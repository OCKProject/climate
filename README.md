Open Climate Knowledge (OCK) is an open research project for data mining Open Access (OA) papers related to Climate Change &mdash; to build stats on OA rates, and for researchers to use in their work. OCK is intended for researchers inside and outside of academe.

>Get involved! Run the software yourself or contribute to the research project. You can see open tasks and areas of expertise that need covering [here](https://github.com/petermr/climate/issues). If you have questions or comments then raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/petermr/climate/issues) or message on Twitter with the hashtag [#OCK](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OCK&src=typed_query&f=live).

The mission of OCK is to make research related to climate change 100% open. Currently research publishing related to climate change appear to be at rates of <30% open access. (Tai and Robinson 2018)

OCK has two goals:

- firstly, to build a knowledge base on rates of open research using Peter Murray-Rust's data mining software OpenNotebook, and
- secondly, to make a plan and recommendations about how to transition to 100% open research.

## Building a knowledgebase using OpenNotebook for Open Climate Knowledge

Much of the code and processes are shared communal resources from different projects using OpenNotebook, see a listing here.

### OpenNotebook workflow

 1. Install setup locally
 2. Create a dictionary, or use or modify an existing dictionary
 3. Select repository(s) to data mine
 4. Carry out search and/or retrieval of papers
 5. View the results in your local browser: SVG diagrams, statistics, papers broken down into sections, and as Scholarly HTML
 6. Modify dictionary and search, and repeat as needed
 7. Publish results
 8. Post-process results as needed

## About us

OCK started as part of the eLife Sprint, September 2019,  in Cambridge, UK.

The project maintainers are [Peter Murray-Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Murray-Rust) chemist and open access advocate and Simon Worthington editor-in-chief [*Generation Research*](https://genr.eu/), with coordination from the [Open Science Lab](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/open-science/): TIB &ndash; German National Library of Science and Technology.
