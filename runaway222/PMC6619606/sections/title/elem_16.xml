 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The proportion of shifting cities varied consistently across the world. Cities in northern latitudes will experience the most dramatic shifts in extreme temperature conditions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217592.g002" href="#pone.0217592.g002">Fig 2C</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217592.g002" href="#pone.0217592.g002">Fig 2D</a>). For example, across Europe, both summers and winters will get warmer, with average increases of 3.5°C and 4.7°C, respectively. These changes would be equivalent to a city shifting ~1,000 km further south towards the subtropics, i.e. a velocity ~20 km.year

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217592.g002" href="#pone.0217592.g002">Fig 2D</a>). Consequently, by 2050, striking changes will be observed across the northern hemisphere: Madrid’s climate in 2050 will be more similar to the current climate in Marrakech than to Madrid’s climate today; London will be more similar to Barcelona, Stockholm to Budapest; Moscow to Sofia; Portland to San Antonio, San Francisco to Lisbon, Tokyo to Changsha, etc(

The yellow bar the difference between the current and future climate of the city of interest (e.g. current London and London 2050 in (a)). The green bar represents the difference between the future climate of the city of interest (London 2050) and the current climate of the most similar counterpart (e.g. Barcelona in (a)).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cities in the tropical regions will experience smaller changes in average temperature, relative to the higher latitudes. However, shifts in rainfall regimes will dominate the tropical cities. This is characterized by both increases in extreme precipitation events (+5% rainfall wettest month) and, the severity and intensity of droughts (-14% rainfall driest month). With more severe droughts, tropical cities will move towards the subtropics, i.e. towards drier climates (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217592.g002" href="#pone.0217592.g002">Fig 2C</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217592.g002" href="#pone.0217592.g002">Fig 2D</a>). However, the fate of major tropical cities remains highly uncertain because many tropical regions will experience unprecedented climate conditions. Specifically, of all 22% of cities that will experience novel climate conditions, most (64%) are located in the tropics. These include Manaus, Libreville, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Rangoon, and Singapore (
