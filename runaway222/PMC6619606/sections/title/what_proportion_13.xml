 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We characterized the climate of the world’s 520 major cities using 19 climatic variables that reflect the variability in temperature and precipitation regimes for current and future conditions. Future conditions are estimated using an optimistic Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP4.5), which considers a stabilization of CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions by mid-century (see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">Material and Methods</a>). This model was chosen to show the extent of the changes we would be facing even considering the implementation of effective mitigation policies. Using a multivariate analysis, we analyzed the climate similarity of all Current and Future cities to one another (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217592.s001" href="#pone.0217592.s001">S1 Table</a>). This simple analysis enables us to estimate which major cities of the world will remain relatively similar, and which will shift to reflect the climate of another city by 2050. Overall, our analysis shows that 77% of the world’s Current Cities will experience a striking change in climate conditions, making them more similar to the conditions of another existing city than they are to their own current climate conditions (
