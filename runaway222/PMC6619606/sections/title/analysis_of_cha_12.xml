 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The future climate of each city was projected within the four principal components (using the PCA eigenvectors derived from the bioclimatic variables of the current climate) to allow for direct comparison between Current and Future Cities (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217592.g001" href="#pone.0217592.g001">Fig 1A</a>), explaining respectively 40.2 and 26.9% of climate variations, we observe changes towards less temperature seasonality, with higher maximal and minimal temperatures during the year, as well as higher precipitation seasonality, with higher precipitation in the wettest month but lower precipitation in the driest one. While no clear trend can be observed along the third axis (10.5% of climate variation), the changes along the fourth axis (7.6% of climate variation) show higher temperature diurnal range (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217592.g001" href="#pone.0217592.g001">Fig 1B</a>), i.e. the daily difference between citiesâ€™ maximum and minimum temperatures will increase. In brief, cities of the world become hotter, in particular during the winter and the summer. Wet seasons become wetter and dry season drier.
