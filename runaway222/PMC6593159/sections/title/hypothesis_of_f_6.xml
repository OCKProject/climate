 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore, we plead to study a dynamical and systemic resilience concept. Altogether, this leads to three closely linked sub-hypotheses:</p>
 <div list-type="order" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Patients with high systemic resilience have low susceptibility for micro-stressors, which predicts lower risk of passing a TP and entering a diseased state.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Indicators of resilience in specific parameters (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, and mood) predict systemic resilience in older adults. This is predicted by dynamic systems theory as it shows that biological parameters become more closely linked as the entire system becomes less stable (

   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Dynamic measures of resilience improve forecasting compared to prognostics that are based on static measures of symptoms and vital signs, measured at a single time point. This is particularly important in elderly people because the predictive value of widely used static physiological measures, based on vital signs such as blood pressure and respiration rate, declines with age (

   </p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In sum, the overarching hypothesis is that compared to currently used static predictors, systemic, time-dependent measures of resilience may improve forecasting of the proximity of TPs and the recovery from passing these TPs in older patients.</p>
