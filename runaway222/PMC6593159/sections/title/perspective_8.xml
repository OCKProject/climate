 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a risk that the hypothesized resilience and TP paradigm ultimately may not be confirmed in the context of geriatric medicine. However, even so the time series that will be studied by testing this hypothesis may provide unique data of important TPs, which can open new research avenues and clinical applications, just as the first real-life videotapes of falls did in falls research and prevention (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In case the proposed hypothesis would be confirmed, this would be a major breakthrough as this would lead to improved individualized forecasting tools, to be used in a wide range of applications. As such, dynamic resilience assessment for specific pathophysiological or treatment stressors could expand the first start of personalized medicine in older adults, which can now only be based on the unified frailty state added to the classical disease, history, and demographic data. Resilience, however, can and should be assessed specifically for different stressors and could lead to different conclusions for psychological, psychiatric, and surgical stressors.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This could be operationalized with different time series such as in hospital early warning scores, body worn accelerometers, cardiovascular and metabolic sensors (temperature, glucose responsiveness, and sodium), and combinations of them. Many of these are already collected, but should be validated still for specific (patho)physiologic recovery processes. Such validation work could ultimately result in a toolbox of (sub-)resilience measures based on time series analyses techniques, of which a range of medical disciplines could profit, as many clinicians encounter TP dynamics.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, improved forecasting techniques could easily become cost-effective for our aging societies. If improved TP navigation in older patients would result in 1–5% reduction of the yearly 10–20% acute hospitalizations of frail older persons – modestly extrapolated – it could reduce Europe’s health (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, rerouting resilience forecasting research from static to dynamic predictors, based on time series of key physiological processes that reflect sub-system equilibrium, is warranted by currently available empirical and mechanistic evidence. Specifically in geriatrics, this would complement advances in frailty research and ultimately the clinical use of resilience measures may improve quality of care and older patients’ wellbeing. To prevent that the “resilience” term, just as “frailty” right now, will soon be used in many undefined different meanings in geriatrics and gerontology, it is best to realize that resilience is already defined in other domains (e.g., pediatrics, public health) in different ways. In this paper, we follow the definition stated by the National Institute of Aging consensus paper (
  <a rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref20">Hadley et al., 2017</a>). As resilience research progresses, it would be best to update this consensus definition from time to time, as, for example, is done in the field of Alzheimer’s disease for the research criteria, in order to prevent misunderstandings, and inadequate research.
