 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The existence of TPs is easily illustrated by the fainting patient in whom blood pressure and cerebral perfusion has declined below the lowest limit of cerebrovascular autoregulation. Fainting occurs after passing a reversible TP. It may seem counter-intuitive that human beings in fainting would show the same resilience properties as simpler organisms such as blue-green algae, in which the first evidence for TPs was reported (
  <a rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref41">Scheffer et al., 2001</a>, 
  <a rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref42">2012</a>). However, it is becoming increasingly evident that many complex systems have critical thresholds, or TPs, during which the system shifts abruptly from one state to another. As they approach the TP, these shifts become more self-propelling. In medicine, examples of such systemic reversible states include delirium episodes, heart failure crises, recurrent falls, migraine attacks, and epileptic seizures. Intriguingly, similar TPs have been demonstrated in global finance by the recent systemic bank and market crashes (
  <a rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref7">Battiston et al., 2016</a>), in historical ice-age climate changes (
  <a rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref42">Scheffer et al., 2012</a>); and in sudden breakdowns in a range of ecological systems, for example, in the alarmingly fast loss of vitality of the Great Barrier Reef (
  <a rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref50">van de Leemput et al., 2015</a>). The common denominator of complex systems in which these TPs of acute and theoretically reversible change are observed is that they all rely on one or more positive feedback mechanisms. These can accelerate change and propel the system over the tipping into another less preferable, but more or less stable, diseased state.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within dynamic systems theory, the mathematical catastrophe model can help to illustrate how changes in an adults’ systemic resilience act as risk markers of increased likelihood of passing TPs. In this model, TPs are known as catastrophic bifurcations (
  <a rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref55">Veraart et al., 2011</a>). Although there are several types of catastrophic bifurcations, the idea is most easily illustrated by looking at the well-known “catastrophe fold” model (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). To understand this model, note that the equilibrium state of an older patient can respond in different ways to stressors such as, for example, pre-surgical anesthesia, surgery or chemotherapy (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Figures 1A</a>–
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">C</a>). Although some older patients with sufficient resilience respond smoothly over time (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Figure 1A</a>), change can also be relatively sharp in patients with low resilience around some threshold condition (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Figure 1B</a>). The situation in which critical transitions occur, for example, toward a syncope state or a stroke, can be modeled by an equilibrium curve which is “folded” (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Figure 1C</a>). In short, there are three models of adaptation in health states over time of a person who is in equilibrium with a stressor. The model of acute change adaptation (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Figure 1C</a>) best illustrates older patients with insufficient resilience having to stand a new disease or an intervention. Their physiological systems are closest to the bifurcation point (i.e., 
  <span class="italic">F2</span>). Consequently, a small change in their condition causes a large shift in their level of health to the lower branch of the model (from 
  <span class="italic">F2</span> downward to the lower line at 
  <span class="italic">F3</span> in the same time point, in 
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Figure 1C</a>).

  <div class="caption">
   <p>Catastrophic bifurcations in human physiology are illustrated by the well-known fold catastrophe (left hand panels). Although some systems respond smoothly 
    <span class="bold">(A)</span> over time, change can also be relatively sharp over time in the equilibrium curve, which reflects the response of the organ or individual around some threshold condition 
    <span class="bold">(B)</span>. The situation in which critical transitions can occur arises if this equilibrium curve is “folded” 
    <span class="bold">(C)</span>. Then three equilibria can exist for a given condition. If the system is very close to a bifurcation point (i.e., 
    <span class="italic">F2</span>) a tiny change in the condition, may cause a large shift in health state to the lower branch [
    <span class="italic">F3</span> in 
    <span class="bold">(C)</span>]. Close to such a bifurcation a perturbation [arrow in right hand graph 
    <span class="bold">(D)</span>] can easily push the system across the boundary between the attraction basins, as illustrated by the stability landscapes in the right hand graph. Subjects may then suddenly shift from one to another health state and energy level. The likelihood of such a sudden change over time differs with the system’s resilience: least resilient close to the tipping point (landscape slide with arrow) more resilience moving away from this point (
    <span class="italic">F2</span>), backward and forward (so non-linear). When the route would be started from the right hand side [at 
    <span class="italic">F3</span> in 
    <span class="bold">(C,D)</span>] backwards, the way up would lead to point 
    <span class="italic">F1</span>, and therefore would be different from the way down (
    <span class="italic">via F2</span>). This shows that bifurcation points are passed differently coming from different directions. In human physiology this is resembled by the fact that the recovery route differs from the route of acutely falling ill.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, when a patient is close to such a TP bifurcation, a minor stressor can easily push the system across the boundary between the basins of attraction, as illustrated by the stability landscapes in 
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Figure 1D</a>. These bifurcation points are the TPs where the self-propelling change can produce a large transition in response to a minor health stressor. In older adults, such a large transition may result in sudden syncope, atrial fibrillation or delirium. Although declining systemic resilience may seemingly have little effect on older patients, it turns out to result in a situation where even small stressors, no matter what sort, may push these patients over a TP, to show the lack of resilience of the older individual.
