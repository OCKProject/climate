 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concept of systemic resilience appears to be straightforward. However, it is in fact not obvious that a single overarching system property exists that determines the risk of passing through and recovering from TPs for the most important disease states in older adults, such as delirium, depression, falls, and acute loss of autonomy in activities of daily life. In principle, these acute severity states are reversible, but ultimately they may also lead to death from a cascade of complications.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historically, resilience in humans was first defined as the systems’ ability to cope with stress and preserve functioning (
  <a rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref33">McEwen, 2004</a>). Since then, systemic resilience has been predominantly studied in the stress recovery system of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Later on, resilience was studied in depth in medicine in the domains of psychology and psychiatry, where it is defined as the capacity to recover following psychosocial stress (
  <a rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref31">Lavretsky, 2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A growing series of recent biological empirical studies returned to the original concept of systemic resilience and showed that this may be quantified by several mathematical measures of slowing recovery of complex systems after perturbation by stressors, which both may be artificial (heat, chemicals) and natural (climate change or disease) (
  <a rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref41">Scheffer et al., 2001</a>, 
  <a rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref40">2009</a>, 
  <a rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref42">2012</a>). The validity of such measures of slowing down of recovery already is confirmed by controlled laboratory experiments, initially with cyanobacteria and algae (
  <a rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref9">Carpenter et al., 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref55">Veraart et al., 2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Added to this, powerful recent evidence for the existence of systemic resilience in living systems comes from work on the nematode worm 
  <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis elegans</span>, which probably is the best studied animal model in aging research. For example, 100,000 of these worms were exposed to stimuli such as heat, chemicals, food, and mutagens to challenge resilience. The study showed that survival curves were of similar shape, regardless of the stressor (
  <a rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref48">Stroustrup et al., 2016</a>). This strongly suggests the existence of a systemic physiological property – systemic resilience – which causes similar defense reactions to different stressors. These preclinical nematode experiments support the hypothesis that various kinds of (micro-)stressors may be used to quantify systemic resilience in more complex biological systems. To gain more understanding of the underlying physiology of systemic resilience in man, it is best to properly define resilience, as the whole persons’ capacity to recover from challenges, and regain the previous levels of physical and mental condition, and of autonomy in activities of daily living, ultimately determining the chances of survival. Complementary, subsystem resilience refers to the recovery potential of physiological subsystems such as postural balance, blood pressure, cerebral perfusion or mood. Resilience as physiological measure related to the dynamical systems theory may be used to generate useful mathematical models that can accurately describe behavior of complex dynamical systems in biology, such as frequently occurring TP transitions in nature (
  <a rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref41">Scheffer et al., 2001</a>). However, so far, this TP-related theory has not yet been used to describe age-related diseases, nor recovery potential in disease trajectories and physiology of aging. By adopting this system dynamics perspective of resilience, it may be more usefully applied in man, probably most valuable in older adults as they frequently pass subsystem TPs related to acute severity changes of chronic diseases (e.g., acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure, or delirium in case of dementia). These TPs seriously threaten the integrity of overall equilibrium state, and thus survival, if not recovered from.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to other complex systems, humans also pass through critical shifts between alternative states (
  <a rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref14">Dakos et al., 2012</a>). In many human diseases, self-propagating positive feedback mechanisms can cause unstoppable TP transitions. For example, a nasty remark to a person in a labile subnormal mood may exacerbate social isolation, resulting in fewer positive interactions and more negative feelings, which finally propagate into a severely depressed state (
  <a rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref51">van de Leemput et al., 2014</a>). From this perspective, a number of striking similarities can be found between different warning signals for impending acute transitions during chronic episodic disorders (
  <a rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref35">Olde Rikkert et al., 2016</a>). For example, elongation of the recovery period of an acute heart failure episode acts as risk marker for quick relapse of heart failure (
  <a rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref35">Olde Rikkert et al., 2016</a>), longer recovery time of repolarization in cardiac muscle cells (longer QTS interval) increases the risk of ventricular fibrillation (
  <a rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref29">Lahti et al., 2014</a>) and longer recovery times in epilepsy (
  <a rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref25">Kramer et al., 2012</a>), and migraine (
  <a rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref43">Scheffer et al., 2013</a>) predict subsequent seizures and headache attacks, respectively (
  <a rid="tab1" ref-type="table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). This evidence base can be used to develop a groundbreaking new hypothesis to quantify systemic resilience in human physiology.
