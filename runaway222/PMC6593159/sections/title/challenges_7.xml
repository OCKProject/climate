 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several reasons why such hypothesis driven TP forecasting in older adults is still a major challenge:</p>

  <div class="list-item">
   <p>It is notoriously hard to predict the timing of TPs, as ongoing health changes may quickly change the resilience of older patients. Even a transient flu or 2 weeks bed rest may lower resilience for elective surgery. So far, we lacked the technology of quickly responsive, sensor techniques, linked to stimulus-response monitoring, specifically in heart rate, balance, attention, and mood. These are needed to reliably track resilience over time in the parameters most important for older adults.</p>

   <p>During intensive medical interventions such as chemotherapy or oncologic surgery, static measures of frailty have shown only limited predictive value for complications, adverse events and mortality, and no predictive value for recovery potential and beneficial outcome in surgical or oncologic trajectories (

    <a rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref23">Hubbard and Jatoi, 2015</a>). Moreover, the seven clinically applicable frailty instruments have a predictive accuracy of only 60% compared to detailed frailty instruments used in research (

   <p>Integrated care is assumed to improve the outcome of complex medical problems for older adults (
    <a rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref5">Bakker and Olde Rikkert, 2015</a>). However, trials on integrated care, targeted by frailty level, did not yet result in an improved outcome of fewer TPs. For example, eight large trials targeting at frailty, from the recent Dutch National Programme on Aging, did not result in improved outcome (
    <a rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref22">Hoogendijk, 2016</a>). To improve outcomes, resilience-directed targeting criteria, and thus dynamic targeting measures, may be indispensable.

   <p>Individual modeling and forecasting is notoriously difficult. Even in intensive care medicine, the massive datasets of routinely collected time series are not yet transformed to validated, individual forecasting models. However, there is some proof-of-concept for this individual modeling by constructing individual time series in Bayesian modeling to understand multimorbidity and disease trajectories in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (

    <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">Bueno et al., 2016</a>). In this approach, graphical and quantified models of time series were combined, which enabled input from mathematical formulae on the one hand, and mechanistic reasoning based on medical expertise on the other hand. This combined approach may make the uncertainty level of population-based forecasting applicable in individualized predictions (
