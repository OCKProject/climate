 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results demonstrate that populations of a native plant with a restricted range are capable of responding to severe drought within a few years. Previous studies have demonstrated rapid evolution in plant populations in response to environmental changes, and many of these studies included weedy or introduced species with broad geographic ranges (e.g., Franks, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0036">2011</a>; Franks et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0040">2007</a>; Kuester et al.,

  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0102">2013</a>; Thomann et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0105">2015</a>), which can benefit from increased genetic variation from population mixing or hybridization during the invasion process (e.g., Gaskin &amp; Schaal, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0043">2002</a>; Lavergne &amp; Molofsky, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0068">2007</a>). In contrast, peripheral populations and species with restricted ranges have been viewed as potentially unable to respond quickly or effectively to a strong selective pressure due to lack of genetic variation (Dawson et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0021">2010</a>; Holt et al.,

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rapid, contemporary evolution</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the resurrection approach, we found compelling evidence that phenological traits shifted in an adaptive manner during the intense drought, and this may partially explain how the species range of this plant has remained stable over recent decades (Sexton &amp; Dickman, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0095">2016</a>), whereas other species are exhibiting range shifts due to severe drought and climate change (Crockett &amp; Westerling, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0020">2017</a>; Serra‐Diaz et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0094">2015</a>). We documented a significant reduction in time to emergence that would be adaptive in hotter and drier climates, accompanied by a reduction in variance in emergence time in the drought generation. Drought generation plants generally emerged earlier, and subsequently achieved greater height, biomass, and fruit mass during the experiment. There was no difference between generations in SLA (discussed below), and in contrast to emergence patterns, drought generation plants generally flowered later than pre‐drought plants and did not show differences in variance between generations in these traits. Nevertheless, flowering time is a strongly differentiated trait among populations (discussed below).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two lines of evidence suggest that the observed differences in the drought generation may have been adaptive. First, the faster seed emergence observed in the drought generation is consistent with field experiments with this species in which earlier emergence in seedlings translated into greater fitness under drought stress (Sexton et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0097">2011</a>). The evolutionary changes in phenology did not vary by elevation (i.e., no significant generation by elevation interaction), although populations varied greatly in their responses across the range (Figure 
   <a rid="eva12803-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12803-fig-0002">2</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, variance in some phenological and morphological traits was reduced in the drought generation, suggesting natural selection or bottleneck events may have occurred. Rapid increases in temperature have been shown to be associated with a reduction in genetic variation for traits affected by climate (Jump &amp; Peñuelas, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0060">2005</a>). With the exception of days to first flower, all traits had reduced variance in the drought generation (Table 
   <a rid="eva12803-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#eva12803-sup-0001">S4</a>); however, only days to emergence exhibited significant variance reduction (Table 
   <a rid="eva12803-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#eva12803-sup-0001">S3</a>). By comparison, SLA, an important trait for drought tolerance but not necessarily drought avoidance (Ackerly et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0002">2002</a>), was not found to vary significantly by population or generation. However, drought generation plants generally flowered later, opposite to emergence responses, suggesting that flowering time may have been under selection, but in a direction consistent with greater drought tolerance rather than avoidance. Early flowering is indicative of drought escape in annual plants because early flowering allows plants to complete their life cycle before the onset of drought. However, late flowering might potentially indicate drought tolerance or at least a strategy of growing more slowly and conserving resources during drought. Franks (
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0036">2011</a>) found that 
   <span class="italic">Brassica rapa</span> plants that flowered early had low water use efficiency, whereas plants that flowered later had greater water use efficiency, indicating greater drought tolerance.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above changes in phenotypic variance might potentially reflect changes in additive genetic variance, since genetic variance and phenotypic variance are often related, but this was not possible to determine from this study. A change in phenotypic variance is still notable, since this is a change in the population and one that could potentially influence the results of future selection. Reductions in trait variance could also be due to bottlenecks (i.e., genetic drift) and due to reduced population sizes under drought conditions. However, if the observed changes were due mainly to genetic drift, we would predict random trait mean shifts in adaptive and nonadaptive directions and reductions in variance across all or most traits. Instead, variance reductions align with trait shifts related to drought avoidance and are generally consistent among populations. Although the resurrection approach alone only provides evidence for evolution, rather than providing the mechanism (Franks et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0038">2018</a>), the idea that this phenotypic shift was caused by selection rather than by drift is probably the most reasonable assumption. Drift would be expected to take much longer to produce a significant phenotypic change (Conner &amp; Hartl, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0016">2004</a>), and drift alone is even less likely if the direction of change is generally consistent among populations and if emergence time is controlled by multiple genes (which would be expected to drift independently and not produce a strong directional change). Thus, although genetic drift may have contributed to evolutionary shifts between generations, we consider selection to have been a more likely agent of change.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whether the observed differences between generations were partially the outcome of adaptive transgenerational plasticity is an open question. Nevertheless, evidence for such “anticipatory” parental effects is weak based on prior studies (Uller, Nakagawa, &amp; English, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0106">2013</a>). Enhanced offspring quality through increased seed mass is one common maternal effect in plants (Roach &amp; Wulff, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0087">1987</a>). However, we controlled for maternal family seed mass effects in our models, and the results of the next‐generation growth chamber experiment confirm that earlier emergence in the drought generation is likely to be a genetic effect. Although we found evidence for reduced variances perhaps due to natural selection, these still may have been influenced by maternally derived epigenetic changes (Germain et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0044">2013</a>). For self‐fertilizing plants such as 
   <span class="italic">M. laciniatus</span>, broad‐sense heritability, which includes maternal effects, is the most relevant agent of adaptive potential (Conner &amp; Hartl, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0016">2004</a>). Thus, although the above effects are conflated in field‐collected seeds, examining first‐generation traits in highly selfing species is potentially as or more important than examining subsequent generation traits for understanding realistic rapid adaptive response. Moreover, our results are consistent with other genetically based adaptive patterns in this species (Sexton et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0097">2011</a>), supporting the hypothesis that the observed trait shifts are genetically based and are adaptive under drought. In the Sexton et al. (
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0097">2011</a>) study, 
   <span class="italic">M. laciniatus</span> seedling emergence was shown to be under strong natural selection in the field in a fast‐drying, range‐edge environment experiment. A future aim is to understand to what extent epigenetic effects on gene expression or changes in allele frequencies caused the adaptive patterns observed.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seed quality and longevity is known to decline with seed age (Harrington, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0051">1972</a>), and we attempted to account for this in our study. Seed quality could also affect results if a nonrandom portion of seeds do not germinate, and thus, their correlated traits are not represented; that is to say, the “invisible fraction” effect (Grafen, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0046">1988</a>; Weis, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0109">2018</a>). The cut tests coupled with results from the postsown GA group, in which nearly all cells that were treated germinated within a few days, rule out seed death as important influences in our study. Storage effects may have influenced germination results since emergence was higher in the refreshed generation in growth chambers, although growth chamber conditions were better for all populations (i.e., day length, temperature). To our knowledge, no published study has applied postsown GA treatment as a test of viability. In light of our findings, this technique could be a useful tool for studies diagnosing the above issues or investigating seed banks.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence for climate adaptation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed elevation‐based trait differences consistent with climate adaptation, but only in phenological traits. Days to first flower lengthened by elevation, which suggests elevation‐based adaptation by means of flowering time variation (Kooyers, Greenlee, Colicchio, Oh, &amp; Blackman, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0064">2015</a>; Méndez‐Vigo, Picó, Ramiro, Martínez‐Zapater, &amp; Alonso‐Blanco, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0075">2011</a>; Sandring &amp; Ågren, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0091">2009</a>; Stinchcombe et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0101">2004</a>). These findings corroborate other studies that have linked phenology to climate adaptation in the yellow monkeyflowers (Friedman &amp; Willis, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0041">2013</a>; Sexton et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0097">2011</a>). Although emergence time was observed to decrease significantly with elevation, high‐elevation populations had greatly reduced sample sizes due to more complex germination cues. Moreover, this elevation effect in emergence was lost in the confirmatory generation. Thus, future research is necessary to confirm and understand the significance of this pattern.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Morphological traits did not vary significantly across elevation in the experiment. Fruit mass, total plant mass, and maximum height tended to increase with elevation, but not significantly so (Figure 
   <a rid="eva12803-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12803-fig-0003">3</a>). Previous common garden studies have found that plants from lower elevations are often larger, grow more quickly, and flower earlier and for a longer time, while plants from high elevations have the opposite characteristics, which are likely adaptations to conditions at different elevations (Clausen et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0014">1941</a>; Conover &amp; Schultz,

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concluding remarks</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the foundational studies of local adaptation demonstrated adaptation to elevation in plant populations in the California Sierra Nevada region (Clausen et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0014">1941</a>). Since Clausen et al.'s landmark study, we have learned that climate adaptation in plants is very common, although not ubiquitous (Blanquart, Kaltz, Nuismer, Gandon, &amp; Ebert, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0009">2013</a>; Hereford et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0054">2009</a>). We have also learned that adaptation can be rapid (e.g., Franks et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0040">2007</a>) and that it can involve Mendelian and non‐Mendelian (i.e., epigenetic) inheritance (Feng, Jacobsen, &amp; Reik, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0030">2010</a>; Lynch &amp; Walsh, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0071">1998</a>) of few or many genes (Anderson, Willis, &amp; Mitchell‐Olds, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0005">2011</a>; Bradshaw &amp; Schemske, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0011">2003</a>; Fournier‐Level et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0033">2011</a>). However, since Clausen et al., human‐caused climates are changing rapidly, and now, there is great concern about potential range shifts and whether plant species can respond through adaptation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The finding that there can be a rapid adaptive response to an extreme climate event across the range of a habitat specialist plant contributes to our understanding of plant species distributions and potential persistence under climate change. Resurrecting older genotypes and comparing them to contemporary populations is gaining fast recognition as an important way to empirically test the effects and ramifications of climate change (Franks et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0037">2008</a>, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0038">2018</a>), but few studies have done so. We encourage participation in efforts such as Project Baseline (Etterson et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0028">2016</a>) and other seed bank programs to facilitate further research.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate models predict an increasingly hot and dry future in California, with temperature increases of 1.5–1.8°C by 2,100 and substantial reductions in precipitation (Ackerly, Cornwell, Weiss, Flint, &amp; Flint, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0001">2015</a>; Cayan, Maurer, Dettinger, Tyree, &amp; Hayhoe, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0013">2008</a>). Forecasts also predict a greater proportion of precipitation falling as rain rather than snow (Cayan et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0013">2008</a>), which will compress timing of water availability. Thus, there will likely continue to be strong directional selection for traits and phenotypes that correspond with drought tolerance or escape (Etterson &amp; Mazer, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0029">2016</a>; Franks et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0040">2007</a>; Jump &amp; Peñuelas, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0060">2005</a>; Schneider &amp; Mazer, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0093">2016</a>). Importantly, although we found evidence for adaptive response, we also found evidence for reduced phenotypic variation. Thus, as climate continues to become hotter and drier, and intense directional selection continues, subsequent reductions in genetic variation (i.e., additive genetic variation) may make adaptation increasingly difficult (Anderson et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0004">2012</a>; Jump &amp; Peñuelas, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0060">2005</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future investigations into selection for adaptive genotypes will be necessary to improve our understanding of climate adaptation in wild systems. Future work could expand to measure performance under various levels of simulated drought and to test for interactive effects of habitat characteristics (i.e., soil type, soil moisture, community composition, etc.). Research is also needed to investigate not only the magnitude of climate stress, but also its duration (i.e., consecutive events) to understand how different populations of a species range can and may respond to stress and selection, including peripheral populations. Finally, research on the specific mechanisms of adaptive response (i.e., gene action, epigenetics, maternal provisioning, etc.) to strong and rapid climate stress in field conditions is greatly needed.</p>
