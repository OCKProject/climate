 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed elevation‐based trait differences consistent with climate adaptation, but only in phenological traits. Days to first flower lengthened by elevation, which suggests elevation‐based adaptation by means of flowering time variation (Kooyers, Greenlee, Colicchio, Oh, &amp; Blackman,

  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0101">2004</a>). These findings corroborate other studies that have linked phenology to climate adaptation in the yellow monkeyflowers (Friedman &amp; Willis, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0041">2013</a>; Sexton et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0097">2011</a>). Although emergence time was observed to decrease significantly with elevation, high‐elevation populations had greatly reduced sample sizes due to more complex germination cues. Moreover, this elevation effect in emergence was lost in the confirmatory generation. Thus, future research is necessary to confirm and understand the significance of this pattern.

  <a rid="eva12803-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12803-fig-0003">3</a>). Previous common garden studies have found that plants from lower elevations are often larger, grow more quickly, and flower earlier and for a longer time, while plants from high elevations have the opposite characteristics, which are likely adaptations to conditions at different elevations (Clausen et al.,
