 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since emergence timing varied in important ways that subsequently affected plant fitness between drought and pre‐drought generations (see Phenotypic evolution in response to drought section in Results), we raised all descendants for an additional generation within growth chambers. (These chambers became available only after the greenhouse experiment was concluded). In this “confirmatory” generation, seeds were sown into a randomized block design and cold stratified in darkness for 2 weeks at 4°C. Trays were then moved to growth chambers and grown with a 16‐hr, 500 μmol light day with a daytime maximum of 25°C ramping down to 10°C at night. Plants were checked daily for emergence for 3 weeks.</p>
