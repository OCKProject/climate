 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global climate change presents a serious and immediate threat to ecosystem structure and function (Loarie et al.,

  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0090" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0090">2000</a>), and the current rates of climate change are unprecedented (Diffenbaugh &amp; Field, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0024">2013</a>). Under changing climates, species will be forced to move or adapt to avoid extinction, with some studies already documenting climate‐driven declines in biodiversity (Harrison, Gornish, &amp; Copeland, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0052">2015</a>; Martay et al.,

  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0102">2013</a>), can be rapid. However, little is known about how climate change affects populations across their range, especially at their range limits. In particular, the extremes of a species range (i.e., elevation, latitude) are important to understand as they are where range expansion or contraction may occur (Hampe &amp; Petit, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0049">2005</a>). The lowest elevation populations, the potential “rear edge or trailing edge,” may face the warmest and driest conditions. These populations may exhibit local extirpation and may be disproportionally affected by climate change, resulting in range contraction (Aitken, Yeaman, Holliday, Wang, &amp; Curtis‐McLane, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0003">2008</a>; Bertrand et al.,

  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0097">2011</a>). Range‐restricted or endemic species may be particularly vulnerable as they are at higher risk of extinction (Dirnböck, Essl, &amp; Rabitsch, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0026">2011</a>; Parmesan,

  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0084">2000</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vulnerability to climate shifts is related to the amount of genetic variation present for natural selection to act upon in a population. Populations at species range limits may be smaller in size and lack sufficient genetic variation to respond to changing climates (Dawson, Grosberg, Stuart, &amp; Sanford, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0021">2010</a>; Holt, Gomulkiewicz, &amp; Barfield, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0057">2003</a>; Kirkpatrick &amp; Barton, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0063">1997</a>). Alternatively, populations at species range limits may have substantial genetic variation (Holt &amp; Gomulkiewicz, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0056">1997</a>; Sexton et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0097">2011</a>) and may already have some degree of local climate adaptation that could provide critical genetic variation to other populations within the species' range (Hampe &amp; Petit, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0049">2005</a>; Holt &amp; Gomulkiewicz, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0056">1997</a>; Macdonald, Llewelyn, Moritz, &amp; Phillips,

  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0097">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A critical factor of species' responses to climate stress is timing their developmental stages to maximize limited resources and increase their chance of survival to reproduce (Cleland, Chuine, Menzel, Mooney, &amp; Schwartz, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0015">2007</a>; Dijk &amp; Hautekèete, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0025">2014</a>; Kimball, Angert, Huxman, &amp; Venable,

  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0105">2015</a>). Selection for faster development and/or earlier flowering due to elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> (Springer &amp; Ward, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0100" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0100">2007</a>), dry soil (Ivey &amp; Carr, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0058">2012</a>), and reduction in precipitation (Franks et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0040">2007</a>) has been documented in some plant species and can facilitate drought escape in shortened growing seasons. Critical photoperiod is the primary control over phenology in temperate climates, with temperature as a secondary moderating effect (Körner &amp; Basler, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0066">2010</a>). Photoperiod is not affected by climate, and as snowpack declines and peak runoff dates shift earlier in the growing season, there could be a mismatch between germination cues and resource availability, leading to reduced fitness (Anderson, Inouye, McKinney, Colautti, &amp; Mitchell‐Olds, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0004">2012</a>). Thus, reduced sensitivity to photoperiod has been shown to be adaptive with changes to climate and can result in faster flowering and shorter seed dormancy (Franks &amp; Hoffmann, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0039">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The “resurrection” approach has recently emerged to document trait shifts (e.g., phenology) due to contemporary evolution (Dijk &amp; Hautekèete, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0025">2014</a>; Franks et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0037">2008</a>, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0040">2007</a>; Franks, Hamann, &amp; Weis, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0038">2018</a>; Hairston et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0048">1999</a>; Kuester, Wilson, Chang, &amp; Baucom, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0067">2016</a>; Sultan et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0102">2013</a>). This approach takes ancestral and descendent seeds collected from a population and raises them in a common environment. Differences in phenotype between ancestors and descendants provide evidence of evolutionary change that has taken place in the interval between the two collections. The resurrection approach is a powerful tool for analyzing contemporary evolutionary responses to changes in climate (Franks et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0038">2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One area that has experienced very substantial changes in climatic conditions, and extremes in climatic fluctuations over the last few decades, is the region of southern and central California. The California Sierra Nevada has a Mediterranean climate characterized by cool, wet winters and warm dry summers. The state's climate, particularly its precipitation, is variable year to year and features wider swings between wet and dry years than in any other state in the United States (Barbour, Keeler‐Wolf, &amp; Schoenherr, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0006">2007</a>; Dettinger et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0022">2011</a>). Exacerbated by the global trend of hotter and drier climates, California recently experienced an exceptional drought beginning in 2011 and containing the driest 12‐month period on record between 2013 and 2014 (Swain et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0103">2014</a>). The effects of the water deficit have been magnified by record high temperatures (Griffin &amp; Anchukaitis, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0047">2014</a>). Moreover, the drought in 2014 has an estimated return interval of 700–900 years, and the cumulative drought of 2012–2014 has an estimated return interval of over 1,200 years (Robeson, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0088">2015</a>). The Sierra Nevada is home to a great diversity of endemic species living along its steep elevational gradients, and climate change is having dramatic effects on these and other regional ecosystems (Harrison et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0052">2015</a>; Kelly &amp; Goulden, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0061">2008</a>; Kimball et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0062">2010</a>; McIntyre et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0074">2015</a>; Moritz et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0077">2008</a>). However, the adaptive capacity of native populations in these systems is virtually unknown.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the effect of the recent, severe drought on the adaptive response of plants across their species range, we conducted a resurrection study of the Sierra endemic, cutleaf monkeyflower, 
  <span class="italic">Mimulus laciniatus</span> A. Gray. We asked the following questions: (a) Have traits shifted in response to the recent, severe drought? and (b) If there are trait shifts, do shifts depend on elevation? Previous studies have found evidence for evolved, earlier development in response to drought that translated into greater fitness under drought conditions (e.g., earlier flowering in 
  <span class="italic">Brassica</span>, Franks et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0040">2007</a>). We compared phenological and morphological trait values of ancestor and descendant seed collections, collected at two separate years at the same populations. We grew seeds in a greenhouse under common conditions from nine populations across the species range, including its elevational extremes representing the potential leading and rear edge. Ancestors (hereafter referred to as “pre‐drought generation”) were collected in years with typical precipitation in 2008 or earlier, and descendants (hereafter referred to as “drought generation”) were collected in an exceptional drought year, 2014. 
  <span class="italic">Mimulus laciniatus</span> is a highly self‐fertilizing annual plant. In this resurrection study, we report first‐generation responses that include broad‐sense heritabilities, which are fundamental to adaptive potential in highly selfing species and which apply to a substantial proportion of flowering plants (Goodwillie, Kalisz, &amp; Eckert, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0045">2005</a>). We confirmed that phenology differences between drought and pre‐drought generations likely had a genetic basis by observing seed emergence in a subsequent generation. We hypothesized that under extreme drought conditions, given sufficient variation, plant populations should shift their phenotypes toward more drought‐adaptive strategies (Franks et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0040">2007</a>).
