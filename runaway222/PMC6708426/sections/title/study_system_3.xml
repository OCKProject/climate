  <span class="italic">Mimulus laciniatus</span> is an annual, herbaceous plant endemic to the western slope of the central Sierra Nevada and limited in its distribution due to its habitat requirements (Sexton &amp; Dickman, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0095">2016</a>). It primarily inhabits snowmelt seeps and moss patches on granite outcrops between ca. 900 and 3,270 m, many of which progressively dry during the growing season. 
  <span class="italic">Mimulus laciniatus</span> spans several biotic zones in the Sierra Nevada, including the foothill woodland, the montane mixed‐conifer, and the subalpine and alpine communities (Sexton et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0096">2016</a>). It is a winter annual that germinates during the late fall and winter rains characteristic of its Mediterranean climate (Cowling, Rundel, Lamont, Kalin Arroyo, &amp; Arianoutsou, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0019">1996</a>). It develops a small basal rosette of leaves through the winter, flowers during the spring or early summer and senesces in the dry late spring or summer depending on elevation. It is primarily self‐pollinating (roughly 95%; Ferris, Sexton, &amp; Willis, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0031">2014</a>), though it can be visited by bees and other insects (Sexton et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0097">2011</a>). Since 
  <span class="italic">M. laciniatus</span> is largely self‐pollinating, maternal and epigenetic effects may be important components of its adaptive response for coping with environmental stress (Germain, Caruso, &amp; Maherali, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0044">2013</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected seeds from nine 
  <span class="italic">M. laciniatus</span> populations at two periods in time (Table 
  <a rid="eva12803-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#eva12803-sup-0001">S1</a>). Seeds were collected randomly within each population to maximize genetic diversity related to habitat heterogeneity (following Sexton et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0096">2016</a>). Pre‐drought generation seeds were collected in 2006 for all populations with the exception of Hwy 168 (HWY) and Hetchy Sign (HS), which were collected in 2005, and Jackass Meadow (JM), which was collected in 2008. The drought generation seeds were collected in 2014 for all populations. The nine localities span a wide set of heterogeneous habitats and elevations, from the lowest at 947 m to the highest at 3,095 m, and represent the entirety of the species elevational range. Of these, three populations were sampled near low‐elevation extremes; three from high‐elevation extremes; and three from more intermediate elevations. These populations are located within Yosemite National Park, Sierra National Forest, and private property (Figure 
  <a rid="eva12803-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12803-fig-0001">1</a>).
