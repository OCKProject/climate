 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maternal effects (also referred to as “transgenerational effects”) on seed quality can affect subsequent phenotypic traits in common gardens (Heger, Jacobs, Latimer, Kollmann, &amp; Rice, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0053">2014</a>; Roach &amp; Wulff, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0087">1987</a>) and can act as important adaptive mechanisms in the wild (Galloway &amp; Etterson, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0042">2007</a>; Germain et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0044">2013</a>). Maternal effects can also be important and inseparable components of phenotypic genetic variance, especially for a highly selfing species such as 
  <span class="italic">M. laciniatus</span>. To account for potential maternal effects driven by seed mass differences, we estimated mean seed mass for a subset of maternal families that had ample seeds (406% or 79.6% of maternal families planted). 
  <span class="italic">Mimulus laciniatus</span> seeds are tiny (generally &lt;1 mm), and so we calculated mean seed mass by weighing 10–30 field‐collected seeds per family. Mean seed mass was included as a covariate in statistical models to account for potential maternal effects (Jonas &amp; Geber,
