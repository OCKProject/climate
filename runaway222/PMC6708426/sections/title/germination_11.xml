 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Germination varied greatly among treatments and populations. Of the untreated group, the three highest elevation populations had lowest germination (17.3%). In contrast, the six lower and intermediate elevation populations had very similar germination (43.3% and 45.0%, respectively; Table 
  <a rid="eva12803-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#eva12803-sup-0001">S2</a>). Despite these elevational differences, almost all untreated plants that germinated flowered (95.0%). The GA group had the highest germination (94.9% of individuals treated) but only a little over half flowered (54.4%). Of those that flowered, 61% were from the pre‚Äêdrought group and 39% were from the drought group. The vernalized group had the lowest germination (26.0% of individuals treated) and the lowest flowering rate (38.6%).
