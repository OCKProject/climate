   <span class="italic">Mimulus laciniatus</span> is an annual, herbaceous plant endemic to the western slope of the central Sierra Nevada and limited in its distribution due to its habitat requirements (Sexton &amp; Dickman, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0095">2016</a>). It primarily inhabits snowmelt seeps and moss patches on granite outcrops between ca. 900 and 3,270 m, many of which progressively dry during the growing season. 
   <span class="italic">Mimulus laciniatus</span> spans several biotic zones in the Sierra Nevada, including the foothill woodland, the montane mixed‐conifer, and the subalpine and alpine communities (Sexton et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0096">2016</a>). It is a winter annual that germinates during the late fall and winter rains characteristic of its Mediterranean climate (Cowling, Rundel, Lamont, Kalin Arroyo, &amp; Arianoutsou, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0019">1996</a>). It develops a small basal rosette of leaves through the winter, flowers during the spring or early summer and senesces in the dry late spring or summer depending on elevation. It is primarily self‐pollinating (roughly 95%; Ferris, Sexton, &amp; Willis, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0031">2014</a>), though it can be visited by bees and other insects (Sexton et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0097">2011</a>). Since 
   <span class="italic">M. laciniatus</span> is largely self‐pollinating, maternal and epigenetic effects may be important components of its adaptive response for coping with environmental stress (Germain, Caruso, &amp; Maherali, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0044">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected seeds from nine 
   <span class="italic">M. laciniatus</span> populations at two periods in time (Table 
   <a rid="eva12803-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#eva12803-sup-0001">S1</a>). Seeds were collected randomly within each population to maximize genetic diversity related to habitat heterogeneity (following Sexton et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0096">2016</a>). Pre‐drought generation seeds were collected in 2006 for all populations with the exception of Hwy 168 (HWY) and Hetchy Sign (HS), which were collected in 2005, and Jackass Meadow (JM), which was collected in 2008. The drought generation seeds were collected in 2014 for all populations. The nine localities span a wide set of heterogeneous habitats and elevations, from the lowest at 947 m to the highest at 3,095 m, and represent the entirety of the species elevational range. Of these, three populations were sampled near low‐elevation extremes; three from high‐elevation extremes; and three from more intermediate elevations. These populations are located within Yosemite National Park, Sierra National Forest, and private property (Figure 
   <a rid="eva12803-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12803-fig-0001">1</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Greenhouse experiment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess seed viability, we conducted cut tests of seeds from 30 randomly drawn maternal families from pre‐drought and drought generations (Ooi, Auld, &amp; Whelan, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0079">2004</a>). All seeds were examined under a dissecting microscope and appeared to have a normal endosperm and a live embryo, which indicates viability (Baskin &amp; Baskin, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0007">2014</a>; Bonner &amp; Russell, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0010">1974</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We planted field‐collected seeds from 30 maternal families per site, for each of the pre‐drought and drought generations. As the drought generation experienced an extreme climate and had low seed yield, there were two populations, May Lake (ML) and Mammoth Edge (ME), from which we could not obtain 30 maternal families. We planted 12 maternal families for ML and 14 maternal families for ME for a total of 510 maternal families for the experiment. For one site, ME, no field‐collected seeds were available in the pre‐drought generation. However, seeds from plants that had been self‐pollinated for one generation in the greenhouse after collection during the pre‐drought period at ME were available, and these were used as pre‐drought seeds for ME in our experiment.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seeds were randomly sown into Sunshine Mix #1 potting soil (Sun Gro Horticulture) in eight trays with 72‐cell, black, plastic planters using a randomized block design. Ten seeds from each maternal family were sown into a cell, except in rare cases where fewer were available. After sowing, we added 1cm of sand mulch to the top of each cell, filled the tray bottom with water, covered the tray with a black plastic lid, and placed trays in a 4°C vernalization cabinet for 11 days (Friedman &amp; Willis, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0041">2013</a>). After vernalization, we moved trays to a greenhouse, where plants received natural light and moderate ambient temperatures between 18.5 and 30.1°C. Trays were filled with reverse osmosis water as needed to maintain saturated soil. Once per week, they received a nutrient mix water that contained a 1.3% concentration of fertilizer (Grow More Inc.), magnesium sulfate, and calcium nitrate.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants were surveyed weekly for phenology and morphology traits. Once a seedling was growing in a cell, the individual closest to the center was selected and the other seedlings were documented and thinned. Phenology was recorded as the most advanced stage on the plant: (a) seedling (emerged from soil, vegetative), (b) budding (flower buds present), (c) flowering (at least one open flower was present), (d) fruiting (at least one fruit was present), or (e) dead (dry, senesced; Franks et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0040">2007</a>; Jonas &amp; Geber, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0059">1999</a>; Schneider &amp; Mazer, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0093">2016</a>). Using these data, we calculated days to emergence, defined as the first day when a plant was observed in a cell; days to flower, defined as the first day a flower is observed on a plant; and days to first flower, defined as the number of days between emergence and flowering (Franks et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0040">2007</a>; Jonas &amp; Geber, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0059">1999</a>; Schneider &amp; Mazer, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0093">2016</a>). There were some instances when a plant recorded as “bud” 1 week had a mixture of fruits and flowers the next. In such instances, the stage was entered as “flower.” We also measured traits related to growth, resource allocation, and drought response, including height and specific leaf area (SLA; Ackerly, Knight, Weiss, Barton, &amp; Starmer, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0002">2002</a>; Dolph &amp; Dilcher,

   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0083">1990</a>). For SLA, one basal leaf was collected from the most basal node when a plant was fruiting and photographed, dried, and weighed.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After 105 days of the experiment, 36.86% of the cells had plants, which were largely senescing. This left 63.14% of maternal families planted that had not germinated. It is possible that photoperiod or temperatures were not ideal in the greenhouse in the early spring to promote germination for all populations or that the 11‐day vernalization period was not sufficient for all populations. To test seed viability and confirm dormancy of those that did not germinate, we exposed these cells to two experimental postsown treatments. We moved all living plants from their cells and transplanted them to new, identical trays. The original, untreated trays then contained only cells that had not germinated. Half of trays (178 cells) received a gibberellic acid solution (5 ml per cell of 200 ppm concentration) applied to the soil surface and 24 hr later were rinsed with running water for 3 min. The other half of trays (172 cells) were returned to the 4°C vernalization chamber for 6 days with darkness, and then seven more days with light, and were subsequently returned to the greenhouse. The plants that grew initially, prior to the gibberellic acid or second vernalization, will hereafter be referred to as “untreated” group; those receiving the gibberellic acid will be referred to as “GA” group; and those receiving the second vernalization will be referred to as “vernalized” group. The GA and vernalized plants were treated and returned to the greenhouse in early June (June 2 and 15, respectively). Plants were allowed to grow for 7 months at which time the majority (81%) had senesced. We ended the experiment on September 25. Plants that had not senesced included individuals that were still vegetative (there may have been an inadequate photoperiod to cue flowering in these individuals by the beginning of fall) or reproductive but not yet senescent. After accounting for mortality, we recorded data for 398 individuals, each representing a unique maternal family.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants were clipped at the soil surface, excluding roots. Total number of fruits were counted, removed, collected, and weighed. Fruit mass was used as a proxy for fitness, as in Sexton et al. (
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0097">2011</a>). Nonreproductive aboveground biomass was placed into a drying oven at 60°C for 48 hr and then weighed. The weight of the single leaf harvested from each plant for the SLA analysis was added to the total. To estimate SLA, leaf photos were processed using Image J software to obtain leaf area (Schneider, Rasband, &amp; Eliceiri, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0092">2012</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since emergence timing varied in important ways that subsequently affected plant fitness between drought and pre‐drought generations (see Phenotypic evolution in response to drought section in Results), we raised all descendants for an additional generation within growth chambers. (These chambers became available only after the greenhouse experiment was concluded). In this “confirmatory” generation, seeds were sown into a randomized block design and cold stratified in darkness for 2 weeks at 4°C. Trays were then moved to growth chambers and grown with a 16‐hr, 500 μmol light day with a daytime maximum of 25°C ramping down to 10°C at night. Plants were checked daily for emergence for 3 weeks.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maternal effects (also referred to as “transgenerational effects”) on seed quality can affect subsequent phenotypic traits in common gardens (Heger, Jacobs, Latimer, Kollmann, &amp; Rice, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0053">2014</a>; Roach &amp; Wulff, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0087">1987</a>) and can act as important adaptive mechanisms in the wild (Galloway &amp; Etterson, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0042">2007</a>; Germain et al., 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0044">2013</a>). Maternal effects can also be important and inseparable components of phenotypic genetic variance, especially for a highly selfing species such as 
   <span class="italic">M. laciniatus</span>. To account for potential maternal effects driven by seed mass differences, we estimated mean seed mass for a subset of maternal families that had ample seeds (406% or 79.6% of maternal families planted). 
   <span class="italic">Mimulus laciniatus</span> seeds are tiny (generally &lt;1 mm), and so we calculated mean seed mass by weighing 10–30 field‐collected seeds per family. Mean seed mass was included as a covariate in statistical models to account for potential maternal effects (Jonas &amp; Geber,

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate and compare climate trends, we obtained data for each population, extrapolated from the United States Geologic Survey Basin Characterization Model (270 m resolution; Flint &amp; Flint, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0032">2014</a>). We obtained water year data for the year of seed collection at each population from the pre‐drought and drought collection years. We used the United States Geologic Survey definition of water year, defined as the period from October 1 of the previous year to September 30 of the current year (United States Geological Survey, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0107" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0107">2016</a>). Using water year data, rather than calendar year, is preferable because it includes the fall through spring, when the Sierra Nevada receives the majority of its precipitation and represents the conditions under which seeds germinate, grow, and reproduce. We obtained climatic water deficit (CWD; mm), total water year precipitation (mm), and mean maximum annual temperature (Tmax, °C). CWD is defined as the evaporative demand exceeding available soil moisture, calculated by subtracting actual evapotranspiration from potential evapotranspiration (Flint &amp; Flint, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0032">2014</a>). We also obtained 30‐year annual averages (1981–2010) for precipitation and the temperature maximum and minimum for each population. We imported these data into R Version 0.99.903 (R Core Team, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0086">2016</a>) and calculated precipitation and temperature anomaly by subtracting the 30‐year annual water year average from values of the water year of seed collection to obtain a departure from climate normals. Since plants tend to be locally adapted, largely driven by climate (Clausen, Keck, &amp; Hiesey,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To detect differences in phenological traits (i.e., days to emergence and first flower), between generations and among populations occupying different elevations, we conducted survival analyses using Cox Proportional Hazards models (Fox, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0034">2001</a>). These analyses can accept censored values, which in this experiment were individuals that never emerged when testing time to emergence and individuals that emerged but never flowered when testing differences in days to first flower. Due to the disruption in timing of the GA and vernalization treatments (e.g., most of the GA‐treated plants emerged simultaneously), only the untreated cohort is included in phenological analyses for the greenhouse experiment (see Germination section in Results). For the second generation in the growth chamber experiment, all seeds were included, and cohort was included in the model to control for cohort effects. We fit models for response variables days to emergence, days to flower, and days to first flower; we included generation (pre‐drought or drought), elevation (covariate), elevation by generation interaction, cohort, and mean seed mass (covariate) as explanatory variables; tray and population were included as random effects. Significance of explanatory variables was tested using likelihood ratio tests. The survival analyses were conducted in R Version 0.99.903 (R Core Team, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0086">2016</a>) using the coxme package (Therneau,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For analyses of morphological traits, all variables were transformed using average ranks (Conover &amp; Iman, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0018">1981</a>) because standard transformations (i.e., log, square root, box cox, etc.) did not sufficiently meet the assumptions of parametric analyses. We created a Pearson correlation matrix in R using the Hmisc package (Harrell &amp; Dupont, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0050">2016</a>) to examine whether any traits are highly correlated. We used a REML model (Shaw, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0098">1987</a>) with total plant mass, fruit mass, vegetative biomass, number of fruits, plant height, and SLA as response variables; generation (pre‐drought or drought), elevation (covariate), elevation by generation interaction, germination cohort (untreated, GA, or vernalized), and mean seed mass (covariate) as explanatory variables; tray and population were included as random variables.

   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0086">2016</a>), using the car package (Fox &amp; Weisberg, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0035">2011</a>), to determine whether trait variance differed by generation or population. For a highly selfing plant like 
   <span class="italic">M. laciniatus</span>, variance among full‐sibling families (i.e., genetic lineages) is the most relevant measure of genetic variance (Conner &amp; Hartl, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0016">2004</a>). Thus, we used population trait variance as a proxy for trait genetic variance. We also calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) for each trait using the raster package (Hijmans &amp; van Etten, 
   <a rid="eva12803-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0055">2012</a>) to estimate trait variance among maternal families. These data were used as a proxy to compare genetic variation among populations and whether variance was reduced during the drought of 2012–2014.
