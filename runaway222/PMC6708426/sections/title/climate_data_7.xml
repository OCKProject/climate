 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate and compare climate trends, we obtained data for each population, extrapolated from the United States Geologic Survey Basin Characterization Model (270 m resolution; Flint &amp; Flint, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0032">2014</a>). We obtained water year data for the year of seed collection at each population from the pre‐drought and drought collection years. We used the United States Geologic Survey definition of water year, defined as the period from October 1 of the previous year to September 30 of the current year (United States Geological Survey, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0107" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0107">2016</a>). Using water year data, rather than calendar year, is preferable because it includes the fall through spring, when the Sierra Nevada receives the majority of its precipitation and represents the conditions under which seeds germinate, grow, and reproduce. We obtained climatic water deficit (CWD; mm), total water year precipitation (mm), and mean maximum annual temperature (Tmax, °C). CWD is defined as the evaporative demand exceeding available soil moisture, calculated by subtracting actual evapotranspiration from potential evapotranspiration (Flint &amp; Flint, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0032">2014</a>). We also obtained 30‐year annual averages (1981–2010) for precipitation and the temperature maximum and minimum for each population. We imported these data into R Version 0.99.903 (R Core Team, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0086">2016</a>) and calculated precipitation and temperature anomaly by subtracting the 30‐year annual water year average from values of the water year of seed collection to obtain a departure from climate normals. Since plants tend to be locally adapted, largely driven by climate (Clausen, Keck, &amp; Hiesey, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0014">1941</a>; Hereford, Elle, &amp; Geber, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0054">2009</a>; Leimu &amp; Fischer, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0069">2008</a>), understanding the magnitude of extreme climate events relative to climate averages can help frame and direct studies of climate change response and adaptation.
