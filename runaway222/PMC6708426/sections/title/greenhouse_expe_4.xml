 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess seed viability, we conducted cut tests of seeds from 30 randomly drawn maternal families from pre‐drought and drought generations (Ooi, Auld, &amp; Whelan, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0079">2004</a>). All seeds were examined under a dissecting microscope and appeared to have a normal endosperm and a live embryo, which indicates viability (Baskin &amp; Baskin,

  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0010">1974</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We planted field‐collected seeds from 30 maternal families per site, for each of the pre‐drought and drought generations. As the drought generation experienced an extreme climate and had low seed yield, there were two populations, May Lake (ML) and Mammoth Edge (ME), from which we could not obtain 30 maternal families. We planted 12 maternal families for ML and 14 maternal families for ME for a total of 510 maternal families for the experiment. For one site, ME, no field‐collected seeds were available in the pre‐drought generation. However, seeds from plants that had been self‐pollinated for one generation in the greenhouse after collection during the pre‐drought period at ME were available, and these were used as pre‐drought seeds for ME in our experiment.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seeds were randomly sown into Sunshine Mix #1 potting soil (Sun Gro Horticulture) in eight trays with 72‐cell, black, plastic planters using a randomized block design. Ten seeds from each maternal family were sown into a cell, except in rare cases where fewer were available. After sowing, we added 1cm of sand mulch to the top of each cell, filled the tray bottom with water, covered the tray with a black plastic lid, and placed trays in a 4°C vernalization cabinet for 11 days (Friedman &amp; Willis, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0041">2013</a>). After vernalization, we moved trays to a greenhouse, where plants received natural light and moderate ambient temperatures between 18.5 and 30.1°C. Trays were filled with reverse osmosis water as needed to maintain saturated soil. Once per week, they received a nutrient mix water that contained a 1.3% concentration of fertilizer (Grow More Inc.), magnesium sulfate, and calcium nitrate.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants were surveyed weekly for phenology and morphology traits. Once a seedling was growing in a cell, the individual closest to the center was selected and the other seedlings were documented and thinned. Phenology was recorded as the most advanced stage on the plant: (a) seedling (emerged from soil, vegetative), (b) budding (flower buds present), (c) flowering (at least one open flower was present), (d) fruiting (at least one fruit was present), or (e) dead (dry, senesced; Franks et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0040">2007</a>; Jonas &amp; Geber, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0059">1999</a>; Schneider &amp; Mazer, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0093">2016</a>). Using these data, we calculated days to emergence, defined as the first day when a plant was observed in a cell; days to flower, defined as the first day a flower is observed on a plant; and days to first flower, defined as the number of days between emergence and flowering (Franks et al., 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0040">2007</a>; Jonas &amp; Geber, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0059">1999</a>; Schneider &amp; Mazer, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0093">2016</a>). There were some instances when a plant recorded as “bud” 1 week had a mixture of fruits and flowers the next. In such instances, the stage was entered as “flower.” We also measured traits related to growth, resource allocation, and drought response, including height and specific leaf area (SLA; Ackerly, Knight, Weiss, Barton, &amp; Starmer, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0002">2002</a>; Dolph &amp; Dilcher, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0027">1980</a>; Mooney &amp; Dunn, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0076">1970</a>; Ostertag, Warman, Cordell, &amp; Vitousek,

  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0083">1990</a>). For SLA, one basal leaf was collected from the most basal node when a plant was fruiting and photographed, dried, and weighed.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After 105 days of the experiment, 36.86% of the cells had plants, which were largely senescing. This left 63.14% of maternal families planted that had not germinated. It is possible that photoperiod or temperatures were not ideal in the greenhouse in the early spring to promote germination for all populations or that the 11‐day vernalization period was not sufficient for all populations. To test seed viability and confirm dormancy of those that did not germinate, we exposed these cells to two experimental postsown treatments. We moved all living plants from their cells and transplanted them to new, identical trays. The original, untreated trays then contained only cells that had not germinated. Half of trays (178 cells) received a gibberellic acid solution (5 ml per cell of 200 ppm concentration) applied to the soil surface and 24 hr later were rinsed with running water for 3 min. The other half of trays (172 cells) were returned to the 4°C vernalization chamber for 6 days with darkness, and then seven more days with light, and were subsequently returned to the greenhouse. The plants that grew initially, prior to the gibberellic acid or second vernalization, will hereafter be referred to as “untreated” group; those receiving the gibberellic acid will be referred to as “GA” group; and those receiving the second vernalization will be referred to as “vernalized” group. The GA and vernalized plants were treated and returned to the greenhouse in early June (June 2 and 15, respectively). Plants were allowed to grow for 7 months at which time the majority (81%) had senesced. We ended the experiment on September 25. Plants that had not senesced included individuals that were still vegetative (there may have been an inadequate photoperiod to cue flowering in these individuals by the beginning of fall) or reproductive but not yet senescent. After accounting for mortality, we recorded data for 398 individuals, each representing a unique maternal family.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants were clipped at the soil surface, excluding roots. Total number of fruits were counted, removed, collected, and weighed. Fruit mass was used as a proxy for fitness, as in Sexton et al. (
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0097">2011</a>). Nonreproductive aboveground biomass was placed into a drying oven at 60°C for 48 hr and then weighed. The weight of the single leaf harvested from each plant for the SLA analysis was added to the total. To estimate SLA, leaf photos were processed using Image J software to obtain leaf area (Schneider, Rasband, &amp; Eliceiri, 
  <a rid="eva12803-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12803-bib-0092">2012</a>).
