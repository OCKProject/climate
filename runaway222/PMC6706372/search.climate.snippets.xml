  <result pre="Ocean freshwater influx. This underlines that the global bathymetry and" exact="climate" post="state may be critical for the response of the"/>
  <result pre="the northern North Atlantic. Previous modelling studies have found that" exact="Arctic" post="closure can trigger an AMOC under early Eocene palaeogeography"/>
