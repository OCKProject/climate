  <p>Depth-integrated salt transport streamfunction. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> The control experiment, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> the Arctic Closed experiment and 
   <span class="bold">c</span> the difference between Arctic Closed—Control. Contour intervals are 0.2 Sv, while transport vectors are drawn above a threshold magnitude of 0.05 Sv in 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> and 0.03 Sv in 
   <span class="bold">c</span>. The presence of overturning in the North Pacific creates greater salt transport into the high latitude sinking regions, along with westward salt transport through the Panama gateway. Once the AMOC is triggered, salt is drawn into the high latitudes of the North Atlantic, causing a near shutdown of salt transport through the Panama gateway
