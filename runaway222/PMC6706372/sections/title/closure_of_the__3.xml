 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Arctic Ocean was very fresh during the Eocene, with an estimated surface salinity of around 20–25 psu in the early and middle Eocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. This background state was punctuated by short-lived episodes of extreme freshening (&lt;5 psu), where the freshwater dwelling 
  <span class="italic">Azolla</span> algae bloomed across the Arctic Ocean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. The middle Eocene 
  <span class="italic">Azolla</span> blooms are contemporaneous with findings of 
  <span class="italic">Azolla</span> in the Nordic seas, implying at least periodic shallow Arctic–Atlantic exchange, with proxy evidence for relatively low salinities (brackish; 22–30 psu) in the North Sea and Greenland Basin Sea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. Assemblages of silicoflagellates and ebridians from the middle Eocene show some similarities between North Atlantic and Arctic species, indicating an Arctic–Atlantic connection during the middle Eocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. Low salinity conditions were driven by an enhanced hydrological cycle in the Eocene climate combined with topographically induced river runoff
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>, and the more enclosed geometry of the Arctic basin with only narrow, shallow and ephemeral seaways in the proto-Fram Strait and Barents Sea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. Geological reconstructions of the Barents Sea indicate that this region was the only viable connection between the Arctic and Atlantic in the late Eocene, and that this connection likely closed around the EOT (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). We therefore investigate the effect of this Arctic isolation on the EOT ocean circulation.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The environmental conditions in the Arctic Ocean from the late Eocene through the Oligocene are poorly known. This time interval coincides with a prolonged hiatus (44–18 Ma) in the only drilled Cenozoic sequence from the central Arctic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. However, seismic stratigraphic interpretations of stacked progradational facies on the Eastern Siberian Sea slope indicate that relative sea level in the Arctic became decoupled from global eustatic variations at the EOT
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. This isolation remained until the opening of the Fram Strait in the early Miocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. The main tectonic driver for progressive isolation in the Paleogene was the northward motion of the Greenland microplate. The associated compressional tectonics, cumulatively referred to as the Eurekan deformation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>, formed a continental land bridge extending from Arctic Canada to Svalbard. By the end of the Paleogene, the Barents Sea was the only viable seaway for exchange between the Arctic and the Norwegian–Greenland Sea.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Today the average depth of the Barents Sea is 230 m, but much of its physiography was inherited from glacial erosion in the Quaternary
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>, which has been overlooked in early Cenozoic reconstructions. The pre-Quaternary Barents shelf has consistently been portrayed as a subaerial platform, uplifted in the Eocene and Neogene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. The most recent global palaeogeographic reconstruction for the late Eocene (38 Ma) has relatively deep (200–500 m) seaways cutting across the Barents shelf providing conduits for water exchange
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. These seaways, however, may have actually formed at a more recent age, since they occur where the largest glacial troughs exist on the shelf today (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Furthermore, the existence of these seaways is at odds with geological reconstructions of the Barents Sea in the late Eocene and Oligocene that portray the shelf as a subaerial denudation surface
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>, from which 1500–2500 m of sediment was eroded in the Paleogene and Neogene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span> (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). We apply a land bridge to the Barents Sea as a simplified representation of the gradual closing of this seaway, in line with evidence of Arctic Ocean isolation at the EOT
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span> (see Methods).
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several recent modelling studies of the late Eocene (38 Ma) show that the combination of a fresh Arctic Ocean and its narrow and shallow connection to the Atlantic ocean circulation prevented North Atlantic sinking
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. In these simulations, sinking is found either in the Southern Ocean or the North Pacific or both, but never in the North Atlantic. Furthermore, a modelling study with neodymium tracers enabled found the best match to Eocene observations with strong sinking in both the North Pacific and South Pacific
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Modelling studies have found that closing the Arctic–Atlantic gateway can trigger North Atlantic sinking under early Eocene boundary conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>, but this mechanism has yet to be tested under EOT palaeogeography. Given the proxy evidence of the AMOC start-up at the EOT, it is important to determine how the Arctic–Atlantic gateway impacts the ocean circulation under late Eocene palaeogeography.
