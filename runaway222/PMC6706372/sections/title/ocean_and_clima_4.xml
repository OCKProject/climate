 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigate the effects of closing the Arctic–Atlantic gateway using a coupled climate model, described in the Methods. Two simulations are performed: a pre-EOT control simulation with an open Arctic–Atlantic gateway (~200 m depth; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>) and a post-EOT simulation where the gateway is closed. In the control simulation, there is sinking in the North Pacific, but not in the North Atlantic. There is a dramatic increase in surface salinity in the North Atlantic in response to the closing of the Arctic gateway, increasing from around 25–30 psu when open to around 34–35 psu when closed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The latter level of salinity is similar to that of the deep ocean and the modern-day North Atlantic. This enables the establishment of an AMOC instead of the Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation found in the open Arctic experiment (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). We note that sinking occurs in both the Nordic Seas and the Labrador Sea, as indicated by deep mixed layers in these areas (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). This is in contrast to a previous early Eocene modelling study which found that Atlantic sinking occurred only in the Nordic Seas
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>. We hypothesise that this difference may be due to the widening of the Atlantic basin from early to late Eocene. A wider Atlantic basin increases the area of wind forcing on the North Atlantic gyres, which may alter the heat and salt transport of the western boundary currents towards the deep water formation regions.

Closure of the Arctic–Atlantic gateway leads to a dramatic increase in North Atlantic salinity. This in turn triggers North Atlantic sinking, and the cessation of North Pacific sinking

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the closed Arctic state, the North Pacific has lower surface salinities than in the control simulation, primarily due to the salt-advection feedback
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. This feedback introduces a competition between the two northern deep water sources, implying that when the sinking and salinity in one basin increase, the sinking and salinity in the other basin decrease
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. In the control simulation, salt is transported from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the Panama Seaway, whereas in the Arctic closed experiment, this gateway transport largely disappears (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The competition between North Atlantic and North Pacific sinking is in line with proxy indications of a link between the onset or strengthening of Atlantic sinking
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span> and the cessation of North Pacific sinking
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>, which likely prevailed during the Eocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Once established, atmospheric feedbacks enhance the salinity asymmetry due to a decrease in precipitation minus evaporation in the North Atlantic, while in the North Pacific the pattern is reversed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). This is due to the strong dependence of evaporation on SST. This transition demonstrates that the outflow of fresh surface water from the Arctic Ocean during the Eocene may have had a limiting effect on the AMOC. Although our experiments represent two distinct open/closed gateway experiments, in reality the closure of the gateway is likely to have been a gradual transition over several million years. Thus, a gradual closure of this gateway can explain proxy evidence that the Labrador Sea bottom salinity increased by around 5 psu over a 3–4 million year interval leading up to the EOT

The presence of overturning in the North Pacific creates greater salt transport into the high latitude sinking regions, along with westward salt transport through the Panama gateway. Once the AMOC is triggered, salt is drawn into the high latitudes of the North Atlantic, causing a near shutdown of salt transport through the Panama gateway
