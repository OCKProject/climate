 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The closed Arctic experiment was spun up for 6500 years from idealised initial conditions using an iterative coupling procedure identical to the control experiment, with the last 3200 years being run in fully coupled mode. Time series of SST and temperatures at 2000 and 4000 m depth are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>, along with MOC indices, and North Atlantic surface temperature and salinity. The deep ocean is still cooling after 6500 years, but the overturning circulation is steady in both hemispheres, and the surface temperature and salinity in the deep water formation regions are stable.

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The wide Southern Ocean gateways and shallow GSR experiments were branched from the control run at year 5500, and run for a further 1000 and 1500 years, respectively. The shallow GSR experiment was extended due to a transient shutdown of global overturning during re-equilibration; thereafter, sinking was re-established in the North Pacific and the Southern Ocean (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The shallow GSR–Arctic closed experiment was branched from year 5500 of the Arctic closed experiment and run for a further 500 years. No substantial changes to the overturning circulation were found. Changes to the bathymetry in the perturbation experiments are shown in Supplementary Fig.
