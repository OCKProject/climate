 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show that the demographic trend for South America falls significantly below expectations for population growth after 8.6 k cal BP. After this point in time, periodic and statistically significant population deflation in the archaeological 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C record is apparent on a continental level, lasting at least until 6 k cal BP (p &lt; 0.001, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, left). This indicates that exceptional deviations from early Holocene demographic regimes occurred. The millennial-scale downturns associated to the initial Middle Holocene can be subdivided into three phases beginning with the initial dip in the demographic proxy at ~8.6 k cal BP, followed by ~7.7 k cal BP and finally ~6.9 k cal BP. These are bracketed by brief periods of recovery lasting two centuries or less. After the initial mid-Holocene, there is a return to model expectations, which are exceeded by ~5.3 k cal BP, likely marking the transition to a new demographic regime after ~6 k cal BP

  </span>. Our index of variability (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, right) is derived from a robust outlier analysis of multiple palaeoclimatic records that together provide spatial coverage of precipitation patterns across South America. Our summary index shows a rapid increase starting at 8.6 k cal BP, concurrent with the first phase of downturn, peaking more than two standard deviations above the dataset mean at ~8.4 and 8.2–8.1 k cal BP. Following a short hiatus coincident with recovery, a second spike prefaces a second bout of demographic reduction after ~7.7 k cal BP. A third (~6.9–6 k cal BP) phase of sustained population decline spans the transition to more arid conditions that are typically recognised in the mid-Holocene of South America
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. This is visible as a trough in our variability index punctuated by less intense yet above-average variability around 7.2 k and 6.5 k cal BP. Placing the frequency of hydroclimatic anomalies before and during the mid-Holocene transition alongside our demographic proxy illustrates the extent to which these patterns are coeval in time.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The next set of analyses aims to identify spatial variability in demographic dynamics associated to the middle Holocene. Disaggregating the archaeological 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C record into three regions formally describes significant variation in the distribution and intensity of demographic downturns, underscoring that the impacts of climatic variability are themselves variable in space (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Negative and positive deviations in the permutation tests reflect periods where subsets of the data significantly exceed the overall continental trend
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>, indirectly confirming the existence of a continent-wide decline starting at ~8.6 k cal BP. It is important to note the reason for conformity between the summed probability distributions around 8.2 k cal BP. We find a lack of significant downturn in relation to the overall trend in the continental dataset consistent with the South America-wide downturn identified separately (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). As indicated by the null model test, the entire modelling domain is experiencing a demographic contraction at this time, which masks the statistical distinctiveness of coeval downturns in subsets of the data. The absence of a significant negative signal at this time in this test is therefore to be expected.

Regional SPDs are compared against a 95% confidence envelope generated by randomly permuting the regional affiliation of each radiometric date (1000 runs).

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Together, the permutation tests reveal a staggered temporal structure in the summed probability distributions over the mid-Holocene chron. The tropical Highlands and Lowlands trends both show significant yet out of phase negative deviations from the continental confidence envelope. The Highlands appear responsive to heightened aridity around ~6 k and ~5 k cal BP, while declines in the Lowlands appear around 7 k cal BP. Inverse demographic trends exist between the Lowlands and Southern Cone at this time and between the Highlands and Southern Cone around 6 k cal BP. We observe that the most sustained local deviations in the Highland and Southern Cone data occur after 6 k cal BP, albeit opposite trends (negative and positive, respectively), while the Lowlands experiences only centennial-scale negative deviations. Pairwise regional comparisons with permutation tests (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>) concordantly show that the tropical Lowland and Highland SPDs return non-significant p-values, indicating statistical similarity, while both are significantly different from the Southern Cone. Together, our results indicate that a common mechanism may have influenced tropical South America, separately from the subtropical and temperate biomes of the Southern Cone. To this effect, we note significantly higher relative population in this region already by 7.5 k cal BP and repeatedly thereafter, with none of the negative phases experienced elsewhere.

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we performed a parameter sweep on a broad range of possible null models for the Early and Middle Holocene. This indicated a critical breakpoint occurred at 8.6 k cal BP. To investigate the degree of departure from this stable (weakly linear) post-colonisation trend, we conditioned our null model on this data. When tested against simulated radiocarbon data generated with Monte Carlo methods, our results show a repeated and statistically significant downturn of varying duration and intensity after 8.6 k cal BP, concurrent with increasing climatic variability from this point in time. These phases last until at least 6 k cal BP, at which point a second regime shift appears likely

  </span>. Further testing reveals centennial-scale depressions in the archaeological 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C record are present across highly diverse environmental and cultural settings, revealing widespread population decline during the mid-Holocene. Regional differences are detected through comparison with the structure of the continent-wide dataset (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), and identifies separate phases of downturn in the tropical Highlands and Lowlands data. In contrast, the Southern Cone remains largely above or within the continental confidence envelope. In statistical terms, the tropical Highlands and Lowlands reveal approximately equivalent demographic trends with some local differences, while the Southern Cone is significantly different from both. Significant positive divergences from the continental trend suggests that this region apparently did not suffer the same degree of downturn during periods of high climatic variability. Accounting for time-dependent site loss and spatial variability in preservation and research intensity (Methods), the weight of the statistical evidence suggests that the depth of the mid-Holocene downturn reflects much more than an oscillation of local population levels around a stable mean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Rather, our results indicate that a phased demographic contraction over a period of several centuries took place across South America. Strong synchrony is evident between all three regions following peak climatic variability (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). After the initial mid-Holocene, however, regional demographic responses diverge. Below we discuss possible impacts and consequences of this pattern in terms of the social and bioclimatic changes experienced by indigenous South Americans during this period of interest.
