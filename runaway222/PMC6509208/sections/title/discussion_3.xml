 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An initial period of high climatic variability spans the transition from the early to the middle Holocene. Three steps (8.4k, 8.2k, and 8.1 k cal BP) have an exceptionally high frequency of anomalies and the ramping up of frequent anomalous events shown in our index (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) correlates with the initial drop in relative population observed across South America at and after 8.6 k cal BP. Archaeologists have repeatedly pointed to mid-Holocene aridity across South America as a mechanism driving occupational hiatuses in multiple localities, indicative of abandonment or logistic range reductions tethered to more predictable resources

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. As illustrated by our archaeological summed probability distributions, significant departures from the quasi-stable Early Holocene regime occurred at least until 6 k cal BP, in the form of several protracted periods of population decline. A second, attenuated phase of anomalous climatic events following the initial extreme phase reveals the continuing impact of climatic variability on human populations. Our results indicate that precipitation variability, as well as absolute reductions in moisture, may have acted as joint drivers of demographic change in leading up to and in the first half of the Middle Holocene

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Importantly, the point identified as a probable demographic regime shift here is independent of the palaeoclimatic records included in our index.

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A key influence on summer monsoon precipitation is the seasonal procession of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and its interaction with the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) over tropical South America. As the magnitude of ITCZ movement southwards is ultimately driven by orbitally-forced changes in North Atlantic surface temperature, negative anomalies result in a northerly (&lt;10 °S) mean latitude of the ITCZ
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. This leads to a reduction in precipitation in eastern Brazil and southern Amazonia, generally in antiphase to wetter conditions in the northern and western portions of the continent during such events, including the tropical Andes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. Our selection of proxies (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>) provides a long-term average of variability in this mechanism in latitudinal cross-section across tropical South America, as well as a separate index of precipitation in the southern mid-latitudes of the continent, which are predominantly influenced by the relative strength of Pacific westerlies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, simulated precipitation grids (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, top) suggest that the highest variance at the start of the mid-Holocene occurred in a broad arc across the tropics, from the north of the continent to eastern Brazil, inflected via western Amazonia. The central Amazon and circumscribed areas of the Pacific coast experienced the least variability in tropical precipitation patterns over this period. The latter agrees with the suppression of the ENSO phenomenon in the Pacific during the mid-Holocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>, although overall the southern latitudes of the continent present the least variable precipitation patterns. Although flora responded to overall more xeric mid-Holocene conditions, biome-scale vegetational transitions appear not to have been severe when averaged over approximately four millennia

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We propose that a combination of factors was responsible for sustained demographic downturn evident in the summed probability distributions. Relatively sudden, high-amplitude variability in precipitation patterns acted as “climatic shocks”
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span> that provoked the downturns observable in our demographic proxy (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>–
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Following initial spikes in climatic variability, depressed tropical moisture availability in the mid-Holocene

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span> may have caused small changes in precipitation to have disproportionate impacts on human-occupied niches. Populations that were adapted to early Holocene conditions may have first suffered negative impacts to their resilience, translating to increased vulnerability to comparatively small-scale climatic events after 8.2 k cal BP. Concordantly, where climatic instability is less pervasive, for example in the Southern Cone as defined here (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, bottom), the negative effects on demography are lessened in comparison to regions where some degree of climatic oscillations endured, as in the tropical Highlands and Lowlands. Nonetheless, after 6 k cal BP, our archaeological 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C proxy in tropical regions is sufficiently recovered to be consistent with, or exceed, model expectations. The continental confidence envelope is surpassed in the Highlands by the onset of the early Holocene at 4.2 k cal BP, while the Lowlands do so well before this point in time (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>).

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Amidst the geographically-variable effects of climate change, South American populations themselves enacted modifications to local ecosystems through the deployment of plant management and cultivation practices

  </span>. The precocious use and dispersal of comestible and useful plants began in the Early Holocene in South America, and the long-distance translocation of crops such as peanut (

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span> highlights the deep antiquity of cultivation practices in the Neotropics. These and other species were integrated into diversified and likely regionally-specific multi-crop procurement systems at various times after 8.2 k cal BP
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. The deliberate and incidental use of fire to modify local ecologies also influenced and shaped the environmental niches of which these crops were a part

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. We suggest that the development of these intertropical systems is a crucial development in the context of significant population reduction relative to earlier periods. Under the stresses induced by both demographic and environmental conditions, anthropic ecologies that already incorporated cultivated or managed resources before the mid-Holocene may have become proportionately more important to subsistence strategies in the face of an unstable climate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. The increasing visibility of cultivated plants in the palaeobotanical record from the mid-Holocene could suggest that climate change may have promoted the incorporation of a greater proportion of managed plants into tropical forager subsistence systems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Population recovery during the second half of the mid-Holocene (after 6 k cal BP) is consistent with a florescence linked to a diversified and more stable resource base following climatic stabilisation to a drier yet steady phase

A possible outcome of these cultural and environmental trajectories was the emergence, in some regions, of population aggregation and social institutions for the coordination and control of previously-unprecedented population densities among South American populations by the Late Holocene

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding mid-Holocene demographic patterns is predicated on our consideration of climatic variability, as well as against the backdrop of developments in cultivation practices. We follow recent research in noting that the scale of anthropic environmental legacies is necessarily linked to relative population over time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. Our examination of the archaeological and climatic record of South America provides a continental-scale framework for understanding the interplay between population dynamics and food procurement diversification over the mid-Holocene, as well as questioning at what point climate change or instability demands alternative pathways be adopted by human populations. In this regard, the broadening of the trophic niche of humans through the adoption of a greater proportion of plant resources may have functioned as a buffer against environmental unpredictability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. We can generalise that human populations in this period experienced significant and sustained periods of demographic downturn on a continental scale. These demographic processes were not uniform in either time or space and likely encompass substantial variation below the spatial scale we have adopted here. In particular, previously-identified local responses to mid-Holocene climate change require further investigation in the context of our findings.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The demographic signals highlighted on a broad scale in this work are composites of local archaeological records. Statistically significant deviations, whether negative or positive, invite further investigation into the trajectories adopted by human populations at a variety of spatial scales and settings. We anticipate that more research, ideally combining computational vegetation reconstructions and landscape modelling, will help to formally characterise how the demography of South America was shaped by, and in turn shaped, environmental conditions in the long term. Systematic assessments of cultural and biotic resilience to hydroclimatic variability are necessary to understand the development of both domains in the millennia following the human colonisation of South America.</p>
