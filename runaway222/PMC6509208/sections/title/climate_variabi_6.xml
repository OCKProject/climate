  </span>. To derive a robust index of climate variability we use the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD), a measure of statistical dispersion, on a set of precipitation records with near-complete latitudinal coverage of South America (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). MAD provides a symmetrical estimate of the central tendencies of a time series, and effectively accounts for the value of any given data point in the context of a rolling window. It is not sensitive to isolated extreme outliers or non-normal distributions, and therefore correctly identifies sudden, large-amplitude changes and oscillations while excluding general trends. Here, we impose ±3 times the rolling MAD as a conservative threshold for identifying an extreme outlier. We scale the window to the resolution of each individual palaeoclimatic record to approximate a 100-year rolling average and have selected records with a resolution sufficient to allow a minimum of three points per interval. Where records have multiple sources of data, for example two speleothems reported from Lapa Grande cave, Brazil, the outlier analysis has been performed separately on these sources and subsequently combined.

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We sum the identified anomalies from each record into 100-year bins to present them on a common time scale of calendar years before present (cal BP) and produce an intuitive summary index of climatic outliers for continental South America. In addition to the high initial MAD threshold for defining an abrupt event in each individual record, we suggest that frequencies of binned anomalies that are two standard deviations over the dataset mean are indicative of significantly above-normal climatic variability. Finally, we underline that the results simply reflect the sum of anomalies in a given time step, not their magnitude, spatial distribution, or whether they are negative or positive deviations from the rolling MAD of a given precipitation record. Deriving a composite measure of climatic variability aims to contextualise our demographic data (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) rather than directly infer the state of the climate or environment itself. We rely on the interpretations palaeoclimatologists and palaeoecologists to understand the conditions and impacts of climate on humans in our modelling domain.
