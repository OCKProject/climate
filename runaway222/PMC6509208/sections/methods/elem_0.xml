  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis employs a database of archaeological radiocarbon determinations compiled from a continuous and ongoing survey of the published academic and grey literature, with an especial focus on Amazonia. Our own collection is cross-referenced to large pre-existing databases
   <span class="sup">

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
   </span> and corrected with reference to the original published sources. Our data collection resulted in a set of 5450 radiocarbon determinations for the interval 12 k – 2 k 
   <span class="sup">14</span>C years before present. In contrast to previous compilations over this period
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
   </span>, we furnish a much larger sample of radiocarbon dates for Amazonia and circum-Amazonia, providing better control over this area.
  </p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We make use of the R package ‘rcarbon 1.2’
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
   </span> to perform statistical analyses on our data. Following established frameworks for the aggregate analysis of archaeological 
   <span class="sup">14</span>C, we examine summed probability distributions (SPDs) of calibrated radiocarbon dates as a proxy for relative change in population over time. This approach to archaeological radiocarbon data rests on the assumption that higher past populations deposit more archaeological material to date, in turn resulting in the production of radiocarbon determinations commensurate with ancient demography

   </span>, i.e. an assumption of monotony between dated archaeological charcoal and past population levels. Sampling bias, time-dependent and spatially variable taphonomic loss, laboratory errors, calibration curve fluctuations, and sample contamination can potentially introduce systematic errors that obscure or exacerbate genuine demographic signals in the 
   <span class="sup">14</span>C record. Our mitigation measures for these issues are described in detail in the Supplementary Information. Deletion and loss of archaeological sites is unlikely to have operated on spatiotemporal scale sufficient to bias the record of an entire continent consistently

   <span class="sup">14</span>C data to be broadly representative despite expectations of some localised site loss.
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We initially perform the analysis on the entire South America dataset. However, the global trend may mask significant regional variation in potential subsets of the data. With reference to spatial structure, sites tend to be highly clustered in, for example, the desert coast of Peru, while being diffuse in the central Amazon basin, rendering a single clustering metric inappropriate for discovering viable subdivisions. Formal methods for grouping spatial point patterns such as k-means or density-based clustering are, respectively, unable to adapt to the arbitrary shape of the point pattern and the high variation in the spatial density of sites. For the purposes of the analysis, we choose to partition the South American radiocarbon data into three to investigate human population patterns and capture variation in the structure of the data within broad biogeographical and climatic realms, rather than any specific archaeological cultures or phenomena. The appearance of consistent patterns in the radiocarbon data should therefore reflect robust and independent cross-regional demographic trends. An objective of our study is to consider coeval shifts in demographic and climatic regimes at and around the transition to the Middle Holocene (8.2 k cal BP).</p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have opted to divide all sites located above the 300 m elevation contour into northern and southern subsets along the Peru-Chile border, to form the core of the Highlands and Southern Cone datasets. Both sets include Pacific coast sites located to the west of the elevation cut-off point. We assigned dates from Bolivia in La Paz, Oruro, and Cochabamba departments to the Highlands, and those located in Chuquisaca, Tarija, and Potosí to the Southern Cone. The remainder of the Southern Cone consists of dates from Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, and the Brazilian states of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina. Sites located below 300 m above sea level and outside of the abovementioned elevation boundaries form the Lowlands dataset. These criteria produce three subsets of the data that group lowland Amazonia with the Guianas, the Orinoco basin, and northeast Brazil (here the Tropical Lowlands), the northern Pacific coast and Andes with the Amazonian foreland basin and foothills (here the Tropical Highlands), and finally the southern Pacific coast and Andes with the Pampas, Patagonia and the southern Brazilian highlands (the Southern Cone). With reference to the climatic systems that drive rainfall variability across South America (Supplementary Information), our subdivisions correspond approximately (in order) to areas principally influenced by moisture transportation from the Atlantic, areas influenced by the Atlantic and potentially Pacific sources, and predominantly South Pacific/Atlantic-influenced zones

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The statistical modelling presented here principally concerns the mid-Holocene, but we carry out our analyses on dates in the interval 12–2 k cal BP. Dates pre-dating 12 k 
   <span class="sup">14</span>C years BP were excluded, as were those with Gaussian errors of &gt;200 years. Although the initial peopling of South America was underway by 14 k cal BP, and possibly earlier
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
   </span>, the sparse evidence available for this period and its distance from the mid-Holocene makes it less germane to this study. Our initial analyses on the 5450 radiocarbon determinations acquired for the entire continent employ the following protocol:

      <span class="italic">Calibration</span>. Radiocarbon dates are calibrated and aggregated by site into non-overlapping phases over the period 12–2 k 
      <span class="sup">14</span>C BP, and we report on the results from a focused time range of 9 k – 3 k cal BP. Aggregation of dates from the same site into bins of 200 years is carried out to account for the overrepresentation of well-dated sites. We principally make use of the SHCal13 curve
      <span class="sup">
       <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
      </span> for calibration (Fig.

      <span class="sup">
       <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
      </span> is used. This calibration curve is offset from the terrestrial curves by several centuries to account for the incorporation of ancient carbon from ocean upwelling into mollusc exoskeletons. In addition, we calibrate marine dates using local averaged ΔR offsets and errors by interpolating to the geographically-closest sampling site, acquired through an online repository

Our choice is guided by an information criterion indicating maximum goodness-of-fit with this model over linear and logistic growth models (Sensitivity Analysis). A sample of calendar dates equal to the number of bins are drawn from the fitted model, converted to 
      <span class="sup">14</span>C dates, re-calibrated, and their probability distributions summed. We opt to draw from the uncalibrated date distribution. Errors for the re-calibration were generated by sampling with replacement from the empirical

  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above procedures controls for the global effects of taphonomy and first-order spatial processes such as sea level rise, as exponential model fitting mimics the effects of time-dependent loss and the permutation tests makes use of the

Nonetheless, the initial formulation of the null hypothesis may be responsible for this finding (a Type I error) and thus we extend our model testing further to resolve this issue.

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
   </span> in specifying a null model based on prevailing patterns 
   <span class="italic">prior</span> to a target period of interest rather than the dataset as a whole. Through inspection of our exponential model (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), we first note that this null hypothesis performs particularly poorly in the Terminal Pleistocene and Early Holocene, and second, the SPD suggests a slow decline in the South American 
   <span class="sup">14</span>C record may begin already around 9 k cal BP. Further testing (Supplementary Information) indicates that the point of divergence from approximately stable, weakly linear Early Holocene demographic regimes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
   </span> is most likely to have occurred at 8.6 k cal BP (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>), providing a point of departure for investigating the degree to which mid-Holocene demographic trends diverge from prior patterns. That is, instead of a single null hypothesis for 12–2 k cal BP, we condition our new null model on the period 12–8.6 k cal BP to satisfactorily identify the degree of deviation after this point in time.
  </p>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our protocols allow us to examine salient features of the South American radiocarbon record, specifically: (a) the degree and significance of deviation in demographic trends from the null hypothesis of steadily increasing population throughout the Early Holocene in our domain, and (b) the similarity of population trajectories in each regional setting. Both sets of tests permit local and global tests of significance to be estimated, and regional population histories to be compared through z-transformation of the empirical and simulated SPDs
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate variability index</div>
  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To our knowledge there is no single prevailing criterion for defining a climatic anomaly, with a variety of thresholds, methods, and selection procedures reported in the literature
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
   </span>. To derive a robust index of climate variability we use the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD), a measure of statistical dispersion, on a set of precipitation records with near-complete latitudinal coverage of South America (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). MAD provides a symmetrical estimate of the central tendencies of a time series, and effectively accounts for the value of any given data point in the context of a rolling window. It is not sensitive to isolated extreme outliers or non-normal distributions, and therefore correctly identifies sudden, large-amplitude changes and oscillations while excluding general trends. Here, we impose ±3 times the rolling MAD as a conservative threshold for identifying an extreme outlier. We scale the window to the resolution of each individual palaeoclimatic record to approximate a 100-year rolling average and have selected records with a resolution sufficient to allow a minimum of three points per interval. Where records have multiple sources of data, for example two speleothems reported from Lapa Grande cave, Brazil, the outlier analysis has been performed separately on these sources and subsequently combined.
  </p>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We sum the identified anomalies from each record into 100-year bins to present them on a common time scale of calendar years before present (cal BP) and produce an intuitive summary index of climatic outliers for continental South America. In addition to the high initial MAD threshold for defining an abrupt event in each individual record, we suggest that frequencies of binned anomalies that are two standard deviations over the dataset mean are indicative of significantly above-normal climatic variability. Finally, we underline that the results simply reflect the sum of anomalies in a given time step, not their magnitude, spatial distribution, or whether they are negative or positive deviations from the rolling MAD of a given precipitation record. Deriving a composite measure of climatic variability aims to contextualise our demographic data (Figs 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) rather than directly infer the state of the climate or environment itself. We rely on the interpretations palaeoclimatologists and palaeoecologists to understand the conditions and impacts of climate on humans in our modelling domain.
