  <p>Test of summed probability distribution of calibrated archaeological 
   <span class="sup">14</span>C dates against a null model (grey shading) and climatic variability index. 
   <span class="italic">Left</span>: Starting at 8.6 k cal BP South America experiences three phases of significant population deflation (blue shading). By the end of the mid-Holocene, the continental summed probability curve exceeds the null model (red shading). 
   <span class="italic">Right</span>: (I) Exceptionally high climatic variability characterises the beginning of the mid-Holocene, with three time steps within 200 years of 8.2 k cal BP having an incidence of anomalies more than two standard deviations (light blue dashed line) above the mean (dark blue dashed line). (II) A second phase of cyclical high variability persists in the early mid-Holocene until 6.5 k cal BP.
