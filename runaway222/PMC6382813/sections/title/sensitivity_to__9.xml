 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the 49 simulations performed in the study, 40 other simulations were performed with a continent comprising 27% of the area of the Earth (comparable to modern values), solar constant of 1142 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> and a carbon dioxide concentration of 2000 ppm. Methane was varied from 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 2400, and 2600 ppm. These simulations show a similar sensitivity to that presented in the present article.
