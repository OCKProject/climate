  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate model Fast Ocean Atmosphere Model (FOAM) comprises an atmosphere and ocean component that are coupled to each other
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span>. Although simplified to run a large number of simulated years per day, it is a complex climate model that solves time-dependent equations describing the fluid and thermodynamics of the system. FOAM is a coupled general circulation model, meaning that it uses different circulation models for various aspects of the simulation. The Community Climate Model CCM3 is used to simulate the atmospheric components of the planet, whereas the Modular Ocean Model OM3 is used to simulate the dynamics of the ocean. The two components are coupled, meaning that the transfer of heat and moisture at the boundary is calculated, as well as the distribution of any sea ice. Although the dynamics of the sea ice is not included in FOAM, other studies have examined how the inclusion of sea-ice dynamics changes the ability of a model to initiate Snowball Earth

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>. In particular, when polar ice caps become large, they flow under the influence of gravity, facilitating the advance of the ice front equatorward. This result means that Snowball-Earth conditions would onset at a lower value of methane concentration for models with sea-ice dynamics than for those without. In our simulations, which are heavily abstracted, this effect does not change the qualitative conclusion that the topography of the Earth (or more specifically, the albedo) affects the onset of Snowball Earth.

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">FOAM splits the atmosphere into 18 vertical levels, each with a depth in units of pressure of 55 hPa. The atmosphere has 40 latitudinal and 48 longitudinal grid points. The ocean model has a higher resolution, with 128 latitudinal and longitudinal grid points with a maximum of 20 vertical levels depending on the chosen ocean depth. These levels are not equally spaced, with the first 14 levels making up the top 1500 m of the ocean. For simplicity, the ocean depth is set to a constant value of 3100 m, one of the fixed depths available in the ocean model. This depth is similar to the average ocean depth on present-day Earth. The flat continent had a constant elevation of 20 m above sea level. The area of the oceans and continents does not change when water from the oceans is removed to form ice sheets on land. The depth of the continental ice sheets does not affect the continental topography.</p>

  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For simplicity, our simulations share the same orbital characteristics (i.e., orbital rotation rate, eccentricity, obliquity, date of perihelion) as the present day, with the exception of a 360-day year. The solar constant is set to the predicted solar luminosity 2.4 billion years ago of 1100 W m

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The size and location of the continents 2.4 billion years ago is uncertain. One plausible reconstruction places a supercontinent close to the equator, with a larger meridional dimension than zonal one

To replicate this, a rectangular continent (on a latitude–longitude map projection) centred on the equator that is 15.6% of the total surface area is used in this experiment. This continent extends from 56°N to 56°S, and has a west–east width of 68° longitude. The continent surface type is set to desert rock, which has an albedo of 24%

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mountain configuration</div>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Little information is available about the topography of this supercontinent, and so we experiment with a number of hypothetical sets of mountain ranges at various latitudes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). They are all placed parallel to latitude lines, and the pairs are placed the same distance from the equator in each hemisphere. The mountains are approximately Gaussian in profile, have a latitudinal width of 10 grid points, which is equivalent to about 1550 m (14° latitude) at the equator, and each mountain spans the entire longitudinal dimension of the continent. The mountain dimensions are restricted by the 128 × 128 grid boxes, which limits how gradual the slope of the mountains can be, but they have a maximum height of 3000 m. A suite of model simulations varying the maximum height of the mountains using the M40 and M50 configurations showed no sensitivity to the onset of the Snowball Earth for mountain heights between 0.5 and 3.0 km. Such results are consistent with those where we vary the albedo of flat terrain at low latitudes and show that the effect of the albedo on climate is greater than the effect of the terrain on climate.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initialisation and simulation</div>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simulations are performed in a time-slice experiment where the model is initialised and then run until it reaches equilibrium. Each simulation is initialised with the conditions of the present climate. The polar surface temperature is set to 10 °C and the equatorial temperature to 28 °C. The conditions being tested cannot maintain such a high surface temperature, and so the system evolves to a new, colder state. The state that the system ends up in primarily depends on the tested value of methane. Simulations are run for a total of 400 years to give the climate enough time to evolve to its new state. But, this time is not sufficient to produce ice sheets of substantial depth to rival the height of the mountain range or reach the stage where the ice would flow a substantial distance due to gravity (which could not be modeled in FOAM anyway). Thirty-day mean values are output from the model 12 times each model year. These data describe the monthly-mean state of the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere (ice and snow) for that year.</p>

  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the 49 simulations performed in the study, 40 other simulations were performed with a continent comprising 27% of the area of the Earth (comparable to modern values), solar constant of 1142 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> and a carbon dioxide concentration of 2000 ppm. Methane was varied from 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 2400, and 2600 ppm. These simulations show a similar sensitivity to that presented in the present article.
