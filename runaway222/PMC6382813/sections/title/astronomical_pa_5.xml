 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For simplicity, our simulations share the same orbital characteristics (i.e., orbital rotation rate, eccentricity, obliquity, date of perihelion) as the present day, with the exception of a 360-day year. The solar constant is set to the predicted solar luminosity 2.4 billion years ago of 1100 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, 19% lower than the present-day value

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To compensate for this lower solar constant, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was higher than the present-day values
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. Greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane have been hypothesised to have created a strong greenhouse effect on early Earth. This experiment assumes that carbon dioxide is the largest contributor to this warming. One possible range of carbon dioxide concentrations during the Proterozoic is 4000 to 80,000 ppmv

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. A value of 10,000 ppmv is chosen, a number within this range and also used in another study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. The range of atmospheric methane concentration to test over was decided based on estimates
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span> and the results of modelling
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. This range is 1–100 ppmv.
