  </span>. Although simplified to run a large number of simulated years per day, it is a complex climate model that solves time-dependent equations describing the fluid and thermodynamics of the system. FOAM is a coupled general circulation model, meaning that it uses different circulation models for various aspects of the simulation. The Community Climate Model CCM3 is used to simulate the atmospheric components of the planet, whereas the Modular Ocean Model OM3 is used to simulate the dynamics of the ocean. The two components are coupled, meaning that the transfer of heat and moisture at the boundary is calculated, as well as the distribution of any sea ice. Although the dynamics of the sea ice is not included in FOAM, other studies have examined how the inclusion of sea-ice dynamics changes the ability of a model to initiate Snowball Earth

  </span>. In particular, when polar ice caps become large, they flow under the influence of gravity, facilitating the advance of the ice front equatorward. This result means that Snowball-Earth conditions would onset at a lower value of methane concentration for models with sea-ice dynamics than for those without. In our simulations, which are heavily abstracted, this effect does not change the qualitative conclusion that the topography of the Earth (or more specifically, the albedo) affects the onset of Snowball Earth.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">FOAM splits the atmosphere into 18 vertical levels, each with a depth in units of pressure of 55 hPa. The atmosphere has 40 latitudinal and 48 longitudinal grid points. The ocean model has a higher resolution, with 128 latitudinal and longitudinal grid points with a maximum of 20 vertical levels depending on the chosen ocean depth. These levels are not equally spaced, with the first 14 levels making up the top 1500 m of the ocean. For simplicity, the ocean depth is set to a constant value of 3100 m, one of the fixed depths available in the ocean model. This depth is similar to the average ocean depth on present-day Earth. The flat continent had a constant elevation of 20 m above sea level. The area of the oceans and continents does not change when water from the oceans is removed to form ice sheets on land. The depth of the continental ice sheets does not affect the continental topography.</p>
