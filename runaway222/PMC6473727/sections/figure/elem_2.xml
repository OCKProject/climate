  <p>Predicted interactive effects of higher temperature, elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub>, and drought stress on plant vascular system. (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) Control (lower temperature, ambient CO
   <sub>2</sub>, no drought), (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) higher temperature with elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub>, (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) higher temperature with drought stress, (
   <span class="bold">D</span>) elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub> with drought stress, and (
   <span class="bold">E</span>) higher temperature with elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub> and drought stress. For higher temperature with elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub>, increased xylem diameter and density, increased cell wall thickness and cambial thickness, and increased stem diameter are expected. For higher temperature with drought stress, decreased xylem diameter and density, maintained cambial thickness, increased cell wall thickness, and decreased stem diameter are anticipated. For elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub> with drought stress, decreased xylem diameter and density, maintained cambial thickness, increased cell wall thickness, and stable stem diameter are expected, unless DS becomes extreme, in which case it may decrease. In the instance of higher temperature with elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub> and drought stress, increased vessel wall thickness, increased cambial thickness, and decreased stem diameter are expected. This illustration is based on data from the literature cited in
