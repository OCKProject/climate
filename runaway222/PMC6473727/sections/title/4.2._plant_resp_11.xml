 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In combination, higher temperature and increased drought stress lead to reduced crop yield [
  <a rid="B77-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-plants-08-00065">77</a>,
  <a rid="B79-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79-plants-08-00065">79</a>]. It is projected that negative climate trends, including higher temperature and drought, which associated with rising atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub>, may eventually outweigh the benefits of CO
  <sub>2</sub> to plant yield [
  <a rid="B77-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-plants-08-00065">77</a>] (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00065-f001" href="#plants-08-00065-f001">Figure 1</a>). When higher temperature is combined with drought stress, the carbon balance of leaves may be offset, leading to an imbalance of photosynthesis and respiration. Fixed carbon is lost in respiration, and overall net photosynthesis and respiration may decline. Full photosynthetic capacity can potentially be restored following restoration of water supply in the absence of irreversible damage [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Higher temperature and precipitation may act synergistically on the reactivation of cambial cells and the subsequent formation and differentiation of xylem and phloem cells [
  <a rid="B16-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-plants-08-00065">16</a>,
  <a rid="B29-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-plants-08-00065">29</a>]. This would indicate that development of vascular cambium cannot occur without both of the required stimuli—water availability and higher temperature. In combination with increased temperature, reduced water availability may change the timing of cambial cell initiation. Since temperature has the potential to exacerbate the effects of water deficit, earlier suberization may result [
  <a rid="B97-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97-plants-08-00065">97</a>], and vascular tissue may become narrower, resulting in a reduced capacity for xylem-driven water transport [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In woody plants (e.g., black poplar), extreme drought stress led to metabolic impairment of photosynthesis. A combination of higher temperature and drought stress decreased net CO
  <sub>2</sub> assimilation and stomatal conductance. Drought stress had a greater effect on plant metabolic activities at lower temperature (25 °C) than at higher temperature (35 °C), because maximum photosynthesis was about four fold lower and the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation and the apparent maximum rate of electron transport at saturating irradiance were two fold lower at lower temperature than at higher temperature. In addition, plants under lower temperature recovered more slowly than those under higher temperature [
  <a rid="B7-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-plants-08-00065">7</a>]. In herbaceous plants (e.g., spring wheat), higher temperature with drought stress decreased net CO
  <sub>2</sub> assimilation, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and growth, but increased WUE [
  <a rid="B111-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B111-plants-08-00065">111</a>] (see 
  <a rid="plants-08-00065-t002" ref-type="table" href="#plants-08-00065-t002">Table 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00065-f001" href="#plants-08-00065-f001">Figure 1</a>). In canola (
  <span class="italic">Brassica napus</span> L.), plants grown under higher temperatures and drought stress had a lower biomass than plants grown under control conditions—lower temperatures and watering to field capacity. The canola seedlings also had a reduced stem mass [
  <a rid="B30-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-plants-08-00065">30</a>], which could indicate a reduction of vascular tissues, as they are responsible for the majority of stem girth [
  <a rid="B11-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-plants-08-00065">11</a>]. Increases in temperature may exacerbate the magnitude of water-stress effect, but this depends, in part, on species and geographical location [
