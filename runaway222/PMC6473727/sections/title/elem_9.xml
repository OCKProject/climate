  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent mathematical model depicts that increased temperature alone is expected to only marginally increase photosynthesis; however, when higher temperature is combined with elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub>, larger net photosynthesis is expected by up to 50%. On the basis of this model, species that do not acclimate to elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub> will experience a greater enhancement of photosynthesis [
   <a rid="B4-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-plants-08-00065">4</a>], and a greater volume of water will be both lost to the atmosphere and required for root uptake, which may be problematic in water-limited environments.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants have been shown to exhibit plastic responses to a number of environmental factors, but many mathematical models fail to take these into account, likely because they remain poorly understood.

When higher temperature is combined with drought stress, the carbon balance of leaves may be offset, leading to an imbalance of photosynthesis and respiration.
