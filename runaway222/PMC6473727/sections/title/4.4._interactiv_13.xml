 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4.4. Interactive Effects of Temperature, Carbon Dioxide, and Drought on the Form and Function of Plant Vascular System</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interaction among the three main components of climate change—increased temperature, elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> and drought—can affect plant growth by affecting photosynthesis and dry mass partitioning [
  <a rid="B120-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B120-plants-08-00065">120</a>]. Temperature, in combination with elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub>, has been shown to increase plant growth both under irrigation and drought conditions. In contrast, elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> under ambient temperatures, had no effect on plants in any of the watering regimes, suggesting the importance of interaction among these three factors [
  <a rid="B5-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-plants-08-00065">5</a>]. Temperature and drought stress cause stomatal closure, and since this reduces carbon fixation, carbohydrate stores could become depleted, leading to tissue starvation. Temperature and CO
  <sub>2</sub> both affect tree anatomy and hydraulic conductance, and these changes may result in lower drought tolerance. Beneficial effects of CO
  <sub>2</sub> have been shown to vanish under severe drought stress, but these interactions require further study [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In woody plants, the interactive effects of these three environmental factors on plant growth and physiology vary with species. For example, interaction among higher temperature, elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub>, and drought stress increased growth of loblolly pine [
  <a rid="B108-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B108-plants-08-00065">108</a>], red ironbark, and Sydney blue gum [
  <a rid="B110-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110-plants-08-00065">110</a>], but decreased that of Monterey pine and Oyster Bay pine [
  <a rid="B109-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109-plants-08-00065">109</a>]. Incidence of embolism might also increase in response to climate change components. Since recovery might depend on the overall plant health, runaway embolism may become more frequent, leading to a higher rate of plant mortality [
  <a rid="B18-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-plants-08-00065">18</a>]. In herbaceous plants, in general, these three factors decreased net CO
  <sub>2</sub> assimilation, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and biomass, but increased WUE, as shown in alfalfa [
  <a rid="B26-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-plants-08-00065">26</a>,
  <a rid="B27-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-plants-08-00065">27</a>,
  <a rid="B113-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B113-plants-08-00065">113</a>], bird’s-foot trefoil, black medick [
  <a rid="B114-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B114-plants-08-00065">114</a>], and canola [
  <a rid="B1-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-plants-08-00065">1</a>] (see 
  <a rid="plants-08-00065-t002" ref-type="table" href="#plants-08-00065-t002">Table 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00065-f001" href="#plants-08-00065-f001">Figure 1</a>). In alfalfa, a decrease in stomatal conductance would indicate a decrease in transpiration. Increased temperature and CO
  <sub>2</sub> were shown to decrease Rubisco activity; higher temperature, elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub>, and drought stress caused Rubisco inhibition [
  <a rid="B26-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-plants-08-00065">26</a>]. In a study with black knapweed (
  <span class="italic">Centaurea nigra</span> L.), plants were grown under varying temperatures, CO
  <sub>2</sub>, and water regimes. Interaction among these factors significantly affected shoot biomass; plants that were grown under higher temperatures at ambient CO
  <sub>2</sub> with drought stress had the lowest shoot mass, whereas plants that were grown under lower temperatures at elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> and watering at field capacity had the highest shoot mass. This indicates that shoot biomass was smaller under a combination of these factors than under the control conditions [
  <a rid="B31-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-plants-08-00065">31</a>]. A decrease in shoot mass could be indicative of decreased vascular tissue, or larger, less frequent xylem conduits.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate models have predicted how plants will perform under increased temperature and CO
  <sub>2</sub> [
  <a rid="B5-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-plants-08-00065">5</a>], but not how these factors interact with drought. Acclimation models should examine the potential of leaves that develop under these stress conditions, as they may have a higher acclimation potential than pre-developed leaves that are forced to acclimate under sudden stress induction [
  <a rid="B116-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116-plants-08-00065">116</a>]. On the basis of earlier findings, we predict that the components of global climate change may affect plant vascular system in the future (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00065-f002" href="#plants-08-00065-f002">Figure 2</a> and
