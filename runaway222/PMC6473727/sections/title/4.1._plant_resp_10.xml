 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent mathematical model depicts that increased temperature alone is expected to only marginally increase photosynthesis; however, when higher temperature is combined with elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub>, larger net photosynthesis is expected by up to 50%. On the basis of this model, species that do not acclimate to elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> will experience a greater enhancement of photosynthesis [
  <a rid="B4-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-plants-08-00065">4</a>], and a greater volume of water will be both lost to the atmosphere and required for root uptake, which may be problematic in water-limited environments.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants have been shown to exhibit plastic responses to a number of environmental factors, but many mathematical models fail to take these into account, likely because they remain poorly understood. Photosynthesis and respiration can acclimate in response to temperature and CO
  <sub>2</sub>, depending on the length and intensity of the stimuli [
  <a rid="B116-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116-plants-08-00065">116</a>]. Reduced transpiration can occur at very high temperatures because Rubisco is temperature-sensitive, slowing down carbon fixation and reducing need for water transport [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In woody plants, higher temperature at elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> either increased or decreased net CO
  <sub>2</sub> assimilation, stomatal conductance, and growth, as shown in Norway spruce, Scots pine [
  <a rid="B105-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B105-plants-08-00065">105</a>], and Tamanqueiro [
  <a rid="B106-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B106-plants-08-00065">106</a>]. In herbaceous plants, these two factors together decreased net CO
  <sub>2</sub> assimilation and stomatal conductance, increased or decreased transpiration, but increased WUE; the effects varied with species [
  <a rid="B17-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-plants-08-00065">17</a>,
  <a rid="B28-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-plants-08-00065">28</a>] (see 
  <a rid="plants-08-00065-t002" ref-type="table" href="#plants-08-00065-t002">Table 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00065-f001" href="#plants-08-00065-f001">Figure 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Independently, temperature and CO
  <sub>2</sub> greatly affected photosynthesis in night-flowering catchfly (
  <span class="italic">Silene noctiflora</span> L.). Higher temperature increased transpiration, but did not increase net CO
  <sub>2</sub> assimilation or WUE, whereas elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> increased net CO
  <sub>2</sub> assimilation and WUE, but decreased transpiration. When these factors were combined, the highest transpiration rate occurred in plants grown under higher temperatures at elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub>, and these plants were of comparable size to those of control [
  <a rid="B28-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-plants-08-00065">28</a>]. A study on alfalfa (
  <span class="italic">Medicago sativa</span> L.) showed that elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> in combination with increased temperature decreases crude protein but increases plant growth; however, elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> under ambient temperature or under partial irrigation has no effect on plant growth [
  <a rid="B5-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-plants-08-00065">5</a>]. Studies have yet to examine the effects of these two factors on vascular cambium; however, since plants were of similar size when under higher temperature and elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub>, this may indicate that vascular cambium may be unaffected, but more in-depth morphological studies are required.
