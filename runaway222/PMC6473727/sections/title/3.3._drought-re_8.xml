 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drought stress can lead to photosynthetic inhibition through leaf senescence, reduced growth, and feedback inhibition of photosynthetic enzymes [
  <a rid="B89-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89-plants-08-00065">89</a>] along with initial processes, such as stomatal closure, which occurs as one the earliest responses to drought [
  <a rid="B94-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94-plants-08-00065">94</a>]. Under drought stress, the water cost associated with carbon fixation causes a negative tradeoff as plants may either dehydrate or have a reduced rate of carbon fixation, leading to carbon starvation [
  <a rid="B18-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-plants-08-00065">18</a>]. A plant is considered to be under drought stress when the soil water content is not replenished by rainfall or irrigation [
  <a rid="B68-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-plants-08-00065">68</a>]. At the onset of drought stress, stem hydraulic capacitance, transpiration and root water uptake begin to decline [
  <a rid="B68-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-plants-08-00065">68</a>,
  <a rid="B95-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95-plants-08-00065">95</a>]. Root hydraulic conductance declines, and as soil water content diminishes, roots lack sufficient water supply. Initially, root hydraulic conductance decreases, as the Casparian band potentially reduce the backflow of water from root to soil [
  <a rid="B68-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-plants-08-00065">68</a>]. Stomatal closure and subsequent reduction in photosynthesis occur rapidly due to reduced carbon fixation and supply of carbon to chloroplasts and Rubisco active sites [
  <a rid="B1-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-plants-08-00065">1</a>,

  <a rid="B89-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89-plants-08-00065">89</a>]. Understanding how plant species respond to drought stress will allow us to better predict the effects of future climate. In North America, warmer temperatures reduce snowpack and subsequently decrease the stream flows of spring and summer, which will increase the length of growing season with incidence of drought stress [
  <a rid="B85-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-plants-08-00065">85</a>]. A recent climate model has predicted drought-induced reductions in plant hydraulic conductance, canopy transpiration, carbon assimilation, and productivity [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prolonged drought results in decreased photosynthesis, which will result in decreased structural carbohydrates and may promote runaway cavitation [
  <a rid="B18-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-plants-08-00065">18</a>]. In woody plants, in general, drought stress decreases diameter of vessel and tracheid, thickness of vascular cambium, and delays formation of xylem and phloem, or division of cambium cell [
  <a rid="B22-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-plants-08-00065">22</a>,

  <a rid="plants-08-00065-t001" ref-type="table" href="#plants-08-00065-t001">Table 1</a>). Under drought stress, xylem cavitation is induced, resulting in the formation of embolism and disruption of the transpiration streamâ€”one of the key features affecting plant survival and productivity under drought stress [
  <a rid="B22-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-plants-08-00065">22</a>]. A comparison between temperate deciduous oaks and Mediterranean evergreen oaks revealed that the latter are less vulnerable to embolism; however, Mediterranean trees that exhibited the most drought stress, had morphological changes, such as narrower vessels, greater pit area, and numerous leaky pits in the inter-vessel [
  <a rid="B22-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-plants-08-00065">22</a>]. Under prolonged drought, there is an increase in osmotic potential (change in chemical potential of water by solutes) of xylem sap. Similar changes in both leaf and root extracts have been observed in some species, such as grapevine (
  <span class="italic">Vitis vinifera</span> L.). This could help contribute to the maintenance of proper water flow, which can be calculated based on the volume flow rate and the force of water flow, including water movement from soil into the roots, under water deficit [
  <a rid="B97-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97-plants-08-00065">97</a>]. When a plant is under drought stress, xylem pressure may change, resulting in stomatal closure through root-to-shoot signaling [
  <a rid="B37-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-plants-08-00065">37</a>]. Severe drought can lead to complete loss of hydraulic conductance and, in turn, to the desiccation of aboveground tissues and plant mortality [
  <a rid="B98-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B98-plants-08-00065">98</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drought stress may reduce vessel diameter while maintaining vessel density, hydraulic conductance, and conductive area [
  <a rid="B22-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-plants-08-00065">22</a>]. Precipitation is essential for the formation of latewood in many ring-porous trees [
  <a rid="B29-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-plants-08-00065">29</a>]. A study showed that during dry periods of the year in Ivory Coast there were no developing cambium cells in teak tree (
  <span class="italic">Tectona grandis</span> (L.f.) Kuntze), and at the onset of the rainy season, cambial cells began to swell. Division of phloem cells was observed before division of xylem cells, but xylem cells expanded and differentiated first [
  <a rid="B43-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-plants-08-00065">43</a>]. In contrast, a study on chestnut (
  <span class="italic">Castanea</span> sp.) indicated that production of new xylem and phloem still happened, regardless of an extremely hot and dry month [
  <a rid="B29-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-plants-08-00065">29</a>], suggesting that there may be differences among species.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in climatic responses could result in a shift in cambial activity. Drought can suppress cambial cell division and inhibits turgor-driven cell enlargement [
  <a rid="B24-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-plants-08-00065">24</a>]. In dry conditions, plants increase suberization of root apoplastic barriers; for example, root suberization, which is important for water retention, increased in the endodermis but decreased in the sclerenchyma cells of rice [
  <a rid="B21-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-plants-08-00065">21</a>]. Increased suberization is observed under a number of stress conditions [
  <a rid="B23-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-plants-08-00065">23</a>]. In the drought-sensitive cultivars of grapevine, more rapid root suberization occurs even under control conditions, as opposed to root suberization in drought-insensitive cultivars of grapevine. Also, under drought stress, suberization occurs closer to the root tip in both cultivars, indicating a faster maturation of root tissue [
  <a rid="B97-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97-plants-08-00065">97</a>]. Hydrotropism can result in deeper roots, with access to deep-water [
  <a rid="B99-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B99-plants-08-00065">99</a>]. When deep-water is available, plants have longer root systems with increased root density at such depths, increasing capacity for water transport from soil to shoot as a result of higher frequency of root hairs and increased vessel diameter [

  <a rid="B18-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-plants-08-00065">18</a>]. Drier climates result in smaller pits with thicker and less porous pit membranes, which could be an adaptive response [
  <a rid="B18-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-plants-08-00065">18</a>]. Xylem anatomical traits have been shown to adjust to drought conditions in trees, as drier conditions result in larger tracheid lumens, thicker cell walls, and a greater number of ray tracheids, increasing efficiency of water transport [
  <a rid="B18-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-plants-08-00065">18</a>,
  <a rid="B101-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B101-plants-08-00065">101</a>]. In angiosperms, dry weather promotes narrow vessel elements, which may reduce the occurrence of embolism; however, this could be a trade-off through decreased xylem transport capacity [
  <a rid="B18-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-plants-08-00065">18</a>]. While drought stress has been observed to decrease xylem vessel diameter, this may prove adaptive as water transport increases with xylem radius; early-season growth would use less water, conserving it for processes, such as grain filling [
  <a rid="B23-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-plants-08-00065">23</a>]. In other areas, where conservation is not an issue, increased xylem diameter is considered a desirable characteristic, and is targeted in selective breeding processes [
