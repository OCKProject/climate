  <a rid="B35-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-plants-08-00065">35</a>]. Xylogenesis, the process by which conduits are formed through programmed cell death, results in a long-distance, low-resistance pathway composed of non-living cells [
  <a rid="B39-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-plants-08-00065">39</a>] that act as a water pipeline [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Earlier studies have suggested that vascular anatomy is important in plant acclimation potential. For example, common oak (
  <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span> L.) trees that died in response to a widespread drought had a greater xylem vessel diameter than trees that survived, so these anatomical traits may increase drought susceptibility [
  <a rid="B41-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-plants-08-00065">41</a>]. Also, vegetation shifts due to climate change lead to more ecological drought [
