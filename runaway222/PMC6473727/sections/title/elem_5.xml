 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most environmental stress factors have common effects on plants, including inhibition of growth, reduced photosynthesis, hormone fluctuations, and accumulation of stress-related compounds. Often, these changes occur as a result of dehydration caused by an imbalance between water uptake in the roots and water loss through leaf transpiration [
  <a rid="B68-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-plants-08-00065">68</a>], with local weather extremes holding the highest impact on plant survival and productivity. In particular, xylem physiological function is highly vulnerable as tree survival depends on its ability to sustain water supply to the tree crown under variable environmental conditions [
  <a rid="B18-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-plants-08-00065">18</a>]. The first line of defense against plant dehydration is often stomatal closure, and since stomatal conductance and water transport are coupled, changes in one will affect the other, resulting in changes in overall photosynthetic processes [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental factors have an important effect on the initiation and differentiation of vascular cambium. The rate of cambial cell division and, in turn, xylem development, is correlated with temperature, rainfall, and humidity [

  <a rid="B69-plants-08-00065" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69-plants-08-00065">69</a>]. Higher rainfall leads to cambial reactivation, and subsequent differentiation of xylem vessel elements, whereas these processes are negatively correlated with temperature. Cambial activity of woody plants is very sensitive to water deficits and drought decreases or delays cell division of vascular cambium by reducing turgor pressure of cambial cells, leading to reduced plant growth [

A comparison between temperate deciduous oaks and Mediterranean evergreen oaks revealed that the latter are less vulnerable to embolism; however, Mediterranean trees that exhibited the most drought stress, had morphological changes, such as narrower vessels, greater pit area, and numerous leaky pits in the inter-vessel [

Under prolonged drought, there is an increase in osmotic potential (change in chemical potential of water by solutes) of xylem sap. Similar changes in both leaf and root extracts have been observed in some species, such as grapevine (
   <span class="italic">Vitis vinifera</span> L.). This could help contribute to the maintenance of proper water flow, which can be calculated based on the volume flow rate and the force of water flow, including water movement from soil into the roots, under water deficit [

In dry conditions, plants increase suberization of root apoplastic barriers; for example, root suberization, which is important for water retention, increased in the endodermis but decreased in the sclerenchyma cells of rice [
