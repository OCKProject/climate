  <div class="title">Cumulative C budget (Tg C year

  </div>
  <p>The numbers in brackets [e; r] are the outcomes of the two model configurations: enhanced erosion-induced C sink (e), with the mineralization during transport set to 2%, the burial efficiency to 95%, and the enrichment factor to 2, and reduced erosion-induced C sink (r), where the same parameters were set to 10%, 20%, and 1, respectively. Dark arrows represent C displacements, while blue arrows represent C fluxes as C exchanges with the atmosphere (CO
   <sub>2</sub>-C). For the net soil flux, negative values represent a C source to the atmosphere, while positive values represent a C sink (see Materials and Methods for the full C balance component details). The agricultural area simulated (arable crops, grassland, and permanent crops) covers 1.88 Mkm
