 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CENTURY model was parameterized to simulate the soil C and N turnover in a fixed profile of 0 to 30 cm. When the model incorporates soil erosion (
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>), an upward C flux from a subsoil pool follows the erosion event (as described in point 3 of the “Model framework and configuration” section). Moreover, the C balance accounts for C displacement components, some of them representing C moving outside the land domain (such as C to rivers, lakes, and ocean). For the purpose of the study, we set our boundary conditions to the land and, despite estimating a lump term accounting for C delivered to the riverine system, we did not calculate its decomposition (to CO
  <sub>2</sub>) related to the turnover outside the land.

  <sub>B</sub> fluxes, over the period 2016–2100, were assumed to be preserved from decomposition with two contrasting burial efficiency rates over a 100-year horizon (0.95 and 0.2). The corresponding CO
