 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we use a consistent biogeochemistry-erosion model framework to quantify the impact of future climate on the C cycle, taking into account accelerated water erosion through variation in rainfall erosivity (

   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>). The model couples the process-based biogeochemistry model CENTURY (

  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">

  </a>) and the RUSLE2015 erosion model (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>), the latter based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The strength of this approach is that (i) any SOC change related to land use or management activity, including the effect of climate on plant productivity and soil respiration, propagates as a different amount (and type) of displaced SOC, potentially inducing a dynamic feedback, and (ii) land use and management directly affect the soil erosion rates, giving a bidirectional feedback on C balance.

  </a>), showing a high level of accuracy in simulating dynamic replacement in comparison with previous studies and the overall SOC budget (section S2: figs. S2 to S5). Some of the previous assumptions on sediment distribution that are required for running the model at continental scale were further tested using a delivery/sedimentary model, as detailed in section S3 (figs. S6 and S7 and table S1).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model was run for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 climate scenario as simulated by the HadGEM2 climate model, with current erosion (CE) and accelerated erosion (AE), the latter induced by the rainfall erosivity change as calculated recently by Panagos

   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>). When the model incorporates erosion, the C balance accounts for C displacement components (see Materials and Methods) and does not generate CO
  <sub>2</sub> fluxes until the C is mineralized. As we were interested in the net C exchange between soil and atmosphere, the net soil C flux was calculated
