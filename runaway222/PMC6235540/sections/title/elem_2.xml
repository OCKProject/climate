 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of climate change on the terrestrial C cycle is predominantly explained by productivity-driven changes in ESMs (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>), with potential significant biases when omitting the land management effect (
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). Our model framework, which includes a detailed description of land use and agricultural management, also showed an increase in C input by 2100 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>), driven by the higher productivity under the HadGEM2 projection observable at mid-high latitude. This increase was almost offset by enhanced soil respiration, which showed a similar continental response to C input fluxes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>). By the end of the century, the model also predicted an overall increase of C displaced by erosion, with an opposite trend in western countries (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>) and some large areas such as Andalusia and central France. This pattern partially overlapped with the change in rainfall erosivity (fig. S8), as eroded C is dependent not only on soil erosion but also on the evolution of SOC stock due to trends in productivity and soil respiration. These complex feedbacks emerged in the net soil flux figure (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1D</a>), where no clear continental patterns of land C sink and source were predicted over the period 2016–2100.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Looking at the continental C budget in the AE_e scenario (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>), we estimated a small C sink from agricultural land equal to 0.09 Tg C year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (C
  <sub>I</sub> − C
  <sub>H</sub>). Despite the fact that eroded C was more than one order of magnitude lower than the vertical fluxes, its contribution was important; the additional losses generated by C displacement (C
  <sub>Tm</sub> and C
  <sub>Bm</sub>) offset the vertical C sink, leading to a C source from land equal to 0.92 Tg C year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> over the period 2016–2100. When we ran the model without erosion, the C source from land was even higher and equal to 1.8 Tg C year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (table S2). This result suggests that climate change was the overarching driver on net CO
  <sub>2</sub> losses, which were partially offset by soil erosion through dynamic replacement (fig. S5), under this conservative model configuration.

   <p>The numbers in brackets [e; r] are the outcomes of the two model configurations: enhanced erosion-induced C sink (e), with the mineralization during transport set to 2%, the burial efficiency to 95%, and the enrichment factor to 2, and reduced erosion-induced C sink (r), where the same parameters were set to 10%, 20%, and 1, respectively. Dark arrows represent C displacements, while blue arrows represent C fluxes as C exchanges with the atmosphere (CO
    <sub>2</sub>-C). For the net soil flux, negative values represent a C source to the atmosphere, while positive values represent a C sink (see Materials and Methods for the full C balance component details). The agricultural area simulated (arable crops, grassland, and permanent crops) covers 1.88 Mkm

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the AE_r scenario, the halving of the enrichment factor caused a direct reduction of eroded C, which amounted to 63% than the AE_e (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>). Despite the lower SOC loss from the soil profile by erosion, the concomitant lower dynamic replacement led to a positive feedback on the vertical fluxes (C
  <sub>I</sub> &lt; C
  <sub>H</sub> with a value of −0.56 Tg C year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). In this model configuration, we estimated a net soil C flux of −10.1 Tg C year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, largely driven by the lower burial efficiency of buried SOC in the model setup (that is, 0.2). Although this value represents a quite extreme configuration of our model framework, a recent study indicated burial efficiencies of 0.22 and 0.14 in colluvium and alluvium stores of temperate zones, respectively (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). In this scenario, the C feedbacks generated by erosion resulted in a net soil C flux five times higher than that driven by climate change alone (−10.1 versus −1.8 Tg C year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The C displacement between eroding and depositional areas also induced different C feedbacks mediated by the associated nitrogen (N) (that is, in the organic matter), in turn affecting crop productivity at different landscape positions (see fig. S9 and related discussion) (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). At the EU level, we calculated a C
  <sub>I</sub> loss of 0.05 Tg C year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> per Tg of C eroded, which suggests relatively small reductions in productivity over the period 2016–2100, as supported by other studies (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>). Conversely, the effect may be much higher locally and the magnitude of our estimate may be conservative, if the increase in rainfall erosivity will be associated with a higher frequency of extreme events (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). In CENTURY, the unique feedback on plant productivity due to erosion is related to the displacement of N (associated with SOC) and its turnover, while the model does not simulate mechanistically physicochemical soil changes (for example, in structure, texture, and loss of all nutrients) due to rain-driven intensive erosion events or the direct impact on the vegetation (
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>). Direct and indirect effects of erosion on plant productivity may then be very important (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>). Despite the fact that the direct plant response to erosion is only modulated by N in our model, this is the first attempt to dynamically include lateral C fluxes in a process-based model framework at continental scale.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil erosion is a widespread process that currently affects EU agricultural soils (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>); therefore, the evaluation of future C feedbacks driven by its change requires a baseline reflecting the current conditions. To quantify the potential C feedback of accelerated erosion in the future, we ran the model, keeping erosion rates constant at current levels (current erosion: CE scenarios). With this run, we estimated that the future variation in rainfall erosivity led to 35% more C displaced by erosion in both configurations (e and r; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>). Overall, the climate-induced erosion feedback (ΔC
  <sub>netAE</sub>) was marginal in the e scenario but was more pronounced in r, with a loss of 2.34 Tg C year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> and table S2). Considering the contrasting ranges of parameterization in the two configurations, it is likely that we are catching the magnitude of this feedback, although there are no data against which to compare the model.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the fact that accelerated erosion induced a negligible C source continentally under the AE_e scenario (0.01 Tg C year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), we observed a marked regional variability (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>). In 35% of the cells (that is, 66 Mha), we estimated an induced C sink by the accelerated erosion, completely offset by sources for the remaining agricultural areas. In the AE_r scenario, the erosion-induced C sink was present in only 13% of the agricultural soils (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3B</a>), while lower values than those in AE_e were estimated all over the continent.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Projections of land C fluxes in current Earth system simulations under climate change are particularly affected by C turnover in soils (
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>) and are still missing the erosion feedbacks over decadal scales (
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>). This study may be a preliminary step toward coupling landscape dynamics in the biogeochemistry component of land schemes. Our results highlight how the interaction among soil variability, local management, climate, and geophysical processes leads to a variable C response, both in space and in sign of emissions. Upscaling of inventory-based approaches to large areas should therefore be done with care so that processes that have inherent variability are not oversimplified. Furthermore, our results challenge the suggestion that erosion will lead to a C sink in the near future, but they also claim for new researches investigating poorly known landscape C processes.
