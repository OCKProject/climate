 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The methodology for the estimation of the future rainfall erosivity was presented in a very recent study (
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>). Summarizing, this made use of the REDES (Rainfall Erosivity Database at European Scale) and a statistical approach (Gaussian process regression), used to spatially interpolate rainfall erosivity data with climatic scenarios. Using the HadGEM2 general circulation model climate projections (for RCP 4.5), available at the WorldClim repository, the rainfall erosivity was calculated for two time periods, namely, 2050 and 2070. Therefore, the soil erosion was recalculated, keeping the current factors of RUSLE, except the rainfall erosivity. The ratio between the future and the current soil erosion by water is reported in fig. S8.
