 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our modeling framework has some limitations. Soil erosion by water is a selective process that redistributes different size particles across the landscape, in turn potentially changing the environmental conditions affecting plant growth and SOC decomposition (

  </a>). In addition, the displaced C is associated to different mineral/particle fractions (for example, C bound to mineral particles, C in aggregates, and particulate C) (

  </a>), and the turnover of these different fractions is not yet implemented into the large-scale models, which are still currently based on the compartment approach of “conceptual” C pools (

   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>). We estimate that the development of full sediment delivery models coupled with new generations of biogeochemical models based on measurable C fractions will take another decade. To do this, we will need more information and increased process understanding to transfer microscale processes, such as aggregate breakdown, to millions of hectares. Meanwhile, we could account for lateral C fluxes with feasible approaches, as we have described here. Future land C projections rely on complex Earth system and biogeochemical models that do not incorporate the erosion process, lowering the level of confidence of our predictions. We have attempted to include the main lateral and vertical C fluxes as driven by a climate change projection to increase the confidence of future projections of soil C erosion on the C cycle.
