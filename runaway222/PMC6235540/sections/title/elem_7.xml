  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model framework was based on coupling the process-based biogeochemistry model CENTURY to the RUSLE2015 erosion model. This model integration has been presented in previous studies, and a summary flowchart is given as fig. S1. We summarized the model setup and main assumptions as follows.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1) The CENTURY model was ran at a resolution of 1 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> for the agricultural soil of the EU, using the soil erosion from RUSLE2015 model as input for CENTURY. Starting from 1900, the erosion process was implemented, keeping the climate, soil, and topographic factors (R, K, and LS, respectively) constant. While we considered K and LS factors quite invariable on a centennial scale, the C factor associated with the crop type was dynamically varied with crop rotations and land use changes. The simulated land use was based on the CORINE Land Cover 1990, 2000, and 2006, supplemented with Eurostat (Statistical Office of the European Communities)/FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) statistics to build up crop rotations and implement consistent agronomic inputs (fertilization, irrigation, etc.). Before 1990, we assumed the same land use but with different agricultural techniques characterized by lower productivity crops, lower rates of mineral N, and different rotation schemes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2) Originally, we assumed that each 1-km
   <span class="sup">2</span> grid cell is composed of an eroding area and a depositional area, the latter retaining a proportion of eroded C. The partition was based on the study of Van Oost 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
   <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
    <span class="italic">11</span>
   </a>), who found that 53 to 95% of eroded SOC were retained in the catchment and redeposited in a limited area (14 to 35%) within the same catchment. Taking the central values, we assumed that 25% of our grid cells were depositional areas, which received 70% of eroded soil. The remaining 30% was accounted for as leaving the grid cell as potential sediments and C discharged to riverine systems. These assumptions on sediment distributions, necessary to work at continental scale, were further tested using a delivery/sedimentary model in regional simulations, as detailed in section S3. After the intercomparison between the original and the sedimentary model–driven configuration, we set a new sediment delivery ratio of 0.11, as most of the sediments were predicted to be retained in land under the delivery/sedimentary model runs.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3) The replacement of eroded soil in the fixed profile comes by “recruitment” from the subsoil layers (SSLs), characterized by a SOC composition defined quantitatively and qualitatively as a partition among the three CENTURY SOC pools (active, slow, and passive). These pools are functionally defined on the basis of mean residence time, as opposed to measured fractions, and thus cannot be constrained by measurements applicable at the EU scale. The most rational approach was to adopt the calibration of Harden 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
   <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
    <span class="italic">7</span>
   </a>), which implicitly related the subsoil composition to the topsoil composition; accordingly, the subsoil SOC pools at time 
   <span class="italic">t</span> = 0 (that is, 1900) were assumed to be composed as a fraction of the top soil pools, as follows

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although CENTURY does not explicitly simulate depositional processes, they can be mimicked while ensuring conservation of mass (soil and C) within the system boundaries. First, we calculated the amount of soil transported from the eroding to the depositional fraction of each grid cell. Second, we simulated the burial effect of the deposition event as a “negative” erosion event, which moves a SOC fraction below the fixed soil profile (C burial flux), proportional to the amount of soil deposited on the surface. Last, the associated amount of deposited C was controlled by setting the incoming SOC pool in the model. This procedure required an iterative process, running the model year by year, first in the eroding area and then in the depositional area of each pixel. A check of the C balance closure was done at the end of simulations.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The methodology for the estimation of the future rainfall erosivity was presented in a very recent study (
   <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
    <span class="italic">18</span>
   </a>). Summarizing, this made use of the REDES (Rainfall Erosivity Database at European Scale) and a statistical approach (Gaussian process regression), used to spatially interpolate rainfall erosivity data with climatic scenarios. Using the HadGEM2 general circulation model climate projections (for RCP 4.5), available at the WorldClim repository, the rainfall erosivity was calculated for two time periods, namely, 2050 and 2070. Therefore, the soil erosion was recalculated, keeping the current factors of RUSLE, except the rainfall erosivity. The ratio between the future and the current soil erosion by water is reported in fig. S8.

Monthly precipitation and maximum and minimum air temperature were downloaded from the World Climate Research Programme–Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (WCR-CORDEX) portal (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://esgf-node.ipsl.upmc.fr/search/cordex-ipsl/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://esgf-node.ipsl.upmc.fr/search/cordex-ipsl/</span>). The present land use and agricultural management remained the same to isolate the climate effect on both productivity/turnover and erosion C feedbacks.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the accelerated erosion (AE) scenario, we linearly interpolated the soil erosion rates since 2016, considering the two soil erosion projections at 2050 and 2070. The name “accelerated erosion” refers to the average effect of rainfall erosivity change on increasing soil erosion. Higher and lower rainfall erosivity patterns are present at the EU level, as depicted in fig. S8. In the current erosion (CE) scenario, we kept the actual soil erosion rates.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the fact that there is limited consensus on C preservation/decomposition upon its displacement, we ran the model with two configurations, enhancing (e model setup) and minimizing (r model setup) the erosion as an induced C sink (or source). In particular, in the e configuration, the enrichment factor (that is, the C concentration in eroded sediments with respect to the bulk soils) was set to 2, the C mineralization during sediment transport to 2% yearly, and the burial efficiency (that is, the amount of C preserved when moved downward into the soil profile) to 95%. In the r configuration, the three parameters were set to 1, 10, and 20%, respectively.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to previous sensitivity analyses, a higher enrichment factor promotes a higher dynamic replacement of C (inducing a C sink in eroding position), while lower mineralization and higher burial efficiency preserve the displaced C. Considering the ranges of parameters from different studies, our configuration should reflect the outer boundary of the erosion effect in inducing a sink/source of C.</p>

   <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
    <span class="italic">22</span>
   </a>), an upward C flux from a subsoil pool follows the erosion event (as described in point 3 of the “Model framework and configuration” section). Moreover, the C balance accounts for C displacement components, some of them representing C moving outside the land domain (such as C to rivers, lakes, and ocean). For the purpose of the study, we set our boundary conditions to the land and, despite estimating a lump term accounting for C delivered to the riverine system, we did not calculate its decomposition (to CO
   <sub>2</sub>) related to the turnover outside the land.
