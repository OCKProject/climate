 <p>This contribution is an outcome from the working group ‘Marine Heatwaves—physical drivers and properties’ (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.marineheatwaves.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.marineheatwaves.org</span>) hosted at the University of Western Australia (UWA) Oceans Institute by T.W., D.A.S., N.J.H., and E.C.J.O. in January 2015. The working group received support for the workshop from a UWA Research Collaboration Award, a UWA School of Plant Biology synthesis grant, and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (ARCCSS: CE110001028). This work contributes to the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) Grand Challenge on Extremes. This paper makes a contribution to the interests and activities of the International Commission on Climate of IAMAS/IUGG and National Environmental Science Programme (NESP) Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub (ESCC) Hub Project 2.3 (Grant No. B0024391).
