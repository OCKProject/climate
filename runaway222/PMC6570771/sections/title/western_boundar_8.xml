 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">WBCs are regions of poleward ocean heat transport at the western extent of the subtropical gyres, where intense air-sea interactions can also affect the local climate. They are associated with strong temperature fronts and eddy variability, with large variability in their transports and location across a range of timescales.</p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent studies suggest that the intensification and poleward displacement of WBCs around the globe are causing local and regional SST warming trends in the mid-latitudes that far exceed mean global warming rates

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. Although the WBC regions and their extensions appear as prominent features when examining typical MHW intensity (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>), there was a notable absence of reported events in the literature based on our search (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Characteristically, WBC regions are prominent in MHW frequency and intensity (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b, d</a>) and do not show up particularly strongly in duration (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>), reflecting the high SST variance in these regions due to relatively rapid transport variations and large mesoscale eddy activity compared with other zones. WBCs are regions of exceptionally sharp horizontal SST gradients, such that small spatial displacements of the edge of the WBC can translate into very large SSTAs.

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the lack of reported MHW events in WBC systems, it is not possible to generalize the local drivers that give rise to MHWs in this zone. Nevertheless, with their role in the poleward advection of heat, one might expect a persistent and enhanced poleward WBC transport to potentially result in a warm SST event (and possible MHW), although only one such case has been discussed in the literature

  </span> during the 2015/16 Tasman Sea MHW that occurred in the East Australian Current (EAC) Extension region located poleward of the EAC core separation point
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. This event lasted for &gt;8 months with an intensity unprecedented over the satellite record (i.e. since 1982). For a number of WBC regions, it has been noted that shifts in current location are associated with SSTAs

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>, but these changes have not been directly linked to MHWs.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been shown that ENSO may weakly modulate western boundary current characteristics including SST on multi-year timescales via the influence of westward propagating oceanic Rossby waves
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span> with the slow propagation of these waves precluding their signal being evidenced as concurrent teleconnections. In addition, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a> suggests that other interannual climate modes may also be important at zero lag together with the PDO. In contrast, the low frequency modulation of ENSO by the IPO/PDO, and thus the lagged dynamic response due to oceanic Rossby wave teleconnections, may have promise for the potential predictability of MHW likelihood on multi-year time scales in these WBC case-study regions. Nonetheless, most of these relationships are weak suggesting that a substantial fraction of MHWs in WBC systems may be internally generated. For example, off southeast Australia most of the interannual variance of the western boundary current system appears to be unrelated to large-scale climate modes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span> and instead may be due to the internal variability arising from shorter time scale instabilities generated from local forcing, interacting, and cascading across scales
