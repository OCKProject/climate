 <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined the relationships between key climate indices (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>), as simple metrics for the climate modes, and the likelihood of MHW occurrence in the area-averaged case-study regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). This was done by summing the number of days at each location when the SSTA for a given region was classified as a MHW (based on

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span> using a 90th percentile threshold) and determining whether the climate index was in a positive or negative phase based on the 1982–2016 daily NOAA OI SST V2 (AVHRR-only) dataset

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>
  </span> (the MHW calculation uses a climatological baseline period of 1982–2012). Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to determine whether the number of days counted were greater or less than what might be expected by chance. For a given climate index, a synthetic time series was constructed with similar autocorrelation characteristics to the index (using a fourth order autoregressive model). We then re-summed the number of MHW days during positive and negative phases of the synthetic index. This process was repeated 10,000 times to produce a frequency distribution of the expected number of days. We used the 5th and 95th percentiles to form confidence intervals for the given mode and region.

 <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To generate Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, a similar procedure was undertaken using 2° × 2° area-averaged SSTA, based on the linearly detrended anomaly field from the daily NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature version 2 (OISSTv2) dataset from 1982–2016, and linearly detrended climate indices. For each resulting time series, we identified which climate modes were significantly related (&gt;90% level) to MHW occurrence using the Monte Carlo simulation. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> provides a spatial map of apparent climate mode influence. Here, the global patterns of identifiable climate modes and their respective phases are indicative of the dominant climate mode on both the enhancement (largest number of MHW days) and suppression (smallest number of MHW days) of MHW occurrences at each location.
