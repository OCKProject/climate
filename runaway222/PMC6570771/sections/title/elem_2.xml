  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The key results from our assessment of MHW drivers are provided under four broad ocean-climate zones—tropical latitudes, middle and high latitudes, western boundary currents and extension regions, and eastern boundary currents—with the synthesis review provided in Supplementary Notes

   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) were identified based on our search criteria (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). These criteria were consistent with the qualitative definition of a MHW as a ‘discrete prolonged anomalously warm water event

The four ocean-climate zones are the tropical latitudes, middle and high latitudes, western boundary currents and their extensions (WBCs), and eastern boundary currents (EBCs). These case-study regions are listed as follows: tropical latitudes [Great Barrier Reef (GBR); Seychelles Islands (SEY); Galapagos Islands (GAL); Bay of Bengal (BofB); Caribbean Sea (Carib)], middle and high latitudes [Mediterranean Sea (MED); Bering Sea (BERING); northwest Atlantic (NWATL); northeast Pacific (NE Pacific); south central Pacific (SCPAC)], WBCs [Gulf Stream (GS); Kuroshio Current (KC); Brazil-Malvinas Confluence (BRZ); Agulhas Current (AGH); Agulhas Retroflection (AGRET); East Australian Current (EAC); East Australian Current Extension (EACx)], and EBCs [Benguela Current (BENG); Leeuwin Current (LEEU); Baja California (Cal); Iberian/Canary Current (Can); Humboldt/Peru Current (Humb)]

  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings are categorized and summarized by case-study region and time scale in Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, and a confidence level around the climate modes or local processes important in modulating specific events has been assigned based on expert assessment of the number of studies and agreement across those studies identified from the literature (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Similar to atmospheric heatwaves, we found that MHWs may be caused by the interaction of many local and remote processes and phenomena acting across a large range of temporal and spatial scales (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). A global composite analysis (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) summarizes the statistical relationships between the important large-scale climate modes and increased MHW occurrences (or likelihood) within the case-study regions and elsewhere. This statistical analysis of data provides an additional unifying perspective that complements our literature synthesis and confidence assessment.

     <p>Our literature assessment of MHW drivers characterizes the contributions from: large-scale or regional climate modes (e.g. ENSO), atmospheric or oceanic teleconnection processes and climatological features (e.g. Rossby waves, fronts) [Mode/Teleconnection columns]; and local processes (e.g. ocean advection) affecting the MHW heat budget [Local Process columns] across four time scales (synoptic, intraseasonal, interannual and decadal) and classified by typology, i.e. eastern boundary currents (EBC), western boundary currents and extensions (WBC), tropics, and middle and high latitudes (MHL). For regions where no drivers or processes could be identified from the literature, the box is left blank. For ENSO, PDO, IOD, NAO and SLP, individual studies may indicate whether MHWs are associated with positive (+) or negative (−) phase. Case studies with an asterisk (*) have no documented MHWs, but literature identifies processes and modes that cause changes in the mixed layer temperature budget. Numbers correspond to a qualitative confidence assessment for literature documented MHW mode/teleconnection and local processes respectively. Confidence ratings are explained in the Methods and Supplementary Fig.

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is evident that the magnitude, frequency, and duration of MHW events have a heterogeneous distribution across the global oceans (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Except for the upwelling regions of the equatorial Pacific cold tongue, the highest intensity MHWs (i.e. with largest SSTA) are primarily associated with boundary currents like the Gulf Stream or their extensions. Based on our literature search and synthesis (Supplementary Notes 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>–
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a> and Supplementary Tables 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>–
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">20</a>), we found it somewhat surprising that there have been very few reported studies of MHWs in the western boundary current regions, despite the large temperature variability found there. In contrast, a greater richness of information has been reported on MHWs in eastern boundary current regions. On average, the longest-duration MHWs tend to occur in the eastern equatorial Pacific associated with El Niño events, aside from a few longer individual events noted elsewhere in recent years, e.g. the recent 2013–2016 northeast Pacific Blob event

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To better frame and contextualize our global assessment of the regional literature on MHW processes and drivers, we first characterized the important relationships between large-scale climate modes and MHW occurrences. This was necessary since individual case studies described in the literature used different methods to define and characterize MHW events. This non-uniformity makes it problematic to directly compare multiple events and their drivers in a consistent manner. To address this, we used satellite SST data following the established MHW definition
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
   </span> and adapted for strong events to uniformly characterize event duration, maximum intensity, and maximum spatial extent of the individual MHWs reported in the literature from 1982–2016 (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). The application of a consistent MHW definition allowed us to compare events and statistically analyze MHW occurrences in relation to large-scale climate modes of variability. Our approach provided a coherent and useful framework to evaluate and confirm whether the warm ocean temperature events identified in our literature search were indeed MHWs, thus providing a more robust confidence assessment.

   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) are complex, although the large-scale patterns are broadly consistent with known SSTA patterns (note that there are clear differences, e.g. compare the regressed SSTA against the composite MHW occurrence plots in Supplementary Figs. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">14</a> for the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM)). Some characteristics include the relationship between ENSO and the extensive area of influence in the Pacific basin, with El Niño apparently enhancing (and La Niña suppressing) MHW occurrences in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean and suppressing MHW occurrences in a characteristic chevron shaped-region of the western Pacific Ocean extending eastwards into higher latitudes (again with opposite signal for La Niña). However, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> indicates that MHW occurrences in the central Indian Ocean are also significantly related to ENSO (likely via the ENSO-driven Indian Ocean Basin-wide mode (IOB)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>), as well as in parts of the Southern Ocean and the eastern Atlantic basin. This highlights the prominence of ENSO influence for many regions around the world. Similarly, the central Pacific (CP) El Niño is strongly related to MHWs in the central and western Pacific. We also note a stronger association between MHW occurrences off the west coast of Australia—where Ningaloo Niños occur
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
   </span>, the lower frequency Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) has the strongest association with MHWs. The North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) have been found to influence temperature and sea level changes in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) dominates in the western and eastern tropical Indian Ocean, also apparently influencing much of the Maritime Continent (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). The North Atlantic Ocean is dominated by the NAO, which has two centres of activity in the far north and in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. Between these two regions there is no clear dominant driver. In the eastern South Atlantic Ocean, MHWs are apparently most strongly modulated by the Atlantic Niño. In the western basin, Pacific drivers including the IPO (identified by the Tripole index, see Methods), NPGO and CP El Niño, appear to be important. No clear climate mode dominates over the Southern Ocean, although there are some extended regions affected by SAM, ENSO, and the IPO.
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a> highlights which climate mode has the strongest relationship with MHW occurrence at a given location, in many instances there are statistically significant relationships with multiple climate modes. This can be seen in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> shown as all the statistically significant relationships between MHW suppression or enhancement with the phase of known climate modes averaged across the various case-study (boxed) regions. Our statistical analysis shows, for example, that the likelihood of a MHW in the northeast Pacific (e.g. the Blob) is elevated to about 17% during positive phases of the PDO and suppressed to about 5% during negative phases of the PDO. However, ENSO (measured by Niño3.4), the IPO (measured by the Tripole index), CP ENSO (measured by the EMI), and NPGO also have significant effects on MHW occurrences in the northeast Pacific. Further, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a> shows that in the equatorial and far North Atlantic Ocean, as well as the tropical southwest Pacific (Coral Sea), there are likely to be &gt;40% more MHW days during the negative NAO phase (Supplementary Figs. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>–
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">15</a> provide detail across all of the climate modes considered).
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many cases, the modulation of MHW occurrence is consistent with local changes in SSTA associated with the various climate modes. For example, the Brazil Current region is linked to local Atlantic Niño variability, the eastern North Pacific region is affected by ENSO, PDO, IPO, and NPGO, and the northwest Atlantic is primarily affected by the NAO. However, it is important to again note that significant statistical relationships do not necessarily indicate causal links. For example, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows an apparent connection between the IOD and MHW suppression in the central Pacific. This link is most likely a consequence of the correlation between the Dipole Mode index (DMI) and Niño3.4 indices, which is due to the IOD being at least partly driven by ENSO variability. Interestingly, in many of the western boundary current (WBC) regions, such as the Gulf Stream, East Australian Current, and the Agulhas Current, we find no clear relationship between MHW occurrence and any of the climate modes. This implies that the key drivers of MHWs in these regions may be either persistent changes in local or remote forcing (e.g. wind stress) not associated with a large-scale climate mode(s), lagged responses to climate modes, or internal variability.

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on our global confidence assessment of the historical peer-reviewed literature on the local to large-scale mechanisms that cause MHWs, we have collectively determined that surface MHWs are the direct result of local-scale processes acting within the mixed layer (e.g. ocean heat advection, air-sea interaction or vertical mixing; Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), which can be modulated by remote influences (e.g. climate modes such as ENSO) and their teleconnections.

   </span>. A positive IOD corresponds to anomalous warming in the western tropical Indian Ocean and anomalous cooling in the east that is generally active between austral winter and spring. It is notable that increased MHW occurrences in the tropical Atlantic are associated most strongly with a negative NAO while MHW occurrences in the tropical Indian Ocean most strongly relate to a positive DMI (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). The atmospheric processes associated with a negative IOD may have extended the duration of the intense MHW across northern Australia during the 2015/16 El Niño

  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case-study regions for tropical latitudes, we found that the longest-duration MHWs identified from the literature were around the Galápagos Island region during major El Niño events. The largest contiguous region experiencing MHW conditions occurred in early November 1997 (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>), while the record breaking 2015/16 El Niño was also linked to extreme SST conditions in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Mechanistically, the large SST changes in the central-eastern tropical Pacific during El Niño are due to coupled ocean-atmosphere processes (e.g. Bjerknes feedback) and changes in horizontal and vertical ocean heat transport. In the Great Barrier Reef region, El Niño conditions result in clearer skies, increased air-sea heat flux, weakened winds, warm ocean advection, and reduced vertical mixing, which are important drivers of MHWs. In the Seychelles region, the warmest SSTAs tend to be associated with ENSO, IOD, and ENSO-IOD events. The 1997/98 MHW event had co-occurring ENSO and IOD events

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>

Large-scale atmospheric pressure anomalies precede anomalous ocean warming and are often triggered by remote changes in SST. Stalled ridges of atmospheric high-pressure systems cause clear skies, warm air, and reduced wind speeds. These conditions make rapid warming in the upper ocean possible, coupled with increase thermal stratification due to reduced vertical mixing. In the North Pacific, we identify multiple drivers that can enhance the occurrence of MHWs, including El Niño and the positive PDO and IPO phases (Figs.

   </span>. However, it is important to recognize the regional complexities from air-sea coupling in these eastern boundary regions associated with regional Niño/Niña phenomena (e.g. Ningaloo and California). The positive phase of the PDO can contribute to enhancing MHW days off the west coast of North America. Off western Africa, the positive phase of the Atlantic Niño index is the dominant phase that enhances MHW days (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). During these phases, high sea surface height anomalies and a deepening of the thermocline result in anomalous poleward currents. Anomalous downwelling favourable winds can also contribute to the strengthening of these poleward flows. These currents result in the advection of warmer water poleward, regional air-sea heat fluxes, and local feedbacks that can contribute to localized warming.
