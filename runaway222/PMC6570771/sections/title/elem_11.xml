   <span class="italic">Web of Science</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Google Scholar</span> were used to find relevant peer-reviewed literature from 1950 to February 2016 for our analysis. In our searches, we used the keywords: sea surface temperature, extreme event, temperature anomaly, heatwave (and heat wave), and anomaly. Of the potential case studies found, suitable studies for inclusion in our database analysis were identified following the application of qualitative selection criteria (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). As a result, a total of 84 refereed articles were included in the database (see Supplementary Tables 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Given the rapidly growing literature on MHWs, a few important relevant papers were also included since the cut-off. We evaluated each study to identify the local to large-scale driver(s) of each of the reported extreme ocean temperature events.

   </span>. Sizeable evidence consisted of multiple (three or more) independent studies of high-quality evidence. A very high confidence rating corresponds to both sizeable evidence and strong agreement. The peer-review process should preclude unreliable evidence or conclusions. However, unavoidable scientific uncertainty is inherent in our own confidence measure. The adopted confidence ranking reconciles the diversity of analyses and data being used by considering overall agreement. For each MHW case-study, we have assessed and reported the level of confidence in the identified MHW driver component as being accurate, which is dependent on the level of agreement and amount of evidence. We consider this to be a systematic approach to comprehensively document MHWs, highlighting agreement and disagreement across the literature.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Definition of MHW driver</div>
  <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We define a MHW driver to be the set of causative mechanisms that combine to produce a MHW event. Specifically, a driver will comprise of the local processes that directly affect the anomalous ocean temperature tendency budget during a MHW event, and where relevant, combined with the large-scale climate forcing mechanisms (e.g. known climate modes, with a centre-of-action that might be remote to the MHW) via teleconnection processes. Our definitions for local processes, climate forcings, and teleconnection processes are given below.</p>
  <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local processes (affecting the MHW budget): represent the processes that directly affect the evolution of ocean temperature (in particular, in the surface mixed layer) at a certain location, i.e. heat fluxes, horizontal advection (from the mean circulation or high-frequency small-scale flow), vertical entrainment, and horizontal and vertical mixing.</p>
  <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate forcings (modes of variability): represent the important large-scale climate modes of variability—like El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)—that remotely or locally generate climate conditions that act to increase or decrease the occurrence of MHWs.</p>
  <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Teleconnection processes: represent the atmospheric or oceanographic processes (e.g. planetary waves, atmospheric bridge) that mechanistically connect the remote modulating climate mode forcing with the direct local process affecting the MHW temperature tendency budget.</p>
  <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study focuses on MHWs as expressed at the sea surface (we note that subsurface data are sparse and ecological impacts are generally realised in the upper ocean where biological productivity is greatest). Hence, local processes represent the surface mixed layer processes that govern extreme sea surface temperature anomalies (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) and that can be potentially diagnosed from a surface temperature (or heat) budget analysis. A list of the relevant mechanisms identified as important to MHW occurrence is provided in Table

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate indices as metrics for climate modes</div>
  <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our composite analysis of MHWs, we considered nine commonly used climate indices that are associated with influential modes of variability in the climate system. These climate modes have characteristic time scales ranging from sub-seasonal (e.g. the SAM) to multi-decadal (e.g. the IPO). It is important to note, however, that there may be compounding influences of multiple large-scale climate modes potentially affecting certain regions simultaneously, since many climate modes are not independent of each other. The climate mode indices used are described below.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Driver space and time scales</div>
  <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the literature review, we found that different drivers can cause MHWs over a range of space and time scales (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). To distinguish between drivers acting on different scales, we categorized the physical drivers across several commonly classified time scales (i.e. synoptic, intraseasonal, interannual, decadal). We defined synoptic timescales as lasting from days to weeks. Intraseasonal refers to variability occurring on the order of 30–90 day cycles. The most notable intraseasonal phenomenon in the tropics is the MJO. Interannual, or year-to-year, variability is associated with phenomena such as ENSO, Ningaloo Niño, Atlantic Niño, Benguela Niño and the IOD. Lastly, the decadal time scale includes phenomena such as the PDO (or IPO) or the AMO, which represent climate variations on the order of decades to multiple decades. Events are categorized according to which driver played the primary role in the associated region (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).

  <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined the relationships between key climate indices (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>), as simple metrics for the climate modes, and the likelihood of MHW occurrence in the area-averaged case-study regions (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). This was done by summing the number of days at each location when the SSTA for a given region was classified as a MHW (based on
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
   </span> using a 90th percentile threshold) and determining whether the climate index was in a positive or negative phase based on the 1982–2016 daily NOAA OI SST V2 (AVHRR-only) dataset
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>
   </span> (the MHW calculation uses a climatological baseline period of 1982–2012). Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to determine whether the number of days counted were greater or less than what might be expected by chance. For a given climate index, a synthetic time series was constructed with similar autocorrelation characteristics to the index (using a fourth order autoregressive model). We then re-summed the number of MHW days during positive and negative phases of the synthetic index. This process was repeated 10,000 times to produce a frequency distribution of the expected number of days. We used the 5th and 95th percentiles to form confidence intervals for the given mode and region.

  <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To generate Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, a similar procedure was undertaken using 2° × 2° area-averaged SSTA, based on the linearly detrended anomaly field from the daily NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature version 2 (OISSTv2) dataset from 1982–2016, and linearly detrended climate indices. For each resulting time series, we identified which climate modes were significantly related (&gt;90% level) to MHW occurrence using the Monte Carlo simulation. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> provides a spatial map of apparent climate mode influence. Here, the global patterns of identifiable climate modes and their respective phases are indicative of the dominant climate mode on both the enhancement (largest number of MHW days) and suppression (smallest number of MHW days) of MHW occurrences at each location.

   <span class="sup">th</span> percentile). A 90th percentile threshold resulted in too many small events that made it unclear when the main event was taking place. If SSTA for a given event dropped below the 98th percentile for &lt;3 days, but then re-emerged, we considered this to be a continuing event (as long as regional SSTA remained warm, i.e. above the 98th percentile). If SSTA dropped below the 98th percentile in one region while building up to exceed the 98th percentile in a nearby region, we considered this to be the same event. In Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>, for each historical event, we reported the dates and magnitudes when: the SSTA first exceeded and finally dropped below the 98th percentile threshold; reached the maximum SSTA (above climatological baseline); and, reached its maximum contiguous area with SSTA greater than the 98th percentile threshold.
