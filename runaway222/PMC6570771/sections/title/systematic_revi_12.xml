  <span class="italic">Web of Science</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Google Scholar</span> were used to find relevant peer-reviewed literature from 1950 to February 2016 for our analysis. In our searches, we used the keywords: sea surface temperature, extreme event, temperature anomaly, heatwave (and heat wave), and anomaly. Of the potential case studies found, suitable studies for inclusion in our database analysis were identified following the application of qualitative selection criteria (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). As a result, a total of 84 refereed articles were included in the database (see Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Given the rapidly growing literature on MHWs, a few important relevant papers were also included since the cut-off. We evaluated each study to identify the local to large-scale driver(s) of each of the reported extreme ocean temperature events.
