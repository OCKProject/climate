  <p>Percentage change in MHW occurrences linked to climate mode phase. The percentage of days experiencing MHWs during positive or negative phases of a climate mode, for each case-study region. The black horizontal line indicates the median percentage over the full period irrespective of the phase of the modes. Values above (below) this bar indicate the climate mode phase enhances (suppresses) the likelihood of MHW occurrences. Values are only shown when significant at the 5% level (based on a Monte Carlo sampling, see Methods). The median deviates from 10% because the MHW definition includes a 5-day threshold and the climatological period used for calculation of MHWs (1982–2012) differs from the full length of the analyzed time series (1982–2016). Climate modes associated with the various indices are described in the Methods (“Climate indices as metrics for climate mode drivers”)</p>
