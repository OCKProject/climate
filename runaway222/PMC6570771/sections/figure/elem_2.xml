   <span class="bold">b</span> Summary schematic showing the locations where climate modes (and phases) have the greatest significant impact on enhancing or suppressing the number of MHW days (see Methods). The percentage of enhancement or suppression for individual climate modes used to construct this schematic are shown in Supplementary Figs.
