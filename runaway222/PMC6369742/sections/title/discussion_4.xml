 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The coverage and quality of our meteorological, glaciological, and geodetic datasets decline as we regress to the mid-1900s, as does our ability to track the relative importance of SMB and DMB as drivers of deglaciation. Even so, it is clear that the sustained acceleration in mass loss recorded by GRACE before mid-2013 was completely unprecedented (
  <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>), as was the collapse of seasonally adjusted mass rate from its peak value to nearly zero in the following 12–18 mo. Mass rate scales with SMB and DMB, so mass acceleration scales with the trend or rate of change of SMB and DMB. Greenland’s air–sea–ice system crossed one or more thresholds or tipping points near the beginning of this millennium, triggering more rapid deglaciation. The pronounced negative shift in spatially integrated SMB (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5 
   <span class="italic">E</span> and 
   <span class="italic">G</span>
  </a>). Runoff increased over most of the flanks of the GrIS, but most noticeably in southwest Greenland, where the margin was gaining mass in 2003 but strongly losing mass by late 2012 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>). Total glacial discharge integrated over southwest Greenland is not only very low (9.5 ± 1.5 Gt/y) compared with other areas (
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>), it has been unusually stable as well. South of JI, mass acceleration was dominated by falling SMB from 2000 onward. A little further north, seasonally adjusted discharge rates at JI increased by ∼44% from early 2000 to early 2006, but barely changed between early 2006 and early 2012 (
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>). It was SMB that was strongly falling in this second 6-y time interval, not DMB (
  <a rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" href="#r10">10</a>). Similar considerations apply in southeast Greenland (
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The decadal acceleration in mass loss in southwest Greenland arose due to the combination of sustained global warming and positive fluctuations in temperature and insolation driven by the NAO. In

  </span>, we develop an analogy with the global coral bleaching events triggered by every El Niño since that of 1997/1998, but not by any earlier El Niño event. Since 2000, the NAO has worked in concert with global warming to trigger major increases in summertime runoff. Before 2000, the air was too cool for the NAO to do the same. In a decade or two, global warming will be able to drive 2012 levels of runoff with little or no assistance from the NAO. In the shorter term, we can infer that the next time NAO turns strongly negative, SMB will trend strongly negative over west and especially southwest Greenland, just as future warming of the shallow ocean is expected to have its largest impact, via DMB (
  <a rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" href="#r33">33</a>, 
  <a rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" href="#r34">34</a>), in southeast and northwest Greenland. Because ice sheet topography equips southwest Greenland with greater sensitivity to atmospheric forcing, we infer that within two decades this part of the GrIS will become a major contributor to sea level rise. There is also the suggestion that enhanced summertime melting may induce more sustained increases in discharge rates.
