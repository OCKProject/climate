  <p>The combined daily uplift anomalies for 46 GNET stations, and the traveling 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of this data cloud. The uplift anomaly is defined as the difference between the observed uplift and a trajectory model consisting of a quadratic trend and a four-term Fourier series fit to all data in a reference period ending in 2013.4. The median anomaly displaces sharply downward at 2013.4 and never returns to zero. NF, # frequencies; NP=2, quadratic trend; SLTM, standard linear trajectory model.</p>
