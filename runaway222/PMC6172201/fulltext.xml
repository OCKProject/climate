The spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature can have strong impacts on community structure and persistence by increasing the duration and the magnitude of unfavorable conditions in sink populations and disrupting spatial rescue effects by synchronizing spatially segregated populations. Although increases in spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature have been documented in historical data, little is known about how climate change will impact these trends. We examined daily air temperature data from 21 General Circulation Models under the business-as-usual carbon emission scenario to quantify patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation between 1871 and 2099. Although both spatial and temporal autocorrelation increased over time, there was significant regional variation in the temporal autocorrelation trends. Additionally, we found a consistent breakpoint in the relationship between spatial autocorrelation and time around the year 2030, indicating an acceleration in the rate of increase of the spatial autocorrelation over the second half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Overall, our results suggest that ecological populations might experience elevated extinction risk under climate change because increased spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature is expected to erode both spatial and temporal refugia.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Northeastern University Marine Science Center; Northeastern University Honors Program</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CCF-1442728</award-id><award-id>OCE-1635989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouhier</surname><given-names>Tarik C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Although classical studies have focused almost exclusively on determining the ecological impacts of shifting average environmental conditions, there is growing recognition that statistical properties beyond the mean can play an equally important role in shaping the structure and functioning of ecosystems under climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. For instance, high variance in an environmental variable can destabilize populations by inducing greater fluctuations in their abundance over time and thus increase the risk of stochastic extinction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Even when environmental variance is too weak to promote extinction risk, it can have a more insidious effect on ecological systems due to nonlinear averaging. Specifically, if a population responds nonlinearly to environmental conditions, then changes in the temporal or spatial properties of the environment (e.g., temporal or spatial variance) can alter the mean ecological response even if the mean environmental conditions remain constant, and the strength of this effect will depend on the degree of nonlinearity in the functional response of the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This implies that the variance of an environmental variable has consequences for ecological systems that cannot be inferred from their average values alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Indeed, studies have shown that variation in environmental variables impacts natural populations and consideration of variance can be required for successful model predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Hence, in order to determine how climate change will impact ecological systems, it is at least as important to study variation in temperature and other critical environmental variables as it is to study their mean.</p><p id="Par3">In addition to variance, it is also crucial to consider the temporal structure or autocorrelation of environmental variables such as temperature, as the variation in environmental variables is predicted to change over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Studies of historical temperatures have shown an increase in their temporal autocorrelation from 1961 to 1990<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and these trends are expected to increase under climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Quantifying such changes in the temporal autocorrelation of environmental variables is critical in order to accurately predict the dynamics and persistence of ecological systems under climate change. Indeed, increased temporal autocorrelation in climate variables has been linked to lower persistence of model and natural populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In general, theory predicts that a reddening of environmental time series (an increase in its temporal autocorrelation) can extend the duration of poor conditions and thus promote extinction risk by eroding temporal refugia or rescue effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The combination of increased temporal variance and autocorrelation in the environment could have even more dire consequences for ecological systems. For example, Dillon <italic>et al</italic>. showed that adding power to lower frequencies of temperature time series increased their temporal variance and autocorrelation, and thus the overall incidence and persistence of long-term heat waves and cold snaps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Such increased intensity (temporal variance) and duration (temporal autocorrelation) of harsh conditions can promote extinction risk. Hence, the destabilizing effect of increased temporal environmental variability can be amplified by an increase in its autocorrelation. Overall, this suggests that increased temporal variance and autocorrelation of environmental conditions may interact synergistically to destabilize ecological systems.</p><p id="Par5">The link between spatial autocorrelation of the environment and population dynamics has also been well established, with theoretical and empirical studies showing that spatiotemporally correlated or synchronized fluctuations in environmental conditions can give rise to synchronized fluctuations in ecological populations (i.e., the Moran effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>). For instance, increased spatial synchrony in air temperature due to changes in basin-scale climate forcing (North Atlantic Oscillation) gave rise to increased synchrony in Greenland animal populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In general, increased spatial autocorrelation in the environment is expected to promote the scale and the magnitude of synchronized fluctuations in populations and thus reduce the spatial heterogeneity of ecological systems. In doing so, increased spatial environmental autocorrelation can thus promote extinction risk at local and regional scales by eliminating the potential for spatial rescue effects between interconnected but increasingly synchronized populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Although the negative effects of spatial and temporal autocorrelation have been established independently in model and natural systems, little is known about how these two phenomena will interact under climate change. Overall, theory suggests that increased spatial and temporal autocorrelation of environmental factors like temperature are expected to interact synergistically to destabilize ecological communities by disrupting both temporal and spatial rescue effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. To determine the potential for such synergistic interactions, we characterized spatial and temporal autocorrelation in temperature from climate model projections. This was accomplished by analyzing temperature data from 1871 to 2099 using spectral analysis to measure temporal autocorrelation by calculating the spectral exponent and estimating spatial autocorrelation by determining the lag distance at which temperature becomes spatially uncorrelated (i.e., the spatial range).</p><p id="Par7">We found that temporal and spatial autocorrelation increased over time in individual climate models and the multimodel mean. However, there was considerable regional variation in temporal autocorrelation, with western North America, central South America, northwestern Eurasia and North Africa seeing significant increases in temporal autocorrelation, but West Africa and the Southern Ocean seeing significant decreases in temporal autocorrelation. Piecewise regression analyses showed consistent breakpoints in spatial trends in autocorrelation around the year 2030 globally, and spatial trends in autocorrelation were statistically significant after the breakpoint across time windows of different sizes. Our results suggest that climate change is likely to increase the spatial and temporal homogeneity of temperature, which may negatively impact connectivity between source and sink populations and thus reduce the persistence of ecological communities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Global trends in temporal autocorrelation</title><p id="Par8">The spectral exponent of the global temperature obtained from the climate multimodel mean becomes more negative over time (&#x0201c;reddening&#x0201d;) indicating increased temporal autocorrelation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

However, there are strong latitudinal patterns, with autocorrelation decreasing most between 70&#x02009;S and 40&#x02009;S due to the influence of the Southern Ocean. Autocorrelation increases most in temperate regions due to the effects of both land and sea. In general, model agreement is relatively high across most of the globe, with the notable exceptions of parts of Antarctica and the north Atlantic (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Model robustness is notably the highest in the Southern Ocean (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). However, robustness is below 50% at other latitudes despite high agreement, which indicates that while individual GCMs are consistent in the trend, there is disagreement about the significance of the trend. Although there is no meaningful change in model agreement and robustness across longitudes, model agreement and robustness vary latitudinally reaching lower values around the South Pole, the equator and the North Pole.</p><p id="Par11">It is important to note that these results are based on the linearly detrended data, which retain seasonal temperature cycles. To determine the robustness of our results to seasonality, we conducted the same analyses on seasonally detrended data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The results from the seasonally detrended data show an almost universal increase in temporal autocorrelation of temperature across the globe, particularly in the Pacific Ocean, the northern Atlantic Ocean, western North America, South America, western Africa and Australia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Overall, the predicted trends in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature are stronger and more spatially-uniform when seasonal temperature cycles are removed. This is because seasonal (annual) temperature fluctuations are characterized by high power and occur at relatively low frequencies when using multi-year time windows. Hence, when regressing (log) power against (log) frequency, annual fluctuations in temperature have high statistical leverage on the slope estimate used to quantify the spectral exponent. Removing seasonality, which remains relatively constant over time and has high leverage on the spectral exponent estimate, thus facilitates the detection of temporal trends in autocorrelation due to changes in temperature fluctuations occurring at non-annual frequencies. One can thus think of the trends obtained using the linearly detrended data as a conservative estimate of the expected changes in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature and those obtained using the seasonally detrended data as anti-conservative.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Global trends in spatial autocorrelation</title><p id="Par12">Spatial autocorrelation in the global multimodel mean temperature measured via the spatial range does not increase significantly over time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Overall, this suggests that the spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature are expected to increase under climate change, particularly during the second half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Increasing autocorrelation in a warming world</title><p id="Par15">Our results are consistent with other research showing an increase in spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature based on weather station data from the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, but inconsistent with one previous study showing a reduction in the temporal autocorrelation of global temperature from weather station data between 1910 and 1990<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This discrepancy is likely due to differences in the nature (observations vs. models), spatial resolution and spatiotemporal extent of the temperature records.</p><p id="Par16">For instance, GCMs are simulated at relatively coarse resolutions, are global in scale, longer term, and do not include all of the stochastic factors that influence temperature across temporal and spatial scales. Hence, GCM projections may exhibit an upward bias in the predicted temporal and spatial autocorrelation of temperature relative to observational studies due to the &#x0201c;spatiotemporal smoothing effect&#x0201d; created by their coarser resolution and limited sources of local stochasticity. Although these differences can make comparisons between raw predictions and observations difficult without some form of statistical correction, they should not affect the likelihood of detecting spatiotemporal trends in temperature autocorrelation within GCMs since these trends are measured by making internal comparisons of model predictions.</p><p id="Par17">We suggest that discrepancies between model projections and observational data are more likely due to the large regional differences in the temporal autocorrelation trends seen in both observational studies and GCM projections (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For instance, the analysis of weather data from 1910 to 1990 cited earlier revealed significant regional differences in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature, with Asia and Australia experiencing a significant increase over time, but South America and North America experiencing a significant decrease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Hence, differences in the spatial extent and resolution of observational studies vs. GCM projections could easily lead to conflicting conclusions due to the high degree of regional variation in these trends. Overall, understanding how the nature, resolution and spatiotemporal extent of temperature records interact to influence this discrepancy will be critical in order to more accurately predict the impact of climate change across temporal and spatial scales. Our GCM results echo those of Dillon <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and Wang and Dillon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, who showed an increase in temporal autocorrelation of historical (observed) temperature data from 1961 to 1990 and an increase in spatial homogeneity in weather data between 1960 and 1991. This agreement between our results based on GCM projections and those of Dillon based on observations is consistent with the notion that differences in the spatial resolution and the spatiotemporal extent rather than the nature of the temperature records may have the greatest impact on estimates of temporal and spatial autocorrelation.</p><p id="Par18">Overall, GCM projections suggest that the temporal autocorrelation of temperature will tend to increase more on land than in the sea, with increases occurring in Eurasia, South America, western North America and southeastern Asia, and decreases occurring mostly in the Southern Ocean. This is intriguing because previous studies have shown that the temporal autocorrelation of temperature tends to be lower on land than in the sea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> because heat transfer occurs over longer timescales in the ocean and thus results in greater system &#x0201c;memory&#x0201d;. Taken together, these results suggest that the disparities in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature between land and sea are predicted to decrease over time at the global scale under climate change.</p><p id="Par19">Differences in the spatial autocorrelation of temperature in tropical vs. temperate regions are consistent with expectations from the physical characteristics of the regions. The significant difference between temperate and tropical regions in the mean scale of spatial autocorrelation (i.e., spatial range) is expected because the tropics are much smaller in area than the temperate regions. There is clear evidence of nonlinearity in the spatial data analyzed, particularly in the spatial range of global temperature. Our exploration of the nonlinearities in the global trends via piecewise regression revealed the presence of a quasi-universal breakpoint around the year 2030 across climate models, after which the spatial autocorrelation of temperature increased significantly over time. This lends support for the existence of a &#x0201c;tipping point&#x0201d; in the effect of carbon emissions on the spatial structure of temperature, with time acting as a proxy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Although the tipping point in the spatial range occurred around year 2030 in tropical regions, our analyses suggest that in temperate regions the threshold occurred during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, around the time that the historical effects of anthropogenic climate change became apparent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Overall, this suggests that climate change may thus increase the spatial autocorrelation of temperature at an accelerating rate over the course of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Ecological impacts of environmental homogenization</title><p id="Par20">Under climate change, our results show that the spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature are expected to increase at a potentially accelerating pace over time.

This is expected to lead to greater spatial and temporal homogeneity (i.e., due to increased spatial and temporal autocorrelation in temperature).</p><p id="Par21">The ecological consequences of increased homogeneity in the environment have been documented in a number of studies.

Indeed, under prolonged exposure to poor environmental conditions, these slow-growing and red-shifted species will see their numbers dwindle and will thus be unable to recover fast enough when conditions improve. Hence, increasing the extent of poor environmental conditions by increasing temporal autocorrelation will erode temporal refugia and prevent temporal rescue effects. Since most animal populations appear to be red-shifted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, extinction risk is likely to rise due to the increased temporal autocorrelation of temperature under climate change.</p><p id="Par22">Additionally, greater spatial homogeneity in environmental variables such as temperature may disrupt spatial rescue effects by destroying the spatial heterogeneity needed in order for source-sink dynamics to occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Overall, the simultaneous erosion of temporal and spatial refugia under climate change has the potential to promote extinction risk. Mitigating the impacts of these trends in the spatiotemporal properties of temperature is thus critical in order ensure the persistence of complex and interconnected ecosystems in an increasingly homogeneous world.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Data acquisition and availability</title><p id="Par23">Daily surface (air) temperature (variable &#x02018;tas&#x02019;) between 1871 and 2099 was extracted from 21 General Circulation Model (GCM) under the &#x02018;business-as-usual&#x02019; representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>; for list of General Circulation Models see Appendix).
