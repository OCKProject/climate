  <p>Maps of changes in the temporal autocorrelation of the multimodel mean temperature. Temporal autocorrelation was quantified via the spectral exponent, with more negative values indicating greater autocorrelation. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Map of the slope obtained by regressing the spectral exponent against time over 10-year periods between 1870 and 2090. Negative (positive) values depicted in red (blue) indicate an increase (decrease) in autocorrelation due to an increase (decrease) in the dominance of lower frequencies. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Grey contours indicate statistically significant slopes (
   <span class="italic">p</span>-value &lt; 0.05). Side plots represent the percentage of geographical locations at each latitude or longitude characterized by an increase in the dominance of lower (red) or higher (blue) frequencies. (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) Map of model agreement for the slope of the spectral exponent. Agreement is defined as the proportion of models predicting the same sign for the slope as the multimodel mean, with areas of high agreement being depicted in darker shades of purple. Side plots represent the percentage of geographical locations where model agreement exceed 50% at each latitude or longitude. (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) Map of model robustness for the slope of the spectral exponent. Robustness is defined as the proportion of models that agree with the multimodel mean on the sign and the statistical significance of the slope. Side plots represent the percentage of geographical locations where model robustness exceeds 50% at each latitude or longitude.
