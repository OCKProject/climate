  <p>Changes in the temporal and spatial autocorrelation of the multimodel mean temperature obtained via simple regression. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Temporal autocorrelation was quantified via the spectral exponent, with more negative values indicating greater autocorrelation. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Spatial autocorrelation was quantified via the spatial range, which measures the geographical distance at which temperatures become decorrelated. Trend lines reflect linear model fits obtained via Generalized Least Squares and shaded regions represent 95% confidence bands. Solid lines indicate statistically significant trends and separate line segments and colors are used to show the breakpoints in the time series. The multimodel mean was computed using 21 GCMs projections and averaged globally over 10-year time windows.
