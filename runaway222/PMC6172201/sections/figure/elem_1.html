         <p>Maps of changes in the temporal autocorrelation of the multimodel mean temperature.
            Temporal autocorrelation was quantified via the spectral exponent, with more negative
            values indicating greater autocorrelation. (
            <span>a</span>) Map of the slope obtained by regressing the spectral exponent against time over
            10-year periods between 1870 and 2090. Negative (positive) values depicted in red
            (blue) indicate an increase (decrease) in autocorrelation due to an increase (decrease)
            in the dominance of lower frequencies. (
            <span>b</span>) Grey contours indicate statistically significant slopes (
            <span>p</span>-value &lt; 0.05). Side plots represent the percentage of geographical locations at each
            latitude or longitude characterized by an increase in the dominance of lower (red)
            or higher (blue) frequencies. (
            <span>c</span>) Map of model agreement for the slope of the spectral exponent. Agreement is defined
            as the proportion of models predicting the same sign for the slope as the multimodel
            mean, with areas of high agreement being depicted in darker shades of purple. Side
            plots represent the percentage of geographical locations where model agreement exceed
            50% at each latitude or longitude. (
            <span>d</span>) Map of model robustness for the slope of the spectral exponent. Robustness is defined
            as the proportion of models that agree with the multimodel mean on the sign and the
            statistical significance of the slope. Side plots represent the percentage of geographical
            locations where model robustness exceeds 50% at each latitude or longitude.
