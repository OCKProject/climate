         <p>Spatial autocorrelation of the multimodel mean temperature from 21 GCMs, averaged
            regionally over 10-year time windws. Spatial autocorrelation was quantified via the
            spatial range, which measures the geographical distance at which temperatures become
            decorrelated. (
            <span>a</span>) Changes in the spatial range for tropical geographical locations (23.5°S to 23.5°N).
            (
            <span>b</span>) Changes in the spatial range for temperate geographical locations (23.5°N to 66°N
            and 66°S to 23.5°S). Trend lines reflect linear model fits obtained via Generalized
            Least Squares and shaded regions represent 95% confidence bands. Solid lines indicate
            statistically significant trends, and separate line segments and colors are used to
            show the breakpoints in the time series.
