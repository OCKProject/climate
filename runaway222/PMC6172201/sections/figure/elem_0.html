         <p>Changes in the temporal and spatial autocorrelation of the multimodel mean temperature
            obtained via simple regression. (
            <span>a</span>) Temporal autocorrelation was quantified via the spectral exponent, with more negative
            values indicating greater autocorrelation. (
            <span>b</span>) Spatial autocorrelation was quantified via the spatial range, which measures the
            geographical distance at which temperatures become decorrelated. Trend lines reflect
            linear model fits obtained via Generalized Least Squares and shaded regions represent
            95% confidence bands. Solid lines indicate statistically significant trends and separate
            line segments and colors are used to show the breakpoints in the time series. The
            multimodel mean was computed using 21 GCMs projections and averaged globally over
            10-year time windows.
