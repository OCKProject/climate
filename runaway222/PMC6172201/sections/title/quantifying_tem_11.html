      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temporal autocorrelation of daily temperature from each model was determined by
         calculating the spectral exponent. Daily temperature over the entire time period of
         the model was linearly interpolated at each geographical location to fill in the gaps
         for models with missing values due to leap years. The interpolated temperature values
         were then linearly detrended prior to analysis by extracting the residuals from a
         simple regression relating daily temperature to time at each geographical location
         over the entire time series. Spectral analysis was then conducted using periodograms
         computed via fast Fourier transforms in order to determine the variability (power)
         associated with each frequency in the interpolated and linearly detrended temperature
         time series
         <span><a>37</a></span>. The slope of the linear regression relating the log-transformed power to the log-transformed
         frequency was used to calculate the spectral exponent
         <span><a>8</a>,
            <a>9</a>,
            <a>33</a></span>. More negative values of the slope indicate greater temporal autocorrelation (i.e.,
         greater “memory”), with most of the variation in the time series being driven by low
         frequencies.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the robustness of our results to seasonal variability, we also performed
         spectral analysis on the seasonally detrended data. To do so, we computed the within-year
         temperature profile at each geographical location by averaging daily temperatures
         across the entire time series. We then subtracted the average within-year temperature
         profile from the daily temperatures at each corresponding geographical location to
         obtain the seasonally detrended data
         <span><a>10</a></span>. Although there were some predictable quantitative differences between the spectral
         analysis results obtained from the seasonally detrended vs. linearly detrended data,
         which we discussed at length in the results section, the overall qualitative trends
         remained largely the same.
