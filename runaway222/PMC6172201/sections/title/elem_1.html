         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spectral exponent of the global temperature obtained from the climate multimodel
            mean becomes more negative over time (“reddening”) indicating increased temporal autocorrelation
            (Fig. 
            <a>1</a>). This temporal trend in the multimodel mean holds in terms of its statistical significance
            (
            <span>p</span>-value &lt; 0.05; Table 
            <a>1</a>) and sign (Table 
            <a>2</a>) across multiple time windows ranging from 5 to 10 years. Multiple individual climate
            models predict a similar increase in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature over
            time, yielding relatively high model agreement across time windows (Table 
            <a>2</a>). However, model robustness remains relatively low due to disagreements over the
            significance of the temporal trend (Table 
            <a>2</a>). There was no evidence of a breakpoint in the spectral exponent across time windows,
            indicating a constant rate of increase in temporal autocorrelation over time.

                     obtained via simple regression. (
                     <span>a</span>) Temporal autocorrelation was quantified via the spectral exponent, with more negative
                     values indicating greater autocorrelation. (

                     geographical distance at which temperatures become decorrelated. Trend lines reflect
                     linear model fits obtained via Generalized Least Squares and shaded regions represent
                     95% confidence bands. Solid lines indicate statistically significant trends and separate
                     line segments and colors are used to show the breakpoints in the time series. The
                     multimodel mean was computed using 21 GCMs projections and averaged globally over
                     10-year time windows.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the temporal autocorrelation in temperature increases at the global scale,
            there is significant geographical variation in both the sign and the strength of the
            trend (Fig. 
            <a>2</a>). Temporal autocorrelation in temperature increases most on land in northwestern
            North America, central South America, northwestern Eurasia, and North and central
            Africa (Fig. 
            <a>2a,b</a>). Temporal autocorrelation also increases in the ocean, mostly in the central and
            southern Atlantic Ocean, the southern Indian Ocean, the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific
            Ocean. However, temporal autocorrelation decreases almost uniformly across the entire
            Southern Ocean and West Africa (Fig. 
            <a>2a,b</a>). Overall, these temporal trends in autocorrelation lead to changes of up to 0.2
            units in the spectral exponent from 1870 to 2099 (Fig. 
            <a>S1</a>).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are no consistent differences in the percentage of geographical locations exhibiting
            increased vs. decreased temporal autocorrelation of temperature across longitudes.
            However, there are strong latitudinal patterns, with autocorrelation decreasing most
            between 70 S and 40 S due to the influence of the Southern Ocean. Autocorrelation
            increases most in temperate regions due to the effects of both land and sea. In general,
            model agreement is relatively high across most of the globe, with the notable exceptions
            of parts of Antarctica and the north Atlantic (Fig. 
            <a>2c</a>). Model robustness is notably the highest in the Southern Ocean (Fig. 
            <a>2d</a>). However, robustness is below 50% at other latitudes despite high agreement, which
            indicates that while individual GCMs are consistent in the trend, there is disagreement
            about the significance of the trend. Although there is no meaningful change in model
            agreement and robustness across longitudes, model agreement and robustness vary latitudinally
            reaching lower values around the South Pole, the equator and the North Pole.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to note that these results are based on the linearly detrended data,
            which retain seasonal temperature cycles. To determine the robustness of our results
            to seasonality, we conducted the same analyses on seasonally detrended data (Fig. 
            <a>S2</a>). The results from the seasonally detrended data show an almost universal increase
            in temporal autocorrelation of temperature across the globe, particularly in the Pacific
            Ocean, the northern Atlantic Ocean, western North America, South America, western
            Africa and Australia (Fig. 
            <a>S2</a>). Overall, the predicted trends in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature are
            stronger and more spatially-uniform when seasonal temperature cycles are removed.
            This is because seasonal (annual) temperature fluctuations are characterized by high
            power and occur at relatively low frequencies when using multi-year time windows.
            Hence, when regressing (log) power against (log) frequency, annual fluctuations in
            temperature have high statistical leverage on the slope estimate used to quantify
            the spectral exponent. Removing seasonality, which remains relatively constant over
            time and has high leverage on the spectral exponent estimate, thus facilitates the
            detection of temporal trends in autocorrelation due to changes in temperature fluctuations
            occurring at non-annual frequencies. One can thus think of the trends obtained using
            the linearly detrended data as a conservative estimate of the expected changes in
            the temporal autocorrelation of temperature and those obtained using the seasonally
            detrended data as anti-conservative.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial autocorrelation in the global multimodel mean temperature measured via the
            spatial range does not increase significantly over time (Fig. 
            <a>1</a>). Although the slope relating the spatial range to time is consistently positive
            across all time windows, it is never significant (Table 
            <a>1</a>). Among individual climate models, the majority show an increase in the spatial range
            over time across all time windows, and the trend is robust across 30–60% of individual
            climate models depending on the time window (Table 
            <a>2</a>). Despite the lack of a significant relationship at the global scale, piecewise regression
            shows that across all time windows, there is a breakpoint in the regression of the
            spatial range against time around year 2030 after which the trend becomes universally
            significant and positive (Table 
            <a>2</a>). After the second breakpoint, robustness of the trend in spatial range also increases
            across all time windows (Table 
            <a>2</a>). Hence, there is evidence that the spatial autocorrelation of temperature at the
            global scale is increasing over time after year 2030.

            the trend in both temperate and tropical regions (Table

            regions (Table

            in the tropics, it is increasing at the same rate in both regions (Table

            is around year 2025 (Fig.
