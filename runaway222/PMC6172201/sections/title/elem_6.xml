 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite substantial variability across the 21 climate models examined, the multimodel mean showed consistent, statistically significant increases in spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature at global and regional scales under climate change. Breakpoint analysis of the spatial range of temperature data over time indicated that there was a threshold response in spatial autocorrelation around year 2030 globally and around year 1950 in temperate regions. Furthermore, robustness of the increasing trend and agreement between individual models increased after the breakpoint for spatial autocorrelation globally. Overall, this suggests that the spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature are expected to increase under climate change, particularly during the second half of the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century.

   </span>, but inconsistent with one previous study showing a reduction in the temporal autocorrelation of global temperature from weather station data between 1910 and 1990
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
   </span>. This discrepancy is likely due to differences in the nature (observations vs. models), spatial resolution and spatiotemporal extent of the temperature records.
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For instance, GCMs are simulated at relatively coarse resolutions, are global in scale, longer term, and do not include all of the stochastic factors that influence temperature across temporal and spatial scales. Hence, GCM projections may exhibit an upward bias in the predicted temporal and spatial autocorrelation of temperature relative to observational studies due to the “spatiotemporal smoothing effect” created by their coarser resolution and limited sources of local stochasticity. Although these differences can make comparisons between raw predictions and observations difficult without some form of statistical correction, they should not affect the likelihood of detecting spatiotemporal trends in temperature autocorrelation within GCMs since these trends are measured by making internal comparisons of model predictions.</p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We suggest that discrepancies between model projections and observational data are more likely due to the large regional differences in the temporal autocorrelation trends seen in both observational studies and GCM projections (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). For instance, the analysis of weather data from 1910 to 1990 cited earlier revealed significant regional differences in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature, with Asia and Australia experiencing a significant increase over time, but South America and North America experiencing a significant decrease
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
   </span>. Hence, differences in the spatial extent and resolution of observational studies vs. GCM projections could easily lead to conflicting conclusions due to the high degree of regional variation in these trends. Overall, understanding how the nature, resolution and spatiotemporal extent of temperature records interact to influence this discrepancy will be critical in order to more accurately predict the impact of climate change across temporal and spatial scales. Our GCM results echo those of Dillon 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
   </span> and Wang and Dillon
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
   </span>, who showed an increase in temporal autocorrelation of historical (observed) temperature data from 1961 to 1990 and an increase in spatial homogeneity in weather data between 1960 and 1991. This agreement between our results based on GCM projections and those of Dillon based on observations is consistent with the notion that differences in the spatial resolution and the spatiotemporal extent rather than the nature of the temperature records may have the greatest impact on estimates of temporal and spatial autocorrelation.
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, GCM projections suggest that the temporal autocorrelation of temperature will tend to increase more on land than in the sea, with increases occurring in Eurasia, South America, western North America and southeastern Asia, and decreases occurring mostly in the Southern Ocean. This is intriguing because previous studies have shown that the temporal autocorrelation of temperature tends to be lower on land than in the sea
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span> because heat transfer occurs over longer timescales in the ocean and thus results in greater system “memory”. Taken together, these results suggest that the disparities in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature between land and sea are predicted to decrease over time at the global scale under climate change.
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in the spatial autocorrelation of temperature in tropical vs. temperate regions are consistent with expectations from the physical characteristics of the regions. The significant difference between temperate and tropical regions in the mean scale of spatial autocorrelation (i.e., spatial range) is expected because the tropics are much smaller in area than the temperate regions. There is clear evidence of nonlinearity in the spatial data analyzed, particularly in the spatial range of global temperature. Our exploration of the nonlinearities in the global trends via piecewise regression revealed the presence of a quasi-universal breakpoint around the year 2030 across climate models, after which the spatial autocorrelation of temperature increased significantly over time. This lends support for the existence of a “tipping point” in the effect of carbon emissions on the spatial structure of temperature, with time acting as a proxy
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
   </span>. Although the tipping point in the spatial range occurred around year 2030 in tropical regions, our analyses suggest that in temperate regions the threshold occurred during the 20
   <span class="sup">th</span> century, around the time that the historical effects of anthropogenic climate change became apparent
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span>. Overall, this suggests that climate change may thus increase the spatial autocorrelation of temperature at an accelerating rate over the course of the 21
   <span class="sup">st</span> century.

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under climate change, our results show that the spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature are expected to increase at a potentially accelerating pace over time. This will promote the homogenization of the world, with equator-like conditions spreading geographically to higher latitudes and leading to concomitant changes in the composition of ecological communities

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span>. This is expected to lead to greater spatial and temporal homogeneity (i.e., due to increased spatial and temporal autocorrelation in temperature).
  </p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ecological consequences of increased homogeneity in the environment have been documented in a number of studies. Increased spatial and temporal homogeneity in environmental variables has been linked to increased extinction risk in populations

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
   </span>. Increased temporal autocorrelation has been shown to promote extinction risk in red-shifted, slow growing species that do not exhibit overcompensatory density-dependence or high sensitivity to environmental stochasticity

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
   </span>. Indeed, under prolonged exposure to poor environmental conditions, these slow-growing and red-shifted species will see their numbers dwindle and will thus be unable to recover fast enough when conditions improve. Hence, increasing the extent of poor environmental conditions by increasing temporal autocorrelation will erode temporal refugia and prevent temporal rescue effects. Since most animal populations appear to be red-shifted

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
   </span>, extinction risk is likely to rise due to the increased temporal autocorrelation of temperature under climate change.
  </p>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, greater spatial homogeneity in environmental variables such as temperature may disrupt spatial rescue effects by destroying the spatial heterogeneity needed in order for source-sink dynamics to occur

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>. Overall, the simultaneous erosion of temporal and spatial refugia under climate change has the potential to promote extinction risk. Mitigating the impacts of these trends in the spatiotemporal properties of temperature is thus critical in order ensure the persistence of complex and interconnected ecosystems in an increasingly homogeneous world.
