      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although classical studies have focused almost exclusively on determining the ecological
         impacts of shifting average environmental conditions, there is growing recognition
         that statistical properties beyond the mean can play an equally important role in
         shaping the structure and functioning of ecosystems under climate change
         <span><a>1</a>–
            <a>3</a></span>. For instance, high variance in an environmental variable can destabilize populations
         by inducing greater fluctuations in their abundance over time and thus increase the
         risk of stochastic extinction
         <span><a>1</a>,
            <a>2</a>,
            <a>4</a></span>. Even when environmental variance is too weak to promote extinction risk, it can
         have a more insidious effect on ecological systems due to nonlinear averaging. Specifically,
         if a population responds nonlinearly to environmental conditions, then changes in
         the temporal or spatial properties of the environment (e.g., temporal or spatial variance)
         can alter the mean ecological response even if the mean environmental conditions remain
         constant, and the strength of this effect will depend on the degree of nonlinearity
         in the functional response of the population
         <span><a>1</a>,
            <a>5</a>,
            <a>6</a></span>. This implies that the variance of an environmental variable has consequences for
         ecological systems that cannot be inferred from their average values alone
         <span><a>1</a></span>. Indeed, studies have shown that variation in environmental variables impacts natural
         populations and consideration of variance can be required for successful model predictions
         <span><a>5</a></span>. Hence, in order to determine how climate change will impact ecological systems,
         it is at least as important to study variation in temperature and other critical environmental
         variables as it is to study their mean.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to variance, it is also crucial to consider the temporal structure or
         autocorrelation of environmental variables such as temperature, as the variation in
         environmental variables is predicted to change over time
         <span><a>6</a></span>. Studies of historical temperatures have shown an increase in their temporal autocorrelation
         from 1961 to 1990
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>3</a></span>, and these trends are expected to increase under climate change
         <span><a>5</a>,
            <a>7</a></span>. Quantifying such changes in the temporal autocorrelation of environmental variables
         is critical in order to accurately predict the dynamics and persistence of ecological
         systems under climate change. Indeed, increased temporal autocorrelation in climate
         variables has been linked to lower persistence of model and natural populations
         <span><a>3</a>,
            <a>8</a></span>. In general, theory predicts that a reddening of environmental time series (an increase
         in its temporal autocorrelation) can extend the duration of poor conditions and thus
         promote extinction risk by eroding temporal refugia or rescue effects
         <span><a>9</a>,
            <a>10</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combination of increased temporal variance and autocorrelation in the environment
         could have even more dire consequences for ecological systems. For example, Dillon
         
         <span>et al</span>. showed that adding power to lower frequencies of temperature time series increased
         their temporal variance and autocorrelation, and thus the overall incidence and persistence
         of long-term heat waves and cold snaps
         <span><a>2</a></span>. Such increased intensity (temporal variance) and duration (temporal autocorrelation)
         of harsh conditions can promote extinction risk. Hence, the destabilizing effect of
         increased temporal environmental variability can be amplified by an increase in its
         autocorrelation. Overall, this suggests that increased temporal variance and autocorrelation
         of environmental conditions may interact synergistically to destabilize ecological
         systems.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The link between spatial autocorrelation of the environment and population dynamics
         has also been well established, with theoretical and empirical studies showing that
         spatiotemporally correlated or synchronized fluctuations in environmental conditions
         can give rise to synchronized fluctuations in ecological populations (i.e., the Moran
         effect
         <span><a>11</a>,
            <a>12</a></span>). For instance, increased spatial synchrony in air temperature due to changes in
         basin-scale climate forcing (North Atlantic Oscillation) gave rise to increased synchrony
         in Greenland animal populations
         <span><a>1</a>,
            <a>3</a>,
            <a>6</a>,
            <a>13</a>,
            <a>14</a></span>. In general, increased spatial autocorrelation in the environment is expected to
         promote the scale and the magnitude of synchronized fluctuations in populations and
         thus reduce the spatial heterogeneity of ecological systems. In doing so, increased
         spatial environmental autocorrelation can thus promote extinction risk at local and
         regional scales by eliminating the potential for spatial rescue effects between interconnected
         but increasingly synchronized populations
         <span><a>15</a>–
            <a>18</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the negative effects of spatial and temporal autocorrelation have been established
         independently in model and natural systems, little is known about how these two phenomena
         will interact under climate change. Overall, theory suggests that increased spatial
         and temporal autocorrelation of environmental factors like temperature are expected
         to interact synergistically to destabilize ecological communities by disrupting both
         temporal and spatial rescue effects
         <span><a>4</a></span>. To determine the potential for such synergistic interactions, we characterized spatial
         and temporal autocorrelation in temperature from climate model projections. This was
         accomplished by analyzing temperature data from 1871 to 2099 using spectral analysis
         to measure temporal autocorrelation by calculating the spectral exponent and estimating
         spatial autocorrelation by determining the lag distance at which temperature becomes
         spatially uncorrelated (i.e., the spatial range).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that temporal and spatial autocorrelation increased over time in individual
         climate models and the multimodel mean. However, there was considerable regional variation
         in temporal autocorrelation, with western North America, central South America, northwestern
         Eurasia and North Africa seeing significant increases in temporal autocorrelation,
         but West Africa and the Southern Ocean seeing significant decreases in temporal autocorrelation.
         Piecewise regression analyses showed consistent breakpoints in spatial trends in autocorrelation
         around the year 2030 globally, and spatial trends in autocorrelation were statistically
         significant after the breakpoint across time windows of different sizes. Our results
         suggest that climate change is likely to increase the spatial and temporal homogeneity
         of temperature, which may negatively impact connectivity between source and sink populations
         and thus reduce the persistence of ecological communities.
