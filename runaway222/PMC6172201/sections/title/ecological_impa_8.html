      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under climate change, our results show that the spatial and temporal autocorrelation
         of temperature are expected to increase at a potentially accelerating pace over time.
         This will promote the homogenization of the world, with equator-like conditions spreading
         geographically to higher latitudes and leading to concomitant changes in the composition
         of ecological communities
         <span><a>29</a>â€“
            <a>31</a></span>. This is expected to lead to greater spatial and temporal homogeneity (i.e., due
         to increased spatial and temporal autocorrelation in temperature).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ecological consequences of increased homogeneity in the environment have been
         documented in a number of studies. Increased spatial and temporal homogeneity in environmental
         variables has been linked to increased extinction risk in populations
         <span><a>15</a>,
            <a>17</a>,
            <a>32</a></span>. Increased temporal autocorrelation has been shown to promote extinction risk in
         red-shifted, slow growing species that do not exhibit overcompensatory density-dependence
         or high sensitivity to environmental stochasticity
         <span><a>8</a>,
            <a>9</a></span>. Indeed, under prolonged exposure to poor environmental conditions, these slow-growing
         and red-shifted species will see their numbers dwindle and will thus be unable to
         recover fast enough when conditions improve. Hence, increasing the extent of poor
         environmental conditions by increasing temporal autocorrelation will erode temporal
         refugia and prevent temporal rescue effects. Since most animal populations appear
         to be red-shifted
         <span><a>33</a>,
            <a>34</a></span>, extinction risk is likely to rise due to the increased temporal autocorrelation
         of temperature under climate change.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, greater spatial homogeneity in environmental variables such as temperature
         may disrupt spatial rescue effects by destroying the spatial heterogeneity needed
         in order for source-sink dynamics to occur
         <span><a>16</a>,
            <a>35</a></span>. Overall, the simultaneous erosion of temporal and spatial refugia under climate
         change has the potential to promote extinction risk. Mitigating the impacts of these
         trends in the spatiotemporal properties of temperature is thus critical in order ensure
         the persistence of complex and interconnected ecosystems in an increasingly homogeneous
         world.
