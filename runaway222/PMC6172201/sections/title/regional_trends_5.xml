 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial autocorrelation in temperature is increasing significantly in temperate (
  <span class="italic">p</span>-value &lt; 0.001) and tropical (
  <span class="italic">p</span>-value &lt; 0.05) regions over time in the climate multimodel mean (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Across individual climate models, there is strong agreement on the direction of the trend in both temperate and tropical regions (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Additionally, the trend is highly robust (&gt;90% of individual models) in temperate regions (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Although spatial autocorrelation is significantly higher in temperate regions than in the tropics, it is increasing at the same rate in both regions (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). The breakpoint in the regression of spatial range against time in the multimodel mean for temperate regions is around 1950, while the breakpoint in tropical regions is around year 2025 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>).

     <span class="bold">b</span>) Changes in the spatial range for temperate geographical locations (23.5°N to 66°N and 66°S to 23.5°S). Trend lines reflect linear model fits obtained via Generalized Least Squares and shaded regions represent 95% confidence bands. Solid lines indicate statistically significant trends, and separate line segments and colors are used to show the breakpoints in the time series.
