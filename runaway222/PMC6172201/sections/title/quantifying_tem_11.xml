 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temporal autocorrelation of daily temperature from each model was determined by calculating the spectral exponent. Daily temperature over the entire time period of the model was linearly interpolated at each geographical location to fill in the gaps for models with missing values due to leap years. The interpolated temperature values were then linearly detrended prior to analysis by extracting the residuals from a simple regression relating daily temperature to time at each geographical location over the entire time series. Spectral analysis was then conducted using periodograms computed via fast Fourier transforms in order to determine the variability (power) associated with each frequency in the interpolated and linearly detrended temperature time series

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. More negative values of the slope indicate greater temporal autocorrelation (i.e., greater “memory”), with most of the variation in the time series being driven by low frequencies.

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the robustness of our results to seasonal variability, we also performed spectral analysis on the seasonally detrended data. To do so, we computed the within-year temperature profile at each geographical location by averaging daily temperatures across the entire time series. We then subtracted the average within-year temperature profile from the daily temperatures at each corresponding geographical location to obtain the seasonally detrended data

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Although there were some predictable quantitative differences between the spectral analysis results obtained from the seasonally detrended vs. linearly detrended data, which we discussed at length in the results section, the overall qualitative trends remained largely the same.
