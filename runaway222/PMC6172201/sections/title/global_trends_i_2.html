      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spectral exponent of the global temperature obtained from the climate multimodel
         mean becomes more negative over time (“reddening”) indicating increased temporal autocorrelation
         (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). This temporal trend in the multimodel mean holds in terms of its statistical significance
         (
         <span>p</span>-value &lt; 0.05; Table 
         <a>1</a>) and sign (Table 
         <a>2</a>) across multiple time windows ranging from 5 to 10 years. Multiple individual climate
         models predict a similar increase in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature over
         time, yielding relatively high model agreement across time windows (Table 
         <a>2</a>). However, model robustness remains relatively low due to disagreements over the
         significance of the temporal trend (Table 
         <a>2</a>). There was no evidence of a breakpoint in the spectral exponent across time windows,
         indicating a constant rate of increase in temporal autocorrelation over time.

               <p>Changes in the temporal and spatial autocorrelation of the multimodel mean temperature
                  obtained via simple regression. (
                  <span>a</span>) Temporal autocorrelation was quantified via the spectral exponent, with more negative
                  values indicating greater autocorrelation. (
                  <span>b</span>) Spatial autocorrelation was quantified via the spatial range, which measures the
                  geographical distance at which temperatures become decorrelated. Trend lines reflect
                  linear model fits obtained via Generalized Least Squares and shaded regions represent
                  95% confidence bands. Solid lines indicate statistically significant trends and separate
                  line segments and colors are used to show the breakpoints in the time series. The
                  multimodel mean was computed using 21 GCMs projections and averaged globally over
                  10-year time windows.
