      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the temporal autocorrelation in temperature increases at the global scale,
         there is significant geographical variation in both the sign and the strength of the
         trend (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). Temporal autocorrelation in temperature increases most on land in northwestern
         North America, central South America, northwestern Eurasia, and North and central
         Africa (Fig. 
         <a>2a,b</a>). Temporal autocorrelation also increases in the ocean, mostly in the central and
         southern Atlantic Ocean, the southern Indian Ocean, the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific
         Ocean. However, temporal autocorrelation decreases almost uniformly across the entire
         Southern Ocean and West Africa (Fig. 
         <a>2a,b</a>). Overall, these temporal trends in autocorrelation lead to changes of up to 0.2
         units in the spectral exponent from 1870 to 2099 (Fig. 
         <a>S1</a>).

                  Temporal autocorrelation was quantified via the spectral exponent, with more negative
                  values indicating greater autocorrelation. (

                  10-year periods between 1870 and 2090. Negative (positive) values depicted in red
                  (blue) indicate an increase (decrease) in autocorrelation due to an increase (decrease)
                  in the dominance of lower frequencies. (

                  locations where model robustness exceeds 50% at each latitude or longitude.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are no consistent differences in the percentage of geographical locations exhibiting
         increased vs. decreased temporal autocorrelation of temperature across longitudes.
         However, there are strong latitudinal patterns, with autocorrelation decreasing most
         between 70 S and 40 S due to the influence of the Southern Ocean. Autocorrelation
         increases most in temperate regions due to the effects of both land and sea. In general,
         model agreement is relatively high across most of the globe, with the notable exceptions
         of parts of Antarctica and the north Atlantic (Fig. 
         <a>2c</a>). Model robustness is notably the highest in the Southern Ocean (Fig. 
         <a>2d</a>). However, robustness is below 50% at other latitudes despite high agreement, which
         indicates that while individual GCMs are consistent in the trend, there is disagreement
         about the significance of the trend. Although there is no meaningful change in model
         agreement and robustness across longitudes, model agreement and robustness vary latitudinally
         reaching lower values around the South Pole, the equator and the North Pole.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to note that these results are based on the linearly detrended data,
         which retain seasonal temperature cycles. To determine the robustness of our results
         to seasonality, we conducted the same analyses on seasonally detrended data (Fig. 
         <a>S2</a>). The results from the seasonally detrended data show an almost universal increase
         in temporal autocorrelation of temperature across the globe, particularly in the Pacific
         Ocean, the northern Atlantic Ocean, western North America, South America, western
         Africa and Australia (Fig. 
         <a>S2</a>). Overall, the predicted trends in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature are
         stronger and more spatially-uniform when seasonal temperature cycles are removed.
         This is because seasonal (annual) temperature fluctuations are characterized by high
         power and occur at relatively low frequencies when using multi-year time windows.
         Hence, when regressing (log) power against (log) frequency, annual fluctuations in
         temperature have high statistical leverage on the slope estimate used to quantify
         the spectral exponent. Removing seasonality, which remains relatively constant over
         time and has high leverage on the spectral exponent estimate, thus facilitates the
         detection of temporal trends in autocorrelation due to changes in temperature fluctuations
         occurring at non-annual frequencies. One can thus think of the trends obtained using
         the linearly detrended data as a conservative estimate of the expected changes in
         the temporal autocorrelation of temperature and those obtained using the seasonally
         detrended data as anti-conservative.
