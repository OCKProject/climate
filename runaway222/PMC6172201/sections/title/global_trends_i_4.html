      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial autocorrelation in the global multimodel mean temperature measured via the
         spatial range does not increase significantly over time (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). Although the slope relating the spatial range to time is consistently positive
         across all time windows, it is never significant (Table 
         <a>1</a>). Among individual climate models, the majority show an increase in the spatial range
         over time across all time windows, and the trend is robust across 30–60% of individual
         climate models depending on the time window (Table 
         <a>2</a>). Despite the lack of a significant relationship at the global scale, piecewise regression
         shows that across all time windows, there is a breakpoint in the regression of the
         spatial range against time around year 2030 after which the trend becomes universally
         significant and positive (Table 
         <a>2</a>). After the second breakpoint, robustness of the trend in spatial range also increases
         across all time windows (Table 
         <a>2</a>). Hence, there is evidence that the spatial autocorrelation of temperature at the
         global scale is increasing over time after year 2030.
