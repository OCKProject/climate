  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily surface (air) temperature (variable ‘tas’) between 1871 and 2099 was extracted from 21 General Circulation Model (GCM) under the ‘business-as-usual’ representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
   </span>; for list of General Circulation Models see Appendix). These 21 GCMs were selected because they included predictions of surface (air) temperature variable at daily temporal scales. All models were standardized to a common 1° × 1° spatial grid and a standard calendar that accounted for leap years. Temperature values above 60 °C were removed as outliers from individual models prior to conducting our analyses.

  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temporal autocorrelation of daily temperature from each model was determined by calculating the spectral exponent. Daily temperature over the entire time period of the model was linearly interpolated at each geographical location to fill in the gaps for models with missing values due to leap years. The interpolated temperature values were then linearly detrended prior to analysis by extracting the residuals from a simple regression relating daily temperature to time at each geographical location over the entire time series. Spectral analysis was then conducted using periodograms computed via fast Fourier transforms in order to determine the variability (power) associated with each frequency in the interpolated and linearly detrended temperature time series
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span>. The slope of the linear regression relating the log-transformed power to the log-transformed frequency was used to calculate the spectral exponent

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span>. More negative values of the slope indicate greater temporal autocorrelation (i.e., greater “memory”), with most of the variation in the time series being driven by low frequencies.
  </p>
  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the robustness of our results to seasonal variability, we also performed spectral analysis on the seasonally detrended data. To do so, we computed the within-year temperature profile at each geographical location by averaging daily temperatures across the entire time series. We then subtracted the average within-year temperature profile from the daily temperatures at each corresponding geographical location to obtain the seasonally detrended data
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
   </span>. Although there were some predictable quantitative differences between the spectral analysis results obtained from the seasonally detrended vs. linearly detrended data, which we discussed at length in the results section, the overall qualitative trends remained largely the same.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantifying spatial autocorrelation</div>
  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial autocorrelation of temperature over each time period was determined using (semi)variograms to estimate the spatial range, which corresponds to the lag distance (measured in kilometers) at which the semivariance of temperature begins to plateau. By quantifying the geographical distance at which temperatures become uncorrelated, the spatial range can thus be used to represent the spatial scale of autocorrelation. The spatial range was estimated by fitting a Gaussian model to the empirical variogram

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
   </span>. We also computed the spatial range of temperature in the tropics (23.5°S to 23.5°N) vs. temperate regions (66°S to 23.5°S and 23.5°N to 66°N) and regressed them against time in order to determine whether there were any regional differences in the temporal trends of spatial autocorrelation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantifying spatial and temporal trends</div>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A Generalized Least Squares (GLS) analysis was used to regress the spectral exponent (temporal autocorrelation) and spatial range (spatial autocorrelation) against time for each of the 21 GCM models as well as the multimodel mean. GLS was used in order to account for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of residuals in the spatial and temporal temperature data. To assess model agreement and robustness of trends, we calculated respectively the proportion of models that agreed on the direction of the trend and the proportion of models that both agreed on the direction of trend and were statistically significant (

   </span>. We conducted the spatial and temporal analyses on daily temperature in 10-year time windows between 1871 and 2099 for the global dataset. Each metric of autocorrelation, the spectral exponent or spatial range, was calculated for each time window, and GLS was used to regress the autocorrelation values for each time window against time. We also conducted an extensive sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of all of our results to different time windows ranging in size from 5 to 10 years (see Tables
