      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite substantial variability across the 21 climate models examined, the multimodel
         mean showed consistent, statistically significant increases in spatial and temporal
         autocorrelation of temperature at global and regional scales under climate change.
         Breakpoint analysis of the spatial range of temperature data over time indicated that
         there was a threshold response in spatial autocorrelation around year 2030 globally
         and around year 1950 in temperate regions. Furthermore, robustness of the increasing
         trend and agreement between individual models increased after the breakpoint for spatial
         autocorrelation globally. Overall, this suggests that the spatial and temporal autocorrelation
         of temperature are expected to increase under climate change, particularly during
         the second half of the 21
         <span>st</span> century.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results are consistent with other research showing an increase in spatial and
            temporal autocorrelation of temperature based on weather station data from the second
            half of the 20
            <span>th</span> century
            <span><a>2</a>,
               <a>19</a></span>, but inconsistent with one previous study showing a reduction in the temporal autocorrelation
            of global temperature from weather station data between 1910 and 1990
            <span><a>8</a></span>. This discrepancy is likely due to differences in the nature (observations vs. models),
            spatial resolution and spatiotemporal extent of the temperature records.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For instance, GCMs are simulated at relatively coarse resolutions, are global in scale,
            longer term, and do not include all of the stochastic factors that influence temperature
            across temporal and spatial scales. Hence, GCM projections may exhibit an upward bias
            in the predicted temporal and spatial autocorrelation of temperature relative to observational
            studies due to the “spatiotemporal smoothing effect” created by their coarser resolution
            and limited sources of local stochasticity. Although these differences can make comparisons
            between raw predictions and observations difficult without some form of statistical
            correction, they should not affect the likelihood of detecting spatiotemporal trends
            in temperature autocorrelation within GCMs since these trends are measured by making
            internal comparisons of model predictions.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We suggest that discrepancies between model projections and observational data are
            more likely due to the large regional differences in the temporal autocorrelation
            trends seen in both observational studies and GCM projections (Fig. 
            <a>2</a>). For instance, the analysis of weather data from 1910 to 1990 cited earlier revealed
            significant regional differences in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature, with
            Asia and Australia experiencing a significant increase over time, but South America
            and North America experiencing a significant decrease
            <span><a>8</a></span>. Hence, differences in the spatial extent and resolution of observational studies
            vs. GCM projections could easily lead to conflicting conclusions due to the high degree
            of regional variation in these trends. Overall, understanding how the nature, resolution
            and spatiotemporal extent of temperature records interact to influence this discrepancy
            will be critical in order to more accurately predict the impact of climate change
            across temporal and spatial scales. Our GCM results echo those of Dillon 
            <span>et al</span>.
            <span><a>2</a></span> and Wang and Dillon
            <span><a>19</a></span>, who showed an increase in temporal autocorrelation of historical (observed) temperature
            data from 1961 to 1990 and an increase in spatial homogeneity in weather data between
            1960 and 1991. This agreement between our results based on GCM projections and those
            of Dillon based on observations is consistent with the notion that differences in
            the spatial resolution and the spatiotemporal extent rather than the nature of the
            temperature records may have the greatest impact on estimates of temporal and spatial
            autocorrelation.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, GCM projections suggest that the temporal autocorrelation of temperature
            will tend to increase more on land than in the sea, with increases occurring in Eurasia,
            South America, western North America and southeastern Asia, and decreases occurring
            mostly in the Southern Ocean. This is intriguing because previous studies have shown
            that the temporal autocorrelation of temperature tends to be lower on land than in
            the sea
            <span><a>10</a>,
               <a>20</a>,
               <a>21</a></span> because heat transfer occurs over longer timescales in the ocean and thus results
            in greater system “memory”. Taken together, these results suggest that the disparities
            in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature between land and sea are predicted
            to decrease over time at the global scale under climate change.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in the spatial autocorrelation of temperature in tropical vs. temperate
            regions are consistent with expectations from the physical characteristics of the
            regions. The significant difference between temperate and tropical regions in the
            mean scale of spatial autocorrelation (i.e., spatial range) is expected because the
            tropics are much smaller in area than the temperate regions. There is clear evidence
            of nonlinearity in the spatial data analyzed, particularly in the spatial range of
            global temperature. Our exploration of the nonlinearities in the global trends via
            piecewise regression revealed the presence of a quasi-universal breakpoint around
            the year 2030 across climate models, after which the spatial autocorrelation of temperature
            increased significantly over time. This lends support for the existence of a “tipping
            point” in the effect of carbon emissions on the spatial structure of temperature,
            with time acting as a proxy
            <span><a>22</a>–
               <a>27</a></span>. Although the tipping point in the spatial range occurred around year 2030 in tropical
            regions, our analyses suggest that in temperate regions the threshold occurred during
            the 20
            <span>th</span> century, around the time that the historical effects of anthropogenic climate change
            became apparent
            <span><a>28</a></span>. Overall, this suggests that climate change may thus increase the spatial autocorrelation
            of temperature at an accelerating rate over the course of the 21
            <span>st</span> century.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under climate change, our results show that the spatial and temporal autocorrelation
            of temperature are expected to increase at a potentially accelerating pace over time.
            This will promote the homogenization of the world, with equator-like conditions spreading
            geographically to higher latitudes and leading to concomitant changes in the composition
            of ecological communities
            <span><a>29</a>–
               <a>31</a></span>. This is expected to lead to greater spatial and temporal homogeneity (i.e., due
            to increased spatial and temporal autocorrelation in temperature).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ecological consequences of increased homogeneity in the environment have been
            documented in a number of studies. Increased spatial and temporal homogeneity in environmental
            variables has been linked to increased extinction risk in populations
            <span><a>15</a>,
               <a>17</a>,
               <a>32</a></span>. Increased temporal autocorrelation has been shown to promote extinction risk in
            red-shifted, slow growing species that do not exhibit overcompensatory density-dependence
            or high sensitivity to environmental stochasticity
            <span><a>8</a>,
               <a>9</a></span>. Indeed, under prolonged exposure to poor environmental conditions, these slow-growing
            and red-shifted species will see their numbers dwindle and will thus be unable to
            recover fast enough when conditions improve. Hence, increasing the extent of poor
            environmental conditions by increasing temporal autocorrelation will erode temporal
            refugia and prevent temporal rescue effects. Since most animal populations appear
            to be red-shifted
            <span><a>33</a>,
               <a>34</a></span>, extinction risk is likely to rise due to the increased temporal autocorrelation
            of temperature under climate change.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, greater spatial homogeneity in environmental variables such as temperature
            may disrupt spatial rescue effects by destroying the spatial heterogeneity needed
            in order for source-sink dynamics to occur
            <span><a>16</a>,
               <a>35</a></span>. Overall, the simultaneous erosion of temporal and spatial refugia under climate
            change has the potential to promote extinction risk. Mitigating the impacts of these
            trends in the spatiotemporal properties of temperature is thus critical in order ensure
            the persistence of complex and interconnected ecosystems in an increasingly homogeneous
            world.
