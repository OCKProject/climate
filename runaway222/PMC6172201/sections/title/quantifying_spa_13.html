      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A Generalized Least Squares (GLS) analysis was used to regress the spectral exponent
         (temporal autocorrelation) and spatial range (spatial autocorrelation) against time
         for each of the 21 GCM models as well as the multimodel mean. GLS was used in order
         to account for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of residuals in the spatial
         and temporal temperature data. To assess model agreement and robustness of trends,
         we calculated respectively the proportion of models that agreed on the direction of
         the trend and the proportion of models that both agreed on the direction of trend
         and were statistically significant (
         <span>p</span>-value &lt; 0.05) as determined by the GLS fits
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>40</a></span>. We conducted the spatial and temporal analyses on daily temperature in 10-year time
         windows between 1871 and 2099 for the global dataset. Each metric of autocorrelation,
         the spectral exponent or spatial range, was calculated for each time window, and GLS
         was used to regress the autocorrelation values for each time window against time.
         We also conducted an extensive sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of
         all of our results to different time windows ranging in size from 5 to 10 years (see
         Tables 
         <a>1</a>–
         <a>3</a>).
