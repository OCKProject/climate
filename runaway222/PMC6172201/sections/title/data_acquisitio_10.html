      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily surface (air) temperature (variable ‘tas’) between 1871 and 2099 was extracted
         from 21 General Circulation Model (GCM) under the ‘business-as-usual’ representative
         concentration pathway (RCP8.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase
         5 (CMIP5
         <span><a>36</a></span>; for list of General Circulation Models see Appendix). These 21 GCMs were selected
         because they included predictions of surface (air) temperature variable at daily temporal
         scales. All models were standardized to a common 1° × 1° spatial grid and a standard
         calendar that accounted for leap years. Temperature values above 60 °C were removed
         as outliers from individual models prior to conducting our analyses.
