      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial autocorrelation in temperature is increasing significantly in temperate (
         <span>p</span>-value &lt; 0.001) and tropical (
         <span>p</span>-value &lt; 0.05) regions over time in the climate multimodel mean (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). Across individual climate models, there is strong agreement on the direction of
         the trend in both temperate and tropical regions (Table 
         <a>S2</a>). Additionally, the trend is highly robust (&gt;90% of individual models) in temperate
         regions (Table 
         <a>S2</a>). Although spatial autocorrelation is significantly higher in temperate regions than
         in the tropics, it is increasing at the same rate in both regions (Table 
         <a>S3</a>). The breakpoint in the regression of spatial range against time in the multimodel
         mean for temperate regions is around 1950, while the breakpoint in tropical regions
         is around year 2025 (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>).

               <p>Spatial autocorrelation of the multimodel mean temperature from 21 GCMs, averaged
                  regionally over 10-year time windws. Spatial autocorrelation was quantified via the
                  spatial range, which measures the geographical distance at which temperatures become
                  decorrelated. (

                  and 66°S to 23.5°S). Trend lines reflect linear model fits obtained via Generalized
                  Least Squares and shaded regions represent 95% confidence bands. Solid lines indicate
                  statistically significant trends, and separate line segments and colors are used to
                  show the breakpoints in the time series.
