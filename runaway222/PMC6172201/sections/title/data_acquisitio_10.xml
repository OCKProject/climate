  </span>; for list of General Circulation Models see Appendix). These 21 GCMs were selected because they included predictions of surface (air) temperature variable at daily temporal scales. All models were standardized to a common 1° × 1° spatial grid and a standard calendar that accounted for leap years. Temperature values above 60 °C were removed as outliers from individual models prior to conducting our analyses.
