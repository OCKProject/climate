 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 13 mosaics of PAs in the focal area potentially protect on average 53% (SD 29%) of the species, according to current projections (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215229.s005" href="#pone.0215229.s005">S4 Table</a>; the lowest values occurred at the most southern PAs [ESEC Rio Ronuro, 13% and IL Rikbaktsá, 15%]; and the highest values occurred at the centre [Carajás Mosaic, 82%] and western [Terra do Meio Mosaic, 98%] PAs). Under future scenarios, approximately 34% (SD 14%) of the current forecasted species in each PA will potentially not find suitable habitats (disregarding species turnover), and the projected species loss displayed distinct patterns depending on the trophic guild, scenario, and PA position and size (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses suggest that the majority of the northern and western parts of the focal area are climatically stable suitable habitats for FT species, indicating that suitable habitats coincided with six to seven of the seven scenarios (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215229.g005" href="#pone.0215229.g005">Fig 5</a>). Climatically stable grid cells which were considered suitable habitats for at least 20% of each trophic guild correspond to 297,500 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. Nearly half of this area is within PAs (164,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> [55%]), yet another significant part has native vegetation but unprotected (88,100 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> [30%]) or overlaps with degraded areas (45,400 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> [15%]; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215229.g005" href="#pone.0215229.g005">Fig 5</a>). Also, there is a drastic reduction in the stable area when considering a higher proportion of each trophic guild per grid cell, for instance, climatically stable cells that were considered suitable habitats for at least 30% of each trophic guild correspond to only 73,400 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (a decrease of about 75%) and there is no single cell that maintains at least 50% of each guild in most scenarios (

All the priority areas are plotted with currently existing Protected Areas (PAs) and deforestation layers. Graphs represents the amount of climatically stable suitable areas for different percentages of a minimum guild class (solid line); the amount of area overlapped with PAs (dashed green line) and overlapped with deforested area (dotted grey line).</p>
