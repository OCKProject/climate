 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change will impact the biodiversity across the globe [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref007">7</a>] and it is important to forecast the effects not only on range shifts but also on the functionalities [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref052">52</a>]. Through our SDMs we show that avian assemblage from SE Amazonia will be potentially strongly affected by climate change in the near future, even under the most optimistic scenario. As expected, species occupying different habitats will respond differently, but invariably frugivores will be more negatively affected. Considering only FT species, currently, the centre and western portion of SE Amazonia are potentially the richest areas, and future projections suggest a northern shift with an expressive depletion in SR. The OAV species have a disjunct distribution, where the occurrence core is in the “dry diagonal” (out of the scope of this work) and isolated patches of the Amazonia [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref053">53</a>]. As our study system includes a transition zone encompassing both environments (FT and OAV), the OAV species occur naturally at low numbers (&lt;30% in almost all areas) but potentially could reach 46% east of Marajó Island and 59% in patches at the central and northwestern portion of the focal area based on our current projections. Under the future scenarios, potential SR was predicted to increase due to a northward shift (from the core region, not shown) that becomes uniform along all of the focal area, maintaining its maximum value (~55%) at the northwestern portion.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to our results, the majority of species were projected to show a range loss. In addition, in terms of trends in mean area change per trophic guild, the FT species presented a decrease in the mean projected area under all future scenarios, resulting in a progressive range retraction through time. It is worth pointing out the range expansion in some FT species that exceed in more the 100%. This could be due to the fact that SE Amazonia represents the distribution margin of some FT species and may not express its climatic affinities precisely [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref054">54</a>]. However, it is also likely that other factors besides climate, such as those related to species ecological characteristics, could play a role in the distribution ranges. Therefore, finer resolution models and/or the inclusion of species-specific environmental factors may be needed to address these issues. Conversely, the OAV species presented an overall trend to increase progressively their distributional range. We hypothesized that FT species would have the greatest impact, and likely, climate change would favour OAV species, based on the expected "savannization" process [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref032">32</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref033">33</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref055">55</a>] (but see [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref056">56</a>]). Our models partially corroborate this idea, showing an increase in mean area of OAV species, except for OAVFR species. Based on our models, frugivores seem to be the most sensitive functional group (FTFR mean area loss ranging between 18.2% [2050; RCP 2.6] and 51% [2070; RCP 8.5], and OAVFR ranging between 9.7% [2050; RCP 6.0] and 32.8% [2070; RCP 6.0]) for the study area as a whole.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of current effectiveness of PAs based on SDM, our results are in accordance with those from recently analysed Brazilian protected areas [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref057">57</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref058">58</a>]. Here, we also provide an evaluation of future effectiveness of the currently established PAs for avian assemblages in SE Amazonia. Our SDMs project a significant loss of species considering future warming climate scenarios in the focal area, and this is even worse considering each PA apart, in which species loss can reach 100% (e.g., Frugivores in IL Guajajara, RCP 6.0 and 8.5). In fact, considering future effectiveness based only on the differentiation between current and future mean temperatures, it was estimated that approximately 19–67% of all current protected areas in Brazil will potentially not have similar temperature regimes in the future [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref040">40</a>]. In addition, the frugivores are the trophic guild class that shows the strongest loss (ranging between 5–100% species loss, in Carajás Mosaic, RCP 2.6, 2050, and IL Guajajara, RCP 6.0, 2050, respectively), and other studies have already suggested this guild is more extinction-prone [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref059">59</a>]. Frugivores play a key role in providing seed dispersal services [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref060">60</a>], mainly in tropical rainforests (70–94% of woody plants [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref061">61</a>]). Additionally, studies have demonstrated that species may not vanish from the ecosystem, but large population declines are sufficient to diminish the amount and quality of seed dispersal to such an extent that plant recruitment is no longer feasible, triggering negative feedback impacts on plant populations, community dynamics and hence ecosystem functions [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref062">62</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref064">64</a>]. Proportionally, our analysis shows that insectivores constitute the second most sensitive guild, despite including more species loss than any other group in absolute terms (between 4–74% species loss, in Terra do Meio Mosaic, RCP 2.6, 2050, and ESEC Rio Ronuro, RCP 8.5, 2050, respectively). Regardless of the low number of studies that have been conducted, the importance of insectivorous birds in reducing plant damage from herbivory has been demonstrated in Neotropical forest canopies [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref065">65</a>]. Although less sensitive than other guilds, nectarivores could potentially lose up to 60% of their current projected diversity (e.g., IL Kayabi and Rikbaktsá, RCP 8.5, 2050). A recent estimation found that &gt;90% of angiosperm species in tropical communities are animal pollinated [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref066">66</a>] and over 111 avian species pollinate plants in Brazil (effectively or potentially), but their importance in pollination is not well documented [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref067">67</a>]. The possible impact of climate change on reducing bird-pollination services is unknown and could include decrease in gene flow among plants, as well in fruit and seed set [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref068">68</a>]. Using knowledge of biological interactions coupled with current and expected future climate conditions is a key strategy to improve the efficiency of conservation plans in terms of restoration and strengthening landscape connectivity [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref069">69</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref070">70</a>]. Notwithstanding, as noted previously, such information need to be more deep- and locally accessed to better evaluate the consequences for other communities of species that interact with avian species. Moreover, the species losses mentioned above did not consider species turnover (i.e., the amount of arriving species), and when it was considered, the SR in each PA did not change substantially. At first glance, this could be considered resilience if it is interpreted as a community response to perturbation, but a large part of this turnover was due to generalists. Several questions remain unanswered about "functional homogenization" in terms of if generalists represent a new degraded state, a transition that will return to the initial equilibrium, or a transition to a novel ecosystem; regardless, generalists invariably affect functioning and productivity, reducing resistance and resilience (see [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref071">71</a>] for a review).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study identified a large, almost connected, and, in great part, intact block in the focal area as climatically stable for at least 20% of each FT trophic guild. Approximately the same area was forecasted for bats using the same parameters [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref026">26</a>]. Our analysis shows that about 55% of our modelled climatically stable area overlap with currently established PAs. Despite of indigenous lands are legally not regarded as conservation units by the Brazilian law, these areas strongly ensure biodiversity protection [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref072">72</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref073">73</a>]. Notably, the westernmost areas are the best preserved and protected, even under heavy pressure from illegal logging and mining, as well as recent government attempts to reduce protected areas (provisional measures MP 756/2016 and MP 758/2016 [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref074">74</a>]) and undermine environmental laws to facilitate the implementation of large infrastructure projects (constitutional amendment–PEC65 [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref075">75</a>]). On the other hand, approximately 15% of the area overlaps with degraded areas, and the remaining 30% still have natural vegetation but no protection. Together, these areas could form a large continuous block of suitable habitat for avian species. Several studies have demonstrated that large, connected, and intact ecosystems ensure the representativeness of multiple landscape gradients, ecological effectiveness of species population size, and intraspecific genetic diversity ([
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref076">76</a>] and references therein). Also, the contribution undertaken by Brazil at the 2015 Paris Conference of the Parties is to restore 120,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of forests by 2030. Most of this restoration should be in sites potentially suitable for as many species as possible, such as those pointed out by our models.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies have already analysed and described how methodological uncertainty could complicate predicting the impacts of climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref077">77</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref080">80</a>]. In fact, each stage of the modelling method provides variation that generate uncertainties (e.g., collinearity and variable selection [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref081">81</a>]; GCMs [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref082">82</a>]; future emission scenarios; algorithms [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref083">83</a>]; threshold selection [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref084">84</a>], without mentioning the uncertainties from the data which is hard to fully explore). Recent works that have partitioned and measured the contribution of the sources of variation inherent to the models, show that the algorithms are responsible for most of the uncertainty, being greater than the climatic models and the future emission scenarios [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref049">49</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref077">77</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref081">81</a>]. Our results are in line with those showing that our algorithms contributed the most to uncertainty when compared with emission scenarios. Although our conclusions are based upon simulation derived from only one GCM, significant efforts have been made between the IPCC's Assessment Reports to reduce biases in climate models [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref034">34</a>] and, as above mentioned, our choice were based in recent analysis showing that CCSM4 best represent the main features over northern South America [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref042">42</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref043">43</a>]. Here, our main goal is not to compare computational methods but instead to provide decision makers with an array of possible outcomes related to the potential impacts of climate change on avian assemblages, considering our large set of species data, the resolution of multi-algorithm, multi-timescale and multi-emission scenario and computational feasibility. There are two more important points that relate to our analysis. Firstly, the dependence of model accuracy methods on sample/species prevalence, highlighting that without reliable presence—absence data, no metrics yield proper estimates (even for TSS as recently demonstrated) [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref085">85</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref087">87</a>]. True absences already are very tough to obtain because they demand high sampling effort to ensure their exactitude, which is much harder in the neotropics where species records’ data (true presences) have spatial, temporal and taxonomic biases [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref014">14</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref015">15</a>]. In addition, expecting for a flawless evaluation metric is unworthy when we can use the available ones in a complementary way. Therefore, we believe that our consensus maps are robust in the projections of possible distribution/composition changes of avian assemblages in the study area. Another important point is the idiosyncratic response of each species to climate change, stressing out that different species may not react in the same way and for this reason, we focus on the general inferred patterns for guild groups. Finally, conservation actions based on our results must assume a flexible strategy (i.e., accept the risks, reassess conditions in front of new evidence, adapt/change strategy) keeping in mind managing in the face of uncertainty [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref069">69</a>].
