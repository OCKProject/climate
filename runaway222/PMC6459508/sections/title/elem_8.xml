 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For FT species (N = 382), our current projections indicated high SR in the centre and western portion of the focal area (≥50%, reaching 76% by cell), and low SR in the south eastern portion (&lt;30%). Under the future scenarios, climate change may result in significant loss in SR (reaching 47% at its maximum in the worst case scenario) besides a distributional shift from west-central richest area to north towards the Marajó island (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215229.g001" href="#pone.0215229.g001">Fig 1</a>). The current projected areas with high SR for OAV species (N = 119) were the central portion of focal area (reaching 59%), and east of Marajó island (46%). Our future scenarios forecasted a northward shift from the core occurrence region (not shown; see the 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec010" href="#sec010">Discussion</a>) resulting in increased SR (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results indicate that a greater number of species were projected to show a range loss rather than a range gain (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215229.g002" href="#pone.0215229.g002">Fig 2</a>). Independent of trophic guild, approximately 187 (49% for FT) and 43 (36% for OAV) species will potentially lose ≥20% of their current suitable area in the next 20 years in the most optimistic scenario (2050; RCP 2.6), and between 72 (19% for FT) and 13 (11% for OAV) species will no longer find suitable habitat in the focal area in the worst case scenario (RCP 8.5; 2070;

In absolute numbers, FTIN accounts for most of the projected loss of geographic range size (out of the 219 species between 105 [48%] and 152 [69%] are expected to lose at least 20% of current projected suitable habitats depending on the scenario), but proportionally the FTFR species will potentially be more negatively affected (out of the 66 species between 38 [58%] and 51 [77%] are expected to lose at least 20% of current projected suitable habitats depending on the scenario). Most of the species projected to gain geographic range sizes are from OAV group with an average increase of 234% (SD 467%;
