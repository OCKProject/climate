 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average global surface temperature has increased by approximately 0.8°C during the last century and is expected to continue increasing [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref001">1</a>]. Species have always reacted to climatic changes throughout their evolutionary history [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref002">2</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref004">4</a>]; however, currently, the main concern is the unprecedented rapidity of the observed changes [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref001">1</a>]. Although, until now, habitat loss and fragmentation have represented the highest threat to biodiversity [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref006">6</a>], some studies have suggested that climate change is likely to outweigh habitat loss as a global threat in the coming decades [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref007">7</a>]. In fact, even though climate change constitutes its own set of risks, it may interact with habitat loss and increase shifts in species distributions, extinctions, and hence compositional changes in communities [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref008">8</a>]. This potential distribution reshuffling of biodiversity may affect the structure, dynamics and functioning of ecosystems and the contributions they provide [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref009">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nature’s contributions to people (NCP) is the concept of “the benefits that people derive from nature [to provide] a good quality of life” proposed by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref010">10</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref011">11</a>]. Similar to the more popular ecosystem services concept [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref005">5</a>], nature components (biodiversity) interact in complex processes that control flows of energy, nutrients and organic matter (ecosystem functioning) that, in turn, produce environmental goods and services (e.g., clean air, fresh water, climate stabilization) that contribute to health and human well-being.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds are good biological indicators of climate change impacts on NCP, since they occupy all terrestrial habitats, consume virtually all type of resources [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref012">12</a>] and therefore provide key ecosystem functions and services such as pollination, seed and nutrient dispersion, predation, and scavenging [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref013">13</a>]. Besides, they are one of the most well-known and studied groups, with a huge amount of data available. Nonetheless, even for birds, there is a deficiency of data in terms of describing and identifying the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest and providing high-quality species distribution data [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref014">14</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref015">15</a>]. For example, according to the last available survey based simply on georeferenced occurrence maps [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref016">16</a>], this biome harbours 1778 resident bird species. However, this number continues to rise as new species are discovered [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref017">17</a>], and to date, large areas have not been inventoried in Amazonia [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref014">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Amazonia is a complex biome, and, just in floristic terms, it consists of areas covered either by forest (FT; 
  <span class="italic">terra-firme</span>), periodically inundated forested environments (
  <span class="italic">várzea</span>, 
  <span class="italic">igapó</span>), as well as open-area vegetation patches (OAV; 
  <span class="italic">cerrado</span>, 
  <span class="italic">campinas</span>/
  <span class="italic">campinaranas</span>, 
  <span class="italic">cangas</span>). This environmental heterogeneity is one of the leading factors responsible for its high species richness [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref018">18</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref019">19</a>]. Moreover, despite being recognized as providing key NCP [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref020">20</a>], Brazilian Amazonia has already lost approximately 19.6% of its forest [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref021">21</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref022">22</a>]. Land-use change caused by agricultural expansion, logging, mining and energy production are responsible for more than 90% of Brazil’s total greenhouse gas emissions [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref023">23</a>]. Therefore, the rapidity of environmental changes has increased the urgency of collecting, organizing and analysing biodiversity data to guide decision-making in conservation. Moreover, the NCPs are essential to human activities, and a better understanding of the range of ecosystem responses to climate change will help to improve the determination and the implementation of effective ecosystems management in a manner that promotes resilience [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref024">24</a>]. Although several studies have found a strong negative impact of forest fragmentation on the biodiversity in Amazonia [

  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref025">25</a>], very few studies have evaluated how species will be affected by climate change in the near future [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref026">26</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref027">27</a>] and fewer studies have examined the consequences of climate change on functional diversity [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we gathered extensive species occurrence data representative of southeastern (SE) Amazonia to assess the potential climate change impact on avian assemblages. Our work encompasses 501 species (representing more than 50% of the known avian diversity of the focal area [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref017">17</a>] and 199,250 occurrence records (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215229.s002" href="#pone.0215229.s002">S1 Table</a>). Using Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), we analysed how different scenarios of climate change could affect the pattern of species distributions and assemblage compositions. By grouping species based on their main diet (frugivores, insectivores, nectarivores and others [
  <a rid="pone.0215229.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215229.ref028">28</a>]) as a proxy to NCPs (seed dispersion, pest control and pollination), we were able to indicate the most susceptible functional group to climate change. In addition, we evaluated the future effectiveness of current Protected Areas (PAs; Conservation Units [CUs] and Indigenous Lands [ILs]) and presented focal areas for different conservation planning considering the dynamics of climate scenarios.
