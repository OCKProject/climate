 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quality of the models, according to TSS (0.68 ± 0.11) and ROC (0.90 ± 0.05; all values above 0.80), had a high levels of accuracy (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215229.s002" href="#pone.0215229.s002">S1 Table</a>), indicating good model fit. Temperature Seasonality (BIO4, for 80% of the species), Annual Mean Temperature (BIO1, for 67%) and Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter (BIO10, for 46%) were important drivers (mean importance &gt; 30%) for many species distributions; and all species (except for 
  <span class="italic">Myiozetetes cayanensis</span>) have at least one predictor variable with importance greater than 30% (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215229.s002" href="#pone.0215229.s002">S1 Table</a>). The sum of squares obtained to each cell showed distinct contributions to variation around the SR maps (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215229.s001" href="#pone.0215229.s001">S1 Fig</a>). Algorithms are responsible for the greatest proportion of variation (FT median [min-max] = 79% [5–100%]; and OAV median [min-max] = 87%, [1–100%]), widely spread in the study area. The proportion of variation attributable to future scenarios was lower than the former (FT median [min-max] = 62% [1–100%]; and OAV median [min-max] = 41%, [1–100%]).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For FT species (N = 382), our current projections indicated high SR in the centre and western portion of the focal area (≥50%, reaching 76% by cell), and low SR in the south eastern portion (&lt;30%). Under the future scenarios, climate change may result in significant loss in SR (reaching 47% at its maximum in the worst case scenario) besides a distributional shift from west-central richest area to north towards the Marajó island (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215229.g001" href="#pone.0215229.g001">Fig 1</a>). The current projected areas with high SR for OAV species (N = 119) were the central portion of focal area (reaching 59%), and east of Marajó island (46%). Our future scenarios forecasted a northward shift from the core occurrence region (not shown; see the 
   <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec010" href="#sec010">Discussion</a>) resulting in increased SR (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results indicate that a greater number of species were projected to show a range loss rather than a range gain (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215229.g002" href="#pone.0215229.g002">Fig 2</a>). Independent of trophic guild, approximately 187 (49% for FT) and 43 (36% for OAV) species will potentially lose ≥20% of their current suitable area in the next 20 years in the most optimistic scenario (2050; RCP 2.6), and between 72 (19% for FT) and 13 (11% for OAV) species will no longer find suitable habitat in the focal area in the worst case scenario (RCP 8.5; 2070;

In absolute numbers, FTIN accounts for most of the projected loss of geographic range size (out of the 219 species between 105 [48%] and 152 [69%] are expected to lose at least 20% of current projected suitable habitats depending on the scenario), but proportionally the FTFR species will potentially be more negatively affected (out of the 66 species between 38 [58%] and 51 [77%] are expected to lose at least 20% of current projected suitable habitats depending on the scenario). Most of the species projected to gain geographic range sizes are from OAV group with an average increase of 234% (SD 467%;

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses suggest that the majority of the northern and western parts of the focal area are climatically stable suitable habitats for FT species, indicating that suitable habitats coincided with six to seven of the seven scenarios (
