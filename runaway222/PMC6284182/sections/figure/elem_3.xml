  <p>A participant experiencing the virtual environment. 
   <span class="bold">(A)</span> The participant wears an Oculus Development Kit 2 (DK2) VR display, whose internal accelerometer and gyroscope track 3-degrees of orientation for the user's head. 
   <span class="bold">(B)</span> The Oculus near infrared (IR) camera tracks IR sensors embedded in the DK2 headset to allow for translational tracking. The IR camera combined with the DK2's accelerometer allows for 6 degrees of freedom tracked on the user's head. 
   <span class="bold">(C)</span> In the Scuba Diver condition, the user embodies a scuba diver to visit the virtual rocky reef. 
   <span class="bold">(D)</span> In the Coral Condition, the user embodies a piece of coral that lives on the rocky reef.
