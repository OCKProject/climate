 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that the measures for this study were administered during the immersive VR experience and the focus of the venue was not on experimental studies, we avoided standardized questionnaires such as those used in our previous experiments. Instead, we created two simpler dependent variables to measure each participant's attitude toward the immediacy of ocean acidification and inquisitiveness about the issue at large.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Movement</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tracked the head and hand movements of participants during the species count, which included working with the virtual slate, to discover if the amount of movement predicted attitude or inquisitiveness. Descriptive statistics for head and hand movements are located in Appendix 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">C</a>.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the immersive VR experience ended, participants responded to the question, “How far away do the consequences of ocean acidification feel to you?” with five answer choices: (1) extremely far, (2) far, (3) reasonable time remains, (4) close, and (5) extremely close. The median response was higher than the midpoint (4), with a slightly smaller mean level of concern for the consequences of ocean acidification [(
   <span class="italic">M</span> = 3.53, 
   <span class="italic">SD</span> = 0.97), min = 1.0, max = 5.0].

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inquisitiveness</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the attitudinal question, participants answered yes or no to the question, “Would you like us to send you more information about ocean acidification?” Approximately one-third of participants asked for more information (53/167; 31.7%).</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species count and search activity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We counted the number of species that each participant grabbed during the underwater experience [(
   <span class="italic">M</span> = 10.22; 
   <span class="italic">SD</span> = 14.17), min = 0, max = 116.0]. This measure differed, however, from the number of species that participants put into their collection buckets [(
   <span class="italic">M</span> = 3.90; 
   <span class="italic">SD</span> = 3.57), min = 0, max = 21]. These items were highly correlated (ρ = 0.74, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) and we therefore combined these scores into a standardized index called 
   <span class="italic">search activity</span> to evaluate participant overall interactivity level during the species count.
