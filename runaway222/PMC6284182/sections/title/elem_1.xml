 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">VR is a communication medium that leads an individual to perceive experiences and environments as if they were not synthetic (Lombard and Ditton, 
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">1997</a>). A virtual experience hinges on two critical dimensions: immersion and presence. Immersion considers how well the technology approximates actions and movements in the virtual space. For example, a highly immersive experience tracks a person's arms or legs with high levels of accuracy and maps his or her movements to the virtual space in a natural way. Presence, on the other hand, is the psychological sense of “being there” (Heeter, 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">1992</a>; Slater and Wilbur, 
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">1997</a>). Presence reflects how well an individual perceives the self in the virtual world and has the opportunity to act within the space (Wirth et al., 
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">2007</a>). Together, an immersive virtual experience with high levels of presence allows the individual to suspend any belief that the experience is mediated.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">VR disciplines have a rich history of documenting the medium's role as an important tool to evaluate social and psychological phenomena. For example, VR assists medical fields with patient rehabilitation and psychological interventions (Nilsson et al., 
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">2012</a>). That is, military veterans who relive their Vietnam War experiences in VR show reduced levels of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder relative to baseline, nearly 6 months after exposure (Rothbaum et al., 
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">2001</a>). People who experience VR therapy for anxiety or personality disorders (e.g., Wiederhold and Wiederhold, 
  <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">2005</a>; Nararro-Haro et al., 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">2016</a>), social phobias (e.g., Klinger et al., 
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">2005</a>), and other fears (e.g., spiders, flying, heights) show consistent or enhanced levels of psychological improvement relative to traditional, face-to-face treatments. Medicine, as well as other fields (e.g., athletics; Bideau et al., 
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">2010</a>) have also used virtual technology for teaching and training because repetitions in VR are free. It is often financially and ethically expensive for doctors, trainers, or nurses to practice on humans, but VR offers rehearsals that feel real and are relatively low-cost. Cadavers can cost hospitals thousands of dollars and harming a living person has non-trivial consequences, including in extreme cases, death. VR allows doctors to move within a space that imitates their physical environment with carryover effects that can positively impact operating room performance (Seymour et al., 
  <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">2002</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Virtual reality and science education</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the 1990's VR has been tested and used as a tool for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. According to Salzman et al. (
   <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">1999</a>), learning in VR is possible because VR systems produce highly engaging experiences, which can lead to greater focus on the learning topic (Bricken and Byrne, 
   <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">1993</a>). VR puts users within a virtual learning environment that reflects the topic of interest (e.g., placing students within a cell if they are learning about human biology), which can offer perspectives that are difficult to realize in other learning settings (see Johnson et al., 
   <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">2002</a>). VR can be effective for learning because it enables “users to interact with spatial representations” from many frames of reference (Salzman et al., 
   <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">1999</a>, p. 294). Finally, the addition of auditory, haptic, and other sensory feedback allows users participate in a world that feels unmediated. Such features provide a multidimensional experience that can aid in cognitive processing and information retention (Ragan et al., 
   <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A classic example of VR developed for learning about science was created by Dede (
   <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">2009</a>), who designed a desktop VR program called River City (see Clarke and Dede, 
   <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">2009</a>). The program's goal is to teach students about the scientific method by progressing through different parts of the city. Students develop research questions about why River City is experiencing health issues or why people are getting sick at uneven rates. Participants move through the curriculum by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting science data.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An extensive review of the research on educational virtual environments by Mikropoulos and Natsis (
   <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2011</a>) suggests that most VR programs are consistent with River City, using desktop or non-immersive technology for learning (e.g., computers, styluses, joysticks). For example, Minogue et al. (
   <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">2006</a>) gave middle school students a desktop VR program to explore the details of a cell. In the treatment group, students received visual and haptic feedback as they explored a virtual cell and the control group only received visual feedback. The data revealed positive learning effects for students in both groups after comparing pre- to post-test knowledge scores about cells. Haptic feedback improved knowledge scores for some low-achieving students, but overall, it did not lead to learning differences between groups.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The prior patterns have been summarized at scale in a recent meta-analysis that evaluated the effect of desktop VR instruction on learning and knowledge gain (Merchant et al., 
   <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">2014</a>). Across nearly 30 studies, Merchant et al. (
   <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">2014</a>) observed that desktop VR interventions produce a significant, positive effect on leaning outcomes and knowledge gain in K-12 higher education. We use this meta-analytic evidence as support for the idea that instruction through predominantly desktop VR is effective and can lead to positive knowledge gain for many science topics. It is still unclear, however, if immersive VR can facilitate learning about complex social and environmental issues.
