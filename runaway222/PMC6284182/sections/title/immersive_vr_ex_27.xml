 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the pre-test, participants were introduced to the VR hardware and the remainder of the experiment. The researcher helped participants put on the HMD and headphones, made adjustments to ensure comfort and A/V clarity, and the VR experience began. Participants were standing for the duration of the experiment. The researcher stayed close to the participant and wore headphones to monitor the person's progress through the VR experience.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the virtual world, participants experienced synchronous environmental feedback designed to make them feel more connected to their self-avatars. Participants saw a fish swim up to their bodies in the virtual world that would begin to repeatedly bump against them. Concurrently, the researcher used a plastic fish on a stick to gently tap the participant on his or her physical body in the same location on their torso as in the virtual world (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">5</a>). These taps continued for ~30 s, then the fish swam away. Participants heard an audible “tap” sound as the fish bumped them. This synchronized sensory feedback aims to make participants feel a greater sense of embodiment in their self-avatars (Botvinick and Cohen, 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">1998</a>; Ehrsson, 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">2007</a>; Slater et al., 
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">2010</a>). No additional interaction with the researcher occurred. Similar to Study 1, participants did not move or swim in the environment. Participants' position was tracked in the virtual space using the external Rift infrared sensor but they did not physically walk around.

    <span class="bold">(B)</span> A fish approaches the participant's virtual body and bumps it repeatedly. The fish's bumping action coincides with the researcher's gentle tapping action in the real world.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The entire virtual experience took ~6 1/2 min and then participants removed the HMD and headphones. Once subjects confirmed they were not motion sick or otherwise uncomfortable from the virtual experience (none were), they continued to the post-test.</p>
