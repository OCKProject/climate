 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The materials in Study 2 were similar to Study 1, with minor virtual world modifications. Most significantly, two conditions were created, each with a different self-avatar for participants to embody. Half of the participants saw themselves as a coral in the virtual world (consistent with Study 1), while others remained human and saw themselves as scuba divers on the seafloor.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the power of an immersive VR experience comes from a sense of connectedness to one's avatar, then becoming someone or something more centrally connected to the virtual world (e.g., the underwater reef) should result in greater learning gains and greater environmental concerns. We expect knowledge gains from pre- to post-test assessments for participants across conditions and explore if embodying a coral or a scuba diver affects learning and attitude change.</p>
