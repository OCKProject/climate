 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess if learning about ocean acidification occurred in immersive VR, students submitted responses to six open-response questions: (1) What is ocean acidification?, (2) What is the most significant cause of ocean acidification?, (3) What are some of the predicted effects of increasing ocean acidification on the world's ocean ecosystems? Be as detailed as you can., (4) How do coral and other sea creatures build their hard skeletons and shells?, (5) How much carbon dioxide is absorbed by the planet's oceans each year?, and (6) How much has the pH level of the ocean changed since the industrial revolution?</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All questions were scored independently by two coders, who were instructed to grade the responses based on accuracy. Consistent with prior work (Minogue et al., 
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">2006</a>), responses were ranked on a point system: zero points for no answer or simply restating the question, one point for a partially correct answer, and two points if the answer contained nearly perfect accuracy with minor inaccuracies. As expected, average ocean acidification knowledge during the pre-test time blocks (Time 1 and 2 in Table 
  <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">2</a>) was low, [(
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 1.97, 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 1.43); min = 0, max = 5.0], compared to the average ocean acidification knowledge during the final three time blocks, [(
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 4.62, 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 2.52); min = 0.5, max = 10.5]. Inter-rater reliability for these judgments was high (Table 
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">1</a>) and examples of ideal answers are provided in the Appendix 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">A</a>. Note, because there were six questions, knowledge scores could have reached a maximum of twelve points.
