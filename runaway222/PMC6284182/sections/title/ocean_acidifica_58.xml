 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants answered three questions about ocean acidification and their responses were judged by three blind raters. The questions asked, “What is ocean acidification?,” “What are the causes of ocean acidification?,” and “What are the predicted effects of ocean acidification?” Following the procedure established in Study 1, questions received grades of 0, 1, or 2 based on their response accuracy. Questions were randomized in the judgment process to control for order effects. Ideal answers are located in Appendix
