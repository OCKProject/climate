 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experiment consisted of six classroom meetings with students and their teachers. All parts of the current study occurred before the topic of ocean acidification was covered in the students' coursework. All activities were approved by our university's Institutional Review Board and sanctioned by the teachers. An overview of the procedure is provided in Figure

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first introductory meeting, students signed up for the study and participated in a VR demonstration unrelated to ocean acidification or science. This allowed the hardware to be tested outside the lab and ensured that the ocean acidification experience was not the students' first VR exposure, resolving one of Bricken's (
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">1991</a>) concerns about the potential fear associated with a first virtual experience. Two weeks later, the research team administered a questionnaire to obtain students' baseline knowledge of ocean acidification. The questionnaire contained inquiries into ocean acidification and the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), a scale to measure attitudes toward the environment. The following day, all students in the class, which included four subjects from our study, went on the first of two open-water scuba diving trips in physical space. This first underwater trip is henceforth referred to as Dive Trip 1 and was introduced to evaluate the potential impact of a physical-world experience on a virtual-world experience. The following week, the research team re-administered the pre-test materials to all participants.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One month after the pre-test, the research team returned to the classroom with the immersive VR hardware. Students were randomly assigned to one of two immersive VR stations and wore a HMD and headphones (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>), but were not tested for stereo vision. Other students who were not participating at the time were given unrelated assignments to complete at their desks.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the immersive VR session, a synchronized narration told participants that their body had become a coral (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3</a>). They were also introduced to the sea life and heard about the causes, processes, and effects of ocean acidification. Participant head rotation was tracked via the HMD and their position in X, Y, Z space was tracked via the infrared sensor. They were also told that their coral avatars would be fixed in the VR experience and were told to refrain from walking around in the physical room. Participants controlled their coral arm movements with the mouse and collected a variety of objects, including calcium and bicarbonate ions to stay healthy as a coral.

By clicking the left mouse button, the participant can extend their coral polyp arm out in front of them in order to collect the ions that float by in the water. Note, the external Rift infrared sensor was used, providing six degrees-of-freedom of tracking.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As this process continued, subjects viewed the ill-effects of ocean acidification on the surrounding ecosystem over the next 40 years (e.g., a decrease in fish populations, increased algae levels). Gradually, the underwater scene morphed into how marine scientists expect it will look at the end of this century and participants were instructed to observe how the acidity dissolved their own coral body. The immersive VR experience concludes with the reef returning to its original state and the participant hears that there is still time left to salvage what we have.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the VR experience, students completed a questionnaire at their desks, which included the six questions about ocean acidification, the NEP scale, and a self-reported measure of presence. The following day (e.g., after the immersive VR classroom experience), the class held their second open water scuba dive, henceforth called Dive Trip 2, which included 10 participants from our study. The next week, the research team administered the ocean acidification knowledge questionnaire and the NEP questionnaire. Four weeks after the VR experience, the research team again administered a delayed post-test. Two students were absent and one chose not to participate in this post-test, yielding 16 respondents for the final measurement, only.</p>
