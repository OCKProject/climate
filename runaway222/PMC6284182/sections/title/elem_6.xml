 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, environmental education is difficult because the issues are complex and challenging to internalize. Prior research suggests that people may feel undecided or uncertain about climate change, specifically, because they cannot see the environment changing first-hand or on a regular basis (Schuldt et al., 
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">2016</a>). The time lag between negative actions (e.g., pollution) that lead to environmental changes may motivate people to believe that a single phenomenon cannot cause such extreme outcomes (Weber, 
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">2013</a>). These ideas suggest that if environmental issues were perceived as psychologically closer or brought to observers directly (Pearson et al., 
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">2016</a>), perhaps people could learn about the issues and be encouraged to take pro-environmental action.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent work has proposed that to address the challenges associated with climate change education, innovative teaching methods are needed for public engagement on the complex social and environmental issues. Wu and Lee (
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">2015</a>) suggest that mediated experiences, particularly involving games about climate change, allow people to dynamically learn through “doing and being” rather than perceiving information in a lecture format (p. 413). Teaching science in a mediated manner provides first-hand experiences and can trigger an emotional response in a user compared to simple information exposure (Mendler de Suarez et al., 
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">2012</a>). Therefore, according to recent scholarship, some of the concerns associated with VR for learning are lifted because of improved technology (e.g., people can play mobile games to interact with a virtual world outside of the lab) and an increased focus on eliciting psychological attachment to the issues (Wu and Lee, 
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We propose that learning about the consequences of climate change should occur in immersive VR because participants will experience negative environmental events first-hand and the issues will be made psychologically closer. These ideas are also supported by theories of psychological distance, such as Construal Level Theory, which suggests that experiences are often appraised based on how spatially, temporally, or socially proximate (or distant) they are to an individual (Trope and Liberman, 
  <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">2010</a>). If an object or event is perceived as psychologically proximate, it is often internalized in concrete terms, compared to an event that is perceived as psychologically distant and internalized in abstract terms (Margolin and Markowitz, 
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">2018</a>). These construal patterns have downstream effects; for example, people who construe objects in concrete terms tend to be less risky than people who construe objects in abstract terms because the effects of their decisions are viewed as more immediate (see Raue et al., 
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">2015</a> for a review). Therefore, data suggest that a detailed and concrete thinking style can bring a social issue psychologically closer, which then encourages people to appraise and feel connected to information. For a pressing and complex issue such as climate change, construing ocean acidification as a psychologically proximate phenomenon through immersive VR and having people internalize the effects of problematic environmental behavior, is a worthwhile and theoretically grounded effort.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our rationale is also consistent with Dede (
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">2009</a>), who suggests that immersive technology can enhance education “by allowing multiple perspectives, situating learning, and transfer” (p. 66). We use the opportunities afforded by immersive VR, such as bringing an abstract event closer and situating the learning experience, to test the idea that people can demonstrate knowledge gain about the consequences of climate change. Specifically, we address a phenomenon called ocean acidification, or the process of the ocean's water decreasing in pH due to increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean acidification is the decreasing pH of the world's surface water as a result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, primarily due to human combustion of fossil fuels (Doney et al., 2009). This process has been well documented in fieldwork and the effects of ocean acidification are particularly noticeable on calcifying organisms, as the carbonic acid formed by the carbon dioxide both breaks down and prevents the formation of their exoskeletons (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 
   <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">2007</a>). Ocean acidification has precipitous consequences as well. Changes to calcifying organisms affect the competitive interactions of species farther up the food chain (Kroeker et al., 
   <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">2012</a>). Scientists agree that the rate of acidification is expected to rise in the future, with even more dramatic effects on ocean ecosystems and other entities that rely on them (Doney et al., 2009).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand the consequences of ocean acidification, scientists have observed naturally occurring sources of sub-oceanic carbon dioxide produced by underwater volcanic vents, for example one site near the coast of Ischia, Italy. The underwater processes in this region provide scientists with a “crystal ball” to see what will happen to oceans as more carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere (Hall-Spencer et al., 
   <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">2008</a>; Kroeker et al., 
   <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">2011</a>). Despite the severity of the problem and the well-supported research behind it, ocean acidification knowledge remains low and the phenomenon receives far less public attention than other climate change issues in environmental education (Kroeker et al., 
   <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">2012</a>; Capstick et al., 
   <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">2016</a>). The natural case study of ocean acidification in Ischia Italy, paired with recent calls for innovative methods that emphasize behavior and attitude change to improve environmental education (McCright et al., 
   <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">2013</a>; Wu and Lee, 
   <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">2015</a>), motivated our experiments to test if people can learn about climate change consequences in immersive VR.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated the effectiveness of immersive VR for learning about marine science through virtual field trips, a common metaphor for learning experiences in a virtual world (Borst et al., 
   <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2018</a>). Our first study started at a high school in the West Coast of the United States. In immersive VR, students participated in activities based on traditional practices of marine scientists, who dive underwater and interact with species of flora and fauna to measure biodiversity. The underwater virtual world was modeled after the Ischian Reef in Italy, where naturally occurring carbon dioxide vents acidify certain areas of the reef and provide scientists with a window into a future affected by climate change. We were primarily interested in the effect of immersive VR—characterized by haptic, auditory, and other sensory feedback experienced throughout a virtual world (Ahn et al., 
   <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">2016</a>)—on the students' learning and knowledge gain about ocean acidification. Our subsequent studies were exploratory and tested the effect of embodiment (Study 2), movement (Study 3), and situated action (Study 4) on learning gains or an interest in learning about climate change.
