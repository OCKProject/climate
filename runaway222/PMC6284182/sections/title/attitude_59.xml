 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants responded to two primary attitude questions. The first question asked how far away the consequences of ocean acidification felt, on a scale from (1) extremely far, to (5) extremely close [(
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 3.33, 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 1.02), min = 1.0, max = 5.0]. The second question consisted of six items where on five-point scales, participants responded to the consequences of ocean acidification, ranging from (a) unimportant to important (b), of no concern to of concern (c), irrelevant to relevant (d), means nothing to means a lot (e), doesn't matter to matters a lot (f), uninvolving to involving (Cronbach's α = 0.94). Overall, participants reported an above-average level of concern for ocean acidification, [(
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 4.05, 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 0.74), min = 1.67, max = 5.0]. These two measures were evaluated separately and also averaged to create an overall attitude score toward ocean acidification [(
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 3.69, 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 0.80), min = 1.83, max = 5.0; Cronbach's α = 0.78].
