 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other studies have found mixed effects for the impact of immersive VR on learning. For example, recent work suggests that students report greater presence in immersive VR (with a HMD) relative to desktop VR after a biology simulation, but they learn less in immersive VR (Makransky et al., 
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">2017</a>). Similar reduced learning effects in immersive VR relative to desktop VR have been found after comparing learning scores for students who learn biology (immersive VR vs. a PowerPoint presentation; Parong and Mayer, 
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">2018</a>). Finally, equivalent levels of learning have also been noted between immersive VR and desktop VR in other science topics (Moreno and Mayer, 
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">2002</a>). Students learned about botany and experienced a tutorial on how to design a plant that could live in low sunlight. Participants in the HMD condition perceived the experience as more immersive relative to the desktop computer condition, but information retention was the same across media.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With mixed effects of immersive VR on learning about science, new studies are needed to add to this body of evidence that can also test the boundary conditions for immersive learning. Here, we evaluate if immersive VR is an effective medium to generate positive learning outcomes and perform exploratory studies to investigate if other parts of a virtual experience (e.g., embodiment, contextual movements) can affect learning about climate change and the environment.</p>
