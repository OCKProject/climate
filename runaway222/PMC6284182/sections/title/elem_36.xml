  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were several significant, positive relationships between post-test scores (see Table 
   <a rid="T3" ref-type="table" href="#T3">3</a>). Presence was positively associated with post-test levels of ocean acidification knowledge (ρ = 0.34, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.019), ratings on the CNS (ρ = 0.47, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001) and NEP scales (ρ = 0.46, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001). Therefore, the more that people reported being attuned to the virtual environment in the post-test, the more that they learned in immersive VR, felt connected to nature, and reported environmental concern. Correlations between measures that are calculated based on the change between pre- and post-test scores can be found in Appendix 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">B</a>; as expected, they show largely the same pattern as post-test correlations alone.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Replicating the results from Study 1, participants displayed positive learning about marine science in immersive VR in a controlled laboratory setting. We explored the possibility that embodying a coral vs. a human scuba diver would lead to more knowledge gain, positive attitude toward the environment, and greater levels of reported presence, though consistent levels of these measures were observed across experimental conditions. Crucially, the data suggest that learning and an increase in environmental concern can occur regardless of the avatar that a person embodies. These findings substantiate and extend the results from Study 1 by exploring the learning effects in an environment with considerably less empirical noise. It could be possible that the significant effect on environmental attitude appeared with a more robust sample size relative to Study 1.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the demonstrable learning effects from the pre-test to the post-test, it is important to consider potential explanations for the null effect across self-avatar conditions. One possibility is that the virtual world provided too rich of an experience and the manipulated self-avatar was not the most salient stimuli in the environment. It is also possible participants ignored the virtual environment and listened to the narration, or vice versa, leading to a dissociation of attitude change and learning gains. However, we observed that participants' reported levels of presence, or the feeling that the virtual world was unmediated, was positively associated with post-test learning scores. Since we observed this finding in a 
   <span class="italic">post-hoc</span> test, we went back into the field to understand other how other aspects of a virtual experience can predict knowledge gain. In an exploratory field study with adults, we tracked how physical arm or head movements may relate to an interest in learning about ocean acidification since prior work suggests that interactivity in media can produce positive associations with a target and facilitate deep cognitive processing (Tremayne and Dunwoody,
