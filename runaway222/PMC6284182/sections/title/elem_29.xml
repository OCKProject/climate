  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean acidification knowledge</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Responses to questions concerning ocean acidification knowledge were independently scored by two coders, blind to participant condition. Significant differences between graders' scores were rare but resolved after discussion, leading to a high inter-rater reliability (Table 
   <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">1</a>). In instances where the scores of two raters differed, the average score was used. Scores were summed for each participant, leading to an overall knowledge measure out of twelve possible points.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Responses to the NEP scale were averaged to create an overall measure of environmental concern (Dunlap et al.,

   <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">2004</a>) were highly correlated (Table 
   <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">1</a>) and averaged. Higher scores reflect more connectedness to nature.
