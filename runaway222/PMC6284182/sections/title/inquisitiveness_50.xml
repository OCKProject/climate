 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A logistic regression model predicting participant inquisitiveness (1 = would like more information, 0 = would not like more information) with total physical movement and total physical rotation as standardized predictors showed a significant effect of total physical movement [(β = 0.45, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.23); Wald = 3.90, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.048, Exp(β) = 1.57; 95% CI for Exp(β) [1.00, 2.47], but no effect of total physical rotation [
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.12, Exp(β) &lt; 1; 95% CI for Exp(β) [0.44, 1.10], Nagelkerke

  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.03].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consistent with our layered analytic approach, we then ran three separate logistic regression models for each body part's movement (e.g., head, left hand, right hand) and concurrent rotation as independent predictors. The data revealed that the total physical movement of the participant's right hand, proxied by the movement of the virtual right-hand model, significantly predicted inquisitiveness [(β = 0.54, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.25); Wald = 4.74, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.029, Exp(β) = 1.71; 95% CI for Exp(β) [1.06, 2.77]. Physical total rotation of the right hand was marginally associated with inquisitiveness, [
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.069, Exp(β) = 0.64; 95% CI for Exp(β) [0.39, 1.04], Nagelkerke 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.04]. Movement and rotation of the left hand were not significant predictors of inquisitiveness [
  <span class="italic">p</span>'s &gt; 0.19, Exp(β) &lt; 1.32; Nagelkerke 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.02], and neither were movement or rotation of the head [
