    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001) and NEP scales (ρ = 0.46, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001). Therefore, the more that people reported being attuned to the virtual environment in the post-test, the more that they learned in immersive VR, felt connected to nature, and reported environmental concern. Correlations between measures that are calculated based on the change between pre- and post-test scores can be found in Appendix 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">B</a>; as expected, they show largely the same pattern as post-test correlations alone.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Replicating the results from Study 1, participants displayed positive learning about marine science in immersive VR in a controlled laboratory setting. We explored the possibility that embodying a coral vs. a human scuba diver would lead to more knowledge gain, positive attitude toward the environment, and greater levels of reported presence, though consistent levels of these measures were observed across experimental conditions. Crucially, the data suggest that learning and an increase in environmental concern can occur regardless of the avatar that a person embodies. These findings substantiate and extend the results from Study 1 by exploring the learning effects in an environment with considerably less empirical noise. It could be possible that the significant effect on environmental attitude appeared with a more robust sample size relative to Study 1.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the demonstrable learning effects from the pre-test to the post-test, it is important to consider potential explanations for the null effect across self-avatar conditions. One possibility is that the virtual world provided too rich of an experience and the manipulated self-avatar was not the most salient stimuli in the environment. It is also possible participants ignored the virtual environment and listened to the narration, or vice versa, leading to a dissociation of attitude change and learning gains. However, we observed that participants' reported levels of presence, or the feeling that the virtual world was unmediated, was positively associated with post-test learning scores. Since we observed this finding in a 
    <span class="italic">post-hoc</span> test, we went back into the field to understand other how other aspects of a virtual experience can predict knowledge gain. In an exploratory field study with adults, we tracked how physical arm or head movements may relate to an interest in learning about ocean acidification since prior work suggests that interactivity in media can produce positive associations with a target and facilitate deep cognitive processing (Tremayne and Dunwoody,

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 5 days of the Tribeca Film Festival, 488 people participated the immersive VR experience either wholly or partially, and several participant exclusion criteria were used. First, we discarded data collected from the 1st day due to general technical failures. Data from participants were also excluded if the individual did not comply with the study's task (e.g., if he or she swam so far outside the simulated reef that they missed the interactive simulation). Finally, we excluded participants who failed to respond to our attitude prompts in the post-underwater experience. This reduced our sample size to 167 participants, though this number remains large enough to possibly detect an effect of physical movements on interest in learning about ocean acidification.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to time constraints set by the festival—to have an exhibit, virtual experiences were required to be &lt;10 min long—we did not formally measure demographics of participants. In general, however, there was greater age and demographic variance in this study than a typical sample of university undergraduates.</p>

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Materials</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For this study, we used the HTC Vive with a resolution of 2160 × 1200 and an update rate of 90 Hz (e.g., 90 frames per second, per eye), tracked at a 22 ms latency rate. Two tracking base stations provided a six degrees-of-freedom control each for the head (through sensors embedded inside the Vive) and the two hands (through hand controllers; 120 Hz update rate, 8.333 ms latency). Participants also received audio feedback provided by stereo headphones. We used Worldviz's Vizard for developing the VR experience and used the 3D models developed by Worldviz around Italy's Ischia Reef. The 3D environment modeled the Mediterranean rocky reefs located off the coast of Ischia, Italy, which were simulated in Studies 1 and 2. The virtual environment in Study 3 was similar, but not identical to the virtual environment in Study 2. Slight modifications were made to the virtual environment due to affordances granted by more advanced hardware and computing power. The modifications included: increasing the fidelity of the graphics and the size of the virtual space that could be explored (e.g., participants could move and interact more within the environment).</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The immersive VR stations were 10' × 10' booths with four curtained walls. It should be noted, however, that the size of the virtual space exceeded physical space limitations. We encouraged participants to stand in one place, swim by moving their arms in a breaststroke motion, and rotate to change their direction.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experiment, including consent procedure, was a self-contained 8 min experience. The embedded informed consent procedure was approved by our university's Institutional Review Board. Pre-recorded narratives for this field trip, recorded by an expert voice-actor, were played through noise-canceling stereo headphones and guided the participants throughout the experience. To display text and visual information, we used virtual information boards. Participants responded to the experimental questions by placing their hands inside virtual choice-boxes and clicking a button on the HTC Vive controllers to select answers to written prompts that appeared within the virtual environment.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The VR experience began on a virtual boat floating above an Ischian Reef (see Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6</a>). Participants first viewed and responded to the informed consent. A series of narratives and infographics then trained each participant on their task, which was to swim underwater by moving their arms in a breaststroke motion and find marine life to measure the biodiversity of the reef. The immersive VR scene brought participants to the first underwater zone, modeled around a healthy rocky reef. Participants were asked to locate three different underwater animal species (snails, octopi, and eel) as part of a “species count,” an activity modeled after biodiversity assessments that marine biologists conduct in the field. For the next 2 min, participants used their arms to swim around the virtual underwater reef looking for the species of animals and collecting as many as they could find by picking them up with their hand controllers and placing them into a bucket located at the reef's center. A dive slate—modeled after the slates used by marine biologists—attached to each participant's virtual left wrist, displayed the remaining time, and how many of each species had been collected.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After 2 min, participants were moved to an acidified zone and asked to perform the same species collection task, however, the acidified zone only contained grass and degraded snails. This subtly communicated the message about the ill effects of ocean acidification, implying that the healthy species could no longer survive in an acidified environment. After counting species in the acidified zones, participants returned to the boat and compared the number and the variety of species in the two zones on an infographic. The narration then told participants about the general consequences of ocean acidification around the world. Participants then responded to an attitude and inquisitiveness question related to ocean acidification, which were presented inside the VR world, and then the experience ended with credits and acknowledgments.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed attitude toward ocean acidification and inquisitiveness based on head and hand movements, which are evaluated as separate predictors. We used movement to predict attitude and inquisitiveness because we were interested in exploring physical actions that may be indicative of environmental concern and if people who move more in the virtual space are also likely to express greater interest in environmental issues (Clark, 
   <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">1997</a>; Gallagher, 
   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">2005</a>). For each regression model, we include physical movement and physical rotation of the head and hands as separate predictors because changes to these body parts are often concurrent. That is, movement of the head and hands is also accompanied by rotation of the head and hands (ρ = 0.64,

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the prior evidence suggesting that right-hand movements can predict inquisitiveness, we analyzed the data for other 
    <span class="italic">post-hoc</span> relationships. The point-biserial correlation between inquisitiveness and attitude toward the closeness of ocean acidification revealed a positive relationship (ρ = 0.19, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.014). The exact direction of this effect is unclear, however, because it is plausible that the more people believe climate change is an immediate threat, the more they may be interested in learning about the issue. On the other hand, if people report being inquisitive about climate change, they may also feel like the issue is impending. Further research is required to understand this effect more clearly. Finally, we found that participants' total body movement (ρ = 0.34, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) and rotation (ρ = 0.47, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) were significantly correlated with total search activity (e.g., total species grabbed and collected in the species count). All correlations for this study's key variables are located in Table 
    <a rid="T4" ref-type="table" href="#T4">4</a>.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data suggest that participant right hand movements can predict if people want to learn more about climate change. How can right hand movements predict inquisitiveness? Prior work suggests that people often process information differently based on the side of their physical body that is completing an action (Casasanto, 
    <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">2011</a>; Bailey et al., 
    <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">2016</a>). This idea is called processing fluency (Reber et al., 
    <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">2004</a>), with evidence suggesting that making one hand inaccessible (e.g., wearing a bulky ski glove on one hand) changes how people perceive the space (e.g., the side that is accessible is viewed more positively than the side that is inaccessible; Casasanto and Chrysikou, 
    <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">2011</a>). It is plausible that people with more right-handed movements also were inquisitive because they enjoyed the virtual experience and formed a positive association with it. This contention is worth exploring more directly in future work.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are two primary limitations of this study worth noting. First, we did not gauge handedness of the participants. Second, people at the Tribeca Film Festival paid $40 to get into the VR arcade and stood in line for our immersive VR booth throughout the week-long festival. This information suggests that subjects who participated in our study may therefore have been extrinsically motivated to acquire knowledge about novel experiences in general. Given that we have some evidence that movement can predict interest in learning about climate change, albeit data from an uncontrolled field study, we tested the robustness of these effects in a more sterile laboratory environment with university undergraduates.</p>

Therefore, to explore how other movements can predict knowledge gain and attitude change about ocean acidification, we tested movements that are reasonably germane to underwater swimming that may affect learning. Specifically, we evaluated if knowledge gain and attitude change are affected by two locomotion techniques: (1) swimming by using physical arm movements as gestures, and (2) swimming by using a joystick (e.g., the Wiimote, based on the Nintendo Wii gaming console).</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experimenter explained the immersive VR hardware for viewing and interacting with the virtual world. Depending on the participant's experimental condition for moving underwater, they were provided with Wiimote controls or given instructions for swimming with their hands. Participants then wore the HMD and began their VR experience. A pre-recorded narrative guided subjects throughout the experience at an adjusted level of ambient audio clarity. To ensure familiarity with the underwater world, participants had a 1 min training session to practice locomotion techniques and collect flora and fauna in a virtual underwater zone. Subjects also answered a question that asked about the current temperature since the last time they responded, an exploratory measure that assessed if exposure to climate change effects can modify perceptions about one's environment.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experimenter then placed the participant in the healthy underwater zone. A narrative explained that the virtual world was modeled around a Mediterranean rocky reef, with a colorful and diverse ecosystem of underwater plants and animals. Participants were also shown sea snails, the species they would be searching for and counting in this zone. Figure

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At each stage of the underwater experience, the negative consequences of ocean acidification and climate change became more apparent and exacerbated. First, subjects searched for and counted as many snails as they could find for 2 min, using their condition-specific locomotion technique, and answered a question about the current temperature since the last time they reported. This first zone is henceforth referred to as the 
    <span class="italic">High pH</span>, or low acidification zone. The experimenter then placed participants in a second, climate change affected zone, henceforth referred to as the 
    <span class="italic">Medium pH</span>, or moderate acidification zone. The narrative informed subjects that volcanic vents were releasing carbon dioxide in the water and making the water slightly more acidic, a process called ocean acidification. Comparisons were drawn between the effect of the volcanic vents and the effect of human-released carbon dioxide through the burning of fossil fuels. Descriptions about ocean acidification and its undesired changes in ocean plants and animals were also provided. Participants went on another search for snails and answered a question about the current temperature since the last time they responded. Last, participants moved to the most acidic underwater zone, henceforth referred to as the 
    <span class="italic">Low pH</span>, or high acidification zone. The narrative described that the zone composition reflected scientific predictions of what the earth's oceans will look like in 100 years if fossil fuels continue to be burned at the current rate. In this last zone, participants answered a question about the current temperature since their last response, but did not search for snails as there were none to find.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the 
    <span class="italic">Low pH</span> zone, the researcher helped participants remove the HMD, trackers (in the Gestures condition), and subjects completed a post-experience questionnaire on a laptop. Participants were debriefed and then dismissed after completion of these items.

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants responded to two primary attitude questions. The first question asked how far away the consequences of ocean acidification felt, on a scale from (1) extremely far, to (5) extremely close [(

     <span class="italic">SD</span> = 1.02), min = 1.0, max = 5.0]. The second question consisted of six items where on five-point scales, participants responded to the consequences of ocean acidification, ranging from (a) unimportant to important (b), of no concern to of concern (c), irrelevant to relevant (d), means nothing to means a lot (e), doesn't matter to matters a lot (f), uninvolving to involving (Cronbach's α = 0.94). Overall, participants reported an above-average level of concern for ocean acidification, [(

It is possible that these null effects emerged because the locomotion techniques were not distinct enough to establish differences on perceptions-based dependent measures. That is, participants could travel in generally the same path across conditions but their approaches were dissimilar. Such contrasts may not be strong enough to affect participants, or perhaps the data reveal that psychological effects overwhelm physical effects in VR. The null main effects are not discussed further due to space limitations.
