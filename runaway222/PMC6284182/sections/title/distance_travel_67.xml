 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used hierarchical linear mixed models with two fixed effects (Zone, three levels; Condition, two levels) and a random effect for participant (to control for multiple observations by the same individual) to determine distance traveled by participants underwater. We found a main effect of Zone, [

  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001, η
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.18]. 
  <span class="italic">Bonferroni</span>-corrected adjustments revealed that participants traveled more in the 
  <span class="italic">Low pH</span> zone (
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 47.70 m, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 2.20 m) than the 
  <span class="italic">Medium pH</span> zone [(
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 41.18 m, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 2.20 m); 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.004] and the 
  <span class="italic">High pH</span> zone [(

  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 2.20 m); 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001]. There was no difference in distance traveled across the 
  <span class="italic">High pH</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Medium pH</span> zones, however (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.80). There was also no significant main effect of locomotion technique on distance traveled [
  <span class="italic">F</span> &lt; 1, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.50] and no interaction between locomotion technique and zones for distance traveled [
