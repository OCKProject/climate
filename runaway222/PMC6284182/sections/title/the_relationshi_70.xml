 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What do our studies reveal about the relationship between media and learning? The Interactive Information Processing Model by Tremayne and Dunwoody (
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">2001</a>) suggests when people use media interactively, they engage in more elaborative cognitive processing than people who use media passively. For example, people who use interactive websites that allow clicking on links engage in deeper cognitive processing and appraise their mediated experience more positively than people who use sites that only allow scrolling (Sicilia et al., 
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">2005</a>; see also Xu and Sundar, 
  <a rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69">2016</a>). Therefore, participants who explored more of the virtual space formed deeper cognitive associations with the science content and could learn, recall, and retain the causes and effects of ocean acidification better than those who did not explore the underwater world as much. We suspect that the strong learning effects in immersive VR reflect the medium's unique ability to fully engage a subject in an experience and surround him or her with the feeling of non-mediation (Slater and Wilbur, 
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">1997</a>), but also believe that it is important to explore how immersive VR compares to other media in its potential to facilitate learning about science.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed that the change in knowledge about ocean acidification was linked to increased engagement with and exploration of the virtual space (Study 4). This 
  <span class="italic">post-hoc</span> mechanism is further supported by Sundar (
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">2012</a>), who suggests that increased interactivity demands more conscious and deliberate processing of mediated content for comprehension. The implications of interactivity have been demonstrated largely with websites and online media, though the conceptual underpinnings of this phenomenon are transferrable across media experiences (Sundar et al., 
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">2013</a>). Therefore, we pre-suppose that moving within the space that looked and behaved like a real underwater reef made it easier for people to elaborate and understand the consequences of climate change, and the more that people explored in VR the more they benefited from the virtual experience. This pattern may serve as one recommendation for teachers and immersive VR developers who want to build virtual effective content for classrooms.
