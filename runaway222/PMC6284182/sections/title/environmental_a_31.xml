 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Responses to the NEP scale were averaged to create an overall measure of environmental concern (Dunlap et al., 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">2000</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Items from the CNS scale (Mayer and Frantz, 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">2004</a>) were highly correlated (Table 
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">1</a>) and averaged. Higher scores reflect more connectedness to nature.
