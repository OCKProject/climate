 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Deploying VR hardware in a classroom presented one unforeseen challenge: wearing a HMD hides the physical world from a user, but it does not hide the user from the physical world. Interacting with a world that is invisible to those outside the HMD makes a user look strange to an observer, a fact that became clear in our classroom work (Study 1). Teachers had to remind students of school policies on social media use, as students not engaged in the VR experience were taking pictures of their peers wearing HMDs and attempting to share those pictures online.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are general limitations across studies that are also worth highlighting and resolving in future work. First, it is unclear how long the learning effects may last in most of our studies. Information retention is an issue for most examinations that evaluate technology for education (see Mikropoulos and Natsis, 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2011</a>). Although we encourage future work to explore the potential of immersive VR to increase retention rates over time, our results offer a hopeful outlook, given that weeks after an underwater experience, high school students retained knowledge about ocean acidification.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to exploring information retention, immersive VR should be compared to other media to evaluate the boundary conditions for learning about marine science. Some research suggests that learning about science through a HMD produces similar learning levels as desktop VR (Moreno and Mayer, 
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">2002</a>), but it is important to position immersive VR relative to other innovative teaching platforms and approaches. For example, it is unclear how immersive VR compares to mobile games for learning (Wu and Lee, 
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">2015</a>) and the portable nature of mobile communication may facilitate a different learning potential about science. Therefore, a fruitful line of research we intend to conduct will investigate several teaching methods to isolate the technologies that best support student learning about complex social and scientific issues.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our student and public samples are admittedly not representative of broader populations. Future work should therefore attempt to expand the participant base and extend the findings to additional communities. Our immersive VR treatment was also shorter than many types of educational curricula. As immersive VR becomes more user-friendly and common, the length or types of curricula can expand.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, our experiments lacked a true control conditions to compare against the immersive VR treatments. To more thoroughly evaluate the effect of immersive VR on learning about climate change, immersive VR should be compared to other (non-immersive) media and different learning experiences to evaluate learning gain potential.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The future of using immersive VR for education is promising, though we do not expect the technology to replace teachers, just like Massive Open Online Courses have not replaced universities or in-person lectures. However, immersive VR has the potential to provide unique opportunities for education and to reach students with special learning needs. As such, we strategically positioned the studies and experiences in this paper as field trips (Borst et al., 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2018</a>). Students do not participate in field trips every day, but only on special occasions and for more hands-on, experiential learning. We therefore can see the immediate potential of immersive VR for tutoring and classrooms that need topical reinforcement. For example, students struggling in chemistry can go deeper into the material and learn about the composition of elements first-hand in immersive VR. We currently view immersive VR as a medium to supplement the conventional learning environment, not replace it.
