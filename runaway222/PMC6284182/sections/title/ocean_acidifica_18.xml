  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001, Î·

  <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">2</a> displays the trend of knowledge gain over time and a crucial increase in ocean acidification knowledge after the immersive VR intervention (from Time 2 to Time 3). 
  <span class="italic">Bonferroni</span>-corrected adjustments support this pattern as ocean acidification knowledge was significantly higher for all time points from Time 3 onward, compared to Times 1 and 2 [
  <span class="italic">p</span>'s &lt; 0.001].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering students who participated in at least one of the open-water dives during the study's time period, we observed a significant Dive Trip (trip 1, trip 2) X Time (first, second, third, fourth, fifth meeting) interaction, 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>(4, 46.21)</sub> = 2.85, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.034. Further inspection of this pattern revealed that only during the last session (Time 5), students who went on the first open-water dive reported significantly more ocean acidification knowledge than participants who went on the second dive (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.009). This suggests that a physical-world experience may have a positive impact on learning about complex marine phenomena if it precedes the virtual world. The effect is downstream and not immediate, however. We interpret these data with caution because this study was not a controlled experiment and there may be other factors accounting for the difference between the diving conditions.
