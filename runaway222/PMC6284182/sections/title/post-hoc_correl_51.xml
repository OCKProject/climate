 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the prior evidence suggesting that right-hand movements can predict inquisitiveness, we analyzed the data for other 
  <span class="italic">post-hoc</span> relationships. The point-biserial correlation between inquisitiveness and attitude toward the closeness of ocean acidification revealed a positive relationship (ρ = 0.19, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.014). The exact direction of this effect is unclear, however, because it is plausible that the more people believe climate change is an immediate threat, the more they may be interested in learning about the issue. On the other hand, if people report being inquisitive about climate change, they may also feel like the issue is impending. Further research is required to understand this effect more clearly. Finally, we found that participants' total body movement (ρ = 0.34, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) and rotation (ρ = 0.47, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) were significantly correlated with total search activity (e.g., total species grabbed and collected in the species count). All correlations for this study's key variables are located in Table

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data suggest that participant right hand movements can predict if people want to learn more about climate change. How can right hand movements predict inquisitiveness? Prior work suggests that people often process information differently based on the side of their physical body that is completing an action (Casasanto, 
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">2011</a>; Bailey et al., 
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">2016</a>). This idea is called processing fluency (Reber et al., 
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">2004</a>), with evidence suggesting that making one hand inaccessible (e.g., wearing a bulky ski glove on one hand) changes how people perceive the space (e.g., the side that is accessible is viewed more positively than the side that is inaccessible; Casasanto and Chrysikou, 
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">2011</a>). It is plausible that people with more right-handed movements also were inquisitive because they enjoyed the virtual experience and formed a positive association with it. This contention is worth exploring more directly in future work.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are two primary limitations of this study worth noting. First, we did not gauge handedness of the participants. Second, people at the Tribeca Film Festival paid $40 to get into the VR arcade and stood in line for our immersive VR booth throughout the week-long festival. This information suggests that subjects who participated in our study may therefore have been extrinsically motivated to acquire knowledge about novel experiences in general. Given that we have some evidence that movement can predict interest in learning about climate change, albeit data from an uncontrolled field study, we tested the robustness of these effects in a more sterile laboratory environment with university undergraduates.</p>
