 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The immersive VR HMD for this study was consistent with Study 1 and 2, and the virtual reef was identical to Study 3. An optical tracking system from Worldviz (PPT-E; Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">7</a>), with 180 Hz update rate and 20 ms latency, provided six degrees-of-freedom positional tracking each for the head and the hands. A 24-channel Ambisonic Auralizer Sound System provided spatialized audio feedback to the participants. We used this audio feedback method since it was the default setting for the laboratory. Consistent with Study 3, we used Worldviz's Vizard software to create the VR experience and Worldviz's 3D models of the Mediterranean rocky reef.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The physical space was a 12' Ã— 17' laboratory room. The virtual space was larger than the physical space, however. We encouraged participants to stand in one place and rotate their body to change their direction. Participants in the Joystick condition navigated the underwater world with a hand-held device that had both discrete buttons and continuous pad to navigate the underwater world. Participants pressed the four edges of the continuous pad on the Wiimote to navigate in cardinal directions. All input choices were communicated through Bluetooth.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participant in the Gestures condition performed a breaststroke swimming motion to navigate the underwater world. Each breaststroke motion moved the participant forward in the direction they were facing and movements were discrete accelerations. Decelerations were not representative of actual water resistance, but instead, were empirically derived and constant to minimize nausea from the underwater navigation.</p>
