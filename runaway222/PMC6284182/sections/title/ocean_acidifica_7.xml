 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean acidification is the decreasing pH of the world's surface water as a result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, primarily due to human combustion of fossil fuels (Doney et al., 2009). This process has been well documented in fieldwork and the effects of ocean acidification are particularly noticeable on calcifying organisms, as the carbonic acid formed by the carbon dioxide both breaks down and prevents the formation of their exoskeletons (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">2007</a>). Ocean acidification has precipitous consequences as well. Changes to calcifying organisms affect the competitive interactions of species farther up the food chain (Kroeker et al., 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">2012</a>). Scientists agree that the rate of acidification is expected to rise in the future, with even more dramatic effects on ocean ecosystems and other entities that rely on them (Doney et al., 2009).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand the consequences of ocean acidification, scientists have observed naturally occurring sources of sub-oceanic carbon dioxide produced by underwater volcanic vents, for example one site near the coast of Ischia, Italy. The underwater processes in this region provide scientists with a “crystal ball” to see what will happen to oceans as more carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere (Hall-Spencer et al., 
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">2008</a>; Kroeker et al., 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">2011</a>). Despite the severity of the problem and the well-supported research behind it, ocean acidification knowledge remains low and the phenomenon receives far less public attention than other climate change issues in environmental education (Kroeker et al., 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">2012</a>; Capstick et al., 
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">2016</a>). The natural case study of ocean acidification in Ischia Italy, paired with recent calls for innovative methods that emphasize behavior and attitude change to improve environmental education (McCright et al., 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">2013</a>; Wu and Lee, 
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">2015</a>), motivated our experiments to test if people can learn about climate change consequences in immersive VR.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated the effectiveness of immersive VR for learning about marine science through virtual field trips, a common metaphor for learning experiences in a virtual world (Borst et al., 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2018</a>). Our first study started at a high school in the West Coast of the United States. In immersive VR, students participated in activities based on traditional practices of marine scientists, who dive underwater and interact with species of flora and fauna to measure biodiversity. The underwater virtual world was modeled after the Ischian Reef in Italy, where naturally occurring carbon dioxide vents acidify certain areas of the reef and provide scientists with a window into a future affected by climate change. We were primarily interested in the effect of immersive VR—characterized by haptic, auditory, and other sensory feedback experienced throughout a virtual world (Ahn et al., 
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">2016</a>)—on the students' learning and knowledge gain about ocean acidification. Our subsequent studies were exploratory and tested the effect of embodiment (Study 2), movement (Study 3), and situated action (Study 4) on learning gains or an interest in learning about climate change.
