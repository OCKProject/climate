 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We report no effect of locomotion technique on the separate or overall attitude measures, the CNS scale, the NEP scale, reported temperature change, presence, and simulator sickness, [
  <span class="italic">t</span>'s &lt;1.58, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>'s &gt; 0.12]. It is possible that these null effects emerged because the locomotion techniques were not distinct enough to establish differences on perceptions-based dependent measures. That is, participants could travel in generally the same path across conditions but their approaches were dissimilar. Such contrasts may not be strong enough to affect participants, or perhaps the data reveal that psychological effects overwhelm physical effects in VR. The null main effects are not discussed further due to space limitations.
