 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We present four studies exploring the effect of an immersive VR experience on learning about marine science, specifically the consequences of climate change. All four investigations reached the same general conclusion: after an immersive VR experience, people report positive knowledge gain or an interest in learning about the causes and effects of ocean acidification. In some cases, we observed pro-environmental attitude change and 
  <span class="italic">post-hoc</span> analyses uncovered a potential mechanism for the increased learning effect in Study 4. Participants who explored, traveled, and found more marine objects also demonstrated greater change in learning from pre- to post-test scores about climate change. Our work shows that learning gains or an interest in learning can occur across different participants (high school students, college students, adults), measures (learning gain data, tracking data), and content (versions of the same ocean acidification topic were created).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several distinct contributions of this paper that go beyond the reported learning effects. First, Study 1 serves as an initial proof of concept that immersive VR can deliver complex scientific information to young adults in classrooms. Increased learning likely occurred because the abstract and distant effects of ocean acidification were brought psychologically closer to participants (Trope and Liberman, 
  <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">2010</a>). We created immersive VR experiences that brought oceanic and marine life transformations to students in a manner of minutes, plausibly changing their views on the immediacy of ocean acidification and climate change from conceptually abstract to concrete.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, we address a need in the environmental education literature by bringing innovative content and experiences to climate change education (McCright et al., 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">2013</a>; Wu and Lee, 
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">2015</a>). Our studies show that people can learn about complex social and environmental issues when information is brought to them in an immersive format. Learning also does not appear to be a momentary artifact, as our longitudinal design (Study 1) suggests that people can retain information about ocean acidification weeks after being in immersive VR. Since our paper presents data on participants not limited to college student samples, we are optimistic that these learning patterns are robust and not constrained by age, one's familiarity with new media, or the compensation that he or she received for research participation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our studies also describe the parts of an immersive VR experience that may be difficult to manipulate in a learning setting. Perhaps, our avatar and locomotion manipulations failed to modify the psychological experience of our participants because the focus on exploring and learning about complex information was crucial to the procedure. If the learning content is more familiar to subjects at the study's onset, this may allow participants to focus on their character in a virtual scene and demonstrate learning.</p>
