 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Virtual experiences can be psychologically impactful. Decades of research on Virtual Reality (VR) suggest that people internalize their virtual experiences and treat them as real (Blascovich and Bailenson, 
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">2011</a>). For example, people who have high anxiety about public speaking and give a speech in VR respond to feedback they receive from a virtual audience. If the audience appears negative, people become anxious and internalize reactions from the virtual world (Pertaub et al., 
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">2002</a>). More recent scholarship suggests that the activities in virtual spaces also provide a window into social and psychological processes. That is, the physical characteristics of an avatar can affect interpersonal dynamics (Yee and Bailenson, 
  <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">2007</a>) and embodying someone of a minority race (e.g., a black avatar) reduces levels of bias toward black individuals based on their skin color (Peck et al., 
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The prior evidence suggests that VR can be used to evaluate experiences that are both common (e.g., physical characteristics can affect social dynamics) and fantastical (e.g., changing one's race) relative to everyday life. An opportunity in the VR literature, due to an underwhelming number of experimental studies and mixed evidence, is the evaluation of 
  <span class="italic">immersive</span> VR as a medium for education. The word immersive is italicized because there are numerous studies evaluating desktop VR as a medium for learning (see Dede, 
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">2009</a>; Merchant et al., 
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">2014</a>), but there are a surprisingly small number of quantitative studies examining immersive VR as a tool for learning.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The connection between immersive VR and education has likely been underdeveloped because there are challenges associated with using virtual technology to facilitate learning. According to early but still relevant work by Bricken (
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">1991</a>), cost (e.g., purchasing your own VR system is expensive), usability (e.g., the technology or experiences in VR can be unintuitive), and fear (e.g., being placed in a fully immersive space can be daunting) are three constraints for learning in virtual environments. The novelty of a virtual experience may undermine VR's effectiveness as an educational tool and most people do not currently own immersive VR hardwareâ€”or have limited experience with the technology. Learning about science, for example, during a first experience in VR may therefore be impacted by the medium's unique infrastructure. The integrity of the virtual world must also meet the expectations of an individual if he or she could perform the task in the physical world. That is, practicing surgery in VR must replicate a genuine, unmediated surgical experience including accurate hand motions, sounds, and biological representations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current paper creates learning content and implements the idea of taking virtual field trips to begin to address these challenges. Specifically, we test whether people can learn about the consequences of climate change in immersive VR. Our interest in climate change education stems from the importance of bringing complex issues closer to people psychologically (Schuldt et al., 
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">2016</a>) and is also inspired by recent calls for innovative teaching methods to address environmental concerns (e.g., mobile games; McCright et al., 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">2013</a>; Wu and Lee, 
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">2015</a>). In this spirit, we present two laboratory experiments and two field studies that demonstrate how an immersive VR experience can facilitate learning or an interest in learning about climate change.
