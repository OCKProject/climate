  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forty-four students from a large West Coast University in the United States participated in the experiment for course credit. One participant was excluded due to hardware failures, leaving 24 females and 19 males in the final sample.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 21 participants swam using the remote control, henceforth called the Joystick condition, and 22 participants swam using their physical gestures, henceforth called the Gestures condition. Figure

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The immersive VR HMD for this study was consistent with Study 1 and 2, and the virtual reef was identical to Study 3. An optical tracking system from Worldviz (PPT-E; Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">7</a>), with 180 Hz update rate and 20 ms latency, provided six degrees-of-freedom positional tracking each for the head and the hands. A 24-channel Ambisonic Auralizer Sound System provided spatialized audio feedback to the participants. We used this audio feedback method since it was the default setting for the laboratory. Consistent with Study 3, we used Worldviz's Vizard software to create the VR experience and Worldviz's 3D models of the Mediterranean rocky reef.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The physical space was a 12' × 17' laboratory room. The virtual space was larger than the physical space, however. We encouraged participants to stand in one place and rotate their body to change their direction. Participants in the Joystick condition navigated the underwater world with a hand-held device that had both discrete buttons and continuous pad to navigate the underwater world. Participants pressed the four edges of the continuous pad on the Wiimote to navigate in cardinal directions. All input choices were communicated through Bluetooth.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participant in the Gestures condition performed a breaststroke swimming motion to navigate the underwater world. Each breaststroke motion moved the participant forward in the direction they were facing and movements were discrete accelerations. Decelerations were not representative of actual water resistance, but instead, were empirically derived and constant to minimize nausea from the underwater navigation.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Procedure</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants first read and signed a consent form. Then, they completed a pre-test on a laptop, which solicited demographic information, current knowledge about ocean acidification, and the participant's estimate of the current temperature of the room.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experimenter explained the immersive VR hardware for viewing and interacting with the virtual world. Depending on the participant's experimental condition for moving underwater, they were provided with Wiimote controls or given instructions for swimming with their hands. Participants then wore the HMD and began their VR experience. A pre-recorded narrative guided subjects throughout the experience at an adjusted level of ambient audio clarity. To ensure familiarity with the underwater world, participants had a 1 min training session to practice locomotion techniques and collect flora and fauna in a virtual underwater zone. Subjects also answered a question that asked about the current temperature since the last time they responded, an exploratory measure that assessed if exposure to climate change effects can modify perceptions about one's environment.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experimenter then placed the participant in the healthy underwater zone. A narrative explained that the virtual world was modeled around a Mediterranean rocky reef, with a colorful and diverse ecosystem of underwater plants and animals. Participants were also shown sea snails, the species they would be searching for and counting in this zone. Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F8" href="#F8">8</a> shows how the 3D model of the snail appeared to participants in each of the conditions.

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At each stage of the underwater experience, the negative consequences of ocean acidification and climate change became more apparent and exacerbated. First, subjects searched for and counted as many snails as they could find for 2 min, using their condition-specific locomotion technique, and answered a question about the current temperature since the last time they reported. This first zone is henceforth referred to as the 
   <span class="italic">High pH</span>, or low acidification zone. The experimenter then placed participants in a second, climate change affected zone, henceforth referred to as the 
   <span class="italic">Medium pH</span>, or moderate acidification zone. The narrative informed subjects that volcanic vents were releasing carbon dioxide in the water and making the water slightly more acidic, a process called ocean acidification. Comparisons were drawn between the effect of the volcanic vents and the effect of human-released carbon dioxide through the burning of fossil fuels. Descriptions about ocean acidification and its undesired changes in ocean plants and animals were also provided. Participants went on another search for snails and answered a question about the current temperature since the last time they responded. Last, participants moved to the most acidic underwater zone, henceforth referred to as the 
   <span class="italic">Low pH</span>, or high acidification zone. The narrative described that the zone composition reflected scientific predictions of what the earth's oceans will look like in 100 years if fossil fuels continue to be burned at the current rate. In this last zone, participants answered a question about the current temperature since their last response, but did not search for snails as there were none to find.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the 
   <span class="italic">Low pH</span> zone, the researcher helped participants remove the HMD, trackers (in the Gestures condition), and subjects completed a post-experience questionnaire on a laptop. Participants were debriefed and then dismissed after completion of these items.

 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measures</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consistent with our prior studies, we asked questions about ocean acidification and administered the CNS, NEP, and presence scales. We also evaluated the total distance traveled underwater as a gauge of interactivity in the virtual environment. Finally, other exploratory measures such as the perceived room temperature and ratings of simulator sickness (Kennedy et al., 
   <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">1993</a>) were investigated (for these ancillary measures, see Appendix 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">D</a>).

  <sec class="sec">
   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean acidification knowledge</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants answered three questions about ocean acidification and their responses were judged by three blind raters. The questions asked, “What is ocean acidification?,” “What are the causes of ocean acidification?,” and “What are the predicted effects of ocean acidification?” Following the procedure established in Study 1, questions received grades of 0, 1, or 2 based on their response accuracy. Questions were randomized in the judgment process to control for order effects. Ideal answers are located in Appendix 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">E</a>.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attitude</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants responded to two primary attitude questions. The first question asked how far away the consequences of ocean acidification felt, on a scale from (1) extremely far, to (5) extremely close [(
    <span class="italic">M</span> = 3.33, 
    <span class="italic">SD</span> = 1.02), min = 1.0, max = 5.0]. The second question consisted of six items where on five-point scales, participants responded to the consequences of ocean acidification, ranging from (a) unimportant to important (b), of no concern to of concern (c), irrelevant to relevant (d), means nothing to means a lot (e), doesn't matter to matters a lot (f), uninvolving to involving (Cronbach's α = 0.94). Overall, participants reported an above-average level of concern for ocean acidification, [(
    <span class="italic">M</span> = 4.05, 
    <span class="italic">SD</span> = 0.74), min = 1.67, max = 5.0]. These two measures were evaluated separately and also averaged to create an overall attitude score toward ocean acidification [(
    <span class="italic">M</span> = 3.69, 
    <span class="italic">SD</span> = 0.80), min = 1.83, max = 5.0; Cronbach's α = 0.78].
