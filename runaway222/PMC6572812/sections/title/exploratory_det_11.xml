 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Earth system, as well as in many other complex systems, the most devastating impacts are often related to multiple, compound or synergistic drivers
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>
  </span>. For instance, devastating wildfires need dry and hot conditions, available fuel, and an ignition source. Many impacts are related to threshold behavior
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>
  </span>, and multiple drivers contribute to the tipping of the system

  </span>. Consider the example shown in Fig.Â 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a> where only the synergistic combination of extreme inland precipitation and extreme storm surge leads to coastal floods

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>
  </span>. Causal inference methods can be helpful in identifying the relevant drivers from a typically large number of potential drivers that may be correlated with impacts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>
  </span>. Causal methods further allow us to identify regime shifts in functional relationships that are, e.g., triggered by extreme conditions. The challenges here include high-dimensionality, synergistic effects, and the often small sample size of observed impacts, and are relevant also in other fields such as neuroscience
