  </span> take a different dynamical systems perspective. These methods assume that interactions occur in an underlying dynamical system and attempt to uncover causal relationships based on Takens’ theorem and nonlinear state-space reconstruction. Thus, for these methods to apply it is necessary to demonstrate that a deterministic nonlinear attractor can be recovered from the data. In this sense it is thought to be complementary to the more statistical approaches discussed here. As illustrated in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b, a</a> causal relationship between two dynamical variables 
  <span class="italic">X</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Y</span> can be established if they belong to a common dynamical system, which can be reconstructed from time-delay embedding of each of the observed time series. More specifically, if variable 
  <span class="italic">X</span> can be predicted using the reconstructed system based on the time-delay embedding of variable 
  <span class="italic">Y</span>, then we know that 
  <span class="italic">X</span> had a causal effect on 
  <span class="italic">Y</span>. Nonlinear state-space methods have been applied to ecology
