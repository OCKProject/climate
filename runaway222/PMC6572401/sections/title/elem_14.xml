 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, we performed a confirmatory analysis of the dimensions for each of the variables used in the study, and later we presented a structural equation model for testing the relations between variables.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. Confirmatory Analysis of Climate</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cronbach’s alpha for climate was 0.95. The RMSEA and SRMR obtained in the confirmatory analysis for climate were 0.079 (90% CI [0.076, 0.081]) and 0.076, respectively, indicating an acceptable data fit.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The estimated correlation for the dimension ranged from 0.824 between rules and innovation to 0.916 between goal orientation and innovation, indicating strong relationships between them. For rule dimension, item 7 had the lowest impact. Regarding the innovation dimension, items 8 and 28 had the lowest effects in the construct of the dimension. For the support and goal orientation dimension, all items had similar impacts on the constructs.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the job satisfaction variable, the value of Cronbach’s alpha was 0.91. The goodness of fit values of the model were as follows: RMSEA = 0.057 (90% CI [0.053, 0.06]) and SRMR = 0.048. In addition, the values for CFI and TLI were 0.913 and 0.913, respectively, showing a good fit.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The estimated correlations between dimensions ranged from 0.319, between objects and means and conditions, to 0.826 between equipment and workload. The associations between intrinsic, firm, workload, autonomy, and objects were stronger than those between team retribution and conditions. Regarding the salary, autonomy and object dimensions, all items had similar impacts on their constructs. Within the environment/conditions and workload dimensions, the lower parameter estimated was associated with items 15 and 27.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. Confirmatory Analysis of Role Stress</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For role stress, the value of Cronbach’s alpha was 0.79. The RMSEA value was 0.034 (90% CI [0.023, 0.044]) and the SRMR value was 0.055. The values of CFI and TLI were 0.99 and 0.988, respectively, showing a good fit for the model. The correlations between the dimensions of the construct were positive, with a value of 0.167 for the dimensions of ambiguity and overload, and 0.508 for overload and conflict. Within the ambiguity dimension, the lower parameter estimate was associated with item 1; this item had a weaker impact on the dimension than the rest of them. Regarding the conflict dimension, item 7 had the weakest effect in the construct of the dimension. For the overload dimension, all items had a similar impact.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. Confirmatory Analysis of Burnout</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the burnout variable, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.80. The RMSEA was almost 0 (90% CI [0.000, 0.031]), and the SRMR value was 0.038. The CFI and TLI values were both 1, indicating a perfect fit. The correlations between dimensions were positive, with a value of 0.16 for exhaustion and lack of personal accomplishment, and 0.459 for depersonalisation and exhaustion. Within the depersonalisation and lack of personal accomplishment dimensions, the lowest parameter estimated was associated with items 3 and 9; those items had a weaker impact on their respective dimensions than the rest of the items. For the exhaustion dimension, all items had a similar impact.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.4. Structural Model of Climate as a Determinant of Job Demands</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The standardised estimates of the structural equation model testing the relations between all variables are presented in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01792-f001" href="#ijerph-16-01792-f001">Figure 1</a>. Cronbach’s alpha for the construct was 0.76. The measures of goodness of fit for the model were RMSEA = 0.064, (90% CI [0.056, 0.072]), SRMR = 0.082, CFI = 0.967 and TLI = 0.961. (
   <a rid="ijerph-16-01792-t001" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-01792-t001">Table 1</a>). The climate variable had a significant direct negative effect on burnout and role stress, and a positive impact on satisfaction; it had a stronger impact on job satisfaction than on burnout and role stress. The correlation between burnout and role stress was positive, while the correlations between job satisfaction and burnout and role stress were negative.
