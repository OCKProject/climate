  <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-01792">11</a>] model is an integrative theoretical framework for monitoring workplaces with the aim to increase job engagement and prevent burnout [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-16-01792">12</a>]. This framework is of great interest to Positive Organisational Psychology (POP) since the management of job resources and demands can negatively affect employees, especially in organisational contexts characterised by high job demands [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-16-01792">13</a>]. Demerouti et al. [
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-01792">11</a>] defined job demands as ‘those physical, social, or organisational aspects of the job that require sustained physical or mental effort and are therefore associated with certain physiological and psychological costs’ ([
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-01792">11</a>], p. 501). During the past three decades, many studies have shown that job characteristics can have a profound impact on employee well-being (i.e., job satisfaction, burnout, job engagement) and that job demands such as high work pressure, emotional demands, and role stress may lead to satisfaction problems and impaired health [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The job resources were defined as ‘those physical, psychological, social, or organisational aspects of the job that are either/or functional in achieving work goals; reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological costs; stimulate personal growth and development’ ([
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-01792">11</a>], p. 501). The job resources are means to the achievement or protection of other valued resources and may be located at the level of the organisation at large, the interpersonal and social relations (i.e., supervisor and co-worker support, team climate), the organisation of work, and at the level of the task [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The JD-R model assumes that factors associated with organisations affect employees in two ways: A process of health deterioration, and a motivational process. In the first process, job demands predict the occurrence of burnout, which is associated with negative effects for the organisation and its employees. The motivational process links the existence of labour resources with the emergence of employee engagement, which leads to positive results for both employees and organisations [
