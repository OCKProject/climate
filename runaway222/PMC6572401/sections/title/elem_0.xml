 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reforms in the public sector have been a constant of the last 20 years, and there has been a particular focus on developing human factors [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-16-01792">1</a>]. These changes have become more necessary with the recent financial crisis, which positioned human resources management as a key internal element towards which many of the administration’s new policies should be directed [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-16-01792">2</a>,
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-01792">3</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human factors are the key to improving public services. Bakker [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-16-01792">4</a>] states that people who want to change the world for the better often pursue a professional career in public service and are sometimes characterised by a ‘general altruistic motivation to serve the interests of a community of people, a state, a nation or humankind’ [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-16-01792">5</a>]. However, these employees face environments characterised by changes in performance expectations, high work demands, a hierarchical structure and bureaucratisation of work processes [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-16-01792">6</a>]; these factors tend to lead to the significant deterioration of employee well-being [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-16-01792">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The emergence in the late twentieth century of the so-called ‘Positive Psychology’, which focuses on the positive side of people [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-16-01792">8</a>], was crucial to organisational and occupational psychology. This new paradigm has encouraged human resource departments to focus on increasing opportunities, satisfaction, motivation, resources and flexibility to develop people and enhance their well-being [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-16-01792">9</a>]. In this sense, we want to analyse how the stressful and motivational characteristics of work environments influence the well-being of employees, and how to create healthy environments [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1.1. The Job Demands-Resources Model</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) [
   <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-01792">11</a>] model is an integrative theoretical framework for monitoring workplaces with the aim to increase job engagement and prevent burnout [
   <a rid="B12-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-16-01792">12</a>]. This framework is of great interest to Positive Organisational Psychology (POP) since the management of job resources and demands can negatively affect employees, especially in organisational contexts characterised by high job demands [
   <a rid="B13-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-16-01792">13</a>]. Demerouti et al. [
   <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-01792">11</a>] defined job demands as ‘those physical, social, or organisational aspects of the job that require sustained physical or mental effort and are therefore associated with certain physiological and psychological costs’ ([
   <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-01792">11</a>], p. 501). During the past three decades, many studies have shown that job characteristics can have a profound impact on employee well-being (i.e., job satisfaction, burnout, job engagement) and that job demands such as high work pressure, emotional demands, and role stress may lead to satisfaction problems and impaired health [
   <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-01792">14</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The job resources were defined as ‘those physical, psychological, social, or organisational aspects of the job that are either/or functional in achieving work goals; reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological costs; stimulate personal growth and development’ ([
   <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-01792">11</a>], p. 501). The job resources are means to the achievement or protection of other valued resources and may be located at the level of the organisation at large, the interpersonal and social relations (i.e., supervisor and co-worker support, team climate), the organisation of work, and at the level of the task [
   <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-01792">14</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The JD-R model assumes that factors associated with organisations affect employees in two ways: A process of health deterioration, and a motivational process. In the first process, job demands predict the occurrence of burnout, which is associated with negative effects for the organisation and its employees. The motivational process links the existence of labour resources with the emergence of employee engagement, which leads to positive results for both employees and organisations [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1.2. Organisational Climate and Role Stress</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the main job resources is the organisational climate [
   <a rid="B15-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-16-01792">15</a>]. Organisational climate research is interested in understanding the ways in which workers in an organisation experience and feel the climate, and how it is related to well-being. Schneider, Ehrhart and Macey [
   <a rid="B16-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-16-01792">16</a>] defined climate as ‘the shared meaning organisational members attach to the events, policies, practices, and procedures they experience and the behaviours they see being rewarded, supported and expected’. Thus, organisational climate shows how employees’ shared perceptions are connected to their work environment.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Role stress is the most studied job demand involving a natural phenomenon in organisations. It can be defined as a set of expectations, duties and obligations, applied to employees, coming from those who can influence the employees and help to define their roles [
   <a rid="B17-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-16-01792">17</a>]. It negatively affects employee efficiency [
   <a rid="B18-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-16-01792">18</a>], becoming an element that decreases employees’ well-being [
   <a rid="B19-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-16-01792">19</a>], and has equally pernicious effects on organisational performance [
   <a rid="B20-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-16-01792">20</a>]. The theory of role stress examines how characteristics of roles (e.g., conflict, ambiguity, and overload) are perceived and experienced as stressors by role incumbents, leading to affective and physiological symptoms as well as coping responses [
   <a rid="B21-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-16-01792">21</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the study of the relationship between organisational climate and role stress (job resources and job demands, respectively), the buffering hypothesis prevails. It suggests that the impact of job demands on employee well-being is weaker when they have a high level of resources [
   <a rid="B10-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-16-01792">10</a>]. The relationship between organisational climate and role stress is not a new one and has been shown to play a role in employee behaviour. Bakker and Demerouti [
   <a rid="B22-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-16-01792">22</a>] showed that the direction of this relationship can be positive or negative, and that the difference lies in the level of job resources (social support, job control and feedback) [
   <a rid="B12-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-16-01792">12</a>]. In this line, Hemingway and Smith [
   <a rid="B23-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-16-01792">23</a>] explored how organisational climate is associated with increased stress levels and the occurrence of negative behaviours for organisations; also, Pecino [
   <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-01792">24</a>], using a sample of public employees, showed how organisational climate is strongly and negatively related to role stress.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1.3. The Motivational Process: Organisational Climate and Job Satisfaction</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Job satisfaction is certainly the most researched topic in the history of industrial and organisational psychology [
   <a rid="B25-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-16-01792">25</a>]. The most relevant definition of job satisfaction is that offered by Locke [
   <a rid="B26-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-16-01792">26</a>], who defined it as a ‘positive or pleasant emotional state resulting from the subjective perception of the person’s work experiences’. This topic is of great importance in many models that seek to improve employee well-being [
   <a rid="B27-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-16-01792">27</a>] and organisational efficiency [
   <a rid="B28-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-16-01792">28</a>]. Many studies have shown that this variable has positive effects on organisations and their employees [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The organisational climate can affect employees’ well-being, directly influencing burnout. Under this hypothesis, Winnubst [
   <a rid="B38-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-16-01792">38</a>] carried out a pioneering study and concluded that organisational climate is an important antecedent of burnout. Recent studies have shown that formal support groups create organisational climates that decrease stressors such as burnout [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also, the study of the relationship between role stress and job satisfaction is of major importance. Recently, several studies have presented evidence of this relationship in different country, industry, and labour contexts [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The JD-R model also provides a relationship between the consequences of job demands and those of job resources. A recent longitudinal study by Figueiredo-Ferraz et al. [
   <a rid="B42-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-16-01792">42</a>], who focused on analysing the relationship between burnout and job satisfaction, found a significant two-way relationship between these variables.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other findings explained that—relative to private sector employees—public servants became the most engaged by intrinsic factors including work-related resources [
   <a rid="B43-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-16-01792">43</a>]. Work engagement significantly mediated the relationship between job resources and personal resources of public employees. Public sector workers were more strongly motivated by the desire to work in a supportive working environment. Most observed differences were explained by differences in job content such as skill variety, feedback, or task identity, not by the sector itself [

Also, role stress will show a significant and positive reciprocal relationship with burnout (hypothesis 3). Furthermore, organisational climate will show a significant and negative reciprocal relationship with burnout (hypothesis 4) and role stress will show a significant and negative reciprocal relationship with job satisfaction (hypothesis 5). Finally, job satisfaction will have a reciprocal relationship, both significant and negative, with burnout (hypothesis 6).</p>
