 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this work was to study the reciprocal relationships between a job resource (organisational climate), a job demand (role stress) and indicators of employee well-being (burnout and job satisfaction). The results confirmed that organisational climate is significantly and negatively linked to role stress (−0.594), which suggests that the existence of a positive climate would buffer role stress in workers.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the JD-R model, the direct relationships between demands (role stress) and labour resources (organisational climate) are not specified as positive or negative correlations. Bakker and Demerouti [
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-16-01792">22</a>] considered this as an empirical question related to the occupational context of the sample under study. Thus, in some organisational contexts, the relationship may be positive and in others negative, depending on variables such as the hierarchy, status, educational level and occupational sector. In the context of public employees, the results obtained confirmed the significant and negative relationships found by previous studies [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, climate showed a significant and positive reciprocal influence on job satisfaction (0.746), confirming the motivational process of the JD-R model. Furthermore, previous studies showed that when employees perceive their organisational climate in a more positive way, they are more satisfied [
  <a rid="B31-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-16-01792">31</a>]. Also, we found that role stress and burnout are significantly and positively related (0.953). Thus, the higher the degree of role stress, the higher the incidence of burnout, which impairs employees’ health, as observed in the JD-R model and in previous studies [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-16-01792">19</a>,
  <a rid="B33-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-16-01792">33</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results confirmed that job demands and resources could interact to positively or negatively affect well-being in two cross-linked relationships [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-16-01792">12</a>]. On the one hand, organisational climate showed a significant and negative influence on burnout, which shows that a good climate is related to less burnout. Recent studies have shown that formal support groups create organisational climates that cushion employee stressors related to socio-emotional work such as burnout [
  <a rid="B59-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59-ijerph-16-01792">59</a>]. On the other hand, the results confirmed that role stress is significantly and negatively related to job satisfaction, which could indicate that higher role stress can lead to lower job satisfaction and, therefore, to worse employee well-being. This result is in line with the findings of recent studies [
  <a rid="B40-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-16-01792">40</a>,
  <a rid="B41-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-16-01792">41</a>] and clearly shows how reducing stress levels improves employee satisfaction.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the results confirmed that job satisfaction has a significant and negative relationship with burnout. In a recent longitudinal study, Figueiredo-Ferraz et al. [
  <a rid="B42-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-16-01792">42</a>] analysed the relationship between burnout and job satisfaction. They found a significant two-way relationship between the two variables, with more intense effects when job satisfaction was an antecedent of burnout rather than vice versa.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study represents a step towards understanding the relationships between variables that affect the well-being of employees in public service. These results will be of great interest in the POP field as they will help to promote this viewpoint in the field of human resource management in public administration. The effects of job resources could enhance employees’ well-being, increasing satisfaction and preventing burnout [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4.1. Practical Implications</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results obtained in this study have important practical implications for managing the employees of public universities. A positive climate is key to enhancing and fostering the well-being of public employees, as the perception of a positive organisational climate leads to more satisfied employees. Such employees are less stressed and suffer from less burnout in their work, which should encourage those responsible for managing people to invest in creating comfortable and positive organisational climates. Such policies would not only help produce more positive results at work, but they would also enhance the development of work in a healthy environment. Furthermore, as was already mentioned when discussing the JD-R model, when a professional job is developed in a job environment characterised by the existence of role stressors, it will have negative effects on the health of employees. Therefore, it is important to establish policies in public administration that help employees have control over their demand level and increase their resources.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4.2. Limitations and Future Directions </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the results of our study should be considered with the following limitations in mind. First, the results were obtained from self-reports and might be affected by common method variance. Second, the sample was very specific and limited to public employees in a Spanish context; thus, the results cannot be generalised to other types of organisation or public administration. Third, the design of the study had a cross-sectional nature, which prevented us from drawing conclusions about the temporal order of effects and causality relationships. To avoid such limitations, future research should utilise a longitudinal methodology within a multi-method approach [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our changing world, priority should be given to the study of how the well-being of employees in the public sector affects the execution of their duties. Also, the study of different mediating and moderating links in the relation between job demands, resources and well-being in the public context is important. Thus, a more inclusive approach should be taken to examining how work variables affect performance [
   <a rid="B60-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60-ijerph-16-01792">60</a>]. It will be interesting for future work to consider the multi-level relationships between attitudes, behaviours, and performance aggregated on the team level [
