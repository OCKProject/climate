 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the main job resources is the organisational climate [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-16-01792">15</a>]. Organisational climate research is interested in understanding the ways in which workers in an organisation experience and feel the climate, and how it is related to well-being. Schneider, Ehrhart and Macey [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-16-01792">16</a>] defined climate as ‘the shared meaning organisational members attach to the events, policies, practices, and procedures they experience and the behaviours they see being rewarded, supported and expected’. Thus, organisational climate shows how employees’ shared perceptions are connected to their work environment.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Role stress is the most studied job demand involving a natural phenomenon in organisations. It can be defined as a set of expectations, duties and obligations, applied to employees, coming from those who can influence the employees and help to define their roles [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-16-01792">17</a>]. It negatively affects employee efficiency [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-16-01792">18</a>], becoming an element that decreases employees’ well-being [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-16-01792">19</a>], and has equally pernicious effects on organisational performance [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-16-01792">20</a>]. The theory of role stress examines how characteristics of roles (e.g., conflict, ambiguity, and overload) are perceived and experienced as stressors by role incumbents, leading to affective and physiological symptoms as well as coping responses [
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-16-01792">21</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the study of the relationship between organisational climate and role stress (job resources and job demands, respectively), the buffering hypothesis prevails. It suggests that the impact of job demands on employee well-being is weaker when they have a high level of resources [
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-16-01792">10</a>]. The relationship between organisational climate and role stress is not a new one and has been shown to play a role in employee behaviour. Bakker and Demerouti [
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-16-01792">22</a>] showed that the direction of this relationship can be positive or negative, and that the difference lies in the level of job resources (social support, job control and feedback) [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-16-01792">12</a>]. In this line, Hemingway and Smith [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-16-01792">23</a>] explored how organisational climate is associated with increased stress levels and the occurrence of negative behaviours for organisations; also, Pecino [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-01792" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-01792">24</a>], using a sample of public employees, showed how organisational climate is strongly and negatively related to role stress.
