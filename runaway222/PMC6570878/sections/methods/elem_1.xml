  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was conducted in Seoul (37.34°N, 126.59°E), which is the capital and largest metropolis of South Korea with a population of approximately 10 million [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Seoul spans a land area of 605.25 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>, which is only 0.6% of the total area of South Korea, but 1/5 of the total population of South Korea live in Seoul (16,492 person/km
   <span class="sup">2</span>). Seoul has a temperate climate with distinct seasons and a wide range of temperatures across the year.

  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We utilized data on ED visits recorded by the National Emergency Medical Center (NEMC). The NEMC is a government-funded national ED control agency, and one of its roles is to collect data on ED visits to improve the quality of emergency medical service and health care. The collected data included patient’s information such as sex, age, type of insurance, level of consciousness, vital signs, means of transportation, emergency operative procedures, time variables (visit, discharge, and admission), critical care requirement, disposition status after the ED encounter, duration of hospitalization, and final outcomes (information regarding discharge, transfer, and death) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. These data are transferred electronically from the hospitals to the NEMC via a National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS). The agency maintains an accurate assessment system and annually reports the results to the Ministry of Health and Welfare [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. The NEDIS database has been widely used by broad range of epidemiological researchers due to its reliability [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. ED visit data were obtained from the NEDIS of the NEMC between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2014 for this study. ED visit data were coded and classified according to the discharge diagnosis using the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10). Patients with ICD-10 code N17 based on the primary and secondary disease codes were considered to have AKI (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S2). Because the data were based on ED visit incidence, the onset was regarded as acute even in case of CKD, although it could be regarded as an acute exacerbation of CKD. In this sense, we examined acute renal illness as a whole. In addition, we stratified the patients with both CKD (ICD-10 code N18) and AKI (ICD-10 code N17) in the sensitivity analysis due to the possible discrepancies in the pathophysiological mechanisms of AKI with pre-existing CKD (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S1). Patients were also stratified by sex (male and female), age (&lt; 65 years and ≥ 65 years), and season (warm and cool) when they visited the ED. We also analyzed the comorbidities for AKI, namely, hypertension and diabetes.

  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Automated Synoptic Observing System (ASOS) data from 2010 to 2014 were obtained from the Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA). ASOS collects data every minute, including temperatures (°C), relative humidity (%), and air pressure (hPa), and KMA provides city-level daily average of these meteorological variables. Because air pollution has been reported to have a short-term effect on renal morbidity [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], we also obtained hourly concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of &lt; 10 μm (PM
   <sub>10</sub>) from 27 monitoring sites operated by the Korean National Institute of Environmental Research. Hourly mean concentrations across the monitoring sites were calculated by averaging monitor-specific concentrations, then we calculated the daily representative concentrations of PM
   <sub>10</sub> by averaging the 24-h values from all monitoring stations in Seoul. The data were grouped into two seasons: warm (April–September) and cool (October–March).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analysis</div>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a time-stratified case-crossover design based on conditional logistic regression to analyze the short-term effects of temperature on AKI-ED visits. The case-crossover design, which is a variant of the case-control design, is largely used in environmental epidemiology research [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>] for evaluating when the outcome is acute and the exposure is transient [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Comparisons were made between the case day (the day of the case visits ED) and several control days. In this way, each patient serves as his/her own control on days other than the case day with measured and unmeasured potential confounding factors such as age, sex, smoking status, and other genetic predisposition. Moreover, these are automatically controlled by perfect matching. The control days were selected as the same month and year and matched by day of week for each case. This time-stratified method of selecting comparison days avoids bias resulting from time trends in examination of the environmental exposures. Long-term and seasonal time trends and day of the week were also controlled by design [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. We included potential time-varying confounders, which are relative humidity and barometric pressure in the model. We also performed sensitivity analyses to examine the confounding effects of PM
   <sub>10</sub> (lag 0–1).
  </p>
  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore the susceptibility of groups to the influence of temperature, we modelled the interactions between temperature and each subgroup, namely, age, sex, comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes), and season, to determine whether the effects of temperature differ in these aspects because the case-crossover design cancelled out the potential confounding time-invariant variables.</p>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The exposure–response curve of the relationship between ambient temperature and ED visits was also explored for both warm and cool seasons. For the nonlinear (J-shaped) relationship of the warm season, we fitted value for each observations and the penalized spline curve from conditional logistic model and conducted a piecewise linear regression analysis to estimate the threshold temperature [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. Using a grid search method with a threshold temperature range of 17 °C–27 °C, we found the point that produces the minimum Akaike information criterion among the equally spaced grid points, 0.1 °C [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. The lag effect, lagged by up to 7 days before ED visit, was also analyzed because many studies found a short latency of the effect of temperatures on morbidity [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. The overall associations are estimated as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) per 1 °C increase in temperature. Moreover, we tested for the significant difference between estimates in each subgroup as shown below [
