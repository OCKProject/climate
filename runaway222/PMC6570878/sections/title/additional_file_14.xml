       <span class="bold">Figure S1.</span> Effects of temperature on emergency department visits for acute kidney injury including and excluding the patient with chronic kidney disease. The overall associations are estimated as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals per 1°C increase in temperature. Considerable differences are not observed. Abbreviations: AKI, acute kidney injury; CKD, Chronic Kidney Disease.

The approximate range of the threshold temperature was between 19°C and 27°C with grid points 0.1°C. (a) Fitted value from conditional logistic model. (b) Penalized spline curve for temperature term in the conditional logistic model. (c) Predicted curve for temperature term.
