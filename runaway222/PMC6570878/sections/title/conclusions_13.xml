 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the estimation of the impact of temperature on ED visits of patients with AKI in Seoul, a considerable health burden at elevated temperatures was identified for this population. Projections from global climate models indicate that the variability and extremes of temperature that may affect AKI are likely to increase in the future. Thus, the relationship between temperature and AKI needs to be investigated. Our findings suggest that increases in temperatures are a risk factor for AKI. Patient management and education need to be improved as extreme temperatures become more prevalent with climate change.</p>
