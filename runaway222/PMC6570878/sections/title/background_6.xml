 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasing recognition of climate change and global warming has led to a growing interest of researchers in assessing the potential mechanisms by which it may influence health [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. The adverse impacts of ambient temperature on health have been described in numerous epidemiological studies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>], and some studies have reported that escalations in temperature or heat (waves) are among the risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AKI is defined as “a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage that happens within a few hours or a few days” regardless of the cause [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. AKI is a complex and serious health condition, and its occurrence is associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), reduced quality of life, and even death [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. Therefore, AKI is a critical public health concern. The incidence of AKI is higher than that of acute lung injury or severe sepsis, and AKI is associated with adverse clinical outcomes and high medical costs, including increased mortality, increased hospitalization periods, and the increased risk of requirement for chronic dialysis in survivors [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. The prevalence of AKI has been increasing in South Korea, and this phenomenon combined with the aging of the population poses an economic and social burden (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>).

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The primary underlying mechanism for pre-renal AKI is a series of impairment in renal autoregulation related to pre-glomerular arteriolar vasodilation, by prostaglandin I2 and nitric oxide and post-glomerular arteriolar vasoconstriction, by angiotensin II [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. True hypovolemia or a reduction in the effective circulating volume, such as decreased cardiac output, systemic vasodilation, or intra-renal vasoconstriction results in impaired renal autoregulation, leading to decreased glomerular filtration rate, which is proportional to the level of hypoperfusion [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. Dehydration due to exposure to high temperature may lead to decreased intravascular volume, increased vascular resistance, or low cardiac output, which eventually lead to hemodynamically mediated (pre-renal) AKI [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. Moreover, acute volume depletion leads to increased proximal reabsorption, which affects tubulo-glomerular feedback, resulting in a pre-renal reduction in glomerular filtration rate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerous studies have investigated the association between ambient temperature and morbidity, particularly renal function. Most of these studies have utilized hospital admission data to demonstrate that renal morbidity rates are associated with temperature increases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. However, at our location, hospital admissions would not be appropriate for assessing the acute short-term association in a time transient study because most admissions are scheduled in Seoul. Inclusion of scheduled admissions could attenuate observed associations with ambient temperature, due to inclusion of admissions for which timing of the event was not caused by ambient temperature. Therefore, in this research, emergency department (ED) data for unscheduled visits were used as the outcome measure to gain a better understanding of the relationship between ambient temperature and AKI morbidity in Seoul, a city with a temperate climate with distinct seasons. We performed a time-stratified case-crossover analysis based on conditional logistic regression to investigate the association. In addition, we examined the shape of the associations as well as lag effects. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the generalizability of the association between ambient temperature and AKI using ED visit data in Seoul.
