 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a time-stratified case-crossover design based on conditional logistic regression to analyze the short-term effects of temperature on AKI-ED visits. The case-crossover design, which is a variant of the case-control design, is largely used in environmental epidemiology research [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>] for evaluating when the outcome is acute and the exposure is transient [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Comparisons were made between the case day (the day of the case visits ED) and several control days. In this way, each patient serves as his/her own control on days other than the case day with measured and unmeasured potential confounding factors such as age, sex, smoking status, and other genetic predisposition. Moreover, these are automatically controlled by perfect matching. The control days were selected as the same month and year and matched by day of week for each case. This time-stratified method of selecting comparison days avoids bias resulting from time trends in examination of the environmental exposures. Long-term and seasonal time trends and day of the week were also controlled by design [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. We included potential time-varying confounders, which are relative humidity and barometric pressure in the model. We also performed sensitivity analyses to examine the confounding effects of PM
  <sub>10</sub> (lag 0–1).

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore the susceptibility of groups to the influence of temperature, we modelled the interactions between temperature and each subgroup, namely, age, sex, comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes), and season, to determine whether the effects of temperature differ in these aspects because the case-crossover design cancelled out the potential confounding time-invariant variables.</p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The exposure–response curve of the relationship between ambient temperature and ED visits was also explored for both warm and cool seasons. For the nonlinear (J-shaped) relationship of the warm season, we fitted value for each observations and the penalized spline curve from conditional logistic model and conducted a piecewise linear regression analysis to estimate the threshold temperature [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. Using a grid search method with a threshold temperature range of 17 °C–27 °C, we found the point that produces the minimum Akaike information criterion among the equally spaced grid points, 0.1 °C [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. The lag effect, lagged by up to 7 days before ED visit, was also analyzed because many studies found a short latency of the effect of temperatures on morbidity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. The overall associations are estimated as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) per 1 °C increase in temperature. Moreover, we tested for the significant difference between estimates in each subgroup as shown below [
