 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Automated Synoptic Observing System (ASOS) data from 2010 to 2014 were obtained from the Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA). ASOS collects data every minute, including temperatures (°C), relative humidity (%), and air pressure (hPa), and KMA provides city-level daily average of these meteorological variables. Because air pollution has been reported to have a short-term effect on renal morbidity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], we also obtained hourly concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of &lt; 10 μm (PM
  <sub>10</sub>) from 27 monitoring sites operated by the Korean National Institute of Environmental Research. Hourly mean concentrations across the monitoring sites were calculated by averaging monitor-specific concentrations, then we calculated the daily representative concentrations of PM
  <sub>10</sub> by averaging the 24-h values from all monitoring stations in Seoul. The data were grouped into two seasons: warm (April–September) and cool (October–March).
