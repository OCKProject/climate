 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed a considerable increase in the risk of AKI that was associated with escalations in ambient temperature over all seasons, and the risk for AKI was particularly higher during the warm season. In addition, a noticeable nonlinear relationship with temperature was found during the warm season, indicating a severe risk for AKI associated with ambient temperatures above the threshold of 22.3 °C. Our findings are in line with those of previous studies that show evidence supporting a positive association between high temperatures and the risk of AKI. Two studies from the US and one from Australia found that hospital admissions for AKI were substantially increased during heat wave periods compared with non-heat wave periods [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. In addition, a study of temperature effects on AKI hospital admissions in California reported a 7.4% increase in AKI admissions associated with each 10 °F (5.56 °C) increase in daily mean temperature [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>], while 8.28% increase in AKI-ED visits associated with each 10 °F during the warm season in Seoul of our study. Given that our results were obtained using individual ED visit data, this study strengthens the epidemiologic evidence of an acute adverse effect of ambient temperature on AKI morbidity.
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed considerable adverse effects of temperature on ED visits due to AKI in both warm and cool seasons as the temperature increases, but the risk was greater during the warm season than the cool season and was even greater above the threshold temperature of 22.3 °C. Many studies have focused on the health effects of heatwaves or high temperatures [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. However, the risk for AKI substantially increased in temperatures above 22.3 °C in the present study, suggesting that the threshold temperature is lower than that used in previous studies. This finding is consistent with that of Kovats et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>] who reported that threshold temperatures of 18 °C for diseases of the renal system and 21 °C for renal failure. Additionally, they reported that kidney stones have a considerable effect on hospital admissions for renal disease in Greater London, UK. This suggests that not only extremely hot temperatures and heatwaves, but also moderate temperatures affect health. The effects of non-extreme weather are less focused in the literature. The increased risk of AKI from outdoor exposures during the warm season places greater emphasis on the preventive aspects of AKI.
 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some studies explored the temporal lag patterns of the association between temperature and health risks. For the association of temperature with morbidity, lag days were reported ranging from the same day [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>] to a month [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. According to Fletcher et al. (2012), the strongest association between the mean temperature and AKI hospital admissions occurs at lag 1 (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.12), while significant associations were also observed at lags 0 and 2 (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.09 and OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.08, respectively). Our result showed more acute effects of temperature on AKI-ED visits for lag 0 in both seasons. Similarly, Basu et al. found acute effects of temperature (lag 0) on ED visits in California, USA [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. In Atlanta, USA, Chen et al. also found that increased temperature had same-day (lag 0) effects on both all renal diseases and AKI [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PM
  <sub>10</sub> was assessed in the model. Associations between PM and daily mortality [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>], cardiovascular hospital admissions in the elderly [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>], and infant mortality [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>] have been identified in Korean cities. Furthermore, a recent longitudinal study among US veterans demonstrated the associations of PM concentrations with a higher risk of reducing renal function [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], development of CKD, and progression to end-stage renal disease [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. It is biologically plausible that the inflammation and oxidative stress linked to PM exposure could be an underlying mechanism for a broader number of disease outcomes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>], including renal disorders. Nonetheless, the effect of temperature on AKI was robust with a potential confounder of air pollutants in our analysis. Moreover, our findings remained statistically significant after adjusting for PM
  <sub>10</sub>. In addition, the fact that the temperature effect is robust to the adjustment for PM in our analysis suggests that PM is not solely responsible for the higher risk of AKI. Toxicity depends on the components of PM [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>], and exposure patterns vary by seasons due to behavioral changes of individuals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>]. Thus, the adverse effects of PM on AKI need to be further validated.
 </p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to expectations, the temperature effects of AKI did not vary substantially across demographic characteristics. The elderly may be more vulnerable due to a reduction in thermoregulatory abilities, age-related declines in kidney function, adaptation behaviors, low self-care abilities, and health comorbidities. However, although the risk of the elderly was slightly higher among those aged ≥ 65 years than among those aged &lt; 65 years, the difference was not statistically significant (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.87). No significant difference by sex was noted in this study either (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.96).
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, we also examined the susceptibility to ambient temperatures of persons with comorbidities of prevalent chronic illnesses, particularly hypertension and diabetes. Although AKI is more prevalent among individuals who already have hypertension or diabetes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>], our analysis of temperature-related AKI-ED visits was not significantly associated with these comorbidities. Further in-depth studies are required to clarify these discrepancies.
 </p>
 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even small acute changes in kidney function can result in both short- and long-term complications. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of AKI are associated with an increased survival rate and restore complete renal function. This results in reduced cost of treatment [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>] because CKD patients require hemo- or peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation. If AKI patients without premorbid CKD survive, then most of them recover to dialysis independence [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>]. Therefore, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment is crucial to prevent subsequent CKD, end-stage renal disease, or death [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>] in AKI patients.
 </p>
 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study furthers our understanding of the association between temperature and AKI in Seoul. However, our study has some limitations, including the possible misclassification of exposures intrinsic in ecological studies. The use of ambient rather than personal measurements of temperature may have resulted in bias, which probably underestimated the association. Also, differences between indoor and outdoor temperatures due to air conditioning or heating may affect the association between temperature and AKI outcomes. Similar to other environmental epidemiological studies on AKI [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>], we used the ICD-10 code for the definition of AKI without knowing whether the standard Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria were used for diagnosis. With ICD-codes, diagnosis of AKD could be incorrectly reported or underreported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. We did not have information on medication, as nephrotoxic medications contribute to a substantial proportion of AKI. Further, there may be other individual factors influencing the association between air temperature and AKI. Finally, our study was conducted in a single city; therefore, the findings may not be applicable to other target populations in other areas. To explicitly understand the effects of temperature on AKI, multi-city studies are required.
 </p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Undoubtedly, AKI is affected by more complex factors aside from ambient temperature. However, despite these limitations, we found convincing evidence supporting that temperature might be a triggering or exacerbating factor for AKI. The findings from this study have considerable public health implications because it may help elucidate the effects of ambient temperature on AKI.</p>
