 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained data on ED visits from the National Emergency Medical Center for 21,656 reported cases of AKI from 2010 to 2014. Time-stratified case-crossover design analysis based on conditional logistic regression was used to analyze short-term effects of ambient temperature on AKI after controlling for relevant covariates. The shape of the exposureâ€“response curve, effect modification by individual demographic characteristics, season, and comorbidities, as well as lag effects, were investigated.</p>
