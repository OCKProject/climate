 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The characteristics of the patients who visited the ED for AKI during the 5-year study period (2010–2014) are shown in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. There were 21,656 cases with 73,755 controls, yielding 3 or 4 control days for each patient. Of these, 12,465 visits (57.56%) were by men, and 13,516 visits (62.41%) were by patients aged 65 years or older. The number of ED visits due to AKI did not vary by season (
  <span class="italic">X</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.2, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.6538). The daily mean temperature was 12.49 °C (standard deviation (SD) ±11.03) for the overall study period, 21.16 °C (SD ± 5.75) for the warm season (April–September), and 3.79 °C (SD ± 7.71) for the cold season (October–March). The daily mean relative humidity was 60.43% for the overall study period and was higher for the warm season (65.01%, SD ± 15.20) than that for the cool season (55.84%, SD ± 13.64). The daily mean concentration of particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM
  <sub>10</sub>) was 47.08 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span> (SD ± 27.35) for the overall study period (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). The concentration of PM
  <sub>10</sub> in Seoul is relatively high in spring and winter and relatively low in summer and fall. The monthly summary can be found in Additional file

  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>. Overall, the risk of AKI increases as temperature increases. In particular, the risk sharply increased during the warm season. The threshold temperature was found to be at 22.3 °C from grid searching (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S2), with the OR increasing above this threshold. The OR above 22.3 °C during the warm season was 1.0235 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0230, 1.0239), while the OR below 22.3 °C was 1.0019 (95% CI: 1.0017, 1.0020).

  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows the overall, sex-, age-, comorbidity-, and season-specific associations between ambient temperature and AKI from the final model (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S2). We illustrated the OR per 1 °C increase in ambient temperature for various categories on a single day (lag 0) because the greatest risk was observed for lag 0 (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S4). There was strong evidence of associations between temperature and AKI (OR = 1.0087, 
  <span class="italic">P &lt;</span> 0.001). The associations were significant in both sexes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). However, although the risk estimate is higher among men (OR = 1.0088, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.004) than among women (OR = 1.0086, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.014), the difference between the two groups was not significant (

  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.027), the difference was not significant (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.875). By contrast, there was little evidence of association with comorbidities. The associations were still positive but not significant for both comorbid hypertension (OR = 1.0022, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.633) and comorbid diabetes (OR = 1.0074, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.181). The associations were significant in both seasons, and the risk estimate was higher during the warm season (OR = 1.0149, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.001) than the cool season (OR = 1.0059, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.039). In the sensitivity analysis, the effect of ambient temperature was examined with and without PM
  <sub>10</sub> in the model, and the temperature effect was robust to the adjustment of PM
  <sub>10</sub> (Additional file

Similar lag patterns were also observed among subgroups by sex and age (Additional file
