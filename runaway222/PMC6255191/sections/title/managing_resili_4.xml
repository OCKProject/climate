 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although quantification of systemic resilience has long remained elusive, a long-standing literature documents the ways in which genes, lifestyle, diseases, and other stressors affect healthy dynamic functioning. Indeed, while a systematic approach to managing resilience is missing, the different knobs to turn are basically known. Chronic stress in animals and humans is perhaps the best-known condition that may undermine resilience. The body responds to stress through a suite of reactions that allow energy bursts for fight or flight reactions. When such a state becomes sustained too long, the resulting “allostatic load” causes wear and tear on the body (
  <a rid="r93" ref-type="bibr" href="#r93">93</a>). As a result, the reactive scope of the organism to mount an adequate response to challenges gradually erodes (
  <a rid="r94" ref-type="bibr" href="#r94">94</a>). Chronic stress is also one of the leading adverse life events that have been shown to increase the risk of mental disorders such as depression (
  <a rid="r95" ref-type="bibr" href="#r95">95</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the effects of prolonged stress on health have been long known, the mechanisms explaining the multifactorial nature of resilience with all its cross-linkages are only starting to be unraveled. One line of work is now revealing how stressors to the mood system may affect the immune system. For instance, experiments on monkeys reveal how up-regulation of proinflammatory genes in response to perceived social isolation comes at the cost of impaired response to viral infectious challenge and increased risk of chronic disease and mortality (
  <a rid="r96" ref-type="bibr" href="#r96">96</a>). However, this is only one of many mechanisms that may help explain correlations between life conditions and the risks of morbidity and mortality. The complexity of this issue is well illustrated by work on the relationship between income and disease (
  <a rid="r93" ref-type="bibr" href="#r93">93</a>, 
  <a rid="r97" ref-type="bibr" href="#r97">97</a>). Numerous mechanisms contribute to the high disease burden of low-income groups, and malnutrition is one of the obvious elements (
  <a rid="r98" ref-type="bibr" href="#r98">98</a>). As inflammatory responses and postresponse repair are costly in terms of energy and proteins, malnutrition limits the capacity to fend off disease. This mechanism is vividly illustrated by the sharp rise of active tuberculosis in human populations when food becomes limiting (
  <a rid="r98" ref-type="bibr" href="#r98">98</a>, 
  <a rid="r99" ref-type="bibr" href="#r99">99</a>). The cost of mounting an immune response in turn also affects further resilience of an organism. For instance, in bumblebees an experimentally induced immune response led to increased mortality if the animals were not allowed to increase their feeding rate to compensate for the increased energy costs (
  <a rid="r100" ref-type="bibr" href="#r100">100</a>). Last, the effects of poverty on systemic resilience may have a cognitive component. Worries related to decisions that could affect resources tend to impede overall cognitive functioning (
  <a rid="r101" ref-type="bibr" href="#r101">101</a>). This in turn affects the quality of other choices, potentially leading to further negative health effects (
  <a rid="r102" ref-type="bibr" href="#r102">102</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taking a health-management perspective, an obvious way to promote resilience is to minimize stressors that undermine it. However, there is an interesting paradox. While strong challenges can damage an organism, many forms of moderate challenge are known to promote longevity. For instance, moderate caloric restriction tends to promote longevity in animals (
  <a rid="r103" ref-type="bibr" href="#r103">103</a>, 
  <a rid="r104" ref-type="bibr" href="#r104">104</a>). Similarly, while extreme physical activity can have negative effects (
  <a rid="r105" ref-type="bibr" href="#r105">105</a>), the life-extending effect of moderate to vigorous exercise is well documented (
  <a rid="r106" ref-type="bibr" href="#r106">106</a>). Indeed, the proverbial observation “if you don’t use it, you lose it” applies to many functional aspects. On the other hand, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” is too much of an extrapolation. For example, heat- and drought-stressed individuals of the Australian white-plumed honeyeaters lost weight and were less likely to be recaptured in the following spring, presumably because they had died (
  <a rid="r107" ref-type="bibr" href="#r107">107</a>). On a cellular level, the dual effect of challenge on longevity has been linked to the effects of ROS. While ROS can cause cellular damage, low levels of ROS triggered by challenges such as caloric restriction, hypoxia, temperature stress, and physical activity may actually promote longevity by inducing an adaptive response (
  <a rid="r108" ref-type="bibr" href="#r108">108</a>). While such molecular insights are fascinating, moderate challenge may also help maintain function in simpler ways. For instance, exercise in the elderly helps maintain muscle strength (
  <a rid="r109" ref-type="bibr" href="#r109">109</a>), which is an essential asset for systemic resilience in many ways.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So far, the effects of single factors on resilience are often poorly understood (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>), let alone the full picture of how different mechanisms interact to shape systemic resilience (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>). One limitation of research into this issue is the fact that the dependent variable is typically lifespan or mortality rates. This implies the need for large cohorts and limits the scope for experimental studies. The possibility of quantifying and monitoring systemic resilience of live animals and humans dynamically would greatly enhance the power of studies considering the interactive effects of different drivers. Moreover, lifespan itself is an end point of limited value. In geriatric care, “adding life to years” may often be more valued than “adding years to life.”
