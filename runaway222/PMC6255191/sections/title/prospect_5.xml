 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dazzling web of mechanisms that shape resilience may seem disappointingly complex. However, even if the details are not resolved, taking a resilience-based approach need not be complicated. It may seem challenging to choose between the many potentially relevant actions, but the multifactorial nature of resilience implies that the precise choice actually may not matter too much. Often, working on any of the plausibly related elements should help. Take the three examples from the introduction. To halt the demise of pollinators, it will help to increase the availability of flowers in a landscape and also to reduce exposure to pesticides (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While for humans caring about general health is broadly embraced, healthcare diagnoses and treatments still remain focused mostly on single issues (
  <a rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" href="#r35">35</a>). Singling out well-defined sources of illness remains important. However, many, if not most, health issues are related to interactions involving multiple subsystems of the organism. This becomes vividly clear in cases in which severe loss of resilience causes multiple failures to arise simultaneously. For instance, in dairy cows the onset of lactation may trigger symptoms ranging from infections and metabolic disorders to entire collapse. Similarly, in the frail elderly a broad set of somatic, mood, cognitive, and social problems tend to coincide. Clearly, such multimorbidity is the tip of the iceberg. A tightly knit web of subsystems shapes systemic resilience in all organisms.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The view of organisms as a complex adaptive network logically requires an holistic approach to managing resilience in animals and man. It is easy to forget that fixing a problem with medication or other specific treatment may carry the risk of reducing overall systemic resilience. The accumulation of chronic illnesses despite ever more sophisticated drugs and devices suggests that sustaining and restoring resilience should itself become a major activity. The novel possibilities of measuring resilience may become a game changer in this respect. Routinely providing real-time monitoring of all individuals in herds of thousands of electronically marked dairy cows allows early detection of deviations that hint at individuals that are not doing well (
  <a rid="r112" ref-type="bibr" href="#r112">112</a>). Similarly, wearable sensors are starting to allow the remote monitoring of large groups of patients. Moreover, the general public is beginning to share data from individualsâ€™ own wearable electronics for analysis and comparison online. The emergence of DIORs thus comes at a moment where a growing flood of data may help tip human and animal science from a reductionist to a systemic paradigm. Diagnoses could become based on analyses of network resilience including essential elements ranging from mood and social conditions to different somatic subsystems. Meanwhile, management could become more adaptive, monitoring effects throughout the network and retuning medication and other variables over longer trajectories. In short, the recent technological and theoretical advances invite a fundamental rethinking of our approach to managing health and resilience.
