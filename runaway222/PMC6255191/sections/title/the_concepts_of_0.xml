 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the concept of resilience may seem intuitively straightforward, it is worth noting that it has been used in different ways across scientific disciplines and also outside academia. Its use in fields as diverse as ecology, engineering, environmental sciences, social sciences, economics, and psychology may be explained in part by the malleability of the concept (
  <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>). Resilience takes on different meanings, depending on the context and the field in which it is used (
  <a rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" href="#r46">46</a>, 
  <a rid="r47" ref-type="bibr" href="#r47">47</a>). Nonetheless, definitions invariably relate to the ability of a system to maintain specific functions in the face of change (
  <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interpretation of resilience takes a special twist in systems that have a tipping point: a threshold at which a self-reinforcing mechanism propels a critical transition to a contrasting state (
  <a rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" href="#r48">48</a>, 
  <a rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" href="#r49">49</a>). Efforts to understand such sharp transitions have a long history. In physics, abrupt phase transitions such as freezing may occur even when variables such as temperature change gradually. Also, slow endogenous change may build up a tension that brings a system to a critical point for radical change (
  <a rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" href="#r50">50</a>). Nearly 50 years ago the mathematician Thom (
  <a rid="r51" ref-type="bibr" href="#r51">51</a>) created a framework called “catastrophe theory” to characterize some of the abrupt transitions that could occur in dynamical systems. Although catastrophe theory fell out of favor because it was initially oversold, the mathematical framework is robust and is now recognized as relevant across a broad range of systems (
  <a rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" href="#r49">49</a>). Especially, in ecology, researchers early on recognized the potential for systems to reach a tipping point. To capture the risk of such critical transitions, ecologists defined resilience as the capacity to tolerate disturbance without collapsing (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.resalliance.org/" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.resalliance.org/</span>). As this “ecological resilience” approaches zero, a critical transition can be invoked even by a tiny nudge (
  <a rid="r52" ref-type="bibr" href="#r52">52</a>). It is intuitively straightforward to see how the potential for critical transitions is relevant to organisms (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>) in which aging and stressors can reduce the resilience of the healthy state. In ecology, resilience (
  <a rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" href="#r53">53</a>) was traditionally thought of as the magnitude of the perturbation needed to actually cause the shift (“push it over the ridge” in the representation of 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>). However, this view raises the question of whether such resilience might in some way be quantified without invoking the shift. This would allow detecting situations in which special attention is needed to prevent an unwanted transition [e.g., falling into a depression (
  <a rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" href="#r44">44</a>)] or in which the “bad resilience” of an unwanted state is dwindling to the point that a small nudge could push it out of such a trap [e.g., recovering from a depression (
  <a rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" href="#r44">44</a>)].
