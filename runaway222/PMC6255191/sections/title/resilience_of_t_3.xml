 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although assessing the risk of critical transitions in subsystems can be useful, the central challenge we wish to address is finding ways to assess systemic resilience of the whole. Could there be reliable generic ways to quantify systemic resilience? Measuring recovery rates upon health crises is an obvious angle. However, there is evidence that declining systemic resilience of the whole may also be reflected in measurable declines in the resilience of a range of subsystems. For instance, overall mortality risk is correlated with longer recovery time in blood pressure upon standing up (
  <a rid="r87" ref-type="bibr" href="#r87">87</a>, 
  <a rid="r88" ref-type="bibr" href="#r88">88</a>) and also with slowness in the recovery of heart rate during the first minute after exercise (
  <a rid="r89" ref-type="bibr" href="#r89">89</a>) as well as hand grip strength, gait speed, and a range of other frailty indicators (
  <a rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" href="#r27">27</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It may seem surprising at first that so many different indicators correlate with the risk of all-cause death. However, this observation can also be interpreted as evidence that the resiliencies of the components and of the whole are linked. Such coupling becomes particularly apparent during the process of aging. In most animals, beyond some age mortality risk rises exponentially with the years (
  <a rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" href="#r36">36</a>). For instance, in humans, starting around age 30 years, the likelihood of death doubles roughly every eight years. This rising mortality risk reflects the loss of resilience with age, which is inevitable, but does depend on genetic make-up, stressors, and lifestyle (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). The loss of resilience is of course not completely homogeneous across the body. Some subsystems often remain stronger and compensate in part for the weakening of others. Nonetheless, there is a tendency for the whole and its subsystems to decline in concert.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Part of an explanation may be that stresses influencing parameters such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), chaperon protein regulation, autophagy, and the accumulation of senescent cells affect tissues throughout the organism (
  <a rid="r90" ref-type="bibr" href="#r90">90</a>
  <a href="#r91">*</a>â€“
  <a rid="r92" ref-type="bibr" href="#r92">92</a>). However, the network of mutual dependencies may also cause correlation between resilience of the parts, as the malfunctioning of one subsystem (e.g., glucose regulation) can raise the stress on other subsystems (e.g., water balance by increased urinary output, cognition by glycation of proteins), causing them to deteriorate also. In addition, organisms must distribute resources over subsystems, implying that increased demand from one system may be met at the expense of others.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This view of organisms as complex adaptive networks has implications for our understanding of systemic resilience and for the possibilities of assessment. It may explain why resilience of the elements can be predictive of the systemic resilience of the whole but also suggests that rising correlation between the ups-and-downs of elements in a network might indicate an elevated risk of systemic failure (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2 
   <span class="italic">H</span> vs. 
   <span class="italic">G</span>
  </a>) (
  <a rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" href="#r38">38</a>). So far, few studies have addressed this possibility, although a recent study of a cohort of Italian elderly indeed revealed that correlation between self-reported mood and physical well-being increases with (independently assessed) frailty (
  <a rid="r85" ref-type="bibr" href="#r85">85</a>). In summary, there is emerging evidence that humans and animals may be seen as complex networks in which systemic resilience can be assessed from DIORs, which may be estimated directly from the interactive dynamics of vital parameters such as blood pressure, activity, temperature, postural balance, and mood.
