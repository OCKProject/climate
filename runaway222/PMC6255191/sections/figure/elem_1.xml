  <p>DIORs discussed in the main text. (
   <span class="italic">Left</span>) A resilient system. (
   <span class="italic">Right</span>) A frail system with low resilience. (
   <span class="italic">A</span> and 
   <span class="italic">B</span>) Resilience is represented as the basin of attraction around a healthy state. Slopes correspond to rates of change. When resilience is low (
   <span class="italic">B</span> vs. 
   <span class="italic">A</span>), slopes around the equilibrium are less steep, implying slower return rates to equilibrium. (
   <span class="italic">C</span> and 
   <span class="italic">D</span>) Simulated recovery rates upon a small perturbation. (
   <span class="italic">E</span> and 
   <span class="italic">F</span>) Simulated dynamics in a system subject to a stochastic regime of perturbations illustrating that fluctuations are larger and slower in a frail system (
   <span class="italic">F</span> vs. 
   <span class="italic">E</span>), as reflected in higher variance and higher temporal autocorrelation. (
   <span class="italic">G</span> and 
   <span class="italic">H</span>) Interactive dynamics of subsystems (e.g., mood, posture, cognition) are predicted to become more correlated in a network with low systemic resilience (
   <span class="italic">H</span> vs. 
   <span class="italic">G</span>).
