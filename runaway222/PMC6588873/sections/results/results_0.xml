 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clinicians were 80% female and averaged 37.52 years of age (
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 11.40); there were no significant differences in clinician characteristics across waves (all 
  <span class="italic">p</span>s &gt; .05). Controlling for organizational and clinician covariates, average use of CBT techniques increased by 6% from wave 1 (
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 3.18) to wave 3 (
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 3.37, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .021, 
  <span class="italic">d</span> = .29), compared to no change in psychodynamic techniques (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .570). Each evidence-based practice training initiative in which clinicians participated predicted a 3% increase in CBT use (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .019) but no change in psychodynamic technique use (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .709). In organizations with more proficient cultures at baseline, clinicians exhibited greater increases in CBT use compared to organizations with less proficient cultures (8% increase vs. 2% decrease, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .048).
