 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a repeated cross-sectional design [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>] across 5 years of system-wide EBP implementation in which we were interested in change in technique use at the population level and the moderating effect of organization-level variables on those estimates. In a repeated cross-sectional design, there may be zero overlap in the samples between periods and yet valid inferences of change in population values can be made on the basis of repeated cross-sections. Additionally, the effect of organizational moderators can be examined as long as the same organizations are in the sample. Overlap in the cross-sectional samples is beneficial because it reduces variance of the parameter estimates; however, high overlap between samples is not necessary for valid inferences about changes in population trends over time.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The design incorporated two sampling stages. First, we purposively selected organizations delivering youth outpatient services in Philadelphia’s public behavioral health system. Second, cross-sections of clinicians working within sampled organizations at each wave were recruited. At each wave (2013, 2015, 2017), we attempted to recruit all clinicians within enrolled organizations. This allowed us to examine changes in the population of interest over time without assuming that individuals were the same at each wave, given high clinician turnover rates and the real-world context.</p>
