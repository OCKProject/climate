   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>], a 62-item self-reported checklist of clinician practice. At each wave, clinicians reported on the specific psychotherapy techniques they used with a current, representative client. All items are rated from 1 (
   <span class="italic">rarely</span>) to 5 (
   <span class="italic">most of the time</span>). The factor structure has been confirmed, and the instrument is sensitive to within-therapist changes in strategy use [

  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Formal participation in system-sponsored EBP initiatives was reported by clinicians in response to a series of questions asking if they “formally participated as a trainee through DBHIDS” in the five EBP initiatives (yes/no). To ensure accuracy, we confirmed with each participant that they understood that the questions referred to the 1-year training and ongoing consultation provided by DBHIDS for each initiative. In analyses, this variable was included as a time-varying continuous value indexing the cumulative number of initiatives the clinician had participated in up to each wave (range = 0 to 5). As a control variable, we also created a dichotomous variable indexing whether the clinician had participated in a system-sponsored EBP initiative prior to study entry (yes/no).</p>

  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Organizational measures were constructed by aggregating (i.e., averaging) individual responses within the organization after confirming high levels of within-organization agreement using average within-group correlation (

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. These statistics indicate the extent to which clinicians within an organization exhibit absolute agreement with each other on their ratings of organizational characteristics. Values range from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate greater reduction in error variance, and hence higher level of agreement. Typically, a cutoff of .6 or higher is recommended to provide validity evidence for aggregating individual scores to the organization level [

Given high inter-correlations across ILS subscales and for parsimony, we used the total score (α = .98) only, which is supported by psychometric work [

The six subscales on the ICS measure include organizational focus on EBP (α = .91); educational support for EBP (α = .86); recognition for using EBP (α = .86); rewards for using EBP (α = .87); selection of staff for EBP (α = .93); and selection of staff for openness (α = .95) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>]. The ICS produces subscale scores for each of these factors in addition to a total score. Given high inter-correlations across ICS subscales and for parsimony, we used the total score (α = .94) only, which is supported by psychometric work [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. Psychometric data suggest good reliability and validity [
