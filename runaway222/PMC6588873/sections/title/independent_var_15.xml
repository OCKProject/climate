 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Formal participation in system-sponsored EBP initiatives was reported by clinicians in response to a series of questions asking if they “formally participated as a trainee through DBHIDS” in the five EBP initiatives (yes/no). To ensure accuracy, we confirmed with each participant that they understood that the questions referred to the 1-year training and ongoing consultation provided by DBHIDS for each initiative. In analyses, this variable was included as a time-varying continuous value indexing the cumulative number of initiatives the clinician had participated in up to each wave (range = 0 to 5). As a control variable, we also created a dichotomous variable indexing whether the clinician had participated in a system-sponsored EBP initiative prior to study entry (yes/no).</p>
