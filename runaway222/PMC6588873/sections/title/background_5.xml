 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The last two decades have shown increasing emphasis on the implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in publicly funded behavioral health systems nationally [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Policy-makers in public behavioral health systems (e.g., City of Philadelphia, Los Angeles County, Washington, Hawaii, New York) have committed to using EBPs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>] to improve the quality of psychosocial services and client outcomes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>] using various approaches including tying reimbursement to EBP use (i.e., financial incentives), building EBPs into contracts, and policy initiatives [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Although many public behavioral health systems have invested in implementing EBPs, very few of these efforts have been systematically and rigorously evaluated, thus limiting the ability to understand the effect of these efforts on clinician and organizational behavior and subsequent client reach [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Thought leaders in implementation science have recommended learning from natural experiments enacted by systems via observational research designs in order to produce generalizable knowledge to advance implementation science [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Thus, rigorous evaluation of system-wide EBP implementation can produce valuable information to achieve this objective.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The majority of what is known about system-wide EBP implementation is largely descriptive in nature (i.e., if systems are implementing EBPs, how they support EBPs). One set of studies takes a broad perspective and reports on national trends across system EBP implementations. For example, a study reporting on a set of national surveys conducted with state mental health directors found increases in states offering EBPs for youth from 2001 to 2012 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Another survey study found that the majority of state mental health directors endorsed using financial incentives to promote EBP use in their system [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Another set of studies takes a more granular perspective and reports on specific strategies used within one system such as the City of Philadelphia [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>], New York [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>], Hawaii, and Illinois [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. For example, Powell and colleagues describe how the City of Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual Disability Services (DBHIDS), which oversees behavioral health services for over 600,000 Medicaid-enrolled consumers, began implementing EBPs in 2007 via “EBP initiatives” [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>] and through the creation of the Evidence-based Practice and Innovation Center (EPIC) which included policy, fiscal, and operational changes to encourage EBP implementation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although these perspectives have enriched the field’s understanding of whether systems are implementing EBPs and how EBPs are supported, there is a gap in the literature with regard to how system-wide efforts to implement EBPs are related to clinician practice over time. Only a few studies have attempted to evaluate the effect of system-wide EBP implementation. One national study within the Veterans Health Administration, a large system supporting EBP implementation, found that medical record documentation suggested that only 20% of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (total 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 255,968) received at least one session of EBP for PTSD. Another study using administrative claims data found that there was an increased rate of EBP claims over time within the context of a fiscally mandated implementation effort in Los Angeles County [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. By leveraging existing data sources, these studies provide preliminary insights into how system-wide efforts to implement EBPs may be related to patterns in clinician and organizational behavior, but additional work is needed to understand the effect of such efforts.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another focus of research inquiry includes investigating how system implementation of EBPs interacts with characteristics of the organizations nested within the system, such as organizational leadership, culture, and climate. This line of research can both elucidate potential mutable targets of implementation strategies in future implementation efforts and advance the science of implementation by providing empirical evidence for implementation science frameworks that posit the criticality of these constructs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. Leading determinant frameworks [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>] such as the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>] and the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment framework [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>] suggest the importance of the relationship between implementation and organizational characteristics, such as leadership (i.e., extent to which leaders are capable of guiding, directing, and supporting implementation) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], culture (i.e., shared norms, behavioral expectations, and values of an organization) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>], and climate (i.e., shared perceptions regarding the impact of the work environment on clinician well-being). A growing body of literature explores the relationship between these constructs and implementation (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]). However, findings have been somewhat mixed [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>] and few studies have prospectively investigated the relationship between these factors and implementation—which would provide the most compelling evidence for potential mutable targets of implementation strategies, as well as build causal theory, a key imperative in implementation science [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current study builds on previous work by investigating how a centralized system effort to support implementation in the City of Philadelphia is related to clinicians’ EBP use and how organizational characteristics, specifically implementation leadership, implementation climate, and organizational culture, might moderate these effects [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. We measured clinicians’ self-reported use of psychotherapy techniques for youth in outpatient clinics over 5 years within the context of a system-wide effort to implement EBPs. We measured cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques, which have evidence for their effectiveness for youth psychiatric disorders [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>] and comprised the majority of EBPs implemented by DBHIDS, and psychodynamic techniques, which are frequently used [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>] but have less evidence for youth psychiatric disorders [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. We hypothesized that (a) clinician CBT use would increase over time, whereas psychodynamic technique use would remain static; (b) clinician participation in system-sponsored EBP initiatives would increase CBT use over time; and (c) baseline organizational variables would predict variability in clinician CBT use over time [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>].
