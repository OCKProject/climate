 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the permission of organizational leaders, researchers scheduled group meetings with all clinicians working within the organizations that delivered youth outpatient services, during which the research team presented the study, obtained written informed consent, and collected measures onsite. The only inclusion criterion was that clinicians deliver behavioral health services to youth (clients under age 18) via the outpatient program. We did not exclude any clinicians meeting this criterion and included calinicians-in-training (e.g., interns); the majority of clinicians had their masterâ€™s degree. Clinicians received $50 each wave; clinicians participating in all three waves received an additional $50. Procedures were approved by the University of Pennsylvania and City of Philadelphia IRBs.</p>
