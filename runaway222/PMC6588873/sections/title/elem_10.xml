  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a purposive sampling approach for organizational recruitment. Philadelphia has a single payer system (Community Behavioral Health; CBH) for public behavioral health services, thus we obtained a list from the payer of all organizations that had submitted a claim in 2011–2012. There were over 100 organizations delivering outpatient services to youth. Our intention was to use purposive sampling to generate a representative sample of the organizations that served the largest number of youth in the system. We selected the first 29 organizations as our population of interest because together they serve approximately 80% of youth receiving publically funded behavioral health care. Over the course of the 5 years, we enrolled 21 out of the 29 organizations (73%; some organizations had more than one site, resulting in a total of 27 sites). Sixteen organizations and 20 sites were enrolled in the study at baseline and participated in at least one additional wave and were included in our analysis (
   <span class="italic">k</span> = 20). The organizations included in this study served approximately 42% of youth receiving outpatient services through the public mental health system (total) and represented approximately 52% of youth receiving outpatient services in the purposive sample of organizations that we targeted for recruitment. Organizations were geographically spread across Philadelphia and ranged in size with regard to youth served annually (
   <span class="italic">M</span> = 772.27, range = 337–2275 youth).
