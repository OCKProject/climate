  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. These statistics indicate the extent to which clinicians within an organization exhibit absolute agreement with each other on their ratings of organizational characteristics. Values range from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate greater reduction in error variance, and hence higher level of agreement. Typically, a cutoff of .6 or higher is recommended to provide validity evidence for aggregating individual scores to the organization level [

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Proficient organizational culture was measured using the 15-item 
  <span class="italic">proficiency</span> scale (α = .92) of the Organizational Social Context measure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>]. Proficient organizational culture has been theoretically linked to EBP implementation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>]; items refer to shared norms and expectations that clinicians place client well-being first, are competent, and have up-to-date knowledge. Proficiency scale scores demonstrate excellent reliability, criterion-related validity, and predictive validity [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>–

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implementation leadership was measured using the Implementation Leadership Scale (ILS) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>], a 12-item scale that measures leader proactiveness (α = .92), knowledge (α = .97), supportiveness (α = .96), and perseverance (α = .95) in EBP implementation. Given high inter-correlations across ILS subscales and for parsimony, we used the total score (α = .98) only, which is supported by psychometric work [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>]. Psychometrics suggest excellent internal consistency and convergent and discriminant validity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>]. Items are scored on a 0 (

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implementation climate was measured using the Implementation Climate Scale (ICS) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>], an 18-item measure of strategic climate around EBP implementation. The six subscales on the ICS measure include organizational focus on EBP (α = .91); educational support for EBP (α = .86); recognition for using EBP (α = .86); rewards for using EBP (α = .87); selection of staff for EBP (α = .93); and selection of staff for openness (α = .95) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>]. The ICS produces subscale scores for each of these factors in addition to a total score. Given high inter-correlations across ICS subscales and for parsimony, we used the total score (α = .94) only, which is supported by psychometric work [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. Psychometric data suggest good reliability and validity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. Items are scored on a 0 (
