 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used three-level mixed effects regression models with a Gaussian distribution to generate estimates of clinicians’ average technique use at baseline and over time [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>]. Models were estimated via full information maximum likelihood [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>] in HLM 6.08 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>] and incorporated random intercepts and a random effect for time at the clinician and organization levels to account for the nested data structure. Preliminary analyses indicated that the optimal functional form for time was a single linear trend based on model comparisons using Schwarz’s Bayesian information criterion (BIC) where lower values indicate superior fit. Differences in BIC values of 5.6 (for CBT use) and 3.4 (for psychodynamic technique use) provided positive evidence for the superiority of the linear trend model relative to quadratic and categorical parameterizations of time [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>]. Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> presents the raw means of each dependent variable by wave. Preliminary analyses also confirmed there was significant variance in clinicians’ use of CBT techniques (ICC (1) = .17, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .001) and psychodynamic techniques (ICC (1) = .09, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .001) at the organization level. All analyses controlled for all covariates described above (i.e., client age, clinician age, gender, education, years of experience, attitudes toward EBP, participation in EBP initiative prior to study entry, and organization size) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. No data were missing at the organization level. Clinician-level covariates had &lt; 4% missingness; results of Little’s MCAR test indicated that they were missing completely at random (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 26.10, 
  <span class="italic">df</span> = 22, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .247); we imputed these covariate values using the serial mean [

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Average change in clinicians’ self-reported use of psychotherapy techniques (hypothesis 1) was tested in models with a linear main effect for wave and covariates. This estimated the overall change in clinicians’ use of psychotherapy techniques across waves. The influence of clinician participation in EBP initiatives on use of psychotherapy techniques (hypothesis 2) was tested by adding a time-varying variable which indexed the cumulative number of initiatives each clinician had participated in at each wave (0 to 5). Relationships between organizational variables of interest at baseline and subsequent trends in clinicians’ average use of therapy techniques over time (hypothesis 3) were tested by adding a main effect and interaction term for each organizational moderator. Because of high inter-correlations among organizational characteristics (mean 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = .66), each organizational characteristic was tested separately. The issue of multiple comparisons is complex and contested [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>]. To avoid type II errors and the premature closing of important lines of inquiry, we used the Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) procedure with a false discovery rate of .25 to evaluate the statistical significance of moderator tests for each outcome variable [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>]. For each moderator test, we report the results of the B-H test of statistical significance, unadjusted and adjusted 
  <span class="italic">p</span> values, and measures of effect size. Effect sizes were calculated using two metrics. First, we calculated percent change in technique use from wave 1 to wave 3. Second, we calculated a standardized mean difference in technique use from wave 1 to wave 3. After specifying each model, we examined residuals at levels 1, 2, and 3 and confirmed the tenability of underlying statistical assumptions including normality, homoscedasticity, and functional form [
