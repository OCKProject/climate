  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a repeated cross-sectional design [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>] across 5 years of system-wide EBP implementation in which we were interested in change in technique use at the population level and the moderating effect of organization-level variables on those estimates. In a repeated cross-sectional design, there may be zero overlap in the samples between periods and yet valid inferences of change in population values can be made on the basis of repeated cross-sections. Additionally, the effect of organizational moderators can be examined as long as the same organizations are in the sample. Overlap in the cross-sectional samples is beneficial because it reduces variance of the parameter estimates; however, high overlap between samples is not necessary for valid inferences about changes in population trends over time.
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The design incorporated two sampling stages. First, we purposively selected organizations delivering youth outpatient services in Philadelphia’s public behavioral health system. Second, cross-sections of clinicians working within sampled organizations at each wave were recruited. At each wave (2013, 2015, 2017), we attempted to recruit all clinicians within enrolled organizations. This allowed us to examine changes in the population of interest over time without assuming that individuals were the same at each wave, given high clinician turnover rates and the real-world context.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Procedure</div>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the permission of organizational leaders, researchers scheduled group meetings with all clinicians working within the organizations that delivered youth outpatient services, during which the research team presented the study, obtained written informed consent, and collected measures onsite. The only inclusion criterion was that clinicians deliver behavioral health services to youth (clients under age 18) via the outpatient program. We did not exclude any clinicians meeting this criterion and included calinicians-in-training (e.g., interns); the majority of clinicians had their master’s degree. Clinicians received $50 each wave; clinicians participating in all three waves received an additional $50. Procedures were approved by the University of Pennsylvania and City of Philadelphia IRBs.</p>

  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to 2013, DBHIDS supported EBPs via separate “EBP initiatives” that included training and expert consultation for enrolled clinicians lasting approximately 1 year, as recommended by treatment developers [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Between 2007 and 2019, through these initiatives, DBHIDS supported the implementation of a variety of cognitive behavioral therapy-focused practices addressing a range of psychiatric disorders including cognitive therapy [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>], prolonged exposure [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>], trauma-focused CBT [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,

   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Initially, DBHIDS largely guided organization selection for initiative participation; more recently, organizations have applied for participation through a competitive process. Organizations decided which of their clinicians would participate [

  </p>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As system leaders identified similar barriers across single EBP initiatives, the DBHIDS Commissioner (ACE) convened a task force of academics and policy-makers in 2012 to apply best practices from implementation science to support EBP implementation. This resulted in EPIC, an entity intended to provide a centralized infrastructure for EBP administration. EPIC was formally launched in 2013 and oversees all EBP implementation efforts in the Philadelphia public behavioral health system. EPIC is led by a Director and currently supported by two staff who provide technical assistance to organizations around EBP implementation through meetings, telephone calls, and regular events. In addition to supporting the EBP initiatives, which predated the creation of this centralized infrastructure, EPIC aligned policy, fiscal, and operational approaches by developing systematic processes to contract for EBP delivery, hosting events to publicize EBP delivery, designating providers as EBP agencies, and creating enhanced rates for the delivery of some EBPs. For more details on the approach taken by EPIC and DBHIDS, please see [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. All organizations and clinicians were exposed to system-level support provided by EPIC from 2013 to 2017. Data collection in 2013 occurred prior to the official launch of EPIC.

   <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a purposive sampling approach for organizational recruitment. Philadelphia has a single payer system (Community Behavioral Health; CBH) for public behavioral health services, thus we obtained a list from the payer of all organizations that had submitted a claim in 2011–2012. There were over 100 organizations delivering outpatient services to youth. Our intention was to use purposive sampling to generate a representative sample of the organizations that served the largest number of youth in the system. We selected the first 29 organizations as our population of interest because together they serve approximately 80% of youth receiving publically funded behavioral health care. Over the course of the 5 years, we enrolled 21 out of the 29 organizations (73%; some organizations had more than one site, resulting in a total of 27 sites). Sixteen organizations and 20 sites were enrolled in the study at baseline and participated in at least one additional wave and were included in our analysis (
    <span class="italic">k</span> = 20). The organizations included in this study served approximately 42% of youth receiving outpatient services through the public mental health system (total) and represented approximately 52% of youth receiving outpatient services in the purposive sample of organizations that we targeted for recruitment. Organizations were geographically spread across Philadelphia and ranged in size with regard to youth served annually (

To ensure accuracy, we confirmed with each participant that they understood that the questions referred to the 1-year training and ongoing consultation provided by DBHIDS for each initiative. In analyses, this variable was included as a time-varying continuous value indexing the cumulative number of initiatives the clinician had participated in up to each wave (range = 0 to 5). As a control variable, we also created a dichotomous variable indexing whether the clinician had participated in a system-sponsored EBP initiative prior to study entry (yes/no).</p>

  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Average change in clinicians’ self-reported use of psychotherapy techniques (hypothesis 1) was tested in models with a linear main effect for wave and covariates. This estimated the overall change in clinicians’ use of psychotherapy techniques across waves. The influence of clinician participation in EBP initiatives on use of psychotherapy techniques (hypothesis 2) was tested by adding a time-varying variable which indexed the cumulative number of initiatives each clinician had participated in at each wave (0 to 5). Relationships between organizational variables of interest at baseline and subsequent trends in clinicians’ average use of therapy techniques over time (hypothesis 3) were tested by adding a main effect and interaction term for each organizational moderator. Because of high inter-correlations among organizational characteristics (mean 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = .66), each organizational characteristic was tested separately. The issue of multiple comparisons is complex and contested [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>]. To avoid type II errors and the premature closing of important lines of inquiry, we used the Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) procedure with a false discovery rate of .25 to evaluate the statistical significance of moderator tests for each outcome variable [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>]. For each moderator test, we report the results of the B-H test of statistical significance, unadjusted and adjusted 
   <span class="italic">p</span> values, and measures of effect size. Effect sizes were calculated using two metrics. First, we calculated percent change in technique use from wave 1 to wave 3. Second, we calculated a standardized mean difference in technique use from wave 1 to wave 3. After specifying each model, we examined residuals at levels 1, 2, and 3 and confirmed the tenability of underlying statistical assumptions including normality, homoscedasticity, and functional form [
