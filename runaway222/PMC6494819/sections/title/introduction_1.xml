 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grasslands have among the world’s highest species diversity, harbor endemic and threatened plant and animal species, and provide critical ecosystem services
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. However, limited knowledge of the ecological processes governing grassland function and evolution has contributed to the loss of grasslands with cascading, negative consequences for biodiversity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Research on the evolution and expansion of grasslands reveal that the rise of this ecosystem was a long process occurring asynchronously across continents

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. For example, the ancestral C
  <sub>3</sub> savanna mosaic spread during the mid to late Cenozoic (~55–33 Ma), whereas C
  <sub>4</sub>-dominated open habitats, better adapted to high temperatures, low water availability, and low CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration, expanded during the late Neogene (~10–8 Ma)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. In Europe, fossil plant records (pollen, macrofossils) show that open biome development started during the early to middle Miocene (~20 Ma), though full development occurred since the late Miocene (~10 Ma)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. In contrast, eastern Mediterranean phytolith remains (microscopic silica bodies abundantly produced in grass tissues and better preserved in drier environments) show that grass-dominated habitats were prevalent by the early Miocene (~20 Ma)

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several drivers have been put forward to explain forest loss and the expansion of an open grassy biome. Earlier hypotheses highlighted declining atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations and temperatures and increased aridity and seasonality of precipitation as the main drivers of grassland spread
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. More recently, hypotheses have focused on the influence of local-scale factors such as fire and herbivores
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. The critical role of fire in the rise of the savanna mosaic has been confirmed from fossil pollen, charcoal, and leaf wax 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes records in C
  <sub>4</sub>-dominated grasslands in southern Africa
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. However, whether variations in fire disturbances have contributed to the forest-grassland transition in Eurasian C
  <sub>3</sub>-dominated grasslands remains unclear. The involvement of fire is likely because the ancestral transition from forest to open grassy biome occurred in C
  <sub>3</sub> species, but the rise of grasslands are explained based on processes that maintain tree-grass interactions in C
  <sub>4</sub>-dominated ecosystems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, recent studies from non-forested ecosystems (grasslands, shrublands, savannas) question the view of climate as the only driver of vegetation, and increasingly emphasises the role of disturbance by fire and herbivores

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test the hypothesis that fire contributed to the rise of C
  <sub>3</sub>-dominated open habitats in eastern Eurasia, we used the charcoal morphology record of biomass burning from the Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) 42B 380 A core retrieved from the Black Sea. This 1075 m thick core represents the longest and most complete existing record of the late Miocene to Pleistocene (~10 to 1.9 Ma) Black Sea sedimentary and climatic history. Charcoal morphotypes (grass, forbs, wood) provide evidence of major changes in: i) the source of the fuel burnt (herbs vs. wood), ii) fire type (low intensity- surface vs. high-intensity crown fires), and iii) grassland community dynamics. Charcoal is one the most robust proxy of past fire frequency and fuel type, however, the amount of charcoal does not reflect the fire history per se, but how charcoal resulting from fires is produced, transported, and incorporated into sediments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Our study is the first approach to quantify the long-term extent of fires in temperate open habitats of Eurasia, providing a new view on the ecology and evolution of C
  <sub>3</sub> grasslands independent of the C
  <sub>4</sub> pathway.
