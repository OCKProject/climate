   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). However, source-to-sink analysis shows that the provenance of Black Sea sediments 1050–755 m below sea floor (mbsf) (~10–5 Ma) was predominantly from southerly to southwesterly sources such as the Balkan and Anatolian rivers (Fig.

A transition to a northerly Russian Platform source with episodic delivery of sediments from the Danube occurred between ~5 and 4.3 Ma (755–708 mbsf), and sediments were sourced almost solely from the Russian Platform between ~4.3 and 2.6 Ma (708–651 mbsf).

Poaceae and forb (herbs) charcoal morphotypes are co-dominant between 1050 and 920 mbsf (~10–8.5 Ma), herbaceous (70–90%) and woody charcoal (10–30%) are mixed between 920 and 750 mbsf (~8.5–5 Ma), and charcoal became almost exclusively of herbaceous type between 700 and 540 mbsf (~4.3–1.9 Ma; Figs

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). The peak at ~6.1 Ma corresponds to Pontian flooding in the Paratethys, a time of marine ingress from the Mediterranean Sea

  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pollen-based vegetation reconstruction
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
   </span> indicates stepwise changes in main ecological groups (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). The percentages of herbs (Poaceae, Asteraceae, Brasicaceae, etc.) and steppe elements (
   <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Ephedra</span>) were low (~10%) until 940 mbsf (~8.5 Ma), whereas those of subtropical, warm temperate and coniferous forests show an almost equal representation. The percentages of herbs (grasses and forbs) and steppic plants rose to ~20–30% between 940 and 700 mbsf (~8.5–4.3 Ma), coincidently to the decline in all forest types (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). Herbaceous pollen percentages increased abruptly to ~80% at 700 mbsf (~4.3 Ma) and remained dominant until 540 mbsf (~1.9 Ma),
  </p>
  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two main patterns in the dynamics of the dominant fuel type burnt and the development of grass and forbs habitats are apparent in the charcoal morphotype record from the Black Sea core (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). First, we recorded the greatest biomass burning and fire of high- intensity when mixed herbaceous and woody fuels were prevalent during the late Miocene (~8.5 Ma) to the early and middle Pliocene (~5.33–4.3 Ma). Biomass burning declined markedly and fire were of low- intensity from the late Pliocene to the early Pleistocene (~4.3–1.9 Ma) when fuel originated predominantly from herbaceous plants (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b,c</a>). Second, there is a strong association between increased biomass burning, particularly of grass (Poaceae) fuel, at ~8.5 Ma and the rise in dominance of grass and forb habitats as inferred from pollen records (Figs 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b,c</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). The charcoal and pollen records thus provide strong evidence for a shift from mixed surface and crown fires during the transition from closed forests to open woodlands during the late Miocene and early Pliocene (~8.5–4.3 Ma) towards surface fires when open grassy biomes dominated during the Pliocene to early Pleistocene (~4.3–1.9 Ma).

   </span>. The onset of the expansion of open habitat vegetation from ~8.5 to 5.97 Ma in the Black Sea region was concurrent with slightly enhanced biomass burning (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b–d</a>) and largely increasing evaporative conditions in the Black Sea basin, as indicated by the alkenone-based hydrogen isotopic (δD) record (an evaporation proxy) measured from the same core
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
   </span>. The presence of carbonate nodules requiring strong climate seasonality show that evaporative conditions affected the entire circum-Black Sea region around 8.5 Ma

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span>. This part of the sedimentary sequence is primarily sourced from the Balkans and Anatolia, although charcoal fragments transported by water and air could have originated from the entire Black Sea region (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). A pytholith-based vegetation reconstruction from Turkey indicates a C

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
   </span>. Similarly, stable carbon isotopic analyses (δ
   <span class="sup">13</span>C) of palaeosols from the Greco-Iranian region and pollen records from Bulgaria indicate the development of open vegetation in the late Miocene

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
   </span>. Further support for the progressive drying of the late Miocene environment (~8–5.3 Ma) around the Black Sea and Eastern Mediterranean is found in the rise of large mammals adapted to open habitats

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span>. It is therefore probable that the warm and especially dry climatic conditions that prevailed during large intervals between ~8.5 and 5.97 Ma around the Black Sea may have led to the drying of fuels in the subtropical-warm temperate deciduous-coniferous forests and promoted mixed surface and crown fires. An increasing proportion of herbaceous plants in formerly closed forests may have provided a favorable fuel mix, i.e., fine herbs and coarse wood, therefore escalating ignition potential, flammability, and fire spread

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b,c</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Studies of grass evolution in tropical savannas (C

   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), thus areas increasingly covered by open vegetation, although this source becomes uncertain towards the later part of this interval, i.e., ~5.33–4.3 Ma (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). Pollen records from northern regions (i.e., the Ukrainian Plain) corroborate an increasingly cold and dry climate along a west-to-east gradient during this time, and vegetation dominated by forest-steppe and open xerophytic herbs

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>), a period characterised by a large disruption in the regional hydrological cycle, a major water level drop in the Mediterranean Sea
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A tipping point in the fire regime occurred at ~4.3 Ma and the new established fire regime lasted at least until the end of our record (~1.9 Ma, early Pleistocene). It is evident as a decrease in burning activity, the predominance of herbaceous charcoal fuel and the maximum extent of grassy vegetation (Figs 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b,c</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). A regional differentiation in climate, vegetation, and fauna assemblages was apparent between ~4.2 and 2 Ma, when Central and Eastern Europe (the major source feeding sediments into the Black Sea at that time) remained arid, while the Mediterranean region became more humid

   </span>. We propose that low vegetation productivity and thus fuel availability of grassy vegetation limited the biomass burned yet, surface fires were perhaps frequent. Low amounts of burned biomass and/or frequent fires have been documented in modern low productivity grassy environments and during past dry and cold climatic periods of slow vegetation growth and fuel accumulation
