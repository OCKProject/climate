 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The charcoal record of DSDP 42B 380 A shows an increase in total charcoal concentration from ~0–25 pieces/cm
  <span class="sup">3</span> at the base of the core (1050 mbsf, ~10 Ma) to maximum values in the profile (~50–250 pieces/cm
  <span class="sup">3</span>) between 920 and 700 mbsf (~8.5–4.3 Ma), and a subsequent decline of charcoal abundance to minimum values in the record (~0–5 pieces/cm
  <span class="sup">3</span>) between 700 and 540 mbsf (~4.3–1.9 Ma; Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Poaceae and forb (herbs) charcoal morphotypes are co-dominant between 1050 and 920 mbsf (~10–8.5 Ma), herbaceous (70–90%) and woody charcoal (10–30%) are mixed between 920 and 750 mbsf (~8.5–5 Ma), and charcoal became almost exclusively of herbaceous type between 700 and 540 mbsf (~4.3–1.9 Ma; Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Charcoal become smaller in size from the base (~10 Ma) to ~4.3 Ma, and become larger again between ~4.3 and 1.9 Ma (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Peak charcoal concentrations of notably high magnitude and large particle size are at 850, 785, and 701 mbsf (~6.1, ~5.33, and ~4.3 Ma, respectively; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). The peak at ~6.1 Ma corresponds to Pontian flooding in the Paratethys, a time of marine ingress from the Mediterranean Sea

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. The peak at ~5.33 Ma closely coincides with Pliocene flooding, when Atlantic waters invaded the Mediterranean Sea and briefly reached the Black Sea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Only the peak at 701 mbsf corresponds to a change in sediment provenance (Fig.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pollen-based vegetation reconstruction
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> indicates stepwise changes in main ecological groups (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). The percentages of herbs (Poaceae, Asteraceae, Brasicaceae, etc.) and steppe elements (
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Ephedra</span>) were low (~10%) until 940 mbsf (~8.5 Ma), whereas those of subtropical, warm temperate and coniferous forests show an almost equal representation. The percentages of herbs (grasses and forbs) and steppic plants rose to ~20–30% between 940 and 700 mbsf (~8.5–4.3 Ma), coincidently to the decline in all forest types (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). Herbaceous pollen percentages increased abruptly to ~80% at 700 mbsf (~4.3 Ma) and remained dominant until 540 mbsf (~1.9 Ma),

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two main patterns in the dynamics of the dominant fuel type burnt and the development of grass and forbs habitats are apparent in the charcoal morphotype record from the Black Sea core (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). First, we recorded the greatest biomass burning and fire of high- intensity when mixed herbaceous and woody fuels were prevalent during the late Miocene (~8.5 Ma) to the early and middle Pliocene (~5.33–4.3 Ma). Biomass burning declined markedly and fire were of low- intensity from the late Pliocene to the early Pleistocene (~4.3–1.9 Ma) when fuel originated predominantly from herbaceous plants (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b,c</a>). Second, there is a strong association between increased biomass burning, particularly of grass (Poaceae) fuel, at ~8.5 Ma and the rise in dominance of grass and forb habitats as inferred from pollen records (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b,c</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). The charcoal and pollen records thus provide strong evidence for a shift from mixed surface and crown fires during the transition from closed forests to open woodlands during the late Miocene and early Pliocene (~8.5–4.3 Ma) towards surface fires when open grassy biomes dominated during the Pliocene to early Pleistocene (~4.3–1.9 Ma).
