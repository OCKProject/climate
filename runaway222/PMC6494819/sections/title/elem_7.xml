  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated changes in regional biomass burning in the Black Sea region by analysing sedimentary charcoal in 65 levels of approximately 2 cm
   <span class="sup">3</span> each from the 1075–550 mbsf section, representing the late Miocene to the Pliocene (~10 to 1.9 Ma). Each sample was bleached and wet sieved to 90, 125, and 180 μm respectively, resulting in a total of 195 samples. Sedimentary charcoal pieces were categorised into three main morphotypes (grasses, forbs and wood). The size class and morphotype separation allows us to: a) better constrain the charcoal source area
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
   </span>, where the finer particles (90 and 125 μm) are sourced farther away than the larger particles (180 μm), and b) provide additional information on the fuel source and fire severity, where grass and herb morphotypes primarily originate from low-intensity surface fires and wood from high-intensity crown fires
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
   </span>. Crown fires also supply larger charcoal particles and in greater amounts than surface herbaceous fires
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
   </span>. The remaining material was transferred to a Petri dish, counted, and examined under a stereoscope at 30–60X magnification. Opaque, rectangular particles were classified as charcoal, and some had preserved anatomical structures. The source of the main morphotype categories are: 1) grasses (Poaceae), 2) forbs resulting from the burning of herbaceous plants other than grasses, and 3) wood (ligneous material) following previously described methodologies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
   </span>. We note the rare occurrence of other morphologies such as roots (charcoal likely derived from roots, stolons, rootlets) and deciduous leaves. The resulting macroscopic charcoal counts are expressed as the concentration of total particles (particles/cm
   <span class="sup">3</span>) and the concentration of each charcoal morphotype by dividing the counts by the sediment volume (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). We calculated percentages of each charcoal morphotype and size using the sum of charcoal counts (Figs 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>).

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Theoretical functions and calibrations for the relationship between fire and charcoal production and deposition in sedimentary basins suggest that increased charcoal levels may correlate with fire severity (fuel consumption per fire episode)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
   </span>, and the size of the area burnt at the ecosystem scale

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
   </span>. Distance from the fire source, charcoal transport and deposition can also affect charcoal accumulation 13,60]. Therefore our reconstructed rise in biomass burning integrates information about the increase in area burnt, severity of fire events but also the proximity of the fire source and transportation.
