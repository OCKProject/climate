 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We provide a unique charcoal morphotype record of the role of fire disturbances in the spread and evolution of temperate grassy ecosystems in Eurasia and identify mechanisms that controlled biomass burning in the Black Sea region over six million years. Results show that progressively colder and episodic dry climatic conditions from the late Miocene to middle Pliocene (~8.5–4.3 Ma) promoted fire activity, accentuated the forest-grassland transition, and sustained a more flammable ecosystem. A tipping point in the fire regime occurred at ~4.6 Ma, when the dominance of open grassy vegetation limited biomass productivity and fuel availability and connectivity, leading to surface, low intensity, but likely frequent fires. As the transition to this new vegetation state (grasslands) was associated to an abrupt shift in fire regime, it suggests thresholds in tree-grass cover which, when crossed, resulted in shifts in fire regime. Our results provide an alternative view on grassland ecology and evolution by showing that fire has been a significant ecological and evolutionary agent in temperate C
  <sub>3</sub>-plant-dominated open habitats in Eurasia. Critically, we provide a new framework for better understanding the evolution of temperate grasslands and testing new predictions using fossil charcoal records alongside those for climate and vegetation, as well as dynamic vegetation modells.
