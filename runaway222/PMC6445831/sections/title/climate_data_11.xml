 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed the link between summer climate and RTS initiation for 1984–2015 using the Hadley CRU 4.0 surface air temperature dataset
  <span class="sup">

  </span> with values extracted and averaged for all the grid cells covering Banks Island (71–75°N and 117–126°W). For hindcasting during the 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> Century, we used the same dataset from 1901 onwards. However, there was reduced variance in the dataset for the period 1901–1925 because climatological averages were used for the northern part of the island in these years due to an absence of any proximal climate station. In all cases, we calculated a July–August air temperature index weighted as 66.7% of the previous year and 33.3% of the current year. Other indices were tried, taking into account June or September monthly values or with differing inter-annual weightings, but the chosen index provided the best fit with RTS initiation during the Timelapse period.

 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used individual air temperature records from the three climate stations on Banks Island to examine spatial changes in RTS response (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). We used a homogenized dataset
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span> for Sachs Harbour while data for Thomsen River and Nangmagvik Lake were extracted directly from station records
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. All three stations had missing monthly data, but not in those summers when large numbers of RTS were first observed. Regression with the best available predictor station was used to infill individual months. Infilled air temperatures for Sachs Harbour were based on the Holman/Ulukhatok station located 300 km to the southeast on Victoria Island (total of eight months; July: 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 32, SE = 1.2 °C, 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.75; August: 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 31, SE = 0.7 °C, 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.87). Infilling for Thomsen River was based on Sachs Harbour, 230 km to the south (total of two months; July: 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 17, SE = 0.7 °C, 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.88; August: 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 17, SE = 0.9 °C, 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.75). For Nangmagvik Lake, infilling used records from Thomsen River, located 85 km to the south (total of four months; July: 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 16, 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.90, SE = 0.7 °C; August: 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 16, 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.90, SE = 0.5 °C) or in their absence, records from Mould Bay located 230 km to the north on Prince Patrick Island (total of two months; July: 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 16, SE = 1.6 °C, 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.44; August: 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 17, SE = 1.0 °C, r
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.77).

 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated potential links between RTS initiation and summer rainfall which has been shown to be important in some more southerly regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. We first compared July–August precipitation recorded at the three stations on Banks Island to examine whether there was spatial homogeneity. The coefficient of determination between Sachs Harbour and Thomsen River was 0.24 (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 11) while it was 0.04 (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 14) between Sachs Harbour and Nangmagvik Lake. These low correlations demonstrate the difficulty of interpolating rainfall across distances of 200–300 km. Furthermore, reconstructions of precipitation in the Arctic Archipelago are also subject to considerable uncertainty
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>. Given the limited record for the two northerly stations, we decided to compare Sachs Harbour alone to the logarithm of RTS initiation employing a July–August precipitation index with the same weighting used for temperature (66.7% from the previous year and 33.3% from the current year). There was no significant relationship (
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.025; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 27). We also undertook a multiple regression analysis with both the July–August weighted air temperature index and the precipitation index as independent variables but the latter proved statistically non-significant. The absence of statistical significance could be because the Sachs Harbour data are insufficiently representative of the major area of RTS on the east and north coasts, as suggested by the low correlations, or because a strong causal relationship is lacking. While we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that precipitation plays a role in RTS initiation on Banks Island, therefore, such a relationship was not supported by the data examined.

 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For future modelling we used July and August monthly air temperatures generated from a multimodel mean (42 models; Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) based on RCP4.5, selected as a moderate warming scenario. We calculated 2-year weighted mean July–August temperatures for the period 2016–2100 and smoothed the resultant values using an 11-year running mean. We then generated 100 potential records by randomly adding or subtracting deviations based on a normal distribution from the running mean, with the standard deviation equal to that of the Hadley CRU data for 1986–2015 (1.1 °C). Each record series was used with the relations in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a> (best-fit, +95% confidence interval, and −95% confidence interval) to produce a time series of RTS initiations. Each of the three sets of initiations was then averaged to produce decadal predictions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our predictions are potentially statistically conservative as the three highest years of record in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a> all fall above the log-linear line. In fact, a second-order polynomial provides a closer fit to the highest points and yields a higher 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> value (0.72 vs. 0.64) but given the logarithmic dependent variable, this would yield RTS initiations for slightly higher July–August temperatures that are several orders of magnitude outside the range of the record to date. For this reason, we concluded that the log-linear empirical relationship shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a> was more appropriate for both the hindcasting and future modelling that we undertook.
