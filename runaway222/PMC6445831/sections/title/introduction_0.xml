  </span>. In most cases, the loss of ground ice associated with the formation of these features leads to surface collapse which is irreversible over time scales of decades to centuries, as well as liberating previously frozen carbon

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An RTS comprises a headscarp of thawing ice-rich sediments or massive ice, an overlying headwall composed of the active layer and low ice-content permafrost, and a bowl downslope filled with mud and debris derived from meltwater and soil from the collapse of the under-cut headwall
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Once initiated by the exposure of ground ice, RTS enlarge by retrogression at typical rates of 5–15 m yr

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span> so that directly disturbed areas increase through time. RTS stabilise in autumn as air temperatures drop below 0 °C and melting of the ground ice ceases. They reactivate in summer, providing debris covering the headscarp can flow away, re-exposing the ground ice. A single retrogression of the headscarp, which can continue for as long as 50 years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>, may result in incomplete thaw of the ice-rich layer of permafrost because the mudflow can preserve ground ice beneath it. This preserved ice may be subsequently exposed, resulting in a polycyclic

  </span> headscarp retrogressing upslope in the floor of a stabilised RTS. Re-exposure can occur as a result of renewed fluvial incision or coastal erosion at the base of the slope, or due to detachment failure associated with deep or rapid thaw within the RTS floor

Individual retrogressive thaw slumps are tagged with an identification number, the location of initiation (R-river, C-coast, L-lake or S-slope) and their years of activity. Where the start of thaw slumping post-dates the date of image acquisition (2004) the outline of the landform is not present. The absence of a final date means that a retrogressive thaw slump was still active at the end of the Timelapse period. Note the many unnumbered retrogressive thaw slump scars where thermokarst activity was not observed during the Timelapse period
