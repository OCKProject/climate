 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ten RTS were recorded as being active in part of the Sand Hills moraine during fieldwork in 1984, mostly along the coast
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. All were identifiable in the Timelapse dataset. We are not aware of any other published field observations for Banks Island that are available to validate our historical results.

 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results could be compared, however, to another remote sensing survey
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span> carried out using a 2015 high-resolution WorldView 2 satellite image of the 230 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> Johnson Point watershed in eastern Banks Island. Our database showed 134 RTS as being active in the basin in 2015, more than 90% of which formed part of the 153 active RTS identified in the previous study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Where there was disagreement between the two surveys, we re-examined the Timelapse images closely. Our assessment is that our survey omitted 12 RTS (8% of the total), mostly small features (average size 0.36 ha; maximum 0.88 ha) while two other small identified features (2%) may not have been RTS (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). We also judged that we correctly identified 10 RTS which had been missed in the previous work
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span> and that 19 previously identified disturbances were not active RTS in 2015. This analysis indicates that our island-wide RTS dataset should have fewer than 5% false positives but that up to 10% of active RTS, principally small features, may not have been detected. This size bias preferentially affects the youngest features, so post-2012 activity, or earlier RTS that were active only for a short time, are most subject to underestimation. We conclude that our dataset is at least as complete as earlier surveys carried out over limited areas, and that while it may underestimate the increase in activity during 1984–2015, it should not overestimate the change.
