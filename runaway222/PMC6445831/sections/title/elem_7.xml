  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tracked RTS activity across Banks Island (area 70,000 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>), the westernmost and fourth largest island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
   </span>. The terrain across the island varies from a dissected upland plateau of Devonian age bedrock in the north with elevations exceeding 350 m above sea level (asl), to the hilly ice-rich Late Wisconsinan Sand Hills Moraine in the southwest (produced by a readvance of a lobe in the Amundsen Gulf) and the similarly hummocky Jesse Moraine belt in the east
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
   </span>. Rolling lowlands dominate the terrain in the western part of the island while a bedrock highland exceeding 650 m asl is present at its southern tip.
  </p>
  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate of Banks Island is cold and dry. There are three official climate stations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>): Sachs Harbour (1956-present), on the coast in the extreme southwest (71.99°N, 125.24°W); Thomsen River (1997–present) in the north-central part of the island (73.23°N, 119.54°W); and Nangmagvik Lake (1996–present) near the coast in the far north (74.14°N, 119.94°W). The mean annual air temperature (1981–2010) at Sachs Harbour is −12.8 °C and annual precipitation totals 152 mm, 65% of which falls as snow
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
   </span>. Three vegetation types cover more than 90% of the island: the Jesse moraine belt mainly supports prostrate dwarf-shrub herb tundra; graminoid prostrate dwarf-shrub forb tundra covers the central rolling hills and valleys; cryptogam-herb barrens are present on upland areas in the north
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
   </span>. Limited low elevation areas along the west and south coasts are classified as sedge/grass moss wetlands and small areas in the extreme south of the island exhibit either nontussock, sedge, dwarf shrub, moss tundra or low-shrub tundra

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Use of Timelapse</div>
  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the Google Earth Engine Timelapse dataset
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span> to visually assess terrain change across Banks Island. Timelapse is a series of annual cloud-free satellite images of the entire globe dating from 1984 to 2016 arranged as a zoomable timelapse video. The maximum resolution depends on the satellite platform that acquired the image. At the resolution employed for this study, the platforms were Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8, and Sentinel -2A
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span> generally with pixel sizes of 30 × 30 m or smaller (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). It is possible that some of the imagery for the years 1984–1993 is from Landsat 4 with a resolution of 60 × 60 m, but visual observation suggested otherwise. Imagery covering Banks Island can generally be zoomed on-screen to a scale of ~1:15,000.
  </p>
  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Active RTS were detected visually while viewing the image sequence on the fast setting which causes progressive change to appear as feature motion (Supplementary Videos 
   <a rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM5">1</a>–
   <a rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM13">9</a>). Consequently, RTS as small as 0.2 ha were identifiable (Supplementary Video 
   <a rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM14">10</a>). Frame by frame inspection was then used to determine the dates of activity with an annual resolution. At numerous sites, RTS were polycyclic, with two or even three generations of headwalls transgressing simultaneously (Supplementary Video 
   <a rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM7">3</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our method is time-consuming compared to automated techniques to detect change, such as optical reflectance trend analyses
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>. However, it has the advantage that the cause of observed change is usually identifiable. It therefore reduces confusion with image changes relating to factors such as the formation of active layer detachments or other landslides. Compared to traditional assessments with images separated by years or decades, it has the advantage of allowing a determination of actual activity, rather than inferring activity from headscarp appearance or lack of vegetation
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major advantage of the Timelapse dataset is that it is already assembled and can be accessed without specialised software or equipment
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span>, meaning that large areas can easily be examined. The inherent drawback is that the source and date of acquisition of any given image (or part of an image) is opaque to the user. During assembly, pixels are selected as being representative of a given year so that an early season land cover change might be included while a late-season change might be rejected as an outlier. In some years, no appropriate data may be available for a given site leading to interpolation between years. Given our visual analysis, the main impact of these pre-treatments is to create a degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of RTS initiation and activity cessation.
  </p>
  <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The initial survey of the island was carried out in duplicate by a class of senior undergraduate students at the University of Ottawa, with each student allocated an east–west transect of about 5000 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>. The results were compiled and trained student research assistants reviewed and added to the initial dataset of &gt;1000 RTS, quadrupling the total numbers. The dataset for the entire island was examined by the first author, and a second review was undertaken for the areas with recorded RTS. In total, therefore, all areas with RTS were examined five times. The approach taken was to minimize false positives so that if there was doubt about the origin of an apparent change, it was not retained in the dataset. The mapped changes are therefore most likely to be an underestimate of the entire population, especially of (1) RTS smaller than 0.2 ha, (2) those which were active for less than three years, and (3) those that were initiated close to the end of the record. For this reason, even though Timelapse includes 2016 images, initiation rates are presented to 2014 and total active RTS numbers to 2015.
  </p>
  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once identified, each active RTS was given a unique number and classified according to its point of initiation (Supplementary Data 
   <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">1</a>). The four RTS types recognised were initiated next to a river channel (R), at the coast (C), on a lakeshore (L), or on a slope (S) away from a river, lake or the coast (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). Slope RTS included those initiated in the floor of an older previously stabilised or still-active feature.
  </p>
  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The year that each active RTS was first observed was recorded. This date incorporates uncertainty of 0 to +1 year because initiation could have occurred prior to the acquisition of a specific portion of the Timelapse image in a given summer or after that image was acquired. Furthermore, even if the former was the case, the RTS might not have become large enough to be visible until the following year. The year of apparent stabilisation, recognised by cessation of headwall retrogression, was also recorded. The duration of activity was calculated as inclusive of the recorded start and end years.</p>
  <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">RTS were recognised as individual features if their points of initiation were non-contiguous. Two or more RTS which started on the same river reach, for example, but eventually conjoined laterally (or in a few cases as their headwalls from adjacent valleys met on an interfluve) were counted as two features in the dataset.</p>
  <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">RTS locations, together with the ancillary information described above, were recorded as points on Google Earth (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). Most of the Google Earth satellite imagery for Banks Island dates to 2016, although earlier images can also be viewed. Parts of eastern Banks Island are covered by high-resolution Quickbird imagery dating from 2004 and 2006. Temporal and spatial calculations and statistical analyses were carried out in Excel 16.11.1 for Mac after export of the dataset from Google Earth, and maps were generated in ESRI ArcGIS 10.6.
  </p>
  <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A sample of RTS was digitized on available Google Earth imagery to establish an average growth curve in order to calculate the total area affected by RTS. Fifty RTS in each of the seven highest initiation years were selected in a spatially stratified sample. In addition, the entire population of RTS initiated from 1987–1990 was included. The final sample was reduced to 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 341 as some RTS were initiated after the available image so they could not be measured and in a few cases, the resolution of the Google Earth imagery was too poor to allow confidence in the RTS outlining procedure. The area of an RTS that conjoined during its development with another numbered feature was calculated as a weighted average based on the combined area and the number of years of activity of each of the component RTS. Conjoined RTS were excluded from the sample where the initiation dates differed by more than five years. Because some RTS in the sample stabilised prior to the image date, their ages varied more than their initiation dates (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average areal growth rate was applied to each individual RTS to estimate the total area of Banks Island affected over the Timelapse period. The area subject to RTS at the start of the record was established by examining each active RTS in Timelapse for 1984 and outlining its margins for that year on Google Earth, assuming that it initiated at the local base level. These RTS were given estimated ages based on their areas and then allowed to expand along the RTS growth line until their observed date of stabilisation (if any).</p>
  <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The initial surveys showed that numerous lakes with RTS on their shorelines changed colour from dark blue to turquoise or in a few cases to beige, over the period of record and some expanded dramatically. These changes were recorded (Supplementary Data 
   <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">2</a>), as were the location and timing of substantial sedimentation in catchments subject to intense RTS activity.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Validation of the Timelapse method</div>
  <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ten RTS were recorded as being active in part of the Sand Hills moraine during fieldwork in 1984, mostly along the coast
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span>. All were identifiable in the Timelapse dataset. We are not aware of any other published field observations for Banks Island that are available to validate our historical results.
  </p>
  <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results could be compared, however, to another remote sensing survey
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
   </span> carried out using a 2015 high-resolution WorldView 2 satellite image of the 230 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> Johnson Point watershed in eastern Banks Island. Our database showed 134 RTS as being active in the basin in 2015, more than 90% of which formed part of the 153 active RTS identified in the previous study
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
   </span>. Where there was disagreement between the two surveys, we re-examined the Timelapse images closely. Our assessment is that our survey omitted 12 RTS (8% of the total), mostly small features (average size 0.36 ha; maximum 0.88 ha) while two other small identified features (2%) may not have been RTS (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). We also judged that we correctly identified 10 RTS which had been missed in the previous work
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
   </span> and that 19 previously identified disturbances were not active RTS in 2015. This analysis indicates that our island-wide RTS dataset should have fewer than 5% false positives but that up to 10% of active RTS, principally small features, may not have been detected. This size bias preferentially affects the youngest features, so post-2012 activity, or earlier RTS that were active only for a short time, are most subject to underestimation. We conclude that our dataset is at least as complete as earlier surveys carried out over limited areas, and that while it may underestimate the increase in activity during 1984–2015, it should not overestimate the change.

   <span class="sup">th</span> Century, we used the same dataset from 1901 onwards. However, there was reduced variance in the dataset for the period 1901–1925 because climatological averages were used for the northern part of the island in these years due to an absence of any proximal climate station. In all cases, we calculated a July–August air temperature index weighted as 66.7% of the previous year and 33.3% of the current year. Other indices were tried, taking into account June or September monthly values or with differing inter-annual weightings, but the chosen index provided the best fit with RTS initiation during the Timelapse period.

Regression with the best available predictor station was used to infill individual months.

  <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated potential links between RTS initiation and summer rainfall which has been shown to be important in some more southerly regions
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
   </span>. We first compared July–August precipitation recorded at the three stations on Banks Island to examine whether there was spatial homogeneity. The coefficient of determination between Sachs Harbour and Thomsen River was 0.24 (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 11) while it was 0.04 (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 14) between Sachs Harbour and Nangmagvik Lake. These low correlations demonstrate the difficulty of interpolating rainfall across distances of 200–300 km. Furthermore, reconstructions of precipitation in the Arctic Archipelago are also subject to considerable uncertainty
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
   </span>. Given the limited record for the two northerly stations, we decided to compare Sachs Harbour alone to the logarithm of RTS initiation employing a July–August precipitation index with the same weighting used for temperature (66.7% from the previous year and 33.3% from the current year). There was no significant relationship (
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.025; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 27). We also undertook a multiple regression analysis with both the July–August weighted air temperature index and the precipitation index as independent variables but the latter proved statistically non-significant. The absence of statistical significance could be because the Sachs Harbour data are insufficiently representative of the major area of RTS on the east and north coasts, as suggested by the low correlations, or because a strong causal relationship is lacking. While we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that precipitation plays a role in RTS initiation on Banks Island, therefore, such a relationship was not supported by the data examined.
  </p>
  <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For future modelling we used July and August monthly air temperatures generated from a multimodel mean (42 models; Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) based on RCP4.5, selected as a moderate warming scenario. We calculated 2-year weighted mean July–August temperatures for the period 2016–2100 and smoothed the resultant values using an 11-year running mean. We then generated 100 potential records by randomly adding or subtracting deviations based on a normal distribution from the running mean, with the standard deviation equal to that of the Hadley CRU data for 1986–2015 (1.1 °C). Each record series was used with the relations in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a> (best-fit, +95% confidence interval, and −95% confidence interval) to produce a time series of RTS initiations. Each of the three sets of initiations was then averaged to produce decadal predictions (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our predictions are potentially statistically conservative as the three highest years of record in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a> all fall above the log-linear line. In fact, a second-order polynomial provides a closer fit to the highest points and yields a higher 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> value (0.72 vs. 0.64) but given the logarithmic dependent variable, this would yield RTS initiations for slightly higher July–August temperatures that are several orders of magnitude outside the range of the record to date. For this reason, we concluded that the log-linear empirical relationship shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a> was more appropriate for both the hindcasting and future modelling that we undertook.
