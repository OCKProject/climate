 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We visually observed a 60-fold increase in RTS numbers on Banks Island from 63 in 1984 to a maximum of 4077 in 2013. The vast majority of these new thermokarst features were first observed in the Timelapse dataset in the years immediately following the four warm summers of 1998, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Most RTS remain active for several decades so even a single warm summer has a long-term effect on the landscape. The higher frequency of such events in the past 20 years has created cumulative impacts that have profoundly affected slopes, rivers and lakes on Banks Island. Our modelling indicates that current activity levels far exceed those of most of the 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> Century and that a further substantial increase in RTS formation and activity should be expected over the next 80 years as the climate warms.

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is the first study in which RTS numbers have been compiled with an annual resolution over a very large area, an analysis made possible by the prior assembly of satellite imagery in the Timelapse dataset. The newly derived RTS dataset for Banks Island will be useful for multiple purposes, such as validation of automated remote sensing methods

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The areal expansion of significant RTS activity into northern Banks Island from 2007 onwards is a direct response to regional warming and suggests that areas of ice-rich permafrost elsewhere in the Arctic, which may be relatively unaffected by thermokarst at present due to low summer air temperatures, could become impacted as the climate warms over the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century. A similar areal expansion has occurred in more southerly regions over the past several decades

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. The order of magnitude increase that we observed and the further increase projected will make these areas of the Arctic some of the most dynamic on the planet in terms of landscape change
