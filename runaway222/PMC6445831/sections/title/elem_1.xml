  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of newly observed RTS was clearly linked to summer air temperature. It was predictable using a log-linear relation with a 2-year average of July–August air temperature weighted between the preceding summer (66.7%) and the current year (33.3%) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). The weighting reflects the possibility that RTS may become visible on Timelapse imagery in the actual year of their initiation or, more frequently, in the following year. The log-linear form of the relationship underlines that it is extreme positive summer air temperatures that are most significant to RTS initiation

   <span class="italic">n</span> = 341) (Fig.

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">RTS were initiated most frequently next to rivers (45%), and less often on slopes (27%), around lakes (23%) and at the coast (5%) (Fig.

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). Notwithstanding relative change by locus of initiation, each of the four types of RTS increased by at least 20 times in absolute numbers.
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The finding that all types of RTS increased in the major initiation years (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>) is unexpected. There is no obvious reason why processes as diverse as fluvial, lacustrine and coastal erosion or long-term talik development adjacent to lakes

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
   </span>, should initiate large numbers of RTS in the same year. Our results, therefore, suggest an alternate mechanism. In a warm summer, as with active layer detachment formation, thaw consolidation at the base of the active layer or in the thawing transient layer leads to high porewater pressures, a reduction in effective shear strength, and slope failure where the factor of safety falls below unity

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span>. This exposes ice-rich permafrost protected beneath previously undisturbed slopes, or underlying the floors of previously stabilised RTS and triggers new RTS. Fluvial, coastal and lacustrine erosion remain important over the long-term, acting as pre-conditioners to RTS initiation by de-buttressing slopes through lateral erosion, vertical incision or thaw settlement. The major initiator of RTS on Banks Island, however, is a deepening thaw layer
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>

The number of lakes impacted simultaneously reached a peak of 254 in 2014 and the probability of changes persisting for more than 15 years was on average 63%, compared to the probability of RTS remaining active for the same duration of 79%. These results, and the observation that some lakes changed colour intermittently despite an adjacent RTS being continuously active, demonstrate that visible effects can vary through time, likely depending on the strength of the hydrological connections between the retrogressing headscarp where water and sediment are generated and the lacustrine system at the RTS outlet

  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the modelled total number of active RTS, calculated from initiation and longevity rates, is greater than that observed at the start of the Timelapse period (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8c</a>). This suggests that the average longevity of RTS earlier in the century may have been less than during 1985–2015. Because RTS must reactivate each summer, cold summers in the years following initiation could reduce longevity, and conversely, warm or wet
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
   </span> summers could enhance it. This is supported by visual observations during analysis of the Timelapse dataset which indicated enhanced areal RTS growth during the warmest summers.
  </p>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modelled RTS initiation rates for the 21
   <span class="sup">st</span> Century, represented as the decadal means of 100 model runs, increase from 1616 (95% confidence 660–4370) in 2016–2025, to 11,580 (95% confidence 2693–63,821) in 2086–2095 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9</a>). These predictions indicate, therefore, that a further order of magnitude increase in RTS numbers could occur by the end of the 21
   <span class="sup">st</span> century. This forecast requires examination because several factors could intervene to affect the empirical relationships on which it is based.
  </p>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, it is possible that the relationship in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a> could be affected downwards by geomorphic change associated with greater RTS activity. Sedimentation in river valleys
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
   </span> might raise the local base level and create negative feedback to prevent or slow down renewed initiation. Our observations, however, are that sedimentation of sufficient magnitude to be visible in Timelapse imagery, generally occurs well downstream of RTS sources where rivers debouch from narrow valleys and water velocities likely slow (Supplementary Video 
   <a rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM13">9</a>). Few RTS are present in these lower reaches of rivers. Furthermore, RTS initiated at coasts, on lakes or on slopes are not subject to this type of base level change. Consequently, while we cannot rule out this source of negative feedback, we believe that its impact on future activity will be minor.
  </p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, warm summers, occurring at a sub-decadal frequency in the future, might individually have less of an impact on RTS initiation. This hypothesis is based on the idea that deep thaw in antecedent years would reduce ice contents in the transient layer
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
   </span>, diminishing the likelihood that repeated high rates of late-summer thaw would generate elevated porewater pressures. This possibility is supported by the number of new RTS appearing in the southern part of Banks Island in 1999 and 2012 (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). Nearly 1000 RTS were first observed in the earlier year when the weighted July–August air temperature index for Sachs Harbour was 8.1 °C, while half that number (487) appeared in 2012, even though the index was higher (9.1 °C). This suggests that the response to the 1 °C increase may have been dampened by the deep thaw 13 years earlier. On the other hand, hundreds of RTS were initiated in all parts of the island as a result of three successive warm summers (2010–2012) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>) demonstrating that even if dampened, numbers remained high.
  </p>
  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A third question relates to the availability of terrain susceptible to RTS formation if rates climb as predicted. As mentioned above, active RTS still occupy only a small percentage of the landscape: about 0.1% of the entire island or 0.5% of the 13,000 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> of terrain in which at least 1 RTS per 25 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> was active (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Therefore, an order of magnitude increase in RTS numbers can be physically accommodated. Moreover, numerous valley side segments, lakeshores and coasts exhibit the scars of stabilised RTS (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>), where no activity was detected during the Timelapse period. Since polycyclicity is common (Supplementary Videos 
   <a rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM7">3</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM10">6</a>), RTS numbers could increase within the boundaries of these previously impacted areas, especially given the extensive ground ice present in the Wisconsinan age moraine belts on Banks Island
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
   </span>. Finally, RTS were observed in entirely new locations across Banks Island during the high initiation years of 2011–2013 which suggests that vulnerable areas may exist at the landscape scale outside the current concentrations. RTS could be initiated in these areas as the trend towards warmer summers results in the thaw of high ice content material buried at greater depths.
  </p>
  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A final point relates to RTS longevity. Observations and our hindcasting (see above) suggest that RTS may remain active longer if temperatures increase. The impact of such a change in longevity would be to increase the number of active RTS in the landscape at any given time, independent of the number of initiations.</p>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conclude that the empirical relationships used for our modelling may be affected by changes in response as mean summer temperatures warm, but that sizable positive deviations from the mean will continue to initiate large numbers of RTS within and potentially outside the current areas of activity. These changes will develop more quickly than predicted if climate forcing exceeds the relatively moderate RCP4.5 scenario we used for our modelling.</p>
