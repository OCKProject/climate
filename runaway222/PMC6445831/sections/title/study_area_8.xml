 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tracked RTS activity across Banks Island (area 70,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), the westernmost and fourth largest island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. The terrain across the island varies from a dissected upland plateau of Devonian age bedrock in the north with elevations exceeding 350 m above sea level (asl), to the hilly ice-rich Late Wisconsinan Sand Hills Moraine in the southwest (produced by a readvance of a lobe in the Amundsen Gulf) and the similarly hummocky Jesse Moraine belt in the east

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Rolling lowlands dominate the terrain in the western part of the island while a bedrock highland exceeding 650 m asl is present at its southern tip.

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate of Banks Island is cold and dry. There are three official climate stations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>): Sachs Harbour (1956-present), on the coast in the extreme southwest (71.99°N, 125.24°W); Thomsen River (1997–present) in the north-central part of the island (73.23°N, 119.54°W); and Nangmagvik Lake (1996–present) near the coast in the far north (74.14°N, 119.94°W). The mean annual air temperature (1981–2010) at Sachs Harbour is −12.8 °C and annual precipitation totals 152 mm, 65% of which falls as snow

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>. Three vegetation types cover more than 90% of the island: the Jesse moraine belt mainly supports prostrate dwarf-shrub herb tundra; graminoid prostrate dwarf-shrub forb tundra covers the central rolling hills and valleys; cryptogam-herb barrens are present on upland areas in the north
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. Limited low elevation areas along the west and south coasts are classified as sedge/grass moss wetlands and small areas in the extreme south of the island exhibit either nontussock, sedge, dwarf shrub, moss tundra or low-shrub tundra

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Banks Island lies entirely within the zone of continuous permafrost
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span> with ground ice contents varying from high to medium-to-high. Ground temperatures at Thomsen River in north-central Banks Island average about −12 °C (3 m depth; 2010–2015)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span> and permafrost thickness on the island can exceed 500 m
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. Both the Jesse Moraine and the Sand Hills Moraine contain ground ice that has been interpreted as glacial in origin
