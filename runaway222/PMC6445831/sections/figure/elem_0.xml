  <p>Ground and satellite views of retrogressive thaw slumps. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Polycyclic coastal retrogressive thaw slumps in southwest Banks Island (71.717째N, 124.127째W). Headscarp is thawing ice-rich permafrost (averaging 85% ice by volume

   </span>) while overlying headwall is the former stabilised mudflow comprising the active layer and ice-poor permafrost. Undercutting of the headwall by ablation of the ground ice results in soil collapse that temporarily covers the ice. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Quickbird image in Google Earth of part of the coast of eastern Banks Island (centred on 72.18째N 120.19째W) showing those retrogressive thaw slumps identified as active between 1984 and 2015 using the Timelapse dataset. Individual retrogressive thaw slumps are tagged with an identification number, the location of initiation (R-river, C-coast, L-lake or S-slope) and their years of activity. Where the start of thaw slumping post-dates the date of image acquisition (2004) the outline of the landform is not present. The absence of a final date means that a retrogressive thaw slump was still active at the end of the Timelapse period. Note the many unnumbered retrogressive thaw slump scars where thermokarst activity was not observed during the Timelapse period
