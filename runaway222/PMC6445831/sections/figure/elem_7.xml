   </span>) for Banks Island (1902–2015); dashed line is a 5-year centred running mean. Note: lower variance for 1901–1925 is due to constant values appearing in the Hadley CRU dataset for the northern part of the island for this period. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Hindcast retrogressive thaw slump initiation for 1902–2015 using the climate data in

   <span class="bold">c</span> Total number of retrogressive thaw slumps active on Banks Island (1964–2015). Solid red line was hindcast using initiation numbers in

   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>. Dashed red lines are predictions made using upper 95% confidence interval for initiation and for longevity (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>) and with lower 95% confidence interval for initiation and longevity. Black line is observed total number of active retrogressive thaw slumps (1984–2015)
