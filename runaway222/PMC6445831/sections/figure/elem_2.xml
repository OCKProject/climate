  <p>Longevity and growth of retrogressive thaw slumps. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Percent of all observed features remaining active for a given duration. Best-fit relation is for retrogressive thaw slumps &gt;2 years old and for sample size &gt;30 (upper solid line). Dotted lines are 95% confidence intervals. Lower solid line is sample size. All retrogressive thaw slumps were active for at least 3 years. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Measured area of sampled active retrogressive thaw slumps against age. Best-fit line was constrained through the origin. Dotted lines are 95% confidence intervals
