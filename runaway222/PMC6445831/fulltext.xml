This exposes ice-rich permafrost protected beneath previously undisturbed slopes, or underlying the floors of previously stabilised RTS and triggers new RTS. Fluvial, coastal and lacustrine erosion remain important over the long-term, acting as pre-conditioners to RTS initiation by de-buttressing slopes through lateral erosion, vertical incision or thaw settlement. The major initiator of RTS on Banks Island, however, is a deepening thaw layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> caused by particularly warm summers such as 1998<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. A progressive rise in mean summer air temperature due to climate change, punctuated by positive deviations from that moving average, is therefore expected to trigger new RTS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Impacts on water bodies</title><p id="Par15">Three lakes (each &#x0003c;1.3&#x02009;ha in area) were infilled completely by sediment from adjacent RTS.

This suggests that the average longevity of RTS earlier in the century may have been less than during 1985&#x02013;2015. Because RTS must reactivate each summer, cold summers in the years following initiation could reduce longevity, and conversely, warm or wet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> summers could enhance it. This is supported by visual observations during analysis of the Timelapse dataset which indicated enhanced areal RTS growth during the warmest summers.</p><p id="Par22">Modelled RTS initiation rates for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, represented as the decadal means of 100 model runs, increase from 1616 (95% confidence 660&#x02013;4370) in 2016&#x02013;2025, to 11,580 (95% confidence 2693&#x02013;63,821) in 2086&#x02013;2095 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). These predictions indicate, therefore, that a further order of magnitude increase in RTS numbers could occur by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. This forecast requires examination because several factors could intervene to affect the empirical relationships on which it is based.</p><p id="Par23">First, it is possible that the relationship in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> could be affected downwards by geomorphic change associated with greater RTS activity. Sedimentation in river valleys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> might raise the local base level and create negative feedback to prevent or slow down renewed initiation. Our observations, however, are that sedimentation of sufficient magnitude to be visible in Timelapse imagery, generally occurs well downstream of RTS sources where rivers debouch from narrow valleys and water velocities likely slow (Supplementary Video&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Few RTS are present in these lower reaches of rivers. Furthermore, RTS initiated at coasts, on lakes or on slopes are not subject to this type of base level change. Consequently, while we cannot rule out this source of negative feedback, we believe that its impact on future activity will be minor.</p><p id="Par24">Second, warm summers, occurring at a sub-decadal frequency in the future, might individually have less of an impact on RTS initiation. This hypothesis is based on the idea that deep thaw in antecedent years would reduce ice contents in the transient layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, diminishing the likelihood that repeated high rates of late-summer thaw would generate elevated porewater pressures. This possibility is supported by the number of new RTS appearing in the southern part of Banks Island in 1999 and 2012 (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Nearly 1000 RTS were first observed in the earlier year when the weighted July&#x02013;August air temperature index for Sachs Harbour was 8.1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, while half that number (487) appeared in 2012, even though the index was higher (9.1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C). This suggests that the response to the 1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C increase may have been dampened by the deep thaw 13 years earlier. On the other hand, hundreds of RTS were initiated in all parts of the island as a result of three successive warm summers (2010&#x02013;2012) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) demonstrating that even if dampened, numbers remained high.</p><p id="Par25">A third question relates to the availability of terrain susceptible to RTS formation if rates climb as predicted. As mentioned above, active RTS still occupy only a small percentage of the landscape: about 0.1% of the entire island or 0.5% of the 13,000&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup> of terrain in which at least 1 RTS per 25&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup> was active (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Therefore, an order of magnitude increase in RTS numbers can be physically accommodated. Moreover, numerous valley side segments, lakeshores and coasts exhibit the scars of stabilised RTS (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), where no activity was detected during the Timelapse period. Since polycyclicity is common (Supplementary Videos&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">6</xref>), RTS numbers could increase within the boundaries of these previously impacted areas, especially given the extensive ground ice present in the Wisconsinan age moraine belts on Banks Island<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Finally, RTS were observed in entirely new locations across Banks Island during the high initiation years of 2011&#x02013;2013 which suggests that vulnerable areas may exist at the landscape scale outside the current concentrations. RTS could be initiated in these areas as the trend towards warmer summers results in the thaw of high ice content material buried at greater depths.</p><p id="Par26">A final point relates to RTS longevity. Observations and our hindcasting (see above) suggest that RTS may remain active longer if temperatures increase. The impact of such a change in longevity would be to increase the number of active RTS in the landscape at any given time, independent of the number of initiations.</p><p id="Par27">We conclude that the empirical relationships used for our modelling may be affected by changes in response as mean summer temperatures warm, but that sizable positive deviations from the mean will continue to initiate large numbers of RTS within and potentially outside the current areas of activity. These changes will develop more quickly than predicted if climate forcing exceeds the relatively moderate RCP4.5 scenario we used for our modelling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par28">We visually observed a 60-fold increase in RTS numbers on Banks Island from 63 in 1984 to a maximum of 4077 in 2013.

Most RTS remain active for several decades so even a single warm summer has a long-term effect on the landscape. The higher frequency of such events in the past 20 years has created cumulative impacts that have profoundly affected slopes, rivers and lakes on Banks Island.

However, it has the advantage that the cause of observed change is usually identifiable.

During assembly, pixels are selected as being representative of a given year so that an early season land cover change might be included while a late-season change might be rejected as an outlier. In some years, no appropriate data may be available for a given site leading to interpolation between years. Given our visual analysis, the main impact of these pre-treatments is to create a degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of RTS initiation and activity cessation.</p><p id="Par38">The initial survey of the island was carried out in duplicate by a class of senior undergraduate students at the University of Ottawa, with each student allocated an east&#x02013;west transect of about 5000&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup>. The results were compiled and trained student research assistants reviewed and added to the initial dataset of &#x0003e;1000 RTS, quadrupling the total numbers. The dataset for the entire island was examined by the first author, and a second review was undertaken for the areas with recorded RTS. In total, therefore, all areas with RTS were examined five times. The approach taken was to minimize false positives so that if there was doubt about the origin of an apparent change, it was not retained in the dataset. The mapped changes are therefore most likely to be an underestimate of the entire population, especially of (1) RTS smaller than 0.2&#x02009;ha, (2) those which were active for less than three years, and (3) those that were initiated close to the end of the record. For this reason, even though Timelapse includes 2016 images, initiation rates are presented to 2014 and total active RTS numbers to 2015.</p><p id="Par39">Once identified, each active RTS was given a unique number and classified according to its point of initiation (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Slope RTS included those initiated in the floor of an older previously stabilised or still-active feature.</p><p id="Par40">The year that each active RTS was first observed was recorded.

Temporal and spatial calculations and statistical analyses were carried out in Excel 16.11.1 for Mac after export of the dataset from Google Earth, and maps were generated in ESRI ArcGIS 10.6.</p><p id="Par43">A sample of RTS was digitized on available Google Earth imagery to establish an average growth curve in order to calculate the total area affected by RTS. Fifty RTS in each of the seven highest initiation years were selected in a spatially stratified sample. In addition, the entire population of RTS initiated from 1987&#x02013;1990 was included. The final sample was reduced to <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;341 as some RTS were initiated after the available image so they could not be measured and in a few cases, the resolution of the Google Earth imagery was too poor to allow confidence in the RTS outlining procedure. The area of an RTS that conjoined during its development with another numbered feature was calculated as a weighted average based on the combined area and the number of years of activity of each of the component RTS. Conjoined RTS were excluded from the sample where the initiation dates differed by more than five years. Because some RTS in the sample stabilised prior to the image date, their ages varied more than their initiation dates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).</p><p id="Par44">The average areal growth rate was applied to each individual RTS to estimate the total area of Banks Island affected over the Timelapse period. The area subject to RTS at the start of the record was established by examining each active RTS in Timelapse for 1984 and outlining its margins for that year on Google Earth, assuming that it initiated at the local base level. These RTS were given estimated ages based on their areas and then allowed to expand along the RTS growth line until their observed date of stabilisation (if any).</p><p id="Par45">The initial surveys showed that numerous lakes with RTS on their shorelines changed colour from dark blue to turquoise or in a few cases to beige, over the period of record and some expanded dramatically. These changes were recorded (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>), as were the location and timing of substantial sedimentation in catchments subject to intense RTS activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Validation of the Timelapse method</title><p id="Par46">Ten RTS were recorded as being active in part of the Sand Hills moraine during fieldwork in 1984, mostly along the coast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. All were identifiable in the Timelapse dataset. We are not aware of any other published field observations for Banks Island that are available to validate our historical results.</p><p id="Par47">Our results could be compared, however, to another remote sensing survey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> carried out using a 2015 high-resolution WorldView 2 satellite image of the 230&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup> Johnson Point watershed in eastern Banks Island. Our database showed 134 RTS as being active in the basin in 2015, more than 90% of which formed part of the 153 active RTS identified in the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Where there was disagreement between the two surveys, we re-examined the Timelapse images closely. Our assessment is that our survey omitted 12 RTS (8% of the total), mostly small features (average size 0.36&#x02009;ha; maximum 0.88&#x02009;ha) while two other small identified features (2%) may not have been RTS (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We also judged that we correctly identified 10 RTS which had been missed in the previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and that 19 previously identified disturbances were not active RTS in 2015. This analysis indicates that our island-wide RTS dataset should have fewer than 5% false positives but that up to 10% of active RTS, principally small features, may not have been detected. This size bias preferentially affects the youngest features, so post-2012 activity, or earlier RTS that were active only for a short time, are most subject to underestimation. We conclude that our dataset is at least as complete as earlier surveys carried out over limited areas, and that while it may underestimate the increase in activity during 1984&#x02013;2015, it should not overestimate the change.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Error matrix for identification of active retrogressive thaw slumps in 2015 for the Johnson Point watershed</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>RTS identified as active</th><th>RTS mis-identified as active</th><th>Active RTS not identified</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>This study</td><td>134 (93%)</td><td>2 (1%)</td><td>12 (8%)</td></tr><tr><td>Rudy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup></td><td>153 (106%)</td><td>19 (13%)</td><td>10 (7%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Percentages are calculated in relation to the estimated total number of RTS active in the catchment in 2015 (144)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Climate data</title><p id="Par48">We assessed the link between summer climate and RTS initiation for 1984&#x02013;2015 using the Hadley CRU 4.0 surface air temperature dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> with values extracted and averaged for all the grid cells covering Banks Island (71&#x02013;75&#x000b0;N and 117&#x02013;126&#x000b0;W). For hindcasting during the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, we used the same dataset from 1901 onwards. However, there was reduced variance in the dataset for the period 1901&#x02013;1925 because climatological averages were used for the northern part of the island in these years due to an absence of any proximal climate station. In all cases, we calculated a July&#x02013;August air temperature index weighted as 66.7% of the previous year and 33.3% of the current year. Other indices were tried, taking into account June or September monthly values or with differing inter-annual weightings, but the chosen index provided the best fit with RTS initiation during the Timelapse period.</p><p id="Par49">We used individual air temperature records from the three climate stations on Banks Island to examine spatial changes in RTS response (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). We used a homogenized dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> for Sachs Harbour while data for Thomsen River and Nangmagvik Lake were extracted directly from station records<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. All three stations had missing monthly data, but not in those summers when large numbers of RTS were first observed. Regression with the best available predictor station was used to infill individual months. Infilled air temperatures for Sachs Harbour were based on the Holman/Ulukhatok station located 300&#x02009;km to the southeast on Victoria Island (total of eight months; July: <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;32, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.75; August: <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;31, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.87). Infilling for Thomsen River was based on Sachs Harbour, 230&#x02009;km to the south (total of two months; July: <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.88; August: <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.75). For Nangmagvik Lake, infilling used records from Thomsen River, located 85&#x02009;km to the south (total of four months; July: <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.90, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; August: <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.90, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) or in their absence, records from Mould Bay located 230&#x02009;km to the north on Prince Patrick Island (total of two months; July: <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.44; August: <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, r<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.77).</p><p id="Par50">We investigated potential links between RTS initiation and summer rainfall which has been shown to be important in some more southerly regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. We first compared July&#x02013;August precipitation recorded at the three stations on Banks Island to examine whether there was spatial homogeneity. The coefficient of determination between Sachs Harbour and Thomsen River was 0.24 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) while it was 0.04 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14) between Sachs Harbour and Nangmagvik Lake. These low correlations demonstrate the difficulty of interpolating rainfall across distances of 200&#x02013;300&#x02009;km. Furthermore, reconstructions of precipitation in the Arctic Archipelago are also subject to considerable uncertainty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Given the limited record for the two northerly stations, we decided to compare Sachs Harbour alone to the logarithm of RTS initiation employing a July&#x02013;August precipitation index with the same weighting used for temperature (66.7% from the previous year and 33.3% from the current year). There was no significant relationship (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27). We also undertook a multiple regression analysis with both the July&#x02013;August weighted air temperature index and the precipitation index as independent variables but the latter proved statistically non-significant. The absence of statistical significance could be because the Sachs Harbour data are insufficiently representative of the major area of RTS on the east and north coasts, as suggested by the low correlations, or because a strong causal relationship is lacking. While we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that precipitation plays a role in RTS initiation on Banks Island, therefore, such a relationship was not supported by the data examined.</p><p id="Par51">For future modelling we used July and August monthly air temperatures generated from a multimodel mean (42 models; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) based on RCP4.5, selected as a moderate warming scenario. We calculated 2-year weighted mean July&#x02013;August temperatures for the period 2016&#x02013;2100 and smoothed the resultant values using an 11-year running mean. We then generated 100 potential records by randomly adding or subtracting deviations based on a normal distribution from the running mean, with the standard deviation equal to that of the Hadley CRU data for 1986&#x02013;2015 (1.1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C). Each record series was used with the relations in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> (best-fit, +95% confidence interval, and &#x02212;95% confidence interval) to produce a time series of RTS initiations. Each of the three sets of initiations was then averaged to produce decadal predictions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).</p><p id="Par52">Our predictions are potentially statistically conservative as the three highest years of record in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> all fall above the log-linear line. In fact, a second-order polynomial provides a closer fit to the highest points and yields a higher <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> value (0.72 vs. 0.64) but given the logarithmic dependent variable, this would yield RTS initiations for slightly higher July&#x02013;August temperatures that are several orders of magnitude outside the range of the record to date. For this reason, we concluded that the log-linear empirical relationship shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> was more appropriate for both the hindcasting and future modelling that we undertook.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>
