 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We administered two hundred surveys door-to-door in Raleigh, NC, during the summer of 2015. To promote a representative sample of demographic groups, the sample locations were evenly stratified across five social vulnerability classes, ranging from high to low vulnerability, found in Cutter et al.’s 2006–10 [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref040">40</a>] social vulnerability index (SoVI) data set. The 2006–10 SoVI data set is a national index of social vulnerability, comprising 27 sociological characteristics that are aggregated into quintiles. Eight significant components, including race and gender, explained 78% of the variance in the SoVI data set [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref040">40</a>]. Within the boundary of Raleigh’s city limits, we randomly selected forty households from each of the five SoVI levels using Hawth’s tools in ArcMap 10.x GIS software [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref041">41</a>]. We started sampling from those houses selected with the GIS analysis and, if no one answered, we visited every other house within the SoVI boundaries until a participant agreed to be surveyed.
