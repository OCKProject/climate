 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results contribute to literature on self-perceived climate knowledge by suggesting gender differences may be contingent on educational attainment. Women have been shown to underestimate their competence and intelligence in many fields, including climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref032">32</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref033">33</a>], a phenomenon commonly referred to as the “gender confidence gap” [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref043">43</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref044">44</a>]. The confidence gap is often attributed to the high standards of perfection to which women hold themselves [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref045">45</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref046">46</a>], as well as their risk-aversion [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref047">47</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref048">48</a>]. However, our results suggest this gap exists primarily among those with higher education and is perhaps reversed between the genders among those with low education.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multiple explanations for this interaction are possible. Negative stereotypes face women regarding their academic proficiency, especially in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref024">24</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref049">49</a>]. These negative stereotypes can elicit a disruptive and anxious state, known as stereotype-threat [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref024">24</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref050">50</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref051">51</a>], which can undermine academic performance and contribute to the high attrition rates of women in STEM fields [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref022">22</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref023">23</a>]. These stereotypes can also influence the way women and young girls are treated in classrooms; some teachers are biased against women, particularly in math and the sciences [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref052">52</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref053">53</a>], a phenomenon commonly referred to as expectation bias [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref054">54</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref055">55</a>]. These biases can further exacerbate the negative self-perceptions of female students [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref056">56</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref057">57</a>], and become self-fulfilling prophecies, as these students are often sent on less ambitious tracks [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref058">58</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The negative self-perceptions of knowledge held by educated women may actually be an indication of intelligence. Kruger and Dunning [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref021">21</a>] illustrated that the highest performing individuals underestimate their abilities, while those who over estimate, but are incompetent, do not recognize their incompetence because they lack metacognition. The “Dunning-Kruger” effect, as it is known, is supported by the climate change literature, where women exhibit more scientifically accurate climate change knowledge than do men, yet underestimate their climate change knowledge more than men [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref032">32</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref033">33</a>]. To better explain the differences in perceived knowledge between the genders observed in this and other studies, future studies should assess the actual and perceived levels of knowledge of climate change science between males and females throughout their educational careers.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One crucial implication of the “Dunning-Kruger effect” is that a low level of confidence in one’s own knowledge may actually be a driving force in the search for further information [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref018">18</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref020">20</a>]. Highly educated women may therefore be well suited to learning about the complex and controversial topic of climate change. Climate change can be an intrinsically challenging phenomenon to understand [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref009">9</a>] because political ideology promotes selective use of information [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref059">59</a>] and the causes are not directly observable [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref060">60</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref061">61</a>]. The critical thinking skills provided by higher education [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref062">62</a>], a healthy skepticism of ones own assumptions, and a drive to seek further knowledge—qualities that highly educated women likely possess, may aid in promoting a better understanding of climate science.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cultural exclusion, expectation bias, and limited representation of minorities in STEM majors [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref063">63</a>] likely all contributed to the low level of self-reported climate change knowledge among minority respondents. Minority groups are often culturally excluded from rigorous scientific and environmental education [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref064">64</a>] and many attend schools in low-income urban school districts, which are largely under-funded [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref065">65</a>]. Additionally, minority respondents may have self-reported lower levels of knowledge due to cultural stereotypes of intellectual ability, similar to those that plague women. For example, Steele and Aronson [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref024">24</a>] found that black students only underperform compared to white students when they believe their intellectual ability is being tested. The biased expectations that teachers have of minority students can influence their pedagogical effectiveness, further driving the academic underperformance of minorities [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref066">66</a>]. Future studies should explore the drivers of low perceived climate change knowledge among minorities and compare the levels of assessed climate change knowledge of minority groups to their levels of perceived knowledge.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasing climate change knowledge and self-perceptions of intelligence of minority groups is critical since we are projected to be a majority-minority country by 2043 [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref035">35</a>]. The lack of psycho-social support coupled with lower perceptions of knowledge could have negative implications for the engagement of racial minorities and women in climate change advocacy and education. More culturally diverse communicators on the topic of climate science could help encourage engagement [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref011">11</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref067">67</a>] as well as better k-12 environmental education programs in majority-minority schools. Studies have also found that one way to successfully fortify students against these ill effects is with social-psychological interventions, such as with praise to enforce an incremental theory of intelligence [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref068">68</a>] or through self-affirming writing assignments that aim to reduce negative stereotypes [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref069">69</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref070">70</a>].
