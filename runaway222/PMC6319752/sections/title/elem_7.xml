 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, self-perception of climate knowledge was higher among women than men, countering our initial hypothesis (
  <a rid="pone.0210149.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0210149.t001">Table 1</a>). However, education interacted with gender: highly educated women had a lower self-perception of climate change knowledge than less educated women, whereas highly educated men had a higher self-perception of climate change knowledge than less educated men (
  <a rid="pone.0210149.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0210149.t001">Table 1</a>; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210149.g001" href="#pone.0210149.g001">Fig 1</a>). Increasing educational attainment reversed the gap between the genders because self-perceived knowledge levels among women declined as their educational attainment increased. With all other variables held constant, women were around one point higher than men on the self-reported climate change knowledge scale at the lowest level of educational attainment, and around 0.6 points lower than men at the highest level of educational attainment. Minority respondents also perceived lower levels of knowledge about climate change than white respondents (

   <p>Both regression lines predicting climate change knowledge were generated from the regression equation used to generate results in 
    <a rid="pone.0210149.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0210149.t001">Table 1</a>â€”where demographic variables, as well as drought and disaster experience predict climate change knowledge. Error bars represent standard error. Y-axis starts at 3 as no respondents self-reported knowledge levels below 3.
