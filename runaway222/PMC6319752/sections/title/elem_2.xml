  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted our surveys in Raleigh, NC, which is a city comprised of a diverse and educated community, built around professional and technical services (Location Quotient = 1.78) and education services (Location Quotient = 0.98) [
   <a rid="pone.0210149.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref036">36</a>], [
   <a rid="pone.0210149.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref037">37</a>]. The percentage of the population with a bachelor’s degree or higher in Raleigh (49.2%), is greater than the average for the state of North Carolina (29%) [
   <a rid="pone.0210149.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref038">38</a>]. Raleigh’s population (pop. 464,758) is also relatively diverse compared to the state as a whole; 40.4% of the population in Raleigh is a minority race or ethnicity, compared to 29.2% statewide [
   <a rid="pone.0210149.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref038">38</a>]. Thus findings from this study are most relevant to other urban areas with an emerging economy and culture linked to technology, professional services, and educational services.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Survey instrument</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We measured respondent’s self-perceived knowledge of climate change on a 5-point scale with the statement “I feel knowledgeable about climate change.” Our survey instrument also included demographic questions about race, age, income, gender, and education, as well as respondent’s experience with natural disasters and drought. We measured education on an 11-point scale, ranging from no formal education completed (1) to a doctorate degree (11). Income was measured in $20,000 increments, ranging from less than $10,000 a year (below poverty) to more than $210,000 a year. The design of the survey instrument was guided by Dillman’s tailored design method [
   <a rid="pone.0210149.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref039">39</a>]. The final instrument was developed with pretesting among an equal number of respondents across five social vulnerability classes (n = 20). Respondents were asked at the end of the survey to give feedback on the instrument. After evaluating this feedback, cognitive interviews were conducted with 5 participants to identify any alternative interpretations of survey questions. All research was reviewed and approved by the NC State University Institutional Review Board for the Use of Human Subjects in Research (Protocol Number 4087) and respondents before each survey provided written informed consent.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sampling</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We administered two hundred surveys door-to-door in Raleigh, NC, during the summer of 2015. To promote a representative sample of demographic groups, the sample locations were evenly stratified across five social vulnerability classes, ranging from high to low vulnerability, found in Cutter et al.’s 2006–10 [
   <a rid="pone.0210149.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref040">40</a>] social vulnerability index (SoVI) data set. The 2006–10 SoVI data set is a national index of social vulnerability, comprising 27 sociological characteristics that are aggregated into quintiles. Eight significant components, including race and gender, explained 78% of the variance in the SoVI data set [
   <a rid="pone.0210149.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref040">40</a>]. Within the boundary of Raleigh’s city limits, we randomly selected forty households from each of the five SoVI levels using Hawth’s tools in ArcMap 10.x GIS software [
   <a rid="pone.0210149.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref041">41</a>]. We started sampling from those houses selected with the GIS analysis and, if no one answered, we visited every other house within the SoVI boundaries until a participant agreed to be surveyed.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We constructed a full ordinary least squares regression model in SAS version 9.4 software for Windows [
   <a rid="pone.0210149.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref042">42</a>], for the dependent variable, “I feel knowledgeable about climate change.” We controlled for the following predictor variables: age, race, education, gender, past experience with any natural disasters and drought, and included an interaction term between education and gender. We collapsed the seven race categories into white and minority due to low response rates in several categories. Income was not included in the full model as it was collinear with educational attainment (
