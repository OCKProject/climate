 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Educational efforts are often promoted as antidotes to apathy and denial associated with environmental issues. Increased environmental knowledge often predicts concerns over the social and environmental impacts of climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref001">1</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref002">2</a>], which in turn promotes individual and collective action [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref003">3</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref005">5</a>]. Despite the effectiveness of education as a tool to promote environmental action, achieving and fostering climate literacy can also be challenging as educational efforts are confounded by successful media campaigns to foster skepticism among the public [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref006">6</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref007">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change literacy can serve to further polarize certain individuals [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref008">8</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref010">10</a>]. Kahan et al. (2012) found that scientific literacy and numeracy has opposite effects on climate change concern among those with differing worldviews [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref011">11</a>]. They found that those who subscribe to a worldview that ties authority to conspicuous social rankings become less concerned about the risks of climate change with increasing scientific literacy and numeracy. Those with worldviews that favor less regimented forms of social organization and greater collective attention to the individual respond to climate change education with increasing concern. This gap is attributed to identity-protective cognition, wherein the holders of certain worldviews use and credit the information that is supportive of their own values and opinions [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref008">8</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref011">11</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref013">13</a>]. Adolescents, however, appear more capable of transcending their personal ideology to learn about climate change than adults [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref014">14</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref015">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Self-perceptions of knowledge represent a less studied factor that may also shape efficacy of climate change education efforts. Perceptions of intelligence can determine how people engage with issues; for example, illusions of superiority can distort the way people filter and take-in information [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref016">16</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref017">17</a>]. Studies find that if people feel confident in their levels of knowledge, regardless of their assessed knowledge, they are unlikely to be motivated to acquire new information [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref018">18</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref020">20</a>]; feelings of academic inferiority, on the other hand, can drive the search for further knowledge [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref018">18</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref020">20</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref021">21</a>]. Alternatively, negative self-perceptions can have detrimental impacts; studies find low confidence is one contributing factor to the high attrition rates of women and minorities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref022">22</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref023">23</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Negative cultural stereotypes can lead to these biased self-perceptions by inducing fear and anxiety—known as stereotype threat [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref024">24</a>]. Stereotype threat undermines academic performance and can reduce one’s sense of agency [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref023">23</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref025">25</a>]. Negative stereotypes exist in particular for women and minority groups. Both men and women perceive women to be less knowledgeable on the topics of politics [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref026">26</a>] and science [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref027">27</a>], and studies find individuals with lighter skin are perceived to be more intelligent, regardless of their assessed intelligence [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref028">28</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Few studies have explored the knowledge perceptions of women and minorities as it relates to climate change science. This is a critical gap within the climate change perceptions literature for several reasons. First, although women appear to be more ideologically receptive to climate change education than men [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref007">7</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref029">29</a>], they may possess self-perceived limitations, intensified by educational attainment [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref030">30</a>]-[
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref032">32</a>], that could influence the way they engage with this increasingly important topic [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref033">33</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref034">34</a>]. In addition, the demographics of America are shifting; the US Census Bureau (2012a) predicts the US will be a majority-minority country as early as 2043 [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref035">35</a>]. This means that non-whites will be increasingly exposed to, and required to respond to, the impacts of climate change in America. Ensuring that these groups feel empowered to take on such a challenge is therefore important.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our goal was to evaluate the self-perceptions of knowledge on climate change among various socio-demographic groups, particularly women and minorities. We tested whether the following: age, education, gender, experience with disaster and drought, race, and an interaction between gender and education, predicted the respondent’s self-perceived level of climate change knowledge. Because women may underestimate their comprehension of climate science [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref032">32</a>], we anticipated that women would perceive a lower level of climate change knowledge than their male counterparts. We also expected that increasing educational attainment would further reduce the level of knowledge perceived by women, since increasing education may reduce confidence in knowledge among women [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref030">30</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref031">31</a>]. Similarly, we hypothesized that minority respondents would self-report less knowledge on climate change than white respondents because previous research suggests racial minorities experience negative self-perceptions of intelligence [
  <a rid="pone.0210149.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210149.ref023">23</a>].
