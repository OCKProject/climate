 <div class="title">Vulnerability in the climatic thread of high temperature and heat waves.</div>
 <p>The vulnerability in 2016 increases significantly by 10%â€“15% in all 16 districts compared to 2008. High vulnerability to heat waves was observed in the urban core areas of districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng, due to high percentage of high-rise building and limited green areas (high sensibility), high percentage of population above 65 years old and relative high percentage of outdoor workers (high exposure).</p>
