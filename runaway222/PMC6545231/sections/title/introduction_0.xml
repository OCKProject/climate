 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A vulnerability assessment can be a useful tool for providing information about where we are with regard to the development of the adaptive capacity of a city and the adaptation activities of the population with respect to climate change (
  <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">Amaru &amp; Chhetri, 2013</a>). The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) notes that “adaptation emerged as a focus area under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2001. However, the attention given to it is still not equal to mitigation with regard to target-setting, financing, and institutional frameworks”. By establishing an explicit long-term adaptation goal in Article 7, the Paris Agreement (
  <a rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-20">UNFCCC, 2015</a>) builds on an international consensus on the need of vulnerability reduction and confirms that adaptation to climate change is a key pillar of UNFCCC. Magnan and Ribera observe as a challenge that climate change adaptation achieves ”equal prioritization with mitigation (given) the relative fuzziness of adaptation as a policy area” (
  <a rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-16">Magnan &amp; Ribera, 2016</a>). Ford adds that “mitigation policy constitutes a response to a clear problem (GHG emissions) and can be measured and tracked using standardized and accepted indicators (e.g., tons of carbon). In contrast, adaptation is difficult to define and track, especially in relation to policy issues like development or disaster risk management” (
  <a rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-9">Ford &amp; Berrang-Ford, 2016</a>). Adaptation is place- and context-specific, with no single approach for reducing risks appropriate across all settings (
  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">IPCC, 2014</a>). Vulnerability to climate change can be an accepted indicator for measuring and tracking the success of the adaptation process.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A large and diverse literature has emerged how to assess vulnerability to climate change. The common challenges are to develop robust and credible measures using indicators and indices (known as indicator-based vulnerability assessment (IBVA)) at international, national and local levels (
  <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">Birkmann, 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-3">Birkmann, 2005</a>). Since climate change vulnerability assessment is a complex form of risk assessment, indicators to be used cover components of both geophysical and socio-economic systems (
  <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">El-Zein &amp; Tonmoy, 2015</a>). Unlike a single system, complex geophysical and socio-economic systems requires large number of indicators for capturing all aspects of vulnerability, and thus all IBVA approaches are facing challenges of selection of necessary indicators, aggregation of indicators into an index, linking indicators to policy implication (
  <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">Bollin &amp; Hidajat, 2006</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are two methods for aggregating single indicators into indices in the literature. One is weighting single indicators, and the other is non-weighting single indicators. Weighting means that all single indicators will have different contributions to the integrated index, while non-weighting means that all single indicators have the same contributions to the integrated index. Weights are the measures of importance. There are three arguments for weighting indicators. (a) It is priority-based, and tends to be more realistic than non-weighted indicators. By weighting, priority issues can be addressed and emphasized, and reasonable judgments and decisions can be made. This is very important for the efficient distribution of available resources, and identifying key issues that all stakeholders are concerned about and agree upon. (b) It avoids loss of information during the indicators’ aggregation as much as possible. It is obvious that key indicators will have more weights than others, and aggregated index will have close linkages to the key indicators. The most relevant information will be used in the final index. (c) It is participation-based. The weighting process requires public participation for making judgments. Experts, stakeholders as well as citizens may be involved in the weighting process, and their opinions will have significant influence on the weights of indicators. Since there is no precise mathematical relationship between indicators that ultimately indicate or measure vulnerability, there are limitations in weighting geophysical and socio-economic indicators in measuring vulnerability (
  <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">El-Zein &amp; Tonmoy, 2015</a>). Weighting indicators make more sense at local level. However, the complexity of issues and the lack of scientific weighting methodologies have been obstructing the application of weighting indicators (
  <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">Tonmoy, El-Zein &amp; Hinkel, 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">World Economic Forum, 2001</a>). Environmental indicators can be aggregated by weighting according to their contribution to the environmental issues, which can be determined by scientific research. However, it is very difficult to integrate economic and social indicators by weighting. This is why weighting indicators have not yet been commonly used in the aggregation of social and economic indicators. In our research, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been applied, together with expert judgment for integrating weighted indicators into the index of vulnerability. We find that this method is useful for cities like Beijing, where there is a lack of data, where the situation may differ in different locations and where it is impossible to use a large numbers of indicators for measuring vulnerability to climate change.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two questions remain in measuring vulnerability. The first concerns “the identification of appropriate reference points from which to assess whether we are successfully enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change” (Article 7, para 2, the Paris Agreement). Reference points in emission reduction target-setting have been identified by the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Conference. However setting a reference point for adaptation requires much more and diverse information. The second question concerns the review processes for assessing vulnerability and thus measuring progress on adaptation commitments. It ”will need to balance robustness and comparability of units or indicators that capture key aspects of vulnerability and adaptive capacity with being contextually appropriate” (
  <a rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-16">Magnan &amp; Ribera, 2016</a>). “Transparent and consistent decision-making on climate financing will require clarity on how adaptation intersects with broader development and risk reduction efforts, and thus what constitutes a progression beyond previous efforts” (Article 9, para 3, the Paris Agreement).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess vulnerability, it is crucial to define vulnerability. The most authoritative and widely quoted definition of vulnerability in the context of climate change is developed by the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (
  <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">IPCC, 2007</a>). “Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity”. The IPCC definition has significant limitations. Most critically the three components of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity have not been clearly defined and thus the challenge is to develop indicators for measuring the three components mentioned above. Patt observes that “The IPCC concept in general has proven difficult to operationalize in practice” (
  <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Patt et al., 2009</a>). There is considerable debate in the literature as to what constitutes adaptive capacity and how it might be recognized (
  <a rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-25">Yohe &amp; Tol, 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-6">Brooks, Adger &amp; Kelly, 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Vincent, 2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A city is a complex system composed of multiple sub-systems that interact in various and often crucial ways (
  <a rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-22">Van Dijk &amp; Zhang, 2005</a>). Vulnerability related to climate change corresponds with risks of all sub-systems in climate change. However, if measuring vulnerability wants to take all dimensions of vulnerability into account, a considerable number of indicators for measuring of vulnerability is required. The challenge is to deal with two controversial issues. One, the growing complexity of the definition of urban vulnerability related to climate change and secondly, the practical demand for simplicity of information concerning vulnerability. There is no consensus how many indicators are needed for effective measurement of urban vulnerability. The point is to identify the essential elements that could capture the relevant information on the total system.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Main challenges for development of vulnerability assessment include (1) lack of data availability or gaps in the data, (2) integrating different sources of information (e.g., peer-reviewed and grey literature, quantitative data with qualitative information and expert judgment), (3) development and use of a unified methodology (e.g., common climate scenarios, metrics), (4) involvement of stakeholders, (5) collection of information is expensive in terms of time and resources and (6) development of effective indicators (
  <a rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-8">European Environment Agency, 2018</a>). This article addresses the mentioned-above challenges of (1)–(4).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concept of vulnerability is complex and a one dimensional approach could not meet the needs of vulnerability assessment. Hence an integrated approach is necessary. This article is concerned with creating an urban vulnerability index (UVI) following a step-by-step approach in the context of urban China and intends to help policy-makers at the city and district levels to get insight in the factors determining vulnerability by measuring the progress achieved in adaptation to climate change in the urban areas. Our strategy is first to develop an urban vulnerability index, and secondly to measure empirically the UVI in Beijing, the capital city of China and its major districts. It is the first time such an assessment of vulnerability to climate change is taking place in Beijing, although there are various natural disaster risk assessments reported that use two single indicators (economic damages and mortality) without weighting. The methods developed in this research can become a useful tool for other emerging cities as well.</p>
