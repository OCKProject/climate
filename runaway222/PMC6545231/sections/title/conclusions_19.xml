 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following key conclusions could help explain the vulnerability to climate change in Beijing.</p>

   <p>The IOM result depicted in 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2</a> shows that priority climatic threats are urban drainage floods, high temperature and heat waves and water scarcity and drought in Beijing. Therefore the main source for adapting to climate change in Beijing is increasing the adaptive capacity to be able to respond to heavy rains and drainage floods, high temperature and heat waves and water scarcity and drought. The IOM results revealed that the most harmful climatic threat was historically urban floods in Beijing. However this is changing recently and high temperature and heat waves are going to be the most harmful climatic threat as indicated in 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6" href="#fig-6">Fig. 6</a>.

   <p>Vulnerability to high temperature and heat waves in 2016 increased significantly (
    <span class="italic">T</span>-test result for the long-term trend) by 10%–15% in all 16 districts of Beijing compared to 2008. High vulnerability to heat waves is observed in the urban core areas of the districts Dongcheng and Xicheng, due to high sensibility and high exposure in these two districts.

   <p>Vulnerability to heavy rain and drainage floods in 2016 increases significantly (
    <span class="italic">T</span>-test result for the long-term trend) by 5%–10% as compared to 2008, except the district of Shunyi, where the Beijing Capital International Airport is located and where its vulnerability decreases in the past 10 years. High vulnerability to heavy rain and drainage floods is observed in the urban core areas (downtown) of two districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng.

   <p>Vulnerability to drought increased significantly (
    <span class="italic">T</span>-test result for the long-term trend) by about 10% in the districts of urban new development area and particularly in the four districts of urban ecological conservation area, but decreased by about 10% in the districts of urban core areas and urban extended areas.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While no measure of such a complex phenomenon can be perfect, we suggest further research in this field. Firstly, it is necessary to operationalize international understanding of vulnerability within local contexts. Local communities are all in different stages of preparedness to adapt to climate change. They need to understand locally vulnerability, and should have the tools to identify the influence of local governmental policies on local vulnerability through a process of bottom-up changes. For supporting local understanding and assessment of vulnerability, it is suggested that future IPCC report could attach a technical guideline on vulnerability assessment that can be directly used in or adapted to local conditions. Contextualization of international understanding and approaches can inform local adaptation policy and help incorporating climate futures in planning, and thus provide support to achieving SDG targets on climate change and urbanization.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Secondly, a number of refinements for the selection of single indicators and their aggregation need to be undertaken to deepen local understanding of vulnerability. The score of UVI highly depends on what indicators have been used, how much weight have been assigned to the various factors, and what kind of vulnerability rule has been set up. It is obvious that there are a variety of value judgments and significant uncertainties about the assured causality. It is necessary to deepen further studies on those issues.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thirdly, to be useful, the UVI advanced by this research need to be applied in more cities. Applying the UVI in more Chinese cities, and modifying the UVI accordingly are needed. Finally, a major investment in data collection is clearly called for. Both availability and data quality are crucial to a successful measure of vulnerability.</p>
