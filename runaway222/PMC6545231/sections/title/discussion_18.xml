 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The vulnerability assessment has dominated climate change adaptation programmes at various levels of community, city, region, country and the world as a whole (

  <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">Sheridan &amp; Kalkstein, 2004</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Ford et al., 2015</a>). All assessments are developed based on the definitions of vulnerability and this article is based on the IPCC definition. The IPCC definition defines three components of sensibility, exposure and adaptive capacity of vulnerability. The advantages of the IPCC definition are that it is easy to communicate and results can be compared. The limitation is that the three components lack policy relevance. For linking the assessment to adaptation policies and actions, multi-dimensional vulnerability has been defined and multi-dimensional vulnerability encompasses physical, economic, social, environmental and institutional features (
  <a rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-3">Birkmann, 2005</a>). It is obvious that a multi-dimensional vulnerability assessment needs more indicators and data than the three-dimensional model developed in this article. From definition to practical assessment, the most important challenge facing vulnerability assessments is how to contextualize a definition for the local level, community or district level and even street level. This article started from the 87 indicators selected from literature and, by contextualization, finally 23 indicators are selected for assessing vulnerability to climate change. We argue that the three-dimensional model requires limited indicators and data and thus it is better fitting with cities and communities where data is lacking.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The majority of vulnerability assessments focuses on international, national and regional levels and it is necessary to downscale to the community level for supporting local policy framing and adaptation actions (

  <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Lesnikowski et al., 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-1">Adger, 2006</a>). In this article, the focus was on the city and district levels. We go beyond the IPCC framing of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity by developing indicators for them. We have communicated this research results with local stakeholders and the feedback shows that vulnerability assessment on a grid scale is much needed, since it provides crucial information for policy makers and stakeholders to take local actions. We argue that, for improving policy relevance and intensifying linkages of the assessment and local action, urban vulnerability assessments need to downscale to the street level. In this regard, combining IBVA with GIS is called for in the future, since GIS could provide data on very small scale, e.g., on scale of one km

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this research the Impact Oriented Monitoring (IOM) together with stakeholders’ participation is proven effective to define priority climatic threats. Applying IOM requires collection of high-quality historical data. IOM could provide direct effects of climate disaster and thus it help to communicate with policy makers and stakeholders and helps to understand climate threats that a city may face. By applying IOM, priority climate threats have been identified and thus we capture the key features of vulnerability. Hence it provides valuable and reliable information on vulnerability to difference climatic threats at the city and district level.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The selection of primary indicators is based on a literature study and the reduction and weighting of indicators were the result of a combined experts’ opinions, stakeholders’ participation and using AHP. There are limitations in aggregating weighted indicators using the additive approach that is mainly based on Multiple Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) (
  <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">Tonmoy, El-Zein &amp; Hinkel, 2014</a>). Indicators should be independent and there should be a precise mathematical relationship between indicators. In the literature, most indicator-based vulnerability assessments use MAUT for aggregation of indicator despite the fact that IBVA rarely satisfies MAUT. In our study, we have introduced the criterion of indicator independence in the preliminary selection of indicators. We argue that MAUT is applicable to aggregation of indicators, since all IBVA in vulnerability studies are empirical. However, one must be very careful to explain and communicate the IBVA results, since IBVA provides information more on variations of vulnerability to climate change as indicated in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" href="#fig-4">Figs. 4</a> to 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7" href="#fig-7">7</a>. IBVA hardly provides information on the absolute value of vulnerability.

This vulnerability assessment, which addressed priority climatic threats in Beijing, provides a holistic understanding of the susceptibility to climate change that could be a guidance for facilitating future adaptation.</p>
