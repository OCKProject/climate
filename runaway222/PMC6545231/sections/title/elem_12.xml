 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An urban vulnerability index (UVI) that measures vulnerability to climate changes is a crucial part of the adaptation capacity building process. An UVI is an assessment, information and monitoring tool. As an assessment tool, it helps identify risks and vulnerabilities. As an information tool, it can better instruct the design of early-warning systems and adaptation action plan as well as raise awareness and communicate about vulnerability and risks. As a monitoring tool, it can identify how well a city has responded and recovered to disasters and shocks and whether the targets have been met. Hence, an UVI plays a role during the whole adaptation capacity building process. By applying the three-dimension framework presented in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2</a>, together with literature reviews and expert approach, the composite UVI is presented in the

High vulnerability to the threat of drainage of floods is observed in the urban core areas (downtown) of two districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng, due to the factors of high percentage of paved areas (high sensibility), high population density and high percentage of population above 65 years (high exposure) and old or very old urban drainage system (lower adaptive capacity) that was built 40 years ago.

High vulnerability to heat waves was observed in the urban core areas of districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng, due to high percentage of high-rise building and limited green areas (high sensibility), high percentage of population above 65 years old and relative high percentage of outdoor workers (high exposure). Lower vulnerability in heat waves observed in the district of Yangqing, which is the core ecological conservation area with high green area, less population density and less high-rise buildings. Most districts are in middle vulnerability with value between 0.4–0.6. There are relative low vulnerability in districts of urban new development area and in the ecological conservation area of districts of Huairou, Pinggu and Miyun. These districts have low exposure and low sensibility. In practice, these districts are the main ecological conservation and recreation areas in Beijing.

The UVI in the case of heat waves is highest and it is obviously increasing during the period of 2008 –2016, given to the factors of increasing sensibility (e.g., increasing of numbers of day and night of heat waves annually, limited green space, and increasing of high-rise buildings) and of exposure (e.g., increasing of population density and population above 65 years old, increasing of outdoor workers). Although adaptive capacity in all 16 districts is increasing, the increase is not enough to overcome the increase in both sensibility and exposure. The integrated UVI in the case of drought is almost stabilized, due to that fact that this UVI decreases in the urban core areas and increases in the urban outskirt of ecological conservation areas. The integrated UVI in the case of floods increases slowly, due to the fact that the increase of both sensibility and exposure increases the UVI and the improvement of urban drainage services and governance capacity decreases the UVI.
