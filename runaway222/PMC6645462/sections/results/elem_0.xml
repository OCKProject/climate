These higher rates of Rh increase in all the three scenarios may suggest that Rh was more sensitive to climate change than NPP. On average, the alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau behaved as a carbon sink, with a simulated NEP on a range of 11 ± 16 g C m

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g002" href="#pone.0215261.g002">Fig 2C</a>). However, the temporal dynamics of the NEP indicated relatively less variability than NPP and Rh under the three RCP scenarios, and decreased continually with the slopes of -0.14 g C m

This indicated that the potential capacity for carbon sequestration on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands would gradually decrease under future climate change, because the magnitude of the variation rate of Rh was greater than that of NPP.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The response of the decadal carbon budget to future climate change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify the carbon cycle of the Tibetan Plateau grasslands in response to the climate variability, we further evaluate the decadal-scale dynamics of climate and carbon budgets during three time periods (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">Fig 5</a>). The 2010s ~ 2030s time period was calculated as the difference between the decadal averages of the years 2010 ~ 2019 and 2030 ~ 2039, and the same was done for the 2040s ~ 2060s and 2070s ~ 2090s time periods. The decadal change of carbon fluxes (e.g. ΔNPP and ΔRh) were positively linearly correlated with the ΔT
   <sub>max</sub> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</a>) and ΔT

   <span class="sup">2</span> in a range of 0.59 ~ 0.67 (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01). It was suggested that the increase in temperature could stimulate both vegetation production and also Rh. Furthermore, the linear slopes indicated that 1% increase in T
   <sub>max</sub> and T
   <sub>min</sub> caused a larger increase of Rh by 0.27% (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">Fig 5C</a>) and 0.24% (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">Fig 5H</a>) than those of NPP by 0.23% (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">Fig 5D</a>) and 0.21% (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">Fig 5G</a>). This suggested that Rh was more sensitive than NPP to increasing temperature. Consequently, the simulated NEP exhibited a decreasing trend under a warming climate. With respect to the response to the decadal change of precipitation, the dynamics of the ΔNPP and ΔRh showed an increasing trend with ΔPrecipitation, while these positive responses tended to be stagnant (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</a>). As the decadal change of precipitation varied within comparatively small ranges (~ 5%), temperature might play an important role in modulating the carbon fluxes of alpine grassland. Taken together, the changes in ΔNEP suggested that the alpine grassland still behaved as a carbon sink but its capacity declined over the 21st century.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">Fig 5B, 5E and 5H</a>), and consequently led to a decrease in ΔNEP from 25% to 16% and 6% (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">Fig 5C, 5F and 5I</a>). In response to the continual decrease in temperature and precipitation, the changes in the decadal carbon dynamics were predicted to show a corresponding downward trend in the RCP2.6 scenario. For RCP4.5, the ΔPrecipitation was -1%, 1%, and 0%, with the ΔT
   <sub>max</sub> 12%, 6%, and 4%, and the ΔT
   <sub>min</sub> 6%, 6%, and 4% in the 2010s ~ 2030s, 2040s ~ 2060s and 2070s ~ 2090s time periods, respectively. In this scenario, the reduction in the magnitude of the warming trend was accompanied by stable precipitation, which led to a corresponding decrease in ΔNPP of 5%, 3%, and 4%, and in ΔRh of 7%, 5%, and 4%, respectively. The discrepant magnitudes of the increase in NPP and Rh across different periods, resulting in the variations of the ΔNEP were -13%, -30%, and 8%, respectively. The decrease in ΔNEP in the first two periods was mainly due to a larger increase in Rh than NPP. Under RCP8.5, both the precipitation and temperature were projected to increase when the ΔPrecipitation was 5%, 1%, and 7%, and the ΔT
   <sub>max</sub> was 10%, 22%, and 14%, and the ΔT
   <sub>min</sub> was 7%, 20%, and 25% for 2010s ~ 2030s, 2040s ~ 2060s and 2070s ~ 2090s time periods, respectively. The projected large warming trend over the Tibetan Plateau would favor the growth of alpine grass, with a ΔNPP of 8%, 6%, and 8%, and could also exacerbate carbon decomposition with a ΔRh of 9%, 7%, and 8%, respectively. Consequently, the NEP correspondingly decreased by -3%, -21%, and -3%, respectively. The substantial decrease in the ΔNEP over the 2040s ~ 2060s time period was also partially due to the water stress under strong warming conditions. The dynamics of NEP were largely dependent on the different responses of NPP and Rh to climate change.
