 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The carbon fluxes of the alpine grassland in the Tibetan Plateau were stimulated to be strongly influenced by the climate change and elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref005">5</a>]. Over the 21st century, the Tibetan Plateau grassland NPP and Rh were projected to significantly increase, at rates of 0.35 ~ 1.52 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> and 0.49 ~ 1.62 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, respectively, under the three scenarios. These increases in NPP and Rh were primarily due to the effects of warming and elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations, while the positive impact of precipitation became stable (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">5</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" href="#pone.0215261.g006">6</a>). The enhanced vegetation production in future projections was consistent with the model estimations of Gao et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref007">7</a>] and Jin et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref030">30</a>]. The dynamics of decadal carbon fluxes (ΔNPP and ΔRh) were predicted to decrease with precipitation and temperature under RCP2.6, and with temperature in a relatively stable precipitation scenario under RCP4.5 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">Fig 5</a>). Across all scenarios, the partial correlation (R) between the carbon fluxes (NPP and Rh) and T
  <sub>mean</sub> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g004" href="#pone.0215261.g004">Fig 4A–4F</a>) were higher than those with precipitation (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g003" href="#pone.0215261.g003">Fig 3A–3F</a>), except for the Rh in RCP4.5. These results suggested that the carbon cycle in the alpine region may be primarily controlled by the temperature increase. However, the partial correlation between carbon sink (NEP) and T
  <sub>mean</sub> was predicted to decrease from 0.14 in RCP2.6 to -0.09 in RCP8.5 under a warmer scenario (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g004" href="#pone.0215261.g004">Fig 4G and 4I</a>). The partial correlation of NEP with precipitation were equal to 0.07 and 0.08 in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g003" href="#pone.0215261.g003">Fig 3H and 3I</a>), which were higher than with T
  <sub>mean</sub> (0.04 and -0.09, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g004" href="#pone.0215261.g004">Fig 4H and 4I</a>). Furthermore, the decadal carbon fluxes were predicted to decrease with decreasing precipitation, albeit increasing temperature under RCP8.5 during the 2040s ~ 2060s (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">Fig 5</a>). The role of precipitation was becoming increasingly important in carbon uptake of the Tibetan Plateau grassland. The seasonal dynamics of carbon exchange in alpine grassland under warming were likely to be modulated by water availability [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref036">36</a>]. Similar results were found in Inner Mongolia [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref052">52</a>], the central and eastern United States [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref053">53</a>], and California [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref054">54</a>], which indicated that grass production would largely decrease under warmer and drier climate scenarios. The warming accelerated the evapotranspiration and then changed the soil water availability [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref055">55</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref056">56</a>]. When the soil water availability became limited, the vegetation production might decrease due to suppressed photosynthesis [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref057">57</a>] and also reduce root biomass [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref058">58</a>]. Shen et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref006">6</a>] and Shen et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref059">59</a>] further indicated that the precipitation may regulate the response of vegetation phenology and soil respiration to climatic warming on the Tibetan Plateau. The water availability became an increasingly important factor on carbon dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands, particularly under a warmer climate scenario. These results highlight the significance of accurate projection of precipitation (i.e. the amounts and distributions) under three RCP scenarios, which should be considered in estimates of the carbon fluxes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Tibetan Plateau grasslands were projected to be a net carbon sink (16 ~ 25 Tg C yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) over the 21st century, which was comparable to the results of Jin et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref030">30</a>] with NEP ranging from 18 to 46 Tg C yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>. However, the temporal dynamics of NEP all exhibited a slightly decreasing trend, with slopes of -0.07 ~ -0.14 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> across the three RCP scenarios. This was probably due to the fact that warming induced more carbon inputs into the soil and accelerated respiration rates (Rh), leading to reduced carbon uptake [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref060">60</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref061">61</a>]. On the other side, Cao and Woodward [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref062">62</a>] found that the increasing trend in carbon uptake would be diminished by the acclimated response to climate variability and CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect. Consequently, the temporal dynamics of simulated SOC increased 10 ~ 15 Mg C ha 
  <span class="sup">-1</span> (i.e., 1.4 ~ 2.1 Pg C for 1.4 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) over the 21st century, while the changing rate showed a decreasing trend of -0.12 ~ -0.06 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.01) under the three RCP scenarios. These results were in line with the projections from the CMIP5 [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref063">63</a>], but inconsistent with the findings of Crowther et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref064">64</a>], due largely to the high initial SOC density in high-latitude areas. Our findings suggested that the carbon sequestration in the vegetation and soil was projected to increase under three RCP scenarios, but the carbon sequestration rate was predicted to decrease gradually on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The carbon dynamics exhibited a large discrepancy in response to climate change with and without the effect of elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations. The carbon uptake by vegetation could be strongly stimulated by CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization, especially in July [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref065">65</a>]. The increasing CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration accounted for 1.9% ~ 7.3% of the increase in NPP (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" href="#pone.0215261.g006">Fig 6A</a>), which was less than the range of 9% ~ 11% in the perennial grassland experiment at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in central Minnesota during 1998 ~ 2010 [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref066">66</a>]. Furthermore, the slope of NPP was predicted to increase by 18% ~ 29% under CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization among all scenarios, which was slightly less than the estimates of Piao et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref003">3</a>] (~ 39%) on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands during the past five decades. This was probably due to the effect of CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization, which tended to be saturated over time, and the discrepancy that existed in different models. Furthermore, the response of Rh to CO
  <sub>2</sub> was of the same magnitude (1.7% ~ 6.1%) as that in NPP during the 21st century. The elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations generally had a positive effect on soil respiration by regulating the carbon uptake and allocation, and on the availability of substrate and soil water [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref067">67</a>]. Consequently, the almost consistent increase in NPP and Rh caused by the elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> on the alpine grassland resulted in a relatively small difference in NEP (0.9 ~ 4.9 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" href="#pone.0215261.g006">Fig 6C</a>). However, the grassland carbon cycle was projected to be amplified by around two to three times due to higher CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations under RCP8.5 compared to that in RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. The different potential responses to elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> levels were partly due to the different climate conditions among the three RCP scenarios. For RCP2.6, the increasing CO
  <sub>2</sub> associated with a decreasing trend in temperature and precipitation had a minor effect on the carbon cycle (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" href="#pone.0215261.g006">Fig 6A</a>). Furthermore, the elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> favored plant growth limitedly in RCP4.5, as the continually warming and stable precipitation may induce water stress (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" href="#pone.0215261.g006">Fig 6B</a>). However, increasing temperature and precipitation, together with increasing CO
  <sub>2</sub>, greatly enhanced the carbon uptake in the alpine ecosystem under RCP8.5 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" href="#pone.0215261.g006">Fig 6C</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the dynamically downscaled climate data using regional climate models (RCMs) indicated an improved performance compared to the coarse output from global climate models (GCMs) [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref051">51</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref068">68</a>]. Jin et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref030">30</a>] indicated that the increased resolution of RCMs was preferable for capturing the regional climate patterns, especially under the complex surface characteristics of the Tibetan Plateau. There are also substantial uncertainties in projected climate change for RCMs, coming from the driving GCMs and human action [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref069">69</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref070">70</a>]. Moreover, without taking the effect of nitrogen (N) into account, the quantitative attribution of future climate change and elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations on the carbon dynamics of the Tibetan Plateau grasslands should be considered merely suggestive. The N is regarded as a limiting factor, controlling the carbon uptake and further influencing the climate–carbon cycle feedback [

  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref071">71</a>]. Further efforts should be made to incorporate N feedback to constrain the uncertainty of the carbon cycle in response to a changing environment [
