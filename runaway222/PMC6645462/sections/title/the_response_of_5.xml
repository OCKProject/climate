 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simulated carbon fluxes exhibited a positive correlation with precipitation across the three RCP scenarios with the partial correlation coefficients (R) in the range of 0.07 ~ 0.48 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g003" href="#pone.0215261.g003">Fig 3</a>). The positive response of the carbon fluxes to annual precipitation variation became stronger with increasing temperature. Higher correlations between carbon fluxes (NPP and Rh) and precipitation were found in RCP8.5 with R values of 0.33 (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g003" href="#pone.0215261.g003">Fig 3A and 3D</a>), respectively. Spatially, the carbon fluxes showed a strong positive relationship with precipitation in the midwestern and northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau grassland (R &gt; 0.3,

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g003" href="#pone.0215261.g003">Fig 3</a>). However, an obvious negative correlation between NEP and precipitation was found in the southern and middle part of the Plateau (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g003" href="#pone.0215261.g003">Fig 3G–3I</a>). This was probably due to the fact that precipitation gradually decreased from the southeast to the northwest [
  <a rid="pone.0215261.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0215261.ref020">20</a>]. Increased precipitation in the southeastern mountainous area could lead to more cloud cover, and thus have negative effects on photosynthesis. The Rh tended to be most sensitive to the precipitation variation (R:0.34 ~ 0.48,

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g004" href="#pone.0215261.g004">Fig 4</a>, the simulated carbon fluxes exhibited a positive correlation with temperature (T
