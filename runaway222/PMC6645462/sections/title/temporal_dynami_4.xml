  <sub>2</sub> over the 21st century were simulated. The CENTURY model predicted that the grass NPP would range from 308 ± 13 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> to 495 ± 21 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, with a multiyear mean NPP of 357 ± 18 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> for RCP2.6, 375 ± 20 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> for RCP4.5, and 408 ± 26 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> for RCP8.5 on the Tibetan Plateau, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g002" href="#pone.0215261.g002">Fig 2A</a>). The interannual variation in the grass NPP was projected to increase to different degrees under the three RCP scenarios over the period 2006 ~ 2100, with linear slopes of 0.35 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.01), 0.85 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.01), and 1.52 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.01) for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively. The temporal dynamics of Rh were consistent with the NPP trends in all scenarios, with mean absolute values of 346 ± 9 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, 360 ± 12 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, and 390 ± 19 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, whereas the magnitude of the variation rates of Rh were all greater than that of NPP, with slopes of 0.49 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.01), 0.91 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.01), and 1.62 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.01) for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g002" href="#pone.0215261.g002">Fig 2B</a>). These higher rates of Rh increase in all the three scenarios may suggest that Rh was more sensitive to climate change than NPP. On average, the alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau behaved as a carbon sink, with a simulated NEP on a range of 11 ± 16 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, 15 ± 16 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, and 18 ± 16 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively, for the period from 2006~2100 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g002" href="#pone.0215261.g002">Fig 2C</a>). However, the temporal dynamics of the NEP indicated relatively less variability than NPP and Rh under the three RCP scenarios, and decreased continually with the slopes of -0.14 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.01), -0.07 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.13), and -0.10 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.05) for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively. This indicated that the potential capacity for carbon sequestration on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands would gradually decrease under future climate change, because the magnitude of the variation rate of Rh was greater than that of NPP.
