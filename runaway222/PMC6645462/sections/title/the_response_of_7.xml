 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify the effect of increased CO
  <sub>2</sub> on the carbon fluxes on alpine grasslands, we conducted two model simulations: with and without CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization. Then, the difference between the two simulated results was analyzed to evaluate the impacts of CO
  <sub>2</sub> on the carbon budget under the three RCP scenarios (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" href="#pone.0215261.g006">Fig 6</a>). Across all scenarios, the increasing CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration accounted for 1.9%, 3.6%, and 7.3% of the increase in NPP (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" href="#pone.0215261.g006">Fig 6A</a>), and 1.7%, 3.0%, and 6.1% of the increase in Rh (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" href="#pone.0215261.g006">Fig 6B</a>) under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively. Furthermore, the linear slopes indicated that 1 ppm increase in CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration caused a slightly larger increase of NPP by 0.06 ~ 0.45 g C m

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" href="#pone.0215261.g006">Fig 6A</a>) than those of Rh by 0.06 ~ 0.43 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" href="#pone.0215261.g006">Fig 6B</a>). Notably, the CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect would be substantially amplified when accompanied by an increase in temperature (slope
  <sub>Tmax</sub> = 0.6°C decade
  <span class="sup">-1</span> and slope
  <sub>Tmin</sub> = 0.7°C decade
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">Fig 5D and 5G</a>) and precipitation (slope = 10.0 mm decade
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" href="#pone.0215261.g005">Fig 5A</a>) under RCP8.5. By the end of the 21st century (2090s), the ΔNPP and ΔRh both largely increased from RCP2.6 to RCP8.5, ranging from 2.4% to 11.0%. However, the magnitude of the difference in NEP was relatively small, with multi-model mean values of 0.9, 2.3, and 4.9 g C m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" href="#pone.0215261.g006">Fig 6C</a>). The elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> contributed more to plant growth than decomposition, indicating that the Tibetan Plateau grassland was able to sequester carbon from the atmosphere due to CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization.
