  </span>) was evaluated from the relative scaling of calcification as a function of productivity, with decreases in this quotient generally representing a degradation of the reef, leading to increased primary producers, and decreased calcifiers. The relationship between NCP and NCC was calculated as the slope of the latter on the former (expressed as change in mmol CaCO
  <sub>3</sub> per mmol O
  <sub>2</sub>) over the 21-d incubation, in which hourly NCP was regressed on hourly NCC using Model II regression

  </span>. The slope, elevation, and corresponding error (95% CI) for each of the flumes was calculated using a Major Axis (MA) approach, in which error on both x- and y-axes are accounted for

  </span>. Difference in elevation (y-intercepts) between treatment groups was evaluated using a Wald statistic that tested for no difference among the y-axis intercepts, and similar to slope significance, this statistic was evaluated using a p-value assuming a chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom

  </span>. This analysis was performed on an aggregation of all sampling points within the 21-d incubation (4 time points, 3 days per time point, 4 samples per day = 48 paired NCP/NCC measurements per flume), and analyzed using a model II linear regression with the package smatr in R.
