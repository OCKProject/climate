 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Functional shifts in coral reef communities that alter the ratio of primary production to calcification are reflected in the slope of the NCP-NCC relationship, with a reduction in this relationship representing degradation in reef function, generally resulting from a shift in the dominant benthic community structure from calcifying organisms to algal-dominated communities

  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (2016) comparing the response of mixed vs homogenous benthic community composition representing reefs found in Kaneohe Bay (Oahu, Hawai’i) to acidified conditions showed similar results to those reported here in which the NCP-NCC slope did not change significantly as a result of increased CO

While previous studies of reef community metabolism have not reported alteration of the intercept of the NCP-NCC relationship as a metric of change in metabolic function, the alterations of elevation between treatment groups while maintaining similar slopes seen in our study indicate that a shift in overall community function occurred in the community exposed to high CO

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. For the reef communities in the present experiment, these changes likely are caused by a combination of decreases in the calcification rates of individual organisms and an increase in overall dissolution under high pCO

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global climate change is causing large declines in coral cover on reefs worldwide, particularly through the effects of mass bleaching
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Together with experimental analyses of the effects of global climate change and OA on corals, the rapid declines in coral cover have fueled concerns that coral reefs may not persist as calcified entities beyond the end of the current century
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. The benthic community structure and ecological functions of coral reefs are tied intrinsically to the success of their ecosystem engineers, scleractinian corals and calcified algae, and these taxa already have been impacted by a wide variety of local disturbances that act in concert with global anthropogenic effects which cause a change in ecosystem functioning
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. To date, predictions of how coral reefs will respond to OA have been based largely on species-level experiments testing the sensitivity of coral calcification to high pCO

  </span>. Our study highlights that the “organism approach” cannot capture the functional complexity arising from multiple organisms operating in concert in a natural environment subject to routine variation in select environmental conditions (e.g., light and temperature). An important implication of this outcome is that the whole coral reef community is more than the sum of its parts with regard to its response to OA. The present study highlights the importance of these emergent properties through 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> analysis of an undisturbed coral reef community. Our results suggest that these communities have the potential for adjustments to partially alleviate the negative consequences of OA on NCC. While this outcome might attenuate the risks of OA-related dissolution of the carbonate framework supporting most corals reefs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>, the absence of a comparable effect on daytime NCC underscores that a further understanding of mechanisms that drive changes in NCC are needed.
