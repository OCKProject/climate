 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following initiation of the experiment, 24-h NCC was depressed by 47% within the first day of the high pCO
  <sub>2</sub> treatment, and remained consistently depressed relative to 24-h NCC under ambient pCO
  <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2A</a>). This effect corresponded to a 25% decrease in NCC per unit Ω
  <sub>aragonite</sub> decline, which is similar to the effect size reported in a previous meta-analysis of the sensitivity of reef corals to OA
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. Overall, there was a 49% reduction in daytime NCC under high versus ambient pCO
  <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2B</a>), which corresponds to a 26% reduction in NCC per unit Ω
  <sub>aragonite</sub> decrease. At One Tree Island, Australia, NCC of a lagoon reef was reduced 43% per unit Ω
  <sub>aragonite</sub> reduction during the day, with this effect revealed through an experimental decrease in pH of ~0.14 from ambient (0.7 Ω
  <sub>aragonite</sub> reduction)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. In contrast, our study employed a greater decrease of pH (i.e., ~0.38), and a reduction in Ω
  <sub>aragonite</sub> of 1.89 between treatments, suggesting the decrease of NCC is not a linear function of Ω. On One Tree Reef, there was a higher cover of crustose coralline algae (CCA) (26%), and lower coral cover (12%) compared to the communities in our study (12.2% and 21.9%; CCA and coral, respectively; Fig.

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>) versus the back reef of Mo’orea could indicate that the coral reef community studied at One Tree Island was more sensitive to declining seawater pH than the present coral reef community studied in Mo’orea

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the first day that the treatments were established in the present study, nighttime NCC of the coral reef community maintained under high pCO
  <sub>2</sub> was depressed by 74% relative to ambient conditions. However, the magnitude of the pCO
  <sub>2</sub>-mediated depression of nighttime NCC attenuated over time, and after ~14 days the effect of pCO
  <sub>2</sub> reversed, such that nighttime NCC in the elevated pCO
  <sub>2</sub> treatment was ~1% higher than that under ambient conditions. After 21 days, nighttime NCC at elevated pCO
  <sub>2</sub> was 27% greater than nighttime NCC at ambient pCO
  <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2C</a>). Coral reefs, and in particular, the carbonate sediments packed within their framework, are predicted to transition to net dissolution under RCP 8.5, which was used in the present analysis to scale the pCO
  <sub>2</sub> treatment applied
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. This effect potentially is attributed to the role of OA in accelerating the dissolution of CaCO
  <sub>3</sub> produced by calcareous organisms (e.g., high Mg-calcite producing CCAs vs aragonite producing corals
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>). The overall effect would result in a positive slope of NCC differences between ambient and high pCO
  <sub>2</sub>, shown as less reef dissolution over the 21-d experiment. While recent work has shown little acclimatization potential of reef calcifiers to OA
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>, the attenuation of the initially negative effect of high pCO
  <sub>2</sub> on nighttime NCC of a shallow coral reef suggests these communities acquire some resistance to the negative effects of OA on nighttime NCC. The proximal mechanism(s) underlying this response are unknown, but potentially could include a rapid physiological acclimatization of calcification in organisms to high pCO
  <sub>2</sub> as seen in polychaetes transplanted to CO
  <sub>2</sub> vents
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. While we did not observe a change in coral cover during the experiment, biological feedback loops caused by changes in relative composition of the microbial benthic community should be considered as a potential mechanism mediating the change in nighttime NCC
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. Investigation into this mechanism might benefit from a further understanding of the relationship between biogenic processes that affect NCC and geochemical changes (e.g., mineral composition) within the pore water of the reef framework, as this interaction has been shown to be susceptible to OA
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Further work is required to explore these possibilities, and to determine whether the effects observed for nighttime NCC might also affect daytime NCC and/or 24-h NCC (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>).

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study provides the first experimental results of an 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> effect of OA on NCP (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>,
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">A</a>), in which NCP was depressed by 24% at high pCO
  <sub>2</sub> compared to ambient pCO
  <sub>2</sub> when averaged across the entire experiment (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>,
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">A</a>, S. Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). NCP during the second incubation (Days 7–9) was significantly higher than during the initial incubation period (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>,
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">A</a>, S. Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>), an effect likely due to increased light levels experienced during this time (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>,
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">D</a>)

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Respiration (nighttime oxygen flux) was 41% higher in the community exposed to ambient pCO
  <sub>2</sub> versus high pCO
  <sub>2</sub> during the first 3-d incubation (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>,
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">B</a>; S. Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2E</a>), and community respiration increased by an average of 66% in both communities over the experiment (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>,
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">B</a>; S. Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2E</a>). Decreased NCP of a coral reef community exposed to OA differs from the null result recorded for the same response variable when a back reef community from Mo’orea was exposed to high pCO
  <sub>2</sub> (1146 µatm) for four months
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. While CCA cover increased in both treatment groups in the present study, a greater proportional increase in algal turf cover and cyanobacteria occurred in the reef community maintained at high versus ambient CO
  <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). This outcome suggests fast settling turf/cyanobacteria may drive the changes observed for NCP and R.
