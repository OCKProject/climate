 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study presents the first community metabolism results of the deployment of a FOCE experiment on a shallow, back reef community, and it describes the response of this community to high pCO
  <sub>2</sub> under ecologically relevant environmental conditions
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. Our experiment was conducted on two plots of coral reef (5.00 × 0.55 m) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1A</a>) that were similar to one another in benthic community composition at the start of the experiment (the cover of corals and crustose coralline algae [CCA] differed &lt;4% between the plots; Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>), and were ~1 km from the shore. Acrylic flumes (1.5-cm wall thickness with UV-transparent tops) without floors were sealed over each plot to allow for measurements of metabolism (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1B</a>), and the manipulation of seawater pCO
  <sub>2</sub> over 21 days (2–23 May 2018). Unidirectional flow speeds within the flumes were maintained at ~14 cm s
  <span class="sup">−1</span> using motor-driven propellers, and were similar to average, long-term flow speeds recorded on the back reef (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). Using an autonomous CO
  <sub>2</sub> dosing system deployed on a floating platform adjacent to the flumes, ambient or elevated pCO
  <sub>2</sub> conditions were created for each community (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), which were assigned randomly to one of the two flumes. Elevated pCO
  <sub>2</sub> was maintained by CO
  <sub>2</sub> gas-enrichment to 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> seawater, with pCO
  <sub>2</sub> regulated through negative feedback provided by a pH electrode fitted to the flume (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1C</a>; see methods).

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our experiment contrasted the effects of ambient pCO
  <sub>2</sub> (393 ± 4 µatm, n = 950) and elevated pCO
  <sub>2</sub> targeted at ~1000 µatm (949 ± 7 µatm, n = 950; corresponding to a seawater pH
  <sub>T</sub> of ~7.72; Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). These conditions reflect global atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations that equilibrate with seawater to create Ω
  <sub>arag</sub> of 3.98 and 2.09, respectively (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>,
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">B</a>). The elevated pCO
  <sub>2</sub> is predicted to occur by the end of this century under a pessimistic projection (RCP 8.5) of human actions to control CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions

  </span>. NCC and NCP measurements were made over three consecutive days arranged into four sampling blocks equally spread over the 21-d experiment (i.e.,12 incubation days; see methods). Each day of measurements consisted of determinations in the morning, mid-day, afternoon, and once at night.
