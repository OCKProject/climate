  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To calculate time-integrated values for NCC and NCP (calculated over 06:30–09:30 h, 10:00–14:00 h, 14:30–17:30 h, and 18:00–06:00 h), hourly values were integrated over each 3–12-h incubation period and summed within each day to obtain 24-h values. For 12-hr daytime values, integrated 3 h incubation periods were summed from 06:00–18:00 h, and for 12-hr nighttime values, data were integrated from 18:00–06:00 h</p>

  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Twenty four hour NCC was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA in which pCO
   <sub>2</sub> (ambient and high), and sampling period (incubations 1–4 throughout the whole experiment) were fixed factors, and 24-h NCC was the response variable. Each sampling period consisted of 3 consecutive days that were treated as statistical replicates. The effect of time (incubation day) on the difference of 24-h NCC between ambient and high pCO
   <sub>2</sub> was tested using a Model I least squares linear regression, in which a significant slope indicated that the treatment effect (i.e., the difference in 24-h NCC between ambient and high pCO
   <sub>2</sub>) changed over time. Separate regressions were completed for daytime and nighttime NCC in order to distinguish between the effects of OA on NCC during the day and night. All analyses were performed in R.

   <sub>2</sub> (ambient and high), and time (incubations 1–4 throughout each day) were fixed factors, and 12-h NCP or R was the response variable. Similar to NCC, each sampling period consisted of 3 consecutive days that were treated as statistical replicates.

   </span>) was evaluated from the relative scaling of calcification as a function of productivity, with decreases in this quotient generally representing a degradation of the reef, leading to increased primary producers, and decreased calcifiers. The relationship between NCP and NCC was calculated as the slope of the latter on the former (expressed as change in mmol CaCO
   <sub>3</sub> per mmol O
   <sub>2</sub>) over the 21-d incubation, in which hourly NCP was regressed on hourly NCC using Model II regression

   </span>. This analysis was performed on an aggregation of all sampling points within the 21-d incubation (4 time points, 3 days per time point, 4 samples per day = 48 paired NCP/NCC measurements per flume), and analyzed using a model II linear regression with the package smatr in R.
