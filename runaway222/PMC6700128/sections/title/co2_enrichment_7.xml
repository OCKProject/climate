 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The flumes were powered and controlled through an umbilical cable connecting them to a nearby floating platform fitted with solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). CO
  <sub>2</sub> dosing to the flume was controlled through an Apex Aquacontroller (Neptune Systems), connected to an Atlas Scientific pH probe (ENV-40-pH), which controlled a solenoid (McMaster-Carr Model 5077T141) that injected CO
  <sub>2</sub> gas into the flume from a 60-L gas cylinder on the floating platform. pH probes that controlled the autonomous dosing system were calibrated against pH values every 3 days using the m-cresol dye method (SOB 6 b Dickson

  <sub>2</sub> conditions within the flume (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). The seawater in the ambient flow was not manipulated with respect to CO
  <sub>2</sub>. The pH of the elevated pCO
  <sub>2</sub> flume was set to a daytime target (06:00–18:00 h) of 1000 µatm pCO
  <sub>2</sub> (~7.70 pH
  <sub>Total</sub> units), and the system was programed to decrease by 0.1 pH units (i.e., ~1300 µatm pCO
  <sub>2</sub>), at night (18:00–06:00 h) to mimic
