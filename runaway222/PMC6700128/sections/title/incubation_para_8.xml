 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the experiment, each flume was flushed with ~200 L h
  <span class="sup">−1</span> ambient seawater that was pumped from the reef within 50 m of the study plots. Sampling for NCC and NCP was performed on days 1–3, 7–9, 13–15, and 19–21 of the 21–d experiment (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). Each day of sampling consisted of three incubations during the day (06:30 to 09:30 h, 10:00 to 14:00 h, and 14:30 to 17:30 h) and one incubation that extended over the night (18:00 to 06:00 h). During the measurements of metabolism, flushing of the flumes with seawater was halted, but CO
  <sub>2</sub> treatments and flow conditions were maintained. To prevent hyperoxia and hypoxia in the flume during closed-circuit operation, seawater from the surrounding reef was pumped into the flume for 30 min in between each incubation to replace ~25% of the volume. For the flume maintained at high pCO
  <sub>2</sub>, flushing with ambient seawater between incubations decreased pCO
  <sub>2</sub> to ambient levels. However, following cessation of flushing and prior to the next incubation, treatment conditions were restored to target pCO
  <sub>2</sub> values (~1000 µatm) within 15–30 min.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each incubation, samples of seawater were collected at the beginning and end of each incubation to quantify seawater carbonate chemistry. Samples were drawn from the flume using a 60-mL syringe that was attached to a vinyl tube fitted with a shut off valve. Samples were transported immediately to the shore lab, where salinity was measured using a Thermo Scientific Orion Star A212 conductivity meter, then potentiometrically titrated following standard operating procedures (SOP 3b of Dickson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [2007]) using an automatic titrator (Mettler-Toledo T50) fitted with a Rondolino-sample carousel (Mettler-Toledo). The titrator was fitted with a Mettler pH probe (DGi-115) that was operated with certified HCl (Batch A13 Dickson Laboratory). Certified reference material (Dickson CRM Batch #138) was used to evaluate the accuracy of the total alkalinity (A
  <sub>T</sub>) measurements (SOP 3b
