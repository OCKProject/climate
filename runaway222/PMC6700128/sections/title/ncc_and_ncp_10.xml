 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To calculate time-integrated values for NCC and NCP (calculated over 06:30–09:30 h, 10:00–14:00 h, 14:30–17:30 h, and 18:00–06:00 h), hourly values were integrated over each 3–12-h incubation period and summed within each day to obtain 24-h values. For 12-hr daytime values, integrated 3 h incubation periods were summed from 06:00–18:00 h, and for 12-hr nighttime values, data were integrated from 18:00–06:00 h</p>
