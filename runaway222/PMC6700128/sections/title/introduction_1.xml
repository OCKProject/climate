  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. However, these goods and services are threatened by rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO
  <sub>2</sub>) from anthropogenic sources
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. A result of rising atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations is global climate change (GCC), which for tropical coral reefs is causing profound modifications in benthic community structure and function through thermally-driven mass bleaching events
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Ocean acidification (OA) is a process through which dissolution of CO
  <sub>2</sub> into seawater lowers the calcium carbonate saturation state of seawater (Ω)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. In the marine environment, OA is expected to negatively affect organisms which produce calcareous shells and skeletons more than non-calcifying taxa
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. These effects will be experienced acutely by coral reefs, where the physical structure of the calcareous substratum is built by scleractinian corals and calcified algae
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. OA is predicted to severely impact the underlying biogenic substrata of coral reefs through increased dissolution in response to acidifying seawater conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Field-based observations in natural CO
  <sub>2</sub> seeps have shown decreased coral cover, diversity, and function in response to acidified conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. However, changes in carbonate chemistry across large spatial scales can interact with local effects to modulate processes that contribute to reef carbonate production (e.g. calcification and bioerosion)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. A common theme across papers addressing this topic is that OA is threatening the underlying biogenic physical structure of reefs and, therefore, understanding these effects has become a central objective of coral reef research in the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> Century

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depression of Net Ecosystem Calcification (NEC), the balance of gross calcification and gross dissolution, has been predicted for coral reefs in response to OA and warming
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. However, the complexities of understanding scaling effects
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span> as well as feedback loops between the inorganic substrata and living biota
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span> have resulted in difficulties attributing natural variation in NCC rates, and limited the ability to detect and attribute OA impacts on coral reefs. Laboratory-based studies with constructed communities have shown OA will increase dissolution of coral reefs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>

  </span>.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the impacts of OA on corals, other reef organisms, and reef communities are relatively well known
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>, 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> studies testing community-level responses are needed to predict how marine biota will respond to a changing climate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Experiments conducted 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span>, including those employing a Free Ocean CO
  <sub>2</sub> Enrichment (FOCE) approach, are the benchmark for ecological relevance for determining OA effects on ecosystem function
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> yet there are substantial challenges to implementing FOCE approaches on coral reefs. There are great benefits to addressing these challenges, however, as FOCE experiments embrace the natural complexity of ecosystems in terms of evaluating their response to OA, notably through emergent properties of multiple taxa interacting in a chemically and physically complex environment. To date, there have been two projects in which the effects of elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> have been empirically tested 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> on coral reefs. The first, by Albright 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018, measured NEC of the back reef community at One Tree Islands, Australia, in response to short-term pulses of acidified seawater over multiple days
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. A second project was conducted on Heron Island, Australia, in which deployment of technology described as a “coral proto-FOCE” (cp-FOCE) showed decreases in coral calcification
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>, and alteration in the boron isotopic composition of coral skeletons
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. Here, we significantly expand on these previous experiments by conducting a FOCE experiment to test the effects of predicted end-of-century OA conditions on NCC and Net Community Production (NCP) of a natural back reef community in Mo’orea, French Polynesia. Our results show how the ecosystem function of coral reefs (NCC and NCP) will be altered by OA during the day and night, resulting in improved accuracy of predictions of the effects of OA on coral reef metabolism.
