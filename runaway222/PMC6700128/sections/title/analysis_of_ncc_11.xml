 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Twenty four hour NCC was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA in which pCO
  <sub>2</sub> (ambient and high), and sampling period (incubations 1â€“4 throughout the whole experiment) were fixed factors, and 24-h NCC was the response variable. Each sampling period consisted of 3 consecutive days that were treated as statistical replicates. The effect of time (incubation day) on the difference of 24-h NCC between ambient and high pCO
  <sub>2</sub> was tested using a Model I least squares linear regression, in which a significant slope indicated that the treatment effect (i.e., the difference in 24-h NCC between ambient and high pCO
  <sub>2</sub>) changed over time. Separate regressions were completed for daytime and nighttime NCC in order to distinguish between the effects of OA on NCC during the day and night. All analyses were performed in R.
