   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>), and were ~1 km from the shore. Acrylic flumes (1.5-cm wall thickness with UV-transparent tops) without floors were sealed over each plot to allow for measurements of metabolism (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1B</a>), and the manipulation of seawater pCO
   <sub>2</sub> over 21 days (2–23 May 2018). Unidirectional flow speeds within the flumes were maintained at ~14 cm s
   <span class="sup">−1</span> using motor-driven propellers, and were similar to average, long-term flow speeds recorded on the back reef (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). Using an autonomous CO
   <sub>2</sub> dosing system deployed on a floating platform adjacent to the flumes, ambient or elevated pCO
   <sub>2</sub> conditions were created for each community (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), which were assigned randomly to one of the two flumes. Elevated pCO
   <sub>2</sub> was maintained by CO

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the first day that the treatments were established in the present study, nighttime NCC of the coral reef community maintained under high pCO
   <sub>2</sub> was depressed by 74% relative to ambient conditions. However, the magnitude of the pCO
   <sub>2</sub>-mediated depression of nighttime NCC attenuated over time, and after ~14 days the effect of pCO
   <sub>2</sub> reversed, such that nighttime NCC in the elevated pCO
   <sub>2</sub> treatment was ~1% higher than that under ambient conditions. After 21 days, nighttime NCC at elevated pCO
   <sub>2</sub> was 27% greater than nighttime NCC at ambient pCO
   <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2C</a>). Coral reefs, and in particular, the carbonate sediments packed within their framework, are predicted to transition to net dissolution under RCP 8.5, which was used in the present analysis to scale the pCO
   <sub>2</sub> treatment applied
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
   </span>. This effect potentially is attributed to the role of OA in accelerating the dissolution of CaCO
   <sub>3</sub> produced by calcareous organisms (e.g., high Mg-calcite producing CCAs vs aragonite producing corals
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span>). The overall effect would result in a positive slope of NCC differences between ambient and high pCO
   <sub>2</sub>, shown as less reef dissolution over the 21-d experiment. While recent work has shown little acclimatization potential of reef calcifiers to OA
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
   </span>, the attenuation of the initially negative effect of high pCO
   <sub>2</sub> on nighttime NCC of a shallow coral reef suggests these communities acquire some resistance to the negative effects of OA on nighttime NCC. The proximal mechanism(s) underlying this response are unknown, but potentially could include a rapid physiological acclimatization of calcification in organisms to high pCO
   <sub>2</sub> as seen in polychaetes transplanted to CO
   <sub>2</sub> vents
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
   </span>. While we did not observe a change in coral cover during the experiment, biological feedback loops caused by changes in relative composition of the microbial benthic community should be considered as a potential mechanism mediating the change in nighttime NCC
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
   </span>. Investigation into this mechanism might benefit from a further understanding of the relationship between biogenic processes that affect NCC and geochemical changes (e.g., mineral composition) within the pore water of the reef framework, as this interaction has been shown to be susceptible to OA
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span>. Further work is required to explore these possibilities, and to determine whether the effects observed for nighttime NCC might also affect daytime NCC and/or 24-h NCC (Fig.

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">A</a>, S. Table
