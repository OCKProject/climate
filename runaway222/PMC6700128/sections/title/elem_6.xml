 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study was conducted on the back reef of the north shore of Mo’orea, French Polynesia, which is a high volcanic island in the South Pacific. A custom-designed Shallow Coral Reef Free Ocean CO
  <sub>2</sub> Enrichment (SCoRe-FOCE) system
  <span class="sup">

  <sub>2</sub>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. In February 2016, two plots were identified in the back reef, each 5.00 m long by 0.55 m wide, and they were selected to have a benthic community similar to this back reef in 2007
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>, which consisted of 22% coral, 12% CCA, 23% turf algae, and 43% sand and rubble. Although this community structure differed from that occurring in 2018 when the experiment was conducted, our goal was to explore the response of an average back reef community, which is well represented by the state of the back reef in Mo’orea in 2007. When the study plots first were chosen, coral cover had declined compared to 2007 and, therefore, the community structure was augmented through transplantation of a few coral colonies from the adjacent reef to the study plots. Transplantations were completed &gt;6 months prior to initiation of the incubations.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two-weeks before the start of the experiment (15 April 2018), two, 1.5-cm thick clear acrylic flumes (5.0 × 0.55 × 0.55 m (length × width × height) with UV-transparent tops were secured to fiberglass rails previously attached to the reef at the perimeter of each study plot. The internal volumes of each flume and the return-section was ~2,300 L. The flume was secured to the reef with stainless steel threaded rods drilled and epoxied into the carbonate substratum, and was sealed to the reef using rubber tubing inflated with water and placed between the supporting rails and the reef surface. Rubber matting extending 30 cm from the rails and weighted using 10-kg sand bags augmented the seal. An indicator dye (Rhodamine B, Matheson Coleman &amp; Bell) was injected (~1 mg L
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) into the closed flumes at the start and end of the experiment to evaluate the efficacy of the seal to the reef, and visual inspection was used to detect leaks; none were visible during ~2 h trials.

   <sub>2</sub> dosing to the flume was controlled through an Apex Aquacontroller (Neptune Systems), connected to an Atlas Scientific pH probe (ENV-40-pH), which controlled a solenoid (McMaster-Carr Model 5077T141) that injected CO

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the experiment, each flume was flushed with ~200 L h
   <span class="sup">−1</span> ambient seawater that was pumped from the reef within 50 m of the study plots. Sampling for NCC and NCP was performed on days 1–3, 7–9, 13–15, and 19–21 of the 21–d experiment (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). Each day of sampling consisted of three incubations during the day (06:30 to 09:30 h, 10:00 to 14:00 h, and 14:30 to 17:30 h) and one incubation that extended over the night (18:00 to 06:00 h). During the measurements of metabolism, flushing of the flumes with seawater was halted, but CO
   <sub>2</sub> treatments and flow conditions were maintained. To prevent hyperoxia and hypoxia in the flume during closed-circuit operation, seawater from the surrounding reef was pumped into the flume for 30 min in between each incubation to replace ~25% of the volume. For the flume maintained at high pCO
   <sub>2</sub>, flushing with ambient seawater between incubations decreased pCO
   <sub>2</sub> to ambient levels. However, following cessation of flushing and prior to the next incubation, treatment conditions were restored to target pCO
   <sub>2</sub> values (~1000 µatm) within 15–30 min.
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each incubation, samples of seawater were collected at the beginning and end of each incubation to quantify seawater carbonate chemistry. Samples were drawn from the flume using a 60-mL syringe that was attached to a vinyl tube fitted with a shut off valve. Samples were transported immediately to the shore lab, where salinity was measured using a Thermo Scientific Orion Star A212 conductivity meter, then potentiometrically titrated following standard operating procedures (SOP 3b of Dickson 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. [2007]) using an automatic titrator (Mettler-Toledo T50) fitted with a Rondolino-sample carousel (Mettler-Toledo). The titrator was fitted with a Mettler pH probe (DGi-115) that was operated with certified HCl (Batch A13 Dickson Laboratory).
