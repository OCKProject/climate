 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">NCP and night community respiration (R) was analyzed in a similar way to NCC using a two-way ANOVA in which pCO
  <sub>2</sub> (ambient and high), and time (incubations 1â€“4 throughout each day) were fixed factors, and 12-h NCP or R was the response variable. Similar to NCC, each sampling period consisted of 3 consecutive days that were treated as statistical replicates.
