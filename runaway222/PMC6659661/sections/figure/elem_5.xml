  <p>Relationship between summer leading SAT modes and spring soil moisture. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>,
   <span class="bold">c</span>) Probability that score of (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) PC2 and (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) PC3 is positive computed for each 1.0 kg m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> interval bin of soil moisture anomalies (bars). Blue and red crosses indicate the probability computed for samples whose deviations from the ensemble average are greater than one and two times the standard deviation, respectively. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>,
   <span class="bold">d</span>) Scatter plots between the soil moisture anomaly in May averaged over 50°–70°N, 50°–70°E (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), and scores of (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) second and (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) third PCs for 6,000 samples. The soil moisture anomaly was computed with respect to the ensemble averages. Blue and red lines in (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) and (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) represent average plus/minus one and two times the standard deviation, respectively.
