 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three leading modes for the June–July–August (JJA)-averaged SAT over mid-to-high latitudes of Eurasia were computed by empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis applied to d4PDF data (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>; Methods). Here, we use 6,000 snapshots of SAT derived from 100-member and 60-year-long data in the EOF analysis. The spatial pattern of the first principal component (PC1), which accounts for 14.67% of the total SAT variance, represents the continent-wide SAT increase with enhanced warming over western and northeastern Eurasia. The time series of the PC1 score shows accelerated warming after the early 1990s which is exhibited by all members. The interannual variation of the mean PC1 score is correlated strongly with northern hemispheric SAT (r = 0.91) and Arctic sea ice coverage (r = −0.80). Therefore, PC1 represents the response of Eurasian summer SAT to global climate change induced by external forcing and the resultant Arctic change, including SST increase and sea ice loss
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. The PC1 is related to accelerated northward retreat of snow cover
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span> and increased water shortages in summer (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The second and third principal components (PC2 and PC3), which together account for 20.6% of the total SAT variance, show longitudinal striped patterns over northern Eurasia, similar to the SAT trend in the reanalysis (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). The associated 500 hPa geopotential height fields indicate quasi-stationary wave propagation. The wave centres for PC2 and PC3 are shifted one-quarter phase. In contrast to PC1, interannual variations of the PC2 and PC3 scores appear to fluctuate irrespective of years, although weak increases in the PC2 score is recognised after the early 1990s. The random features of PC2 and PC3 indicate that the phase of wave propagation is determined independently of the prescribed SST variation; hence, the striped SAT pattern is likely attributable to internal dynamical processes of the coupled land–atmosphere system. The wave train patterns are also dominant when EOF analysis is applied to the detrended SAT by using JJA SAT deviation from the ensemble average (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Thus, mid-latitude wave propagation plays a central role in the internal variability of summer SAT. These results are in accordance with earlier analyses based on atmospheric GCM (AGCM) experiments that suggested that in middle latitudes the effects of the coupled land–atmosphere system on Eurasian SAT variability are as strong as the effects of SST
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. The leading patterns of the simulated SAT in d4PDF are similar to those in the reanalysis (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) with warming trends in PC1 and wave-train patterns in PC2 and PC3. The huge ensemble output is advantageous in separating the effects of external forcing and internal variability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. The comparison between Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> confirms that the recent warming in Eurasian summers is result of external forcing, while the internal forcing is responsible for the heterogeneous warming.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> illustrates the successful decomposition of the recent SAT change into two components: one representing the effects of external forcing that robustly increase SAT irrespective of ensemble members, and the other representing the effects of internal dynamics that appear to fluctuate randomly on an interannual timescale. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a> shows reconstructed SAT differences between the 2000s and 1980s computed from linear combinations of the first through third PC modes (Methods). The reconstructed SAT pattern resembles the reanalysis-based SAT change in that there are two areas of accelerated warming over the Eastern European Plain and Central Siberia and a region of negative SAT change over the Western Siberian Plain. This is a reasonable result because we used the optimised weighting coefficients for the linear combinations of the dominant PC modes. It is evident that the SAT increase around Mongolia has been underestimated, which is likely related to the absence of strong local feedback processes between soil moisture and the atmosphere

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> shows that wave train patterns, which fluctuate randomly, are essential for explaining the recent trend of summer SAT. Furthermore, the occurrence of recent extreme weather events in mid-latitude regions can be attributed to quasi-stationary wave propagation

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How are the SAT variations on interannual and decadal timescales related? Figure 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> displays the leading patterns of SAT differences on decadal timescales. Here, we conducted an EOF analysis for the SAT difference between 2000s and 1980s using 100 realisations derived from d4PDF. The wave train pattern appears to be the dominant mode of the summer SAT change on decadal timescales, which indicates decadal SAT and interannual SAT variations over northern Eurasia are closely related to each other. This generally agrees with earlier studies that pointed out the role of internal variability in multi-decadal trends
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> shows that the PC scores of decadal SAT change are remarkably different among the members. This suggests that although the wave train pattern of SAT is a dominant mode on the decadal timescale, its sign is very diverse among the ensemble members. Because ensemble members in d4PDF are all constrained by observed SST and sea ice, decadal variations of SST and sea ice are not the sufficient drivers for the decadal SAT change. Therefore, the inter-member diversity of SAT variations on decadal timescales are also likely attributable to atmosphere and land processes.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand the processes underlying the recent SAT change, key factors that determine a phase of the wave train pattern are investigated.

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>

  </span>. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> shows combined regression patterns of surface anomalies with respect to the PC2 and PC3 scores (Methods), which represent surface anomalies associated with internal forcing. During the preceding winter, high values of snow water equivalent extend around the Western Siberian Plain, which indicate large amounts of water are supplied to the soil layers during the spring snowmelt. Wetter soil starts to emerge in May when the snow melt is finished in the mid-latitude areas. A low 500 hPa geopotential height anomaly develops in May over the Western Siberian Plain where the underlying soil is wet (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Positive feedback between soil moisture and the atmosphere further intensifies the positive soil moisture anomaly in combination with the intensified mid-tropospheric low pressure anomaly. The wave train pattern, which resembles the decadal SAT change, develops in June. These results provide evidence supporting earlier studies that have claimed the Arctic winter climate influences mid-latitude summer climate

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil moisture in May over the Western Siberian Plain (50°–70°N, 50°–70°E) correlates weakly with the PC2 (r = 0.11) and PC3 (r = 0.17) scores (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). For both PC2 and PC3, the share of samples with positive scores increases with the soil moisture anomaly. The soil moisture anomaly modulates the diabatic heating of the atmosphere, which helps initiate the quasi-stationary wave
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Through the positive feedback of land–atmosphere interactions, the wet soil and low SAT anomalies evolve simultaneously under the low pressure anomaly. The strong dependency of the sign of the PCs on the soil moisture anomaly is obvious for samples with large magnitude scores (exceeding one and two times the standard deviation). This indicates that strong land-to-atmosphere feedback is essential for the maintenance of substantial wave propagation over northern Eurasia. Resonance of PC2 and PC3 with positive sign, which accounts for the recent summer SAT change, is more likely to occur with increasing soil moisture around the Western Siberian Plain in May (Supplementary Fig.

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To link the analysis of the huge ensemble experiments with observations, we discuss recent observed changes in snow water. Although the reliability of past changes in snow-related variables over the entire Eurasian continent is controversial, there is observational evidence of recent change in the cryosphere around the Western Siberian Plain. Ground-based measurements have shown that snow depth increased since the 1990s
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span> and that spring snow cover has extended
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span> to around the upper Ob River basin. The number of blocking events and resultant cold events has been increasing over Central Asia
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. These enhanced snow/cold events appear linked with the reduction of Arctic sea ice since around the late 1990s to 2000s, which modulates the internal dynamics of the atmosphere
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. It is probable that in recent years quasi-stationary waves have been anchored by positive snow and soil moisture anomalies over central northern Eurasia, which would explain why the summer SAT trend exhibits a tripole pattern. In Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, time series of PC2 scores exhibits a weak positive shift after the early 1990s, implying that the sea ice reduction modulated the likelihood of a tripole pattern by increasing snowfall events due to enhanced moisture supply from the Arctic Ocean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. A recent GCM study demonstrated that snow-fed wet land in spring lowers the summer SAT in the Ob and Volga river basins
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. Therefore, better prediction of summer SAT anomalies requires sophisticated land surface schemes capable of simulating the delayed discharge of snow water.
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The tripole pattern in summer SAT trend is characterised by internal processes involved in the coupled land–atmosphere system. Therefore, multi-GCM averaging or ensemble averaging of model projections might smooth the spatial variability of summer SAT. As shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>, the wave train-like SAT change in d4PDF disappears due to the ensemble average. It is likely that future change in regional extreme hot events will exceed future projections based on multi-model ensemble averages. Closer monitoring of land surface conditions will be necessary to produce accurate projections of future change in summer SAT. We found that land surface anomalies in spring modulate the likelihood of summer SAT patterns over northern Eurasia. Therefore, our findings can improve the seasonal predictability of abnormal weather in the Eurasian summer.
