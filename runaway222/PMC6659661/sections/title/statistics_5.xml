 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was conducted over 22°–90°N, 0°–180°E. For the computation of eigenvectors, a variance-covariance matrix was used. Before the EOF analysis, the d4PDF data was re-gridded from the original 60 km resolution to 240 km. For d4PDF, 6,000 snapshots (60 years, 100 ensemble members) of JJA-averaged SAT were analysed, and the normalised PC scores for the 6,000 snapshots were arranged on the time axis (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). The EOF analysis presented in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> was based on the detrended SAT in which the deviation of JJA-averaged SAT of each member with respect to the ensemble average was used. In Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, simulated SAT differences between the 1980s and the 2000s for each ensemble member (n = 100) were analysed. For the EOF analysis using the JRA-55 dataset (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), we used the period of 1958–2017.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reconstructed SAT patterns in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b,d</a> were created by the following procedures using d4PDF and JRA-55, respectively. First, regression patterns of JJA SAT against the time series of normalised scores were created for each PC mode (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a–c</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a–c</a>). We considered PC1 through PC3 because these modes account for one-third of the total variance in SAT. Second, weighting coefficients for the linear combination were computed for each PC mode. Assuming two matrices corresponding to the spatial distributions of decadal JJA SAT change (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a,c</a>) and the regressed SAT pattern (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a–c</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a–c</a>), the weighting coefficient was obtained by the inner product of the two matrices. Thus, the weighting coefficient is proportional to the projection of the JJA SAT change pattern onto the eigenvector. The computed weighting factors for the first, second, and third PCs are 2.22, 1.04, and 1.51 for d4PDF, respectively, and 1.80, 1.36, and 0.71 for JRA-55, respectively. These weighting coefficients were chosen to most accurately reproduce the SAT patterns in d4PDF and JRA-55. Finally, the regression patterns from the first to the third modes were overlaid using the weighting coefficients. The same procedures were adopted using the same coefficients as above but for the regression patterns of snow water equivalent and soil moisture (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), and of geopotential height, wind field, and SAT (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). In Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>, only PC2 and PC3 were overlaid by setting the coefficient of PC1 to zero, whereas in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, only PC1 was considered.
