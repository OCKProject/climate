So, even the opportunity to do the decisions part between the two … There was really no time to do it. … All it actually allows you to do is, when the next iteration comes, do a reflection around, what one do we really want to continue to participate in and which ones don’t?

Someone was going to take it to the [AFHTO] board to say that we felt that the return on investment for the frequency is diminishing rapidly. It’s a very good idea, too many iterations, not well thought out, too. (ID = 013)</td>
