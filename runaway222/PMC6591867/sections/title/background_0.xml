 <p id="Par1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of clinical performance feedback to support quality improvement (QI) activities is based on the sound rationale that measurement is necessary to improve quality of care. However, concerns persist about the reliability of this strategy, known as Audit and Feedback (A&amp;F) to support QI. If successfully implemented, A&amp;F should reflect an iterative, self-regulating QI process. Whether and how real-world A&amp;F initiatives result in this type of feedback loop are scarcely reported. This study aimed to identify barriers or facilitators to implementation in a team-based primary care context.</p>
