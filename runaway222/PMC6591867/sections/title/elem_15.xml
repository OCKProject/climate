  <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants cited the frequency of audit cycles as a barrier to implementation. It was specifically noted that the six-month gap between the release of D2D 2.0 and D2D 3.0 was insufficient to observe the effect of any change. Some participants further expressed feedback fatigue.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data validity</div>
  <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many FHTs questioned the validity of the data reported in D2D. Poor documentation was cited as a contributor to data validity concerns. Informants suggested that vague definitions in D2D support material did little to address their mistrust in the data. Many did not understand why the complete methodologies for each measure were not easily accessible. In the absence of such documentation, participants were concerned about methodological consistency between practices, limiting the utility of peer comparison. In addition, participants had a range of perspectives regarding the recency of the audit for each measure. A minority of participants recognized that the multi-sourced nature of D2D implied that the measures may not represent similar time periods (as reflected in Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Some became aware of this when asked about the relative timing of measures during the usability exercise. (Table

        <p>• But how they’re tracking it is not reflective of the spreadsheet that we’ve done and internally tracked our process. And I think some is made of billing codes. Well, only physicians are billing. The billing is different if you’re seeing your patients are coming from long-term care because the codes are different. So our numbers are really not reflective of internally what we’re measuring. (ID = 012)</p>
        <p>• They’re telling us they want to know what percentage of patients can get same day appointments or can get an appointment with their family physician. So, we scored low, but we have IHPs that work with these family physicians and so they don’t need to go see their doctor if they want to have their blood pressure checked. (ID = 008)</p>
        <p>• It’s often unclear, that’s part of what the trepidation is. I’ve had the conversation about this particular one, time spent and I’ve asked things like, I don’t know that, whatever your methodology looks like, I don’t know that you’re factoring in patient complexity, in terms of how much time providers need to spend with people, based on their complexities or their patient profile. And people will say, it’s in there, but they can’t show me how it’s in there. And so then, just saying that it’s in there doesn’t mean that I’m going to trust that it’s in there. (ID = 018)</p>

  <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants cited frustrations with the design of the feedback website, finding it difficult to interpret as data visualisations did not adhere to standard conventions. For example, while the Effectiveness measures in Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> are presented on a percentage scale – details about the scale are absent. Participants also sought the ability to export or share their report directly from the website to support quality improvement, a functionality that was not available at the time of this study. Furthermore, participants expressed a desire for a more accessible data dictionary as well as a more sophisticated website where they could interact with a specific indicator to access further information.

The graphs, you know, to get to the number you had to move your cursor over so that meant me sitting there writing out all the numbers on a piece of paper and then transferring it to Excel. The expanded data wasn’t on the web site at all, so that was a little bit disappointing, so that meant a lot of work afterwards. And then, I guess, when you went to go click on the targets it brought up a PDF. There was just some disconnect with the whole report on how it come out. So if there was any way to export it so that you could get a two or three page report that you could hand to someone, I think that would be a lot more helpful than a lot of links that didn’t really seem to connect well.

Most of the other reports are in some sort of chart format, where it’s actually just figures. There are no graphs and stuff like that. So, D2D attempted to visualize a lot of that data, and by doing so, makes it sometimes awkward to understand, which is kind of the reason that I make my own report from it. (ID = 016)</p>

It would be great if you could hover over this and it would say, this is this. It’s a lot of work to be able to figure that out. Like, I can’t remember whether it’s over 50, or over 65, or over this, that you know, the population and the exact, you know, numbers that you need to be able to put that in off the top of my head.
