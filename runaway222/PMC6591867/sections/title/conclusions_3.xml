 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The implementation of a real-world, voluntary A&amp;F initiative did not lead to desired QI activities despite substantial investments in performance measurement. In small primary care teams, it may take long periods of time to develop capacity for QI and future evaluations may reveal shifts in the implementation state of the initiative. Findings from the present study demonstrate that the potential mechanism of action of A&amp;F may be deceptively clear; in practice, moving from measurement to action can be complex.</p>
