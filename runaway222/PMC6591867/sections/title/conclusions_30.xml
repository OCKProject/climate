 <p id="Par67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite its popularity, A&amp;F remains an unreliable quality improvement strategy. While efforts to understand how and when it works best are ongoing, few studies evaluate the implementation of such interventions in the context of its mechanism of action. This study identified that the implementation of one particular A&amp;F initiative reflected an incomplete feedback loop. Barriers to implementation were attributable to specific design choices which interacted with resource constraints and a dependency on an implementation champion. Substantial efforts invested in quality assessment were unlinked to subsequent action to change processes of care. If the goal of A&amp;F is to promote QI (or to prioritize QI activities in areas of greatest need), it is necessary to consider minimum requirements for both the intervention 
  <span class="italic">and</span> the recipientsâ€™ capacity to respond. Such an achievement depends on alignment and coordinated efforts between health care practitioners and external organizations regarding the outcomes to be measured and the needs of practices to improve on those measures. The deployment of A&amp;F initiatives which effectively leverage the complete feedback loop will enable providers to achieve what they set out to: better care and improved health.
