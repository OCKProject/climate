  <p id="Par68" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the time of the analysis, DJW was an MSc student at the University of Toronto. While DJW collaborated with AFHTO to recruit participants, data collection and analysis were completed independently. This included restricting access to interview transcripts. Prior to the initiation of the recording of the interview, participants were informed by DJW of the rationale for this research, as well as the independence of the research from AFHTO. Further, to ensure that emergent themes were data-driven, DJW has maintained an audit trail. JD is a Scientist with the Provincial Support Program at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. JD is also an Assistant Professor with the Departments of Psychiatry and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at the University of Toronto. Neither JD nor DJW had any professional affiliations with any FHTs during the data collection and analysis stages of this research. NMI is a Family Physician and practices at an Academic FHT which is a member of AFHTO. NMI is also involved in a variety of audit and feedback initiatives, nearly all of which suffer from lower than anticipated engagement. JB is an Associate professor at the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at the University of Toronto and is a board member of a different academic FHT, where she has observed sub-optimal use of clinical performance data. Investigators were aware that these experiences could shape the analyses and discussed this regularly. NMI and JB did not code data and restricted engaging in discussions about findings once themes began to emerge.</p>
