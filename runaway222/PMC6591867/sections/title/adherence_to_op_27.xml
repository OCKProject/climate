 <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An assessment of the present study’s results in the context of Brehaut et al.’s 15 suggestions for effective practice feedback optimization offer insight into the mechanics of the feedback loop. D2D featured many strengths that enabled its uptake [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. First, D2D was supported by the credibility of a trusted source as the initiative was led by a team-based primary care advocacy organization [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. As reported previously, a strong motivator for participation in D2D was the underlying intent to create an A&amp;F report reflective of team-based primary care which would grow into a best-in-class initiative [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. For many FHTs, participation in the 
  <span class="italic">audit</span> and 
  <span class="italic">feedback</span> stages may have been in service of this goal and not quality improvement [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, unlike many A&amp;F interventions studied [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>], D2D included multiple instances of feedback which should have enabled the intervention’s mechanism of action [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. The intent of this feature is to leverage the construct of observability, one of several key concepts in diffusion of innovation theory [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. In delivering three iterations of feedback over a 16-month period, recipients should have had some sense of the intervention’s ability to impact QI. However, cycle frequency was described by participants as a barrier to implementation, with some informants complaining of audit fatigue. Given that repeated cycles of D2D did not yield a complete feedback loop one can conclude that the criterion for multiple instances of feedback should be considered necessary but insufficient for A&amp;F to support QI. Concerns regarding data validity and the design of the feedback report overwhelmed the potential advantages from observability by limiting participants’ engagement in the 
  <span class="italic">response</span> stage. This demonstrates the need for A&amp;F developers to carefully consider whether quality measures of interest can be accurately and rapidly measured and reported in a digestible format, at a frequency to enable observability.

 <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several additional characteristics across the 
  <span class="italic">audit</span>, 
  <span class="italic">feedback</span> and 
  <span class="italic">response</span> stages may have contributed to the incomplete feedback loop [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. For example, D2D included general data (rather than specific detail actionable by the recipient), using a single mode of feedback delivery (rather than multi-modal), without supports perceived as adequate to enable action. A summary of the relative timing of the inputs for three iterations of D2D is presented in Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>. While the feedback report had a visually appealing design, users had difficulty interpreting results and accessing support documentation.
