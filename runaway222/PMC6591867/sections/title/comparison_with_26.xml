 <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several independent findings are consistent with previous literature on A&amp;F and quality improvement in primary care. For example, there is consistent evidence suggesting that developers of A&amp;F interventions should anticipate that feedback recipients will question the validity of the data. In addition to delays between the time of measurement and reporting, common concerns include inadequate scope of measurement, indicators restricted to physician (rather than team) activity, and comparability between peer groups of practices [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. Tensions persist between primary care practices and other levels of the health care system in prioritizing measures of quality. Practices must balance resources committed to improve metrics in A&amp;F with other quality of care issues [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. Over multiple feedback iterations, recipients may re-evaluate their validity concerns.
 </p>
 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additional research has identified that feedback uptake can be enhanced through the provision of in-person facilitated feedback, through respectful relationships between providers and recipients [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Unfortunately, the present study’s findings reveal that the intervention characteristics of D2D failed to provide opportunity for such discussions. Therefore, the identification of best practices to engender faith in the data is an important area of future research.
 </p>
 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second issue is the resource trade-offs that practices must make between a specific A&amp;F effort, other QI efforts and general practice administration [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between practice size and experience in using A&amp;F to support QI. Findings have consistently shown that restrictions to labor or experience can limit the capabilities of a practice to implement relevant audits or leverage the feedback loop appropriately [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. As a result, practices consistently outsource this work as was the case with the present study’s finding that D2D implementation was dependent on an external resource (the QIDSS).
 </p>
 <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The outsourcing of QI processes is not a new phenomenon in the FHT setting. Previous research by Kotecha et al. explored how external practice-facilitators supported FHTs in their QI planning processes. While these external resources served to coach the FHTs, the practices expressed a clear preference for these agents to lead such activity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. The consistent labour scarcity and alternative priorities may lead some to conclude that dedicated funding to outsource QI efforts should be continued practice. However, such policy should be treated with caution. An area for further research is exploring whether and how team-based practices could be encouraged to develop QI leadership and skills internally rather than seek to outsource them.
 </p>
 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A third issue is that A&amp;F interventions are rarely evaluated in the context of their mechanism of action. An exception is the work by Pedersen et al. which, like the present study, evaluated an A&amp;F initiative which failed at the 
  <span class="italic">response</span> stage [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. The present study offers additional insight towards understanding the inconsistent performance of A&amp;F – the incomplete feedback loop. This implementation state was a function of an interaction between the selection of data for audit (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), the available resources of a participating practice, and the design of the feedback report (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Further complicating matters is the tenuous relationship between the physician group and the rest of the primary care team in the FHTs that participated in this study. These contextual factors mean that enhancements of the intervention characteristics may not enhance the intervention’s implementation (fidelity to a complete feedback loop) – or its ability to improve quality of care. Future research is necessary to better understand the extent of this problem in the context of various team-based primary care models and performance feedback initiatives.
