 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants cited the frequency of audit cycles as a barrier to implementation. It was specifically noted that the six-month gap between the release of D2D 2.0 and D2D 3.0 was insufficient to observe the effect of any change. Some participants further expressed feedback fatigue.

So, even the opportunity to do the decisions part between the two … There was really no time to do it. … All it actually allows you to do is, when the next iteration comes, do a reflection around, what one do we really want to continue to participate in and which ones don’t?

Someone was going to take it to the [AFHTO] board to say that we felt that the return on investment for the frequency is diminishing rapidly. It’s a very good idea, too many iterations, not well thought out, too. (ID = 013)</td>

      <td colspan="2">• I thought, for me, it was happening a bit too quickly. I think they could spread it out a little bit more. It felt like D2D 2.0 just happened and then we were getting ready to submit D2D 3.0. (ID = 012)</td>
