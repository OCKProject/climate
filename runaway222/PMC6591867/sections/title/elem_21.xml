  <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">FHTs had access to a wide array of A&amp;F initiatives and participation in these varied widely. All FHTs participated in mandatory quality improvement programs, which included the Quality Improvement Plan (QIP) and patient experience surveys, as outlined in provincial legislation [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. Participants had access to feedback reports covering a range of indicators from several existing provincial initiatives [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. The most common were Health Quality Ontario’s (HQO) Primary Care Group Practice Report; the Screening Activity Report (SAR) from Cancer Care Ontario (CCO); the Electronic Medical Record Administrative Data Linked Database (EMRALD); and the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) from the College of Family Physicians of Canada [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. FHTs also conducted their own internal A&amp;F programs with varying degrees of sophistication. Often, D2D was viewed to be of lower priority relative to these other A&amp;F initiatives. Relative priority was a function of regulatory requirements, available capacity and maturity to support QI, and the perceived attributes of each A&amp;F effort. Specifically, FHTs which lacked internal reporting mechanisms, or which did not participate in external programs assigned greater priority to D2D. (Table

  <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants noted that the D2D audit was labour intensive and that a certain level of human resources was necessary to facilitate the implementation of D2D. Furthermore, that the QIDSS were focused on D2D left participants concerned that there was little capacity for this resource to support other QI activities. This barrier to implementation was not observed among FHTs with dedicated, internal quality improvement support staff, who could support data management, analysis and facilitation of quality improvement.

       <td colspan="2">• I don’t think that, from a team perspective, the teams have the time and capacity to attend to this to the level that perhaps HQO thinks we should. So it’s one thing to say you have the staff resources in a QIDSS specialist to assist … But when you look at how people are spending their time in organizations, and you ask them to engage in D2D or other quality improvement initiatives, it takes time, people attend meetings … there’s a whole bunch of pieces. When they’re doing that, they’re not seeing patients. And so, the quality improvement initiative is, the Ministry going back to your thing around the policy climate, is really trying to drive increased accessibility. When I have 10 people in a meeting for two hours to talk about quality improvement, that means they’re not seeing patients, which reduces access of our patients to our team. So, in terms of resources, there needs to be greater organizational capacity to be able to plan, develop, and implement quality improvement initiatives beyond a part-time QIDSS specialist. Otherwise, we really are working in conflict in terms of trying to give patients greater access to our providers, while, at the same time, distracting our providers by trying to engage them in things like quality improvement initiatives or other things that seem to come down from the Ministry within that particular policy climate.

Informants cited difficulties in engaging physicians who were close to retirement and/or who practiced in other care settings (ie. emergency departments) (Table

And even so, it’s the same physician every time, so I think some of the doctors get a little, well, I don’t want to hear that from him anymore. We actually do have three physicians on our quality committee now which is great because I think they’ll be willing to try more things too spread them to the physicians they work with.

       <td colspan="2">• We have a number of physicians who are closer to retirement or slowing down or getting out of their practices. They just don’t really have the enthusiasm to implement changes or to try to do something in a different way, whether it’s changing the way that they report something in the EMR to like I’ve been doing it by paper for 30 years of my life. And tehn I finally converted to the EMR eight years ago and you’re not going to tell me how to do something different for two years before I retire. And then the other factor is just time. As I mentioned earlier, many of our physicians they work in the Emergency Department for a smaller community hospital. So they work in the ED, they’re working on the floors, they’re seeing patients, they’re working in long-term care and they just don’t have the time. They have their own admin time to work on or they have their own clinic time where they have to be here doing that, so that’s kind of one of the struggles. And some individuals see the family health team as being the family health team and the physician group being the physician group and we work together, but we don’t have to play together kind of thing.
