 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Qualitative analysis was facilitated by NVivo software [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. A framework approach was utilized to analyze the transcripts based on constructs within the CFIR. As with the interview guide, a modified version of the codebook, made available by the CFIR developers was used to analyze interview transcripts. Double coding and the development of the codebook followed the procedure previously reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Construct selection for the frameworks was based on identified relevance to the research questions and was done following data collection, but 
  <span class="italic">prior</span> to analysis. This approach can be described as a directed content analysis that leveraged a priori constructs from an established framework and is consistent with previous uses of CFIR [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>].

 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The framework for the first research question (whether D2D implementation reflected a complete feedback loop), included the CFIR constructs “Executing” and “Engaging”. Text was then analyzed inductively to classify findings into one of three stages of the feedback loop: 
  <span class="italic">audit</span>, 
  <span class="italic">feedback</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">response</span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With respect to the second question (barriers and facilitators to implementation reflective of a complete feedback loop), the framework was generated from thirteen constructs: “Relative Advantage”, “Adaptability”, “Relative Priority”, “Organizational Incentives and Rewards”, “Compatibility”, “Leadership Engagement”, “Available Resources”, “Access to Knowledge and Information”, “Opinion Leaders”, “External Change Agents”, “Reflecting and Evaluating”, “Parallel Initiatives”, and “Usability Testing”. To identify emergent themes from the data, the text was analyzed inductively, and the resulting themes were then categorized by one of three CFIR domains: 
  <span class="italic">intervention characteristics, outer setting,</span> and 
  <span class="italic">inner setting.</span>
