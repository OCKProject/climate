 <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study evaluated the implementation of a voluntary, external A&amp;F initiative, known as D2D, for primary care teams. At the time of evaluation, implementation of D2D reflected an incomplete feedback loop, as respondents indicated no action following the response stage of the A&amp;F cycle. In other words, during the first 16 months of implementation the D2D initiative did not yet reflect an iterative, self-regulating process that directly supported QI. Barriers to implementation emerged as a result of data validity concerns, labour scarcity, the dependence on an external implementation champion, and the practice structure.</p>
 <sec id="Sec14" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison with previous literature</div>
  <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several independent findings are consistent with previous literature on A&amp;F and quality improvement in primary care. For example, there is consistent evidence suggesting that developers of A&amp;F interventions should anticipate that feedback recipients will question the validity of the data. In addition to delays between the time of measurement and reporting, common concerns include inadequate scope of measurement, indicators restricted to physician (rather than team) activity, and comparability between peer groups of practices [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. Tensions persist between primary care practices and other levels of the health care system in prioritizing measures of quality. Practices must balance resources committed to improve metrics in A&amp;F with other quality of care issues [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. Over multiple feedback iterations, recipients may re-evaluate their validity concerns.
  </p>
  <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additional research has identified that feedback uptake can be enhanced through the provision of in-person facilitated feedback, through respectful relationships between providers and recipients [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Unfortunately, the present study’s findings reveal that the intervention characteristics of D2D failed to provide opportunity for such discussions. Therefore, the identification of best practices to engender faith in the data is an important area of future research.
  </p>
  <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second issue is the resource trade-offs that practices must make between a specific A&amp;F effort, other QI efforts and general practice administration [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between practice size and experience in using A&amp;F to support QI. Findings have consistently shown that restrictions to labor or experience can limit the capabilities of a practice to implement relevant audits or leverage the feedback loop appropriately [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. As a result, practices consistently outsource this work as was the case with the present study’s finding that D2D implementation was dependent on an external resource (the QIDSS).
  </p>
  <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The outsourcing of QI processes is not a new phenomenon in the FHT setting. Previous research by Kotecha et al. explored how external practice-facilitators supported FHTs in their QI planning processes. While these external resources served to coach the FHTs, the practices expressed a clear preference for these agents to lead such activity [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. The consistent labour scarcity and alternative priorities may lead some to conclude that dedicated funding to outsource QI efforts should be continued practice. However, such policy should be treated with caution. An area for further research is exploring whether and how team-based practices could be encouraged to develop QI leadership and skills internally rather than seek to outsource them.
  </p>
  <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A third issue is that A&amp;F interventions are rarely evaluated in the context of their mechanism of action. An exception is the work by Pedersen et al. which, like the present study, evaluated an A&amp;F initiative which failed at the 
   <span class="italic">response</span> stage [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. The present study offers additional insight towards understanding the inconsistent performance of A&amp;F – the incomplete feedback loop. This implementation state was a function of an interaction between the selection of data for audit (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), the available resources of a participating practice, and the design of the feedback report (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Further complicating matters is the tenuous relationship between the physician group and the rest of the primary care team in the FHTs that participated in this study. These contextual factors mean that enhancements of the intervention characteristics may not enhance the intervention’s implementation (fidelity to a complete feedback loop) – or its ability to improve quality of care. Future research is necessary to better understand the extent of this problem in the context of various team-based primary care models and performance feedback initiatives.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adherence to optimal feedback recommendations</div>
  <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An assessment of the present study’s results in the context of Brehaut et al.’s 15 suggestions for effective practice feedback optimization offer insight into the mechanics of the feedback loop. D2D featured many strengths that enabled its uptake [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. First, D2D was supported by the credibility of a trusted source as the initiative was led by a team-based primary care advocacy organization [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. As reported previously, a strong motivator for participation in D2D was the underlying intent to create an A&amp;F report reflective of team-based primary care which would grow into a best-in-class initiative [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. For many FHTs, participation in the 
   <span class="italic">audit</span> and 
   <span class="italic">feedback</span> stages may have been in service of this goal and not quality improvement [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, unlike many A&amp;F interventions studied [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>], D2D included multiple instances of feedback which should have enabled the intervention’s mechanism of action [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. The intent of this feature is to leverage the construct of observability, one of several key concepts in diffusion of innovation theory [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. In delivering three iterations of feedback over a 16-month period, recipients should have had some sense of the intervention’s ability to impact QI. However, cycle frequency was described by participants as a barrier to implementation, with some informants complaining of audit fatigue. Given that repeated cycles of D2D did not yield a complete feedback loop one can conclude that the criterion for multiple instances of feedback should be considered necessary but insufficient for A&amp;F to support QI. Concerns regarding data validity and the design of the feedback report overwhelmed the potential advantages from observability by limiting participants’ engagement in the 
   <span class="italic">response</span> stage. This demonstrates the need for A&amp;F developers to carefully consider whether quality measures of interest can be accurately and rapidly measured and reported in a digestible format, at a frequency to enable observability.
  </p>
  <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several additional characteristics across the 
   <span class="italic">audit</span>, 
   <span class="italic">feedback</span> and 
   <span class="italic">response</span> stages may have contributed to the incomplete feedback loop [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. For example, D2D included general data (rather than specific detail actionable by the recipient), using a single mode of feedback delivery (rather than multi-modal), without supports perceived as adequate to enable action. A summary of the relative timing of the inputs for three iterations of D2D is presented in Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>. While the feedback report had a visually appealing design, users had difficulty interpreting results and accessing support documentation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implications for quality improvement</div>
  <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the recency of the data in the audit and the design of the feedback report have important implications for quality improvement. These are captured in the findings detailing that: i) D2D was labour intensive; and ii) acceptance of the feedback was a function of a FHT’s internal maturity with quality improvement. In light of these factors, practices with less quality improvement experience and expertise are provided the impression that the intervention’s feedback loop is complete and is capable of supporting their quality improvement goals. In other words, practices clearly viewed D2D as a complete QI tool and assumed that participation in the 
   <span class="italic">audit</span> and 
   <span class="italic">feedback</span> stages were enabling their efforts to develop QI capacity. However, such engagement may reflect nothing more than a quality mirage.
  </p>
  <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This phenomenon raises several important points. First, some of the 15 suggestions from Brehaut et al. may have greater weight than others as enablers of the mechanism of action for A&amp;F. Suggestions likely necessary (but potentially insufficient) to promote QI which require additional emphasis include: the provision of multiple instances of feedback, the provision of feedback as soon as possible (reflective of current performance), and addressing credibility of the information [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. Second, progressively encouraging responsiveness by A&amp;F recipients around the full loop may need more attention given that the ultimate aim for many A&amp;F initiatives, including D2D, is to support change management. Third, it may not be desirable to distract health professionals or organizations with quality measurements when the feedback is not actionable or when the supports or resources to engage in the 
   <span class="italic">response</span> stage are not available. As highlighted by Fixsen et al., ongoing coaching is a core driver of practice change [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. Performance feedback is important, but the present study illustrates that it may be insufficient to promote QI. The proliferation of measurement detached from actual improvement work is a major risk [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. Moreover, without thoughtful reflection on underlying causes and systemic solutions, quality measurement can miss the forest for the trees [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>].

 <sec id="Sec17" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations</div>
  <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many limitations of the present study have been previously reported [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>], as the data collection and analysis were completed in parallel. First, as all interviews were conducted within a homogeneous practice setting (Family Health Teams in Ontario) findings may not be generalizable to other contexts. Different practice models may yield different results in understanding the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of voluntary, external A&amp;F initiatives such as D2D. Second, while double-coding was applied to the analysis of certain interview transcripts, thematic coding was completed in the absence of a validation procedure by the lead investigator (DJW). The impact of this methodological choice on the results was limited by the use of deductive coding (i.e., CFIR). It is acknowledged that this approach introduces the risk that some aspects of implementation may be overlooked. All authors agreed that this risk was acceptable in the context of the many strengths derived from the use of the CFIR as the theoretical framework for this study. Not only is the CFIR thought to be a comprehensive, well-established and well evidenced framework – it also promotes knowledge translation through the application of consistent terminology in implementation research.
  </p>
  <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lastly, the present findings may not reflect the current implementation state of the D2D A&amp;F program. The program has undergone continued development since the data for this manuscript were collected. In Ontario, quality measurement and management is not yet the norm in the primary care setting and time may be needed to acculturate these approaches [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]. This may be enabled if the multiple agencies conducting A&amp;F initiatives in primary care in Ontario could collaborate [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. As the present study reflects a cross-sectional assessment of implementation, opportunities for future research should not overlook the application of longitudinal methods to track efforts to reduce barriers to implementation.
