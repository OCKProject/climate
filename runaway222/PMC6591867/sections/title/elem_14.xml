   <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many FHTs questioned the validity of the data reported in D2D. Poor documentation was cited as a contributor to data validity concerns. Informants suggested that vague definitions in D2D support material did little to address their mistrust in the data. Many did not understand why the complete methodologies for each measure were not easily accessible. In the absence of such documentation, participants were concerned about methodological consistency between practices, limiting the utility of peer comparison. In addition, participants had a range of perspectives regarding the recency of the audit for each measure. A minority of participants recognized that the multi-sourced nature of D2D implied that the measures may not represent similar time periods (as reflected in Additional file 
    <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Some became aware of this when asked about the relative timing of measures during the usability exercise. (Table

Participants also sought the ability to export or share their report directly from the website to support quality improvement, a functionality that was not available at the time of this study. Furthermore, participants expressed a desire for a more accessible data dictionary as well as a more sophisticated website where they could interact with a specific indicator to access further information.

All FHTs participated in mandatory quality improvement programs, which included the Quality Improvement Plan (QIP) and patient experience surveys, as outlined in provincial legislation [

The most common were Health Quality Ontario’s (HQO) Primary Care Group Practice Report; the Screening Activity Report (SAR) from Cancer Care Ontario (CCO); the Electronic Medical Record Administrative Data Linked Database (EMRALD); and the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) from the College of Family Physicians of Canada [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. FHTs also conducted their own internal A&amp;F programs with varying degrees of sophistication. Often, D2D was viewed to be of lower priority relative to these other A&amp;F initiatives. Relative priority was a function of regulatory requirements, available capacity and maturity to support QI, and the perceived attributes of each A&amp;F effort. Specifically, FHTs which lacked internal reporting mechanisms, or which did not participate in external programs assigned greater priority to D2D. (Table

When they’re doing that, they’re not seeing patients. And so, the quality improvement initiative is, the Ministry going back to your thing around the policy climate, is really trying to drive increased accessibility. When I have 10 people in a meeting for two hours to talk about quality improvement, that means they’re not seeing patients, which reduces access of our patients to our team. So, in terms of resources, there needs to be greater organizational capacity to be able to plan, develop, and implement quality improvement initiatives beyond a part-time QIDSS specialist. Otherwise, we really are working in conflict in terms of trying to give patients greater access to our providers, while, at the same time, distracting our providers by trying to engage them in things like quality improvement initiatives or other things that seem to come down from the Ministry within that particular policy climate.

         <p>R1: She was never a data-person. We just gave her the job and she learned it on the job, which was great. I think that is also one of the concerns, too. From a knowledge transfer perspective, if she left tomorrow, we would be in a lot of trouble. (ID = 003)</p>

   <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implementation was also affected by the relationship between the physicians and the rest of the team (i.e., the executives and allied health professionals of the FHT). Participants noted that some physicians saw the FHT as an entity to which they are not accountable. Informants cited difficulties in engaging physicians who were close to retirement and/or who practiced in other care settings (ie. emergency departments) (Table

If I could go back in time, I would try to figure out a way to set up the structure that I wasn’t an employee of the FHT, that I was an employee of the FHO, and that would be my angle, you know what I mean, that I actually work for the doctors?

So decisions are really made taking into account how it affects not just the doctors, but the Its and everyone else. Really the decisions about going along with D2D were really mostly determined by the direction that Name-X thought we should take and then passed down rather than the other way around.

        <td colspan="2">• Huge changes would be more difficult just because we’re not really allowed to tell them how to work. Basically we have to try it with one physician and then say, hey, you know what, this worked really well, look at the difference in his numbers from doing this for a couple of months. And even so, it’s the same physician every time, so I think some of the doctors get a little, well, I don’t want to hear that from him anymore. We actually do have three physicians on our quality committee now which is great because I think they’ll be willing to try more things too spread them to the physicians they work with. So we have multiple sites of physicians so that makes it difficult too. (ID = 006)</td>

       <tr>
        <td colspan="2">• We have a number of physicians who are closer to retirement or slowing down or getting out of their practices. They just don’t really have the enthusiasm to implement changes or to try to do something in a different way, whether it’s changing the way that they report something in the EMR to like I’ve been doing it by paper for 30 years of my life. And tehn I finally converted to the EMR eight years ago and you’re not going to tell me how to do something different for two years before I retire. And then the other factor is just time. As I mentioned earlier, many of our physicians they work in the Emergency Department for a smaller community hospital. So they work in the ED, they’re working on the floors, they’re seeing patients, they’re working in long-term care and they just don’t have the time. They have their own admin time to work on or they have their own clinic time where they have to be here doing that, so that’s kind of one of the struggles. And some individuals see the family health team as being the family health team and the physician group being the physician group and we work together, but we don’t have to play together kind of thing.
