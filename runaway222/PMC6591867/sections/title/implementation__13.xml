 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">audit</span> stage was led by a QIDSS, or an internal FHT staff member for those practices without the QIDSS resource. These individuals queried each data source and manually transcribed the values into their respective fields in the D2D data entry form.
 </p>
 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the 
  <span class="italic">feedback</span> stage, it was generally the responsibility of the QIDSS to review the results and present the findings to FHT leadership. In some cases, the feedback report was viewed directly by the Executive Director or other leaders. Results would then be shared with a quality improvement committee or board of directors, sometimes following modifications to the report to include comparisons to the QIDSS partnership. Further dissemination of the feedback report to specific providers or staff members was limited.
 </p>
 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">response</span> stage involving the assessment of practice-gaps as well as any subsequent action plans to improve the quality of care was not described by any key informant. Some did report that D2D results were used for narrative purposes in mandatory annual regulatory submissions. Thus, the perceived implementation state of the D2D audit and feedback initiative at the time of this study could be represented by an incomplete feedback loop (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>).

    <p>Diagrammatic Summary of the Implementation of the Data-to-Decisions (D2D) Audit and Feedback Program. The figure represents a diagrammatic summary of how interviewed practices implemented the Data-to-Decisions (D2D) audit and feedback program. The observed state of implementation reflected an incomplete feedback loop as characterized by the fact that the response and audit stages were not linked. The 
     <span class="italic">feedback</span> stage summarizes the observation that the feedback report was sometimes reformatted prior to review by practice leaders
