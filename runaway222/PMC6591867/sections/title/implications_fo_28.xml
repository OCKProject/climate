 <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the recency of the data in the audit and the design of the feedback report have important implications for quality improvement. These are captured in the findings detailing that: i) D2D was labour intensive; and ii) acceptance of the feedback was a function of a FHT’s internal maturity with quality improvement. In light of these factors, practices with less quality improvement experience and expertise are provided the impression that the intervention’s feedback loop is complete and is capable of supporting their quality improvement goals. In other words, practices clearly viewed D2D as a complete QI tool and assumed that participation in the 
  <span class="italic">audit</span> and 
  <span class="italic">feedback</span> stages were enabling their efforts to develop QI capacity. However, such engagement may reflect nothing more than a quality mirage.

 <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This phenomenon raises several important points. First, some of the 15 suggestions from Brehaut et al. may have greater weight than others as enablers of the mechanism of action for A&amp;F. Suggestions likely necessary (but potentially insufficient) to promote QI which require additional emphasis include: the provision of multiple instances of feedback, the provision of feedback as soon as possible (reflective of current performance), and addressing credibility of the information [

Second, progressively encouraging responsiveness by A&amp;F recipients around the full loop may need more attention given that the ultimate aim for many A&amp;F initiatives, including D2D, is to support change management. Third, it may not be desirable to distract health professionals or organizations with quality measurements when the feedback is not actionable or when the supports or resources to engage in the 
  <span class="italic">response</span> stage are not available. As highlighted by Fixsen et al., ongoing coaching is a core driver of practice change [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. Performance feedback is important, but the present study illustrates that it may be insufficient to promote QI. The proliferation of measurement detached from actual improvement work is a major risk [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. Moreover, without thoughtful reflection on underlying causes and systemic solutions, quality measurement can miss the forest for the trees [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>].
