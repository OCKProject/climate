 <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many limitations of the present study have been previously reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>], as the data collection and analysis were completed in parallel. First, as all interviews were conducted within a homogeneous practice setting (Family Health Teams in Ontario) findings may not be generalizable to other contexts. Different practice models may yield different results in understanding the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of voluntary, external A&amp;F initiatives such as D2D. Second, while double-coding was applied to the analysis of certain interview transcripts, thematic coding was completed in the absence of a validation procedure by the lead investigator (DJW). The impact of this methodological choice on the results was limited by the use of deductive coding (i.e., CFIR). It is acknowledged that this approach introduces the risk that some aspects of implementation may be overlooked. All authors agreed that this risk was acceptable in the context of the many strengths derived from the use of the CFIR as the theoretical framework for this study. Not only is the CFIR thought to be a comprehensive, well-established and well evidenced framework â€“ it also promotes knowledge translation through the application of consistent terminology in implementation research.

 <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lastly, the present findings may not reflect the current implementation state of the D2D A&amp;F program. The program has undergone continued development since the data for this manuscript were collected. In Ontario, quality measurement and management is not yet the norm in the primary care setting and time may be needed to acculturate these approaches [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]. This may be enabled if the multiple agencies conducting A&amp;F initiatives in primary care in Ontario could collaborate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. As the present study reflects a cross-sectional assessment of implementation, opportunities for future research should not overlook the application of longitudinal methods to track efforts to reduce barriers to implementation.
