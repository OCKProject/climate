 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Twenty-five individuals representing 18 primary care teams participated in the study. Analysis of how the A&amp;F intervention was used revealed that implementation reflected an incomplete feedback loop. Participation was facilitated by the reliance on an external resource to facilitate the practice audit. The frequency of feedback, concerns with data validity, the design of the feedback report, the resource requirements to participate, and the team relationship were all identified as barriers to implementation of A&amp;F.</p>
