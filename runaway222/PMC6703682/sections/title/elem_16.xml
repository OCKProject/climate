 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The deterministic, average results are subject to additional pressure from climate variability. A particular consequence of variability is greater propensity to collapse. More variable climate conditions, such as under ECE-o and ECE-bc, may lead more often to situations in which stock survival is threatened. This depends particularly on the bio-economic equilibrium biomass around which the actual stock fluctuates driven by the variable climate. If this equilibrium stock size is large, it works as a strong buffer against climatically unfavorable years.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To analyze the systems’ sustainability, we compute the mean time of survival. This standard measure in population viability analysis evaluates stock persistence facing perturbations [

  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref098" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref098">98</a>]. For each combination of climate projection (4) and fuel subsidy scenario (2), we run the model 1000 times, over which we compute means to capture that the fishery is unequally variable.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g007" href="#pone.0220433.g007">Fig 7</a> shows one scatter plot for eight different models—the combination of four climate projections and two policy scenarios. The mean time of survival is indicated on the y-axis. To compare welfare across climate projections, we use the mean net present value (NPV), indicated on the x-axis. The welfare impact is discussed in the next subsection, 3.4.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The colors indicate the underlying climate projection. The shapes indicate the fuel price scenario. The squares show how a fishery performs under different climate scenarios in the BAU case, in which fuel subsidies are maintained. As expected, variability under ECE-o is so high that the fishery underperforms. The fishery cannot reap the whole benefits of its favorable climate prediction. Short periods of high biomass alternate with long periods of slow replenishment. This dampens mean survival relative to the underlying high productivity. NESM-o becomes steadily more unsustainable in the medium term, leading to extinction around 2035. Under ECE-bc, this effect also plays a role, especially in the early years. Variability is high, which contributes to comparatively low sustainability even before 2030. During the early 2030s, the fishery is particularly vulnerable owing to its low productivity and high harvest pressure. During this time, variability in almost all runs eventually leads to extinction. Under NESM-o, mean survival is in line with the deterministic equilibrium. Variability is too low to have a substantial impact. Between NESM-o and ECE-o, variability is a game changer: NESM-o now outperforms ECE-o, even though the latter shows superior equilibrium sustainability. NESM-bc provides the least favorable climate prediction. Almost from the start, productivity is too low to counter the steadily increasing harvest pressure, and the species becomes extinct early on. Therefore, variability is of little relevance.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We can now also measure climate uncertainty, which we define as the spread in outcomes due to different climate projections. Between NESM-o and NESM-bc, climate uncertainty amounts to 4.5 years of mean survival times, that is, 26% of NESM-bc’s value. The two bias-corrected projections, which were specifically adapted for a better reproduction of the observed climate, are the two with the lowest mean survival time. This indicates that if a study relies only on original biased models, outcomes may be upward biased.</p>
