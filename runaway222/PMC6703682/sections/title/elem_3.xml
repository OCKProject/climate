  <span class="italic">Sardinella aurita</span> is a migratory small pelagic schooling species. The species occurs along the continental shelf between Morocco and Guinea Bissau [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate climate impacts on biomass growth, we use stock assessment data for 
  <span class="italic">Sardinella aurita</span> by the Food and Agriculture organization (FAO) working group on the assessment of small pelagic fish off Northwest Africa. In the years 1995–2006, catch independent surveys were carried out in the fourth quarter of each year by the research vessel R/V Dr FRIDTJOF NANSEN [

  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref034">34</a>], the lagged spring and autumn upwelling indexes have a significant positive effect on 
  <span class="italic">Sardinella aurita</span> abundance, because they spur primary productivity. On the other hand, wind stress can influence retention negatively, because larvae drift off to areas where they cannot survive [

  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref048">48</a>]. We use the ERA Interim Reanalysis product, available from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref053">53</a>], to calculate a seasonal coastal upwelling index (CUI) from wind stress using standard procedures [

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001" href="#pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</a>). We average over the area between 13.5–16°N and 17.25–18°W. Our index shows the typical regional pattern: upwelling is strongest in winter, and subsides between June and October.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimate the effect of upwelling on yearly stock growth (surplus stock production), defined as the biomass difference between consecutive years plus catches.

  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref054">54</a>]. We add reported catches by legal foreign trawlers from the “Sea around us” data-base [

  <span class="sup">2</span> of 92%, which is non-surprising considering that only 14 observations (1996–2009) are available and upwelling has been established as the main driver by previous research. The inclusion of upwelling explains 28% of the variation compared to the model without climate impacts. No issues are detected in tests for serial correlation, heteroscedasticity, and skewness at the 5% level. An augmented Dickey–Fuller test gives a test statistic of -3.874 for logged growth and a critical 1%-level value of -3.750, such that we find the data to be stationary.

The positive impact from fall upwelling, significant at 5%, is partly canceled out by the negative impact from winter upwelling (significant at the 1% level). The latter could be linked to lower retention and colder water temperatures unfavorable for the autumn larvae, which would delay spring spawning. Thiaw et al. [
