 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total sector benefits include the fishery’s role as a safety net, that is, income provision (producer surplus or “fisher surplus,” FS), and its direct contribution to food security (“consumer surplus,” CS). CS is the willingness to pay for fish above the monthly equilibrium price. For our downward-sloping demand curve with price on the y-axis and quantity demanded on the x-axis, CS is the area below the curve and above the horizontal line drawn at the equilibrium price (see Section J of the 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001" href="#pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</a>). Fishers earn rents because of their role in providing capital and labor to produce harvest. FS can be calculated by summing the areas below the equilibrium price and above the inverse supply curve for capital and labor, respectively. Adding up FS and CS yields a welfare measure for food security, which takes into account the availability of substitutes, and thus, changes in the fishers’ and consumers’ dependence on fresh 
  <span class="italic">Sardinella aurita</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To compare welfare across climate projections, we use the mean NPV. NPV is a standard economic measure that computes the sum of all future benefits in monetary units and weighs future benefits by a discount factor to capture the higher future value of money that is immediately available. In this study, we use the 2014-NPV of total rents generated in the fishery at an assumed discount rate of 3%. For the scenarios with reduced subsidy, we add the savings of tax revenue. We again compute means over 1000 runs.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculate an average FS of 8.77 billion FCFA in 2014 and an average CS of 5.47 billion FCFA. At a typical price of 1,145 FCFA for a 5-kg basket of local grains, this amounts to 946 baskets yearly for each of the roughly 8100 fishers involved, and 1.96 baskets per inhabitant of the coastal region studied (2.4 million, about 21% of the total Senegalese population). These baskets constitute an additional gain for the fishers (consumers) over the situation in which the resource would not be available to them and they would have to work in different sectors (consume different products). Using observed harvest and prices, we calculate a mean yearly total rent value of 14.97 billion FCFA for 2004–2013. This compares well with the summed benefits from 2014, namely, 14.24 billion FCFA. We conclude that our simulation produces plausible results.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g007" href="#pone.0220433.g007">Fig 7</a>, the mean NPV is indicated on the x-axis. Again, we first concentrate on the squares, that is, the BAU case. High variability under ECE-o also has a dampening effect on rents. First, this is a direct consequence of shorter survival times. Second, ECE-o’s survival year profile is right-tailed: extinction is most likely at the beginning of the time horizon, when harvest curves are flattest. The biomass usually becomes extinct early on, and the relatively high sustainability is the consequence of few runs with very long survival. Owing to discounting, the extra rents per occasional additional survival year contribute only a small amount to the NPV. In particular, the yield is lower than under NESM-o, which is less productive, but very stable. Yields are very low under ECE-bc and NESM-bc, that is, the two bias-corrected models. The low productivity in NESM-bc leads to lower potential NPV. Over-fishing and low sustainability in both ECE-bc and NESM-bc also translate to low expected rents.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the range of total rents as a metric, climate uncertainty amounts to 57 billion FCFA, which constitutes 24% of the lowest NPV of total rents. Fishers’ rent difference accounts for 64% of this gap. We conclude that the effect of climate uncertainty is moderate. This is a direct consequence of low sustainability: short survival times mean that differences in climate projections in the medium term rarely affect rents, because in most cases, the resource by then has gone extinct. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g008" href="#pone.0220433.g008">Fig 8</a> shows the distribution of benefits between fishers and consumers for the eight models considered. The effect on income security is larger than on food security. This results mostly because the model predicts that markets develop and consumers’ dependence on fresh 
  <span class="italic">Sardinella aurita</span> declines. In relative terms, consumers’ mean surplus share is highest under ECE-bc, but the difference across models is exceedingly small.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To separately analyze changes in annual rents under climate change and to complement the literature findings, we compare undiscounted rents in different decades for each model (see Section K of the 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001" href="#pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</a>). Climate change is costly under projections ECE-bc and NESM-bc, as well as for the NESM-o BAU scenario owing to actors’ adaptation. [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref011">11</a>] suggested that for the whole Senegalese artisanal fishery, 13% of jobs would be lost by 2050. Comparing rents in 2014–2023 and 2034–2043, we observe changes between -97% and 52% under BAU. Mean losses lie at 27% when fuel subsidies continue. This result holds only because of the (small but positive) possibility of very large benefits under ECE-o. On average, the resource would have gone extinct by 2050 in all eight model-scenario combinations considered, such that the potential mean yield for 2054–2063 equals zero under all projections except ECE-o. The risk is substantial.
