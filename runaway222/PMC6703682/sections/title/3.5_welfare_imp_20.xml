 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been argued in World Trade Organization (WTO) discussions that developing countries’ fisheries may need subsidies to help maintain food security and alleviate poverty [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref023">23</a>]. The argument is that fuel subsidies help to increase fishing effort by enabling the use of larger vessel, engines that are more powerful and by allowing fishers to travel larger distances to fishing grounds [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref024">24</a>]. The ensuing larger catches lead to lower prices for consumers. The first part corresponds well with our study: Our model predicts that fuel subsidies will lead to more fishing effort. However, once accounting for the dynamic impact of increased fishing pressure on biomass, we find that eliminating fuel subsidies would benefit both fishers and consumers. Higher fuel prices, all else equal, decrease harvest. This reduces over-fishing, such that the equilibrium stock level is higher and more stable. In 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g007" href="#pone.0220433.g007">Fig 7</a>, the circles mark the melt-down subsidy reform case. This would be the outcome if fuel subsidies were gradually decreased and finally fully abolished in 2030. In the most extreme case, NESM-o, this increase reaches 5.4 years mean survival time increase or 62 billion NPV of total rents. It could increase the BAU value by 21%.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, not only are fuel subsidies expensive for taxpayers, they also reduce welfare in total. If fuel subsidies were abolished, climate change might on average even turn out to be slightly beneficial concerning undiscounted rents, that is, the sector’s current value yields (Section K of the 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001" href="#pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</a>). The subsidies may achieve redistribution of rents from fishers to consumers, but this effect is small and dearly bought with an overall lower consumer rent, as evident in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g008" href="#pone.0220433.g008">Fig 8</a>.

  <span class="italic">If fuel subsidies were abolished</span>, 
  <span class="italic">the NPV of total rents would increase regardless of the climate projection</span>. 
  <span class="italic">Abolishing fuel subsidies would also largely maintain the current distribution of rents between consumers and fishers</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We quantify this effect to analyze intervention effectiveness. The beneficial effect of removing fuel subsidies is not equally large across climate projections: The rent difference between policy scenarios varies between 33 billion and 62 billion FCFA, that is, 12–21% of the BAU rent value. Intervention effectiveness depends not only on the cost share of fuel for fishers or the size of the intervention. More important is how climate influences the extinction risk. A low stock may result from a system with overall low productivity (e.g. NESM-bc), with SST-induced over-harvesting incentives or from variability, for example after a sequence of unfavorable upwelling years (e.g. ECE-o). If the stock is low, a small difference in catches due to abolished fuel subsidies can be decisive for whether the resource goes extinct or whether it continues to contribute to food security. The benefit of saving the resource from extinction is even larger if the period of unfavorable climate is only temporary and followed by a more favorable climate with a high equilibrium stock and large sustainable catch potential.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gains due to increased survival time are positive for all scenarios, but largest under NESM-o. Under NESM-o, the abolition of fuel subsidies suffices for the resource to survive for a substantially longer amount of time. For NESM-bc and ECE-bc, policy gains are positive but small, because the intervention is not strong enough for the stock to survive the projected increase in harvest pressure. Under ECE-o, the mean survival year profile becomes more right skewed than in the case with fuel subsidies. This means that the intervention can help to decrease the extinction risk in late years, while it is not sufficient to save the resource in early years (keep in mind that the system is partly stochastic). Due to discounting, these long-run gains have a relatively low weight. Therefore, rent gains per additional survival year are low.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Outcome uncertainty between the different climate projections is increased through fuel subsidy reform. Differences in climate models now translate into larger differences in ensuing rents, that is, up to 84 billion FCFA between the melt-down case under NESM-bc and NESM-o. The increase in uncertainty mostly stems from larger differences in survival times, and longer survival in general such that differences between the climate projections come into effect more and more.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Result 8</span>. 
  <span class="italic">Differences in climate projections lead to a spread in the welfare outcome</span>, 
  <span class="italic">which amounts to more than double the spread between fuel scenarios</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main effect of climate change concerns the spatial stock distribution: biomass becomes more vulnerable to Senegalese purse seines over a certain time horizon, because the fish spend more time in the close-to-shore area. Abolishing fuel subsidies could buy time to bridge this transition period. The effectiveness of this measure depends on the climate development. It would be particularly effective under low variability and a weak SST trend, i.e. with a moderate extinction risk. If either variability or the SST trend proved too strong, this measure would be insufficient. A proper resource management system that goes beyond the mere abolition of subsidies, such as a binding limit on annual harvest, would be needed to ensure sustainability in the long term. Nonetheless, there is good news: productivity remains high under all projections except NESM-bc, such that rents and yields remain high if a proper management is installed. However, if the spatial stock redistribution effect crosses national boundaries, such a management would require multinational cooperation.</p>
