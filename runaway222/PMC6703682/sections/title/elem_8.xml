 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We run the simulation of the fishery and stock dynamics from 2014 to 2079 or alternatively until the fishery collapses. To account for catches from other, mostly artisanal fleets, we multiply the modeled Senegalese purse seine catches by a factor of 1.083, estimated from historical averages. We use a monthly time step, linearly interpolating fish population growth (which is estimated based on yearly data), including the stochastic term.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate policy alternatives, we consider two scenarios. The development of the mean annual fuel price over time for each of the scenarios is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g003" href="#pone.0220433.g003">Fig 3</a>. The first is the business-as-usual case (BAU). A proportionate subsidy of 30.7% [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref095">95</a>] in the form of tax exemptions has formed the most important component of subsidies [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref025">25</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref071">71</a>] since the 1960s. The second scenario considers the case in which the tax-exemption is linearly decreased over 15 years until subsidies are fully eliminated (“melt-down,” md), which enables a gradual transition for fishers and consumers. The price plateaus in 2034, but its level is about 600 FCFA higher under the reform scenario than under the BAU scenario.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the next section, we first take a closer look at changes in stock growth and the results from spatial stock distribution on catchability. Thereafter, we analyze the model behavior at mean growth and harvest pressure, and more closely consider how the equilibrium between growth and harvest pressure changes over the decades. This allows us to compare the effects of climate projections on the fishery under a stable climate, that is, disregarding short-term variability. We proceed to analyze the dynamic system and focus first on the sustainability of the fishery and the propensity for stock collapse. We then turn to the analysis of welfare effects. Subsequently, we explore the effects of abolishing fuel subsidies on sustainability and welfare.</p>
