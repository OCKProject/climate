  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref086">86</a>]. For example, while there is general support among climate models for a continuation in the rise of SST throughout the 21st century, the extent of this rise varies among them [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref087">87</a>]. To consider this model uncertainty, we use the output of two different earth system models with two different formulations per model, to investigate the consequences of the model spread for artisanal fisheries. This comparison allows us to analyze the importance of certain traits and differences for the fishery. The use and comparison of different climate models can improve the overall understanding of climate impacts and the variability of outcomes, as weaknesses are partly compensated for and greater reliability is achieved [

  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref089">89</a>]. Two of our projections (ECE-o and ECE-bc) are derived from an extended version of the EC Earth model, based on the model described in [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref090">90</a>]. The two other projections (NESM-o and NESM-bc) are based on the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM), as described in [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref091" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref091">91</a>]. ECE-o and NESM-o are the original model versions, whereas ECE-bc and NESM-bc are bias corrected. For ECE-bc, bias correction is achieved through adaptation of the ocean-mixing parameter in the ocean model part. For NESM-bc, bias correction is applied by replacing SST from the ocean model part with anomalies before running the atmospheric model, and vice versa with wind stress. The estimated bias is projected into the future. All models use the representative concentration pathway 8.5 as a basis for radiative forcing, that is, business-as-usual continued forcing.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As is common for climate modeling in the region, all four projections show systematic bias to observed values of SST and wind-stress. We use a standard offline nudging approach [

  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref094" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref094">94</a>] for each climate scenario and apply constant monthly factors directly to the data. The coefficients are estimated through a regression model to fit the ERA reanalysis data used to estimate the biological and economic model parts. The proportional approach outperforms the approach of adding a constant in our case. The fit is better for SST than for wind stress, as the SST development is far more systematic.

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001" href="#pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</a>, we compare the four projections concerning mean, trend, standard deviation, and cyclical behavior of key impacts. On average, both winter and fall upwelling show a slight decrease over time for all four models, and are predicted to be stronger under NESM-o and NESM-bc than under ECE-o and ECE-bc. All mean values for winter upwelling for the period 2014–2079 lie below the average observed value during the estimation period (2001–2013). The upper level of the 95% confidence interval falls below the maximum observed value. For fall upwelling, only NESM-o and NESM-bc averages lie above the estimation period mean. For these two, the 95% confidence interval falls fully within the span of observed values. ECE-o and ECE-bc show substantial variability in inter-annual upwelling.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A strong upward trend in SST is evident in all four projections (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g002" href="#pone.0220433.g002">Fig 2</a>). Scenarios ECE-o and ECE-bc feature a higher average temperature than NESM-o and NESM-bc in particular after 2030. They also show a higher variability in yearly means. The difference between warm and cold years is more pronounced. In addition, the seasonal cycle amplitude as well as the pertaining standard deviation are larger under ECE-o and ECE-bc.
