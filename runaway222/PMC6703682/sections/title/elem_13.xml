 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyze the model behavior at mean growth and harvest pressure, and take a closer look at how the equilibrium between the two changes over the decades. This allows us to compare the effects of climate projections on the fishery under a stable climate, that is, disregarding short-term variability.</p>

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g005" href="#pone.0220433.g005">Fig 5</a> shows yearly total harvest as a function of biomass, as well as biomass growth, for exemplary years under ECE-o and BAU. We choose growth with a year lead on harvest, because we model growth in year 
  <span class="italic">y</span> to depend on SSB 1 year before that. The interpretation of the graph is as follows: if the growth function lies above the harvest, the stock shows net growth. In a non-variable, deterministic model, the rightmost interception of the two marks dynamically stable positive equilibrium (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g005" href="#pone.0220433.g005">Fig 5</a>) at which the harvest is exactly offset, such that fishers in the next year are able to benefit from stock exactly as large as in the prior year. For harvest years 2013 and 2078, such a point exists. However, for 2047 the harvest curve lies far above the growth curve. The only stable equilibrium in such a graph would be a biomass of zero. If this were the case for longer than a few periods, biomass would collapse in the deterministic case. Note that these are only singular, exemplary years. As a result of climate variability, the shown years cannot be taken as a reference for whole periods.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g006" href="#pone.0220433.g006">Fig 6</a>, we show how this equilibrium changes over time for all four climate projections and under the two fuel price scenarios. Consider first the black crosses that indicate the BAU case in which fuel subsidies are maintained. A downward trend in equilibrium biomass is recognizable under all four climate projections. The number of years in which fishing is unsustainable, marked with an equilibrium value of zero, also increases. Under ECE-o, few such years alternate with relatively favorable years and equilibrium biomass around 200 kt. For NESM-bc, after 2028, there are only very few sustainable years for the fishery. After about 2030, a dangerous period arises under NESM-o and ECE-bc, in which over-fishing and extinction are likely. This development ends only late in the time horizon, when the SST is too high throughout the year and the harvest decreases again. In the long term, unsustainable harvesting years prevail for NESM-o, NESM-bc, and ECE-bc.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If fuel subsidies were (gradually) abolished, harvest pressure would be lower, such that a higher equilibrium biomass would result (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g006" href="#pone.0220433.g006">Fig 6</a>). Unsustainable years occur less often, particularly under NESM-o. Ensuring survival under ECE-bc and NESM-bc would prove very difficult in the medium term, when productivity is still relatively low and harvest pressure high, and even under the melt-down scenario, numerous unsustainable years arise.
