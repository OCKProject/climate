 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mentioned in section 2.3, both winter and fall upwelling show a slight decrease over time for all four models, and are predicted to be stronger under NESM-o and NESM-bc than under ECE-o and ECE-bc. The decrease in winter upwelling is beneficial for stock growth, while a decline in fall upwelling is harmful. The overall resulting natural growth rate development is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g004" href="#pone.0220433.g004">Fig 4</a>. Clearly, its variability is higher under ECE-o and ECE-bc for both seasons, which is in line with the higher upwelling variability. Average system productivity is highest under ECE-o and lowest under NESM-bc, particularly because of the second half of the time horizon. We observe an upward trend for ECE-o and ECE-bc. In the other two projections, the natural growth rate shows no detectable trend, but a distinct dip is visible in the medium term between 2036 and 2057 under ECE-bc.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SST and monthly dummies enter the harvest function in a jointly multiplicative term. Hence, the SST effect on harvest pressure is strongest during the high season between February and May. These months, especially April and May, have particularly high catchability, also due to biological processes uncontrolled by SST. Section I of the 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001" href="#pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</a> provides a figure showing the development of harvest pressure over time for 4 exemplary months. During the high season, the fishery becomes cheaper over time, as the SST approaches the optimum temperature. The fish remain in the close-to-shore area for a longer period than before, where they are easily caught. Between June and December, the temperature increase leads to a decrease in catchability from 2040 onwards under all climate projections. Fish leave the close-to shore area slightly earlier than before. However, these months are generally less important for the fishery anyway. For both periods, the impact is stronger for ECE-o and ECE-bc, as is the variability. Overall, we observe a severe increase in catchability induced by the SST trend. Toward the end of the time horizon, this trend is either approximately stable (ECE-bc, NESM-o, and NESM-bc) or reversed (ECE-o), when SST already lies above the optimum point during spring. Then, the Senegalese waters finally become too warm for the species, which would permanently relocate northwards. These results are summarized as follows.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">NESM-bc features a comparatively high total harvest pressure over the whole time horizon. At the beginning of the time horizon, yearly harvest pressure is also high under ECE-o, and in the medium term, ECE-bc shows the highest harvest pressure. Under NESM-o, harvest pressure is consistently low.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model includes additional factors that impact the harvest curves. Market development provides increasing substitution possibilities for consumers. Consequently, equilibrium harvest becomes more sensitive to the stock level, leading to a steeper harvest function early in the time horizon and a lower equilibrium stock value. In addition, positive trends in fuel prices and technological development combine with a net low positive trend, which strengthens the upward shift in harvest functions until 2033. By our assumptions, these trends dwindle to zero until 2033.</p>
