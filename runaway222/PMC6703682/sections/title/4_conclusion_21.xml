 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results can inform policymaking, as they shed light on the effect of climate change while incorporating endogenous adaptation of actors. Seemingly beneficial climate impacts, such as a cost reduction due to climate-induced movement of fish stock, may turn out negative, as they increase the propensity to over-fish. When policymakers consider climate change impacts on their fishing sectors, they should not stop at an analysis of catch potential. Even if a fishery currently makes a considerable food and income security contribution under open access and the catch potential would not decrease, climate change might alter the open-access equilibrium to the point where the species is pushed toward extinction. In other words, climate change may alter the need for resource management in a fishery. For the fishery in question, it is clear that without intervention, sustainable resource use is not likely. Moreover, our findings reveal large uncertainty of outcomes with respect to different climate projections, even when qualitative patterns of the climate trajectories are preserved and the differences seem small in the original climate data. Thus, the results underline the need for careful comparative evaluations with different climate projections, and can help policymakers to be on the look-out for important projection traits that may explain outcome differences.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To grasp the severity of climate change impacts fully, it is important to consider complementary future changes, such as those in market development and technological progress. Future market, technology, and factor price development are part of our analysis. Our results show that on aggregate, they accelerate the unsustainable use of the resource. The counteracting increase in fuel prices due to the increase in world market oil prices is not sufficient to turn the tide. Thus, if economic development is neglected in climate change simulation studies, impacts may be underestimated.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We show that abolishing fuel subsidies leads to more sustainable use of the resource. In monetary terms, this is beneficial for the sector as a whole, but also for each of the two factions—consumers and fishers—separately. We conclude that this policy should be considered to enhance overall welfare and to help the sector adapt to climate change. However, this policy alone is not sufficient. It can buy time to implement a proper resource management, such as quotas or—if these are not feasible—more refined effort restrictions. If such a system were successfully implemented, the gains could be large; climate change reduces harvesting costs for a considerable time period. Biomass growth is either unaffected or increases, depending on the climate projection. If over-fishing could be eliminated, the sector would yield a contribution to income and food security that could exceed even current yields. Necessary avenues of future research include the extension of the model to linkages with stocks and fisheries in neighboring Mauritania, as well the inclusion of further fleets and species interactions, once data becomes available. Furthermore, tipping points may play a role: For example, if SST finally becomes too high in nursery areas that can not be compensated by an earlier start of the nursing season, this may threaten larval survival and lead to extinction of the sub-population within a few short years. Further experimental research on such tipping points could shed light on the likelihood of such disastrous events.</p>
