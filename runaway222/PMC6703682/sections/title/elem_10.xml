  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mentioned in section 2.3, both winter and fall upwelling show a slight decrease over time for all four models, and are predicted to be stronger under NESM-o and NESM-bc than under ECE-o and ECE-bc. The decrease in winter upwelling is beneficial for stock growth, while a decline in fall upwelling is harmful. The overall resulting natural growth rate development is shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g004" href="#pone.0220433.g004">Fig 4</a>. Clearly, its variability is higher under ECE-o and ECE-bc for both seasons, which is in line with the higher upwelling variability. Average system productivity is highest under ECE-o and lowest under NESM-bc, particularly because of the second half of the time horizon. We observe an upward trend for ECE-o and ECE-bc. In the other two projections, the natural growth rate shows no detectable trend, but a distinct dip is visible in the medium term between 2036 and 2057 under ECE-bc.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SST and monthly dummies enter the harvest function in a jointly multiplicative term. Hence, the SST effect on harvest pressure is strongest during the high season between February and May. These months, especially April and May, have particularly high catchability, also due to biological processes uncontrolled by SST. Section I of the 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001" href="#pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</a> provides a figure showing the development of harvest pressure over time for 4 exemplary months. During the high season, the fishery becomes cheaper over time, as the SST approaches the optimum temperature. The fish remain in the close-to-shore area for a longer period than before, where they are easily caught. Between June and December, the temperature increase leads to a decrease in catchability from 2040 onwards under all climate projections. Fish leave the close-to shore area slightly earlier than before. However, these months are generally less important for the fishery anyway. For both periods, the impact is stronger for ECE-o and ECE-bc, as is the variability. Overall, we observe a severe increase in catchability induced by the SST trend. Toward the end of the time horizon, this trend is either approximately stable (ECE-bc, NESM-o, and NESM-bc) or reversed (ECE-o), when SST already lies above the optimum point during spring. Then, the Senegalese waters finally become too warm for the species, which would permanently relocate northwards. These results are summarized as follows.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">NESM-bc features a comparatively high total harvest pressure over the whole time horizon. At the beginning of the time horizon, yearly harvest pressure is also high under ECE-o, and in the medium term, ECE-bc shows the highest harvest pressure. Under NESM-o, harvest pressure is consistently low.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model includes additional factors that impact the harvest curves. Market development provides increasing substitution possibilities for consumers. Consequently, equilibrium harvest becomes more sensitive to the stock level, leading to a steeper harvest function early in the time horizon and a lower equilibrium stock value. In addition, positive trends in fuel prices and technological development combine with a net low positive trend, which strengthens the upward shift in harvest functions until 2033. By our assumptions, these trends dwindle to zero until 2033.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyze the model behavior at mean growth and harvest pressure, and take a closer look at how the equilibrium between the two changes over the decades. This allows us to compare the effects of climate projections on the fishery under a stable climate, that is, disregarding short-term variability.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g005" href="#pone.0220433.g005">Fig 5</a> shows yearly total harvest as a function of biomass, as well as biomass growth, for exemplary years under ECE-o and BAU. We choose growth with a year lead on harvest, because we model growth in year 
   <span class="italic">y</span> to depend on SSB 1 year before that. The interpretation of the graph is as follows: if the growth function lies above the harvest, the stock shows net growth. In a non-variable, deterministic model, the rightmost interception of the two marks dynamically stable positive equilibrium (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g005" href="#pone.0220433.g005">Fig 5</a>) at which the harvest is exactly offset, such that fishers in the next year are able to benefit from stock exactly as large as in the prior year. For harvest years 2013 and 2078, such a point exists. However, for 2047 the harvest curve lies far above the growth curve. The only stable equilibrium in such a graph would be a biomass of zero. If this were the case for longer than a few periods, biomass would collapse in the deterministic case. Note that these are only singular, exemplary years. As a result of climate variability, the shown years cannot be taken as a reference for whole periods.

Consider first the black crosses that indicate the BAU case in which fuel subsidies are maintained. A downward trend in equilibrium biomass is recognizable under all four climate projections. The number of years in which fishing is unsustainable, marked with an equilibrium value of zero, also increases. Under ECE-o, few such years alternate with relatively favorable years and equilibrium biomass around 200 kt. For NESM-bc, after 2028, there are only very few sustainable years for the fishery. After about 2030, a dangerous period arises under NESM-o and ECE-bc, in which over-fishing and extinction are likely. This development ends only late in the time horizon, when the SST is too high throughout the year and the harvest decreases again. In the long term, unsustainable harvesting years prevail for NESM-o, NESM-bc, and ECE-bc.

Ensuring survival under ECE-bc and NESM-bc would prove very difficult in the medium term, when productivity is still relatively low and harvest pressure high, and even under the melt-down scenario, numerous unsustainable years arise.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The deterministic, average results are subject to additional pressure from climate variability. A particular consequence of variability is greater propensity to collapse. More variable climate conditions, such as under ECE-o and ECE-bc, may lead more often to situations in which stock survival is threatened. This depends particularly on the bio-economic equilibrium biomass around which the actual stock fluctuates driven by the variable climate. If this equilibrium stock size is large, it works as a strong buffer against climatically unfavorable years.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To analyze the systems’ sustainability, we compute the mean time of survival. This standard measure in population viability analysis evaluates stock persistence facing perturbations [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The colors indicate the underlying climate projection. The shapes indicate the fuel price scenario. The squares show how a fishery performs under different climate scenarios in the BAU case, in which fuel subsidies are maintained. As expected, variability under ECE-o is so high that the fishery underperforms. The fishery cannot reap the whole benefits of its favorable climate prediction. Short periods of high biomass alternate with long periods of slow replenishment. This dampens mean survival relative to the underlying high productivity. NESM-o becomes steadily more unsustainable in the medium term, leading to extinction around 2035. Under ECE-bc, this effect also plays a role, especially in the early years. Variability is high, which contributes to comparatively low sustainability even before 2030. During the early 2030s, the fishery is particularly vulnerable owing to its low productivity and high harvest pressure. During this time, variability in almost all runs eventually leads to extinction. Under NESM-o, mean survival is in line with the deterministic equilibrium. Variability is too low to have a substantial impact. Between NESM-o and ECE-o, variability is a game changer: NESM-o now outperforms ECE-o, even though the latter shows superior equilibrium sustainability. NESM-bc provides the least favorable climate prediction. Almost from the start, productivity is too low to counter the steadily increasing harvest pressure, and the species becomes extinct early on. Therefore, variability is of little relevance.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We can now also measure climate uncertainty, which we define as the spread in outcomes due to different climate projections. Between NESM-o and NESM-bc, climate uncertainty amounts to 4.5 years of mean survival times, that is, 26% of NESM-bc’s value. The two bias-corrected projections, which were specifically adapted for a better reproduction of the observed climate, are the two with the lowest mean survival time. This indicates that if a study relies only on original biased models, outcomes may be upward biased.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total sector benefits include the fishery’s role as a safety net, that is, income provision (producer surplus or “fisher surplus,” FS), and its direct contribution to food security (“consumer surplus,” CS). CS is the willingness to pay for fish above the monthly equilibrium price. For our downward-sloping demand curve with price on the y-axis and quantity demanded on the x-axis, CS is the area below the curve and above the horizontal line drawn at the equilibrium price (see Section J of the 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001" href="#pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</a>). Fishers earn rents because of their role in providing capital and labor to produce harvest. FS can be calculated by summing the areas below the equilibrium price and above the inverse supply curve for capital and labor, respectively. Adding up FS and CS yields a welfare measure for food security, which takes into account the availability of substitutes, and thus, changes in the fishers’ and consumers’ dependence on fresh 
   <span class="italic">Sardinella aurita</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To compare welfare across climate projections, we use the mean NPV. NPV is a standard economic measure that computes the sum of all future benefits in monetary units and weighs future benefits by a discount factor to capture the higher future value of money that is immediately available. In this study, we use the 2014-NPV of total rents generated in the fishery at an assumed discount rate of 3%. For the scenarios with reduced subsidy, we add the savings of tax revenue. We again compute means over 1000 runs.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculate an average FS of 8.77 billion FCFA in 2014 and an average CS of 5.47 billion FCFA. At a typical price of 1,145 FCFA for a 5-kg basket of local grains, this amounts to 946 baskets yearly for each of the roughly 8100 fishers involved, and 1.96 baskets per inhabitant of the coastal region studied (2.4 million, about 21% of the total Senegalese population). These baskets constitute an additional gain for the fishers (consumers) over the situation in which the resource would not be available to them and they would have to work in different sectors (consume different products). Using observed harvest and prices, we calculate a mean yearly total rent value of 14.97 billion FCFA for 2004–2013. This compares well with the summed benefits from 2014, namely, 14.24 billion FCFA. We conclude that our simulation produces plausible results.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g007" href="#pone.0220433.g007">Fig 7</a>, the mean NPV is indicated on the x-axis. Again, we first concentrate on the squares, that is, the BAU case. High variability under ECE-o also has a dampening effect on rents. First, this is a direct consequence of shorter survival times. Second, ECE-o’s survival year profile is right-tailed: extinction is most likely at the beginning of the time horizon, when harvest curves are flattest. The biomass usually becomes extinct early on, and the relatively high sustainability is the consequence of few runs with very long survival. Owing to discounting, the extra rents per occasional additional survival year contribute only a small amount to the NPV. In particular, the yield is lower than under NESM-o, which is less productive, but very stable. Yields are very low under ECE-bc and NESM-bc, that is, the two bias-corrected models. The low productivity in NESM-bc leads to lower potential NPV. Over-fishing and low sustainability in both ECE-bc and NESM-bc also translate to low expected rents.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the range of total rents as a metric, climate uncertainty amounts to 57 billion FCFA, which constitutes 24% of the lowest NPV of total rents. Fishers’ rent difference accounts for 64% of this gap. We conclude that the effect of climate uncertainty is moderate. This is a direct consequence of low sustainability: short survival times mean that differences in climate projections in the medium term rarely affect rents, because in most cases, the resource by then has gone extinct. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g008" href="#pone.0220433.g008">Fig 8</a> shows the distribution of benefits between fishers and consumers for the eight models considered. The effect on income security is larger than on food security. This results mostly because the model predicts that markets develop and consumers’ dependence on fresh 
   <span class="italic">Sardinella aurita</span> declines. In relative terms, consumers’ mean surplus share is highest under ECE-bc, but the difference across models is exceedingly small.

Comparing rents in 2014–2023 and 2034–2043, we observe changes between -97% and 52% under BAU. Mean losses lie at 27% when fuel subsidies continue. This result holds only because of the (small but positive) possibility of very large benefits under ECE-o. On average, the resource would have gone extinct by 2050 in all eight model-scenario combinations considered, such that the potential mean yield for 2054–2063 equals zero under all projections except ECE-o.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.5 Welfare impacts if fuel subsidies are abolished</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been argued in World Trade Organization (WTO) discussions that developing countries’ fisheries may need subsidies to help maintain food security and alleviate poverty [
   <a rid="pone.0220433.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref023">23</a>]. The argument is that fuel subsidies help to increase fishing effort by enabling the use of larger vessel, engines that are more powerful and by allowing fishers to travel larger distances to fishing grounds [
   <a rid="pone.0220433.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref024">24</a>]. The ensuing larger catches lead to lower prices for consumers. The first part corresponds well with our study: Our model predicts that fuel subsidies will lead to more fishing effort. However, once accounting for the dynamic impact of increased fishing pressure on biomass, we find that eliminating fuel subsidies would benefit both fishers and consumers. Higher fuel prices, all else equal, decrease harvest. This reduces over-fishing, such that the equilibrium stock level is higher and more stable. In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g007" href="#pone.0220433.g007">Fig 7</a>, the circles mark the melt-down subsidy reform case. This would be the outcome if fuel subsidies were gradually decreased and finally fully abolished in 2030. In the most extreme case, NESM-o, this increase reaches 5.4 years mean survival time increase or 62 billion NPV of total rents. It could increase the BAU value by 21%.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, not only are fuel subsidies expensive for taxpayers, they also reduce welfare in total. If fuel subsidies were abolished, climate change might on average even turn out to be slightly beneficial concerning undiscounted rents, that is, the sector’s current value yields (Section K of the 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001" href="#pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</a>). The subsidies may achieve redistribution of rents from fishers to consumers, but this effect is small and dearly bought with an overall lower consumer rent, as evident in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g008" href="#pone.0220433.g008">Fig 8</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="bold">Result 7</span>. 
   <span class="italic">If fuel subsidies were abolished</span>, 
   <span class="italic">the NPV of total rents would increase regardless of the climate projection</span>. 
   <span class="italic">Abolishing fuel subsidies would also largely maintain the current distribution of rents between consumers and fishers</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We quantify this effect to analyze intervention effectiveness. The beneficial effect of removing fuel subsidies is not equally large across climate projections: The rent difference between policy scenarios varies between 33 billion and 62 billion FCFA, that is, 12–21% of the BAU rent value. Intervention effectiveness depends not only on the cost share of fuel for fishers or the size of the intervention. More important is how climate influences the extinction risk. A low stock may result from a system with overall low productivity (e.g. NESM-bc), with SST-induced over-harvesting incentives or from variability, for example after a sequence of unfavorable upwelling years (e.g. ECE-o). If the stock is low, a small difference in catches due to abolished fuel subsidies can be decisive for whether the resource goes extinct or whether it continues to contribute to food security. The benefit of saving the resource from extinction is even larger if the period of unfavorable climate is only temporary and followed by a more favorable climate with a high equilibrium stock and large sustainable catch potential.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gains due to increased survival time are positive for all scenarios, but largest under NESM-o. Under NESM-o, the abolition of fuel subsidies suffices for the resource to survive for a substantially longer amount of time. For NESM-bc and ECE-bc, policy gains are positive but small, because the intervention is not strong enough for the stock to survive the projected increase in harvest pressure. Under ECE-o, the mean survival year profile becomes more right skewed than in the case with fuel subsidies. This means that the intervention can help to decrease the extinction risk in late years, while it is not sufficient to save the resource in early years (keep in mind that the system is partly stochastic). Due to discounting, these long-run gains have a relatively low weight. Therefore, rent gains per additional survival year are low.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Outcome uncertainty between the different climate projections is increased through fuel subsidy reform. Differences in climate models now translate into larger differences in ensuing rents, that is, up to 84 billion FCFA between the melt-down case under NESM-bc and NESM-o. The increase in uncertainty mostly stems from larger differences in survival times, and longer survival in general such that differences between the climate projections come into effect more and more.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main effect of climate change concerns the spatial stock distribution: biomass becomes more vulnerable to Senegalese purse seines over a certain time horizon, because the fish spend more time in the close-to-shore area. Abolishing fuel subsidies could buy time to bridge this transition period. The effectiveness of this measure depends on the climate development. It would be particularly effective under low variability and a weak SST trend, i.e. with a moderate extinction risk. If either variability or the SST trend proved too strong, this measure would be insufficient. A proper resource management system that goes beyond the mere abolition of subsidies, such as a binding limit on annual harvest, would be needed to ensure sustainability in the long term. Nonetheless, there is good news: productivity remains high under all projections except NESM-bc, such that rents and yields remain high if a proper management is installed. However, if the spatial stock redistribution effect crosses national boundaries, such a management would require multinational cooperation.</p>
