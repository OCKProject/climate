 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fish constitutes one of the most important natural resources with respect to food security, protein intake, and income generation. More than 20 kg of fish is consumed per capita per year, and in 2018, more than 40 million people earned their livelihoods in capture fisheries [

  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref002">2</a>]. The artisanal sector accounts for around 90% of this employment. Consumers are highly dependent on fish as a protein source [

  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref004">4</a>]. Artisanal fishing communities are particularly vulnerable to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref005">5</a>] and economic impacts may be severe [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref006">6</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref008">8</a>]. Upwelling-favorable winds are expected to increase in the north, decrease in the south [

  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref010">10</a>], and thus, change primary productivity. Cheung et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref007">7</a>] reported an increase in global mean water temperature at time of catch of 0.19°C per decade, due to fish stock redistribution. Artisanal fisheries suffer from a relatively small fishing range around their landing port, such that a redistribution of their target stock may impact their fishing success. For 14 northwest African countries, Lam et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref011">11</a>] projected an average climate change-induced decrease in landed fish of 25.9% between 2000 and 2050, associated with the loss of 50% of available jobs in the region’s fisheries. Other countries could benefit from enhanced catch potential [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Owing to the complexity and global nature of the research, studies rely on simplifying assumptions, such as constant per capita consumption and landings according to biological catch potential or economic growth [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref006">6</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref013">13</a>]. However, changes may be dampened or intensified when fishers and consumers adapt. In open-access artisanal fisheries, in which local market feedbacks are typically strong, such adaptation processes are important. For example, fishers may adapt by changing the used amounts of fuel, capital, and labor in fishing. As a result, over-fishing may increase or decrease with rising harvest potential. Non-linear changes in equilibrium harvest and fish prices arise. While this is scarcely analyzed in fisheries models [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref014">14</a>], Osborne et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref015">15</a>] explicitly modeled adaptation in a crop model, which turned negative impacts of climate change into positive crop yield gains. Apart from climate change, economic changes over time also shape future fish harvest and prices. Market development and urbanization change consumer dependence on fish [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref016">16</a>]. Fishing costs depend on the development of fuel (and thus, oil) prices, which alters the amount fished and the distance traveled by fishing boats [

  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref018">18</a>]. The importance of fuel for fishing has been underlined in the literature [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both climate projections and economic changes are important for policymakers to consider. Therefore, this study aims to simulate the impact of climatic changes on an artisanal open-access fishery under endogenous economic adaptation and (exogenous) economic development. High uncertainty exists with respect to climate change projections, particularly those concerning the amplitude of climate change and the extent of climate variability. Hence, for a robust understanding of climate change adaptation, it is necessary to compare how a fishery develops under different projections and to explore which climate scenario traits are important determinants.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We develop an empirical bio-economic model for the 
  <span class="italic">Sardinella aurita</span> fishery by artisanal purse seines in Senegal, which takes into account climate effects on reproduction of the fish stock, productivity of harvesting and feedbacks on local input and output markets. Climate has a dynamic effect on yearly stock growth through changes in upwelling intensity, but also an effect on catchability, and thus, fishing pressure through fish stock distribution. We simulate the development of biomass, harvest, and prices and we compare outcomes concerning the fishery’s contribution to food and income security. To explore mitigation options, we suggest an easily implementable and overall welfare-increasing intervention: reduction of fuel subsidies. The price for fossil fuels shapes the adaptation process in fisheries. Fuel subsidies constitute one of the most widely used policy instruments: Sumaila et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref022">22</a>] estimate that an annual 7.7 billion US Dollars of fuel subsidies are paid to fisheries globally. It has been argued that fisheries that are relevant for food security may need fuel subsidies to help maintain high effort, high catches and low fish prices for consumers [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref023">23</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref024">24</a>]. By contrast, several authors have found a detrimental dynamic impact on fish stocks [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref025">25</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref026">26</a>]. Fishing fleets benefit from a subsidy decrease if the stock effect is large enough [
  <a rid="pone.0220433.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0220433.ref027">27</a>]. Against this background, we evaluate how climate change outcomes for a fishery could be shaped if fuel subsidies were abolished. Our results are informative for policymakers, as the findings shed light on the effect of expected climate change impacts and mitigation options while considering endogenous adaptation of actors. In summary, the study aims and achieves to investigate how a fishery may be impacted by climate change when both economic adaptation and development is considered, and continues to explore counteracting policy measures.
