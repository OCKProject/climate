            <span><a>3</a></span> showing the existence of wet conditions (thick solid lines), semi-arid conditions
            (thin solid) or arid conditions (dashed). The individual reconstructions are colored
            by region: Central Sahara (Blue), Eastern Sahara (Red), the Atlas &amp; Hoggar Mountains
            (Orange). The records discussed in the text are Lake Yoa

            records shown in order of their wet/dry transition, and the total number of wet/dry
            transitions is shown for each 500â€‰year period.
