         <p>The relationship between sapropel formation and orbital precession using two sapropel
            chronologies. Precessional curves associated with sapropel formation are aligned to
            the start of each occurrence according to the respective chronology. The coloured
            segments of these curves indicate the actual duration of the sapropel. The red horizontal
            line indicates the precession at the termination of the most recent sapropel.
