      <p>Climate deterioration towards desertification in North Africa following the African
         Humid Period has previously been associated with the emergence of pastoralism. Here,
         using a climate-vegetation model, the authors show that pastoralism in fact likely
         slowed the deterioration of orbitally-driven climate change.
