      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Proxy records of northern African palaeoclimate are derived from a variety of sources.
         These range from lake-level, dust deposition, pollen and geochemical records. The
         data used in Figs. 
         <a>2a</a>, 
         <a>5a</a> are derived from the database compiled and interpreted by Shanahan et al.
         <span><a>3</a></span>. For every 500 year interval, the climate state has been subjectively determined
         <span><a>3</a></span> as either wet, moderate or dry (Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>). As with the sensitivity metric (Eq. 
         <a>7</a>), we date the collapse as the first time in which humid conditions are not present
         (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). This compilation of proxy records may provide a geographically and typographically
         biased sample, but is not clear what alternate approaches are availabel to estimate
         an end-date for the green Sahara in a probabilistic fashion.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative population levels (Figs. 
         <a>2b</a>, 
         <a>5b</a>) are a summed probability distribution analysis based on a comprehensive review of
         the abundance of carbon-14 dated archaeological sites across northern Africa
         <span><a>22</a></span>. The underlying principle of this method assumes a monotonic relationship between
         the amount of data and the amount of human presence, which is reliant on the law of
         large numbers to overcome small-scale temporal and spatial biases. Full details on
         the methods are described in Shennan et al.
         <span><a>52</a></span>, whilst criticisms
         <span><a>53</a>,
            <a>54</a></span>, and subsequent defense
         <span><a>55</a>,
            <a>56</a></span> of the method have been presented in several publications. The population estimates
         used in the present analysis
         <span><a>22</a></span> were created from a dataset comprising 3287 radiocarbon dates from 1011 “Neolithic”
         sites. Radiocarbon dates from state level social contexts such as Pharaonic or later
         Garamantian sites were not included in that analysis. The population estimates can
         only provide relative time series and the size of populations cannot be compared between
         the regions shown in Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>. To date, these are the only explicit reconstructions of Holocene demographic trends
         on a trans-Saharan scale, although similar curves have been produced for the western
         desert in Egypt
         <span><a>45</a></span>. Furthermore, it is this curve which Wright suggests corresponds with “the variable
         tempo and intensity of the termination of the AHP” and “local transitions to shrubland
         environments and accelerated rates of soil erosion”
         <span><a>2</a></span>. We exclude African palaeoclimate reconstructions south of 13.42°N from our analysis,
         as this is the most southerly archaeological site used to reconstruct the population
         estimates
         <span><a>22</a></span>.
