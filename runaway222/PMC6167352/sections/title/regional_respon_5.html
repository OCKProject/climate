      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The division of the entire Saharan population into broad regional sets (Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>) allows a preliminary look at spatial variation in the timing of population change.
         The population curves for the Eastern Sahara, the Atlas &amp; Hoggar and Central Sahara
         start broadly synchronous; showing a rapid population increase after the onset of
         humid conditions c. 10.5 ka and during the millennial-long population decline between
         7.5 and 6.5 ka (Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>). At the end of the AHP, however, we observe divergence in the regional demographic
         response. The eastern Sahara, which is today extremely arid, appears to have undergone
         a rapid population decline, as occupation shifted towards the Nile Valley. It has
         even been suggested that this subsequently gave rise to the Pharanoic civilisation
         <span><a>45</a></span>. To the north and west, in the Atlas &amp; Hoggar mountain region, population decline
         appears to have been equally rapid (c. 900 years, Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>). The central Sahara, on the other hand, saw a much more gradual decline in population
         levels that never reached the pre-Holocene population low (Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>). The fact that societies practicing pastoralism persisted in this region for so
         long, and invested both economically and ideologically in the local landscape, does
         not support a scenario of over-exploitation (see Methods). Additionally, the ethnographic
         record demonstrates how the flexibility inherent in traditional African pastoralist
         strategies enables them to make the most efficient use of patchy and fragile environments
         <span><a>4</a>,
            <a>5</a>,
            <a>37</a></span>. It is therefore likely that the origins of such strategies co-evolved with the drying
         environment in a way that enabled humans to live in an adaptive balance with available
         pasture.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The implication that Holocene populations persisted for longer in some parts of the
         Sahara either suggests a spatial variation in the rate of aridification or vegetation
         change, or more intriguingly in the human adaptive strategies. Differential topography
         across the Sahara is certainly worth considering. Mountains such as the Tibesti, Tassili-n-Ajjer
         and Ahaggar form a major topographic feature spanning more than 2500 km from southern
         Algeria to northern Chad. These mountains would have acted as important water towers
         in contrast to the surrounding plains, providing populations living on the windward
         side with more persistent rain runoff during periods of increasing aridity. Some of
         the earliest direct evidence for the exploitation of domestic livestock
         <span><a>46</a></span>, use of milk products
         <span><a>47</a></span>, and the construction of cattle tumuli
         <span><a>46</a>,
            <a>48</a></span>, come from the heart of the central Sahara. On the Messak plateau, for example, extensive
         evidence for rock art depicting livestock scenes and stone monuments with associated
         domestic animal remains dating to the middle Holocene attest to a highly formalized
         expression of a wider Saharan “cattle cult”
         <span><a>46</a>,
            <a>48</a></span>. Isotopic analysis of archaeological animal bones from this region also demonstrate
         seasonal transhumance
         <span><a>48</a></span>, reminiscent of the strategies used by modern traditional pastoralists to ensure
         the maintenance of healthy pasture.
