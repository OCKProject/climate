      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The possibility that humans could have had a stabilising influence on the environment
         has significant implications. Naturally there are consequences for our understanding
         of past climate changes. For example, there is a long-standing discrepancy between
         observed climate of 6 ka for northern Africa and simulations by global climate models
         <span><a>33</a></span>, which currently include no pastoralism. Also the “early Anthropocene” hypothesis
         <span><a>49</a></span> identifies a human-caused perturbation in the carbon cycle around the time of the
         aridification of northern Africa. It is doubtful that the anthropogenic delay suggested
         by the model results above could perturb the global carbon cycle. The carbon stored
         in northern Africa vegetation would have been relatively insignificant. One would
         need to invoke speculative, remote impacts on both tropical wetland methane emissions
         and the carbon sequestration in rainforest peatlands
         <span><a>50</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More broadly, this work presents a positive message about sustainability and climate
         adaptation. We contest the common narrative that past human–environment interactions
         must always be one of over-exploitation and degradation
         <span><a>51</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>1a</a>). This study shows that increasing human population combined with an intensification
         of pastoralism did not accelerate aridification, and may even have delayed the collapse
         of the green Sahara (Fig. 
         <a>1b</a>). This finding provides yet more evidence for the sustainability of pastoralism
         <span><a>4</a></span>. It suggests that traditional, indigenous practices were developed as an adaptation
         to Holocene climate change in northern Africa. Promoting and enhancing sustainable
         pastoralism could be a vital adaptation to our current climate challenge.
