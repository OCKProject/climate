      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Typically, traditional subsistence pastoralism has been seen as agents of environmental
         degradation through overgrazing, habitat change and resource competition with wildlife.
         This view (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>a) was embedded in the environmental doctrine of the twentieth century, partly as
         a consequence of the historical relationship between colonial administrators and traditional
         pastoralists
         <span><a>1</a></span>. This doctrine has led to a recent suggestion that early pastoralism was so unsustainable
         that it triggered a climatic deterioration in the Sahara around 5500 years ago
         <span><a>2</a></span> (at the end of the African Humid Period
         <span><a>3</a></span>). This has significant implications for the way in which modern populations living
         in marginal environments are perceived, and particularly how modern pastoralism is
         recognised within local and regional ecological and economic policies. This suggestion
         goes against research demonstrating the sustainability of pastoralism
         <span><a>4</a>–
            <a>6</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points and threshold behaviours are an emotive topic when talking about future
         climate change
         <span><a>7</a></span>. A common example is the African Humid Period (AHP) lasting from 14,700 years ago
         <span><a>8</a></span> to around 5500 years ago
         <span><a>3</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>), colloquially termed the “green Sahara”. With the onset of favourable orbital conditions
         around 14.7 ka summer rains penetrated much further into northern Africa
         <span><a>8</a></span>. As a result, humid conditions were established initially at lower latitudes, and
         progressively later at more northern latitudes
         <span><a>3</a>,
            <a>9</a>,
            <a>10</a></span>. Pollen reconstructions
         <span><a>11</a></span> indicate a mix of tropical elements reaching up to 20° N, and Sudanian woodland and
         Sahelian grasslands extending at least as far as 28° N. These changes supported numerous
         Sahelian and aquatic animals, such as elephant, crocodile and fish
         <span><a>12</a></span>. Yet, debate is on-going over the rate of climatic deterioration at the end of the
         humid period. Both sediment flux records from deep sea cores off the coast of north-west
         Africa
         <span><a>13</a>–
            <a>15</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>) and Δ
         <span>D</span><sub>wax</sub> isotopic values from east and northeast Africa
         <span><a>9</a>,
            <a>16</a></span> point to a rapid shift 5500 years ago. Pollen and sedimentological records from Lake
         Yoa in northern Chad, however, indicate a more gradual deterioration of the regional
         ecosystem
         <span><a>17</a>,
            <a>18</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>). This discrepancy is partly a consequence of differential sensitivity of the various
         proxies
         <span><a>16</a>,
            <a>18</a></span>, but also because the changes in regional hydroclimates were modified by vegetation
         feedbacks
         <span><a>19</a></span> and local groundwater conditions
         <span><a>10</a></span>. A coherent spatial picture of the end of the AHP is emerging, as demonstrated in
         a recent synthesis of hydrological reconstructions
         <span><a>3</a></span>, revealing a time transgressive termination of humid conditions from north to south
         (Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human occupation during the humid period is clearly demonstrated in numerous rock
         engravings and occupation sites, bearing evidence for the development of food production
         strategies and increasing socio-economic complexity
         <span><a>20</a>,
            <a>21</a></span>. Knowledge about spread and intensity of that human occupation is harder to acquire,
         yet enough exists to create a demographic reconstruction
         <span><a>22</a></span> (see Methods). Several major phases of population expansion and contraction can be
         identified in the Holocene Sahara from archaeological evidence. Hunter-Gatherer-Fisherfolk
         <span><a>21</a></span> initially colonised all regions around 10.5 ka with population levels peaking between
         8 and 7.5 ka (Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>). Over the following millennium, northern Africa underwent a population decline,
         driven by a millennium-long dry event at 8 ka
         <span><a>9</a>,
            <a>16</a></span>. After 7 ka, domestic cattle, sheep and goat spread throughout northern Africa. This
         widespread adoption of (at least some) pastoralist strategies is followed by a second
         population boom (Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>). The second pulse of northern African human occupancy lasted until 5.5 ka, at which
         point the Sahara underwent a major population collapse, coinciding with the decline
         in favourable climatic conditions (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). But was this climate–human interaction one way—or was the collapse of the green
         Sahara an early example of humans interfering with a sensitive environmental system?
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We submit the suggestion that Humans were the catalyst of the collapse of the green
         Sahara
         <span><a>2</a></span> to a rigorous quantitative assessment. We first investigate whether the termination
         of the African Humid Period occurred early than expected, both through analysis of
         observations and using a model. We then examine the nature of early African pastoralism
         and its interactions with landscape. We conclude that the increased adoption of pastoralism
         provided a successful adaptation to the desertification caused by climate change.
