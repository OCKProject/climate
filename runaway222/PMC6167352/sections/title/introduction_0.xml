 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Typically, traditional subsistence pastoralism has been seen as agents of environmental degradation through overgrazing, habitat change and resource competition with wildlife. This view (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>a) was embedded in the environmental doctrine of the twentieth century, partly as a consequence of the historical relationship between colonial administrators and traditional pastoralists
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. This doctrine has led to a recent suggestion that early pastoralism was so unsustainable that it triggered a climatic deterioration in the Sahara around 5500 years ago
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> (at the end of the African Humid Period
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>). This has significant implications for the way in which modern populations living in marginal environments are perceived, and particularly how modern pastoralism is recognised within local and regional ecological and economic policies. This suggestion goes against research demonstrating the sustainability of pastoralism

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points and threshold behaviours are an emotive topic when talking about future climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. A common example is the African Humid Period (AHP) lasting from 14,700 years ago
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> to around 5500 years ago
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>), colloquially termed the “green Sahara”. With the onset of favourable orbital conditions around 14.7 ka summer rains penetrated much further into northern Africa
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. As a result, humid conditions were established initially at lower latitudes, and progressively later at more northern latitudes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Pollen reconstructions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span> indicate a mix of tropical elements reaching up to 20° N, and Sudanian woodland and Sahelian grasslands extending at least as far as 28° N. These changes supported numerous Sahelian and aquatic animals, such as elephant, crocodile and fish
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Yet, debate is on-going over the rate of climatic deterioration at the end of the humid period. Both sediment flux records from deep sea cores off the coast of north-west Africa

  <span class="sup">

  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). This discrepancy is partly a consequence of differential sensitivity of the various proxies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>, but also because the changes in regional hydroclimates were modified by vegetation feedbacks
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> and local groundwater conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. A coherent spatial picture of the end of the AHP is emerging, as demonstrated in a recent synthesis of hydrological reconstructions

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human occupation during the humid period is clearly demonstrated in numerous rock engravings and occupation sites, bearing evidence for the development of food production strategies and increasing socio-economic complexity

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> (see Methods). Several major phases of population expansion and contraction can be identified in the Holocene Sahara from archaeological evidence. Hunter-Gatherer-Fisherfolk
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span> initially colonised all regions around 10.5 ka with population levels peaking between 8 and 7.5 ka (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). Over the following millennium, northern Africa underwent a population decline, driven by a millennium-long dry event at 8 ka
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. After 7 ka, domestic cattle, sheep and goat spread throughout northern Africa. This widespread adoption of (at least some) pastoralist strategies is followed by a second population boom (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). The second pulse of northern African human occupancy lasted until 5.5 ka, at which point the Sahara underwent a major population collapse, coinciding with the decline in favourable climatic conditions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). But was this climate–human interaction one way—or was the collapse of the green Sahara an early example of humans interfering with a sensitive environmental system?

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We submit the suggestion that Humans were the catalyst of the collapse of the green Sahara
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> to a rigorous quantitative assessment. We first investigate whether the termination of the African Humid Period occurred early than expected, both through analysis of observations and using a model. We then examine the nature of early African pastoralism and its interactions with landscape. We conclude that the increased adoption of pastoralism provided a successful adaptation to the desertification caused by climate change.
