      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before considering human agents in the context of climatic change, it is first necessary
         to determine the length of the Holocene AHP assuming no anthropogenic influence. Observations
         alone do not provide sufficient constraint on this, because of insufficiently accurate
         relevant chronologies. Mediterranean sapropel deposition is used as an indicator of
         humid conditions in northern Africa
         <span><a>23</a></span>, because they have some of the most accurate chronologies. Over the past 250,000
         years, it is possible to tune a chronology using well-dated speleothems to provide
         well-constrained estimates of the onset and termination of sapropels
         <span><a>24</a></span>. This chronology suggests that the most recent sapropel was of much shorter duration
         than previous instances (Fig. 
         <a>3a</a>); yet it only includes one other interglacial sapropel (at 129.5 ka). However longer
         records
         <span><a>25</a></span> that allow selection of similar orbital configurations
         <span><a>26</a></span> cannot detect differences at the sub-millennial timescales required (Fig. 
         <a>3b</a>). A concerted effort would be required to develop a sufficiently accurate chronology
         to advance in this direction.

                  chronologies. Precessional curves associated with sapropel formation are aligned to
                  the start of each occurrence according to the respective chronology. The coloured
                  segments of these curves indicate the actual duration of the sapropel. The red horizontal
                  line indicates the precession at the termination of the most recent sapropel.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We develop an idealised model that calculates rainfall and vegetative cover and their
         feedbacks (see Methods) to estimate the natural length of the Holocene AHP instead.
         Compared to previous models
         <span><a>27</a>,
            <a>28</a></span>, rainfall responds to imposed orbital precession
         <span><a>29</a></span> and past greenhouse gas levels as measured in ice cores
         <span><a>30</a></span> (which acts as a proxy for glacial-interglacial changes as well as a local, direct
         forcing). The model is run over the past two glacial cycles (230–20 ka) using a large
         ensemble of parameter settings selected at random. Parameter settings that do not
         exhibit six green episodes during this period are discounted for being inconsistent
         with the observations. The remaining ensemble members are integrated forward to the
         present-day (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). We find late Pleistocene behaviour alone was not sufficient to rule out the continuation
         of the humid period throughout the Holocene at the 5% significance level (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). This failure to accurately predict the passing of a known tipping point—despite
         having 200,000 years of observations—should add a cautionary note to the discussion
         surrounding future climate thresholds.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A sensitivity metric is devised for the model (see Methods) to summarise its behaviour
         and estimate start and end dates for the humid periods. We predict a well-defined
         start of the Holocene AHP (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1</a>), which corresponds closely with the observed date of 14.5 ka
         <span><a>9</a>,
            <a>10</a></span>, supporting the validity of this modelling approach. The model shows several peaks
         during the Holocene when northern Africa would have been particularly sensitive to
         a perturbation (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The largest peak in the modelled sensitivity of the Sahara occurs at 7–6 ka (Fig. 
         <a>5c</a>). This coincides with the second period of population increase between 6.7 and 6.3 ka
         (Fig. 
         <a>5b</a>). The dominant collapse observed for the Holocene AHP (Fig. 
         <a>5a</a>) occurs 500–1000 years after this peak (Fig. 
         <a>5c</a>), which appears to be a robust model result (see Methods, Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). This refutes the hypothesis that pastoralists were “active agents in landscape
         denudation” and accelerated the termination of the Holocene AHP
         <span><a>2</a></span>. Rather it suggests that pastoralism may have actively delayed the region’s environmental
         deterioration (Fig. 
         <a>1b</a>).
