 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The possibility that humans could have had a stabilising influence on the environment has significant implications. Naturally there are consequences for our understanding of past climate changes. For example, there is a long-standing discrepancy between observed climate of 6 ka for northern Africa and simulations by global climate models
  <span class="sup">

  </span>, which currently include no pastoralism. Also the “early Anthropocene” hypothesis
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span> identifies a human-caused perturbation in the carbon cycle around the time of the aridification of northern Africa. It is doubtful that the anthropogenic delay suggested by the model results above could perturb the global carbon cycle. The carbon stored in northern Africa vegetation would have been relatively insignificant. One would need to invoke speculative, remote impacts on both tropical wetland methane emissions and the carbon sequestration in rainforest peatlands

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More broadly, this work presents a positive message about sustainability and climate adaptation. We contest the common narrative that past human–environment interactions must always be one of over-exploitation and degradation

  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). This study shows that increasing human population combined with an intensification of pastoralism did not accelerate aridification, and may even have delayed the collapse of the green Sahara (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). This finding provides yet more evidence for the sustainability of pastoralism
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. It suggests that traditional, indigenous practices were developed as an adaptation to Holocene climate change in northern Africa. Promoting and enhancing sustainable pastoralism could be a vital adaptation to our current climate challenge.
