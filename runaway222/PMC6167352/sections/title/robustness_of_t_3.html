      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The synthesis of observed records
         <span><a>3</a></span> classifies the hydroclimate state only at 500 year intervals. This choice of interval
         was motivated by all the chronologies being sufficiently precise to resolve it
         <span><a>3</a></span>. The model inputs are orbital parameters
         <span><a>29</a></span> and carbon dioxide concentrations
         <span><a>30</a></span>, both of which have dating uncertainties substantially less than 500 years. Dating
         of prior humid periods is subject to errors on the order of millennia (hence the failure
         to constrain the AHP dates observationally). Because of this issue, the valid model
         parameter settings are determined by matching solely the number of prior instances
         rather than their timing (see Methods). We consider the possibility that either a
         humid period was overlooked or that a sapropel has been laid down without a humid
         period during the past 230 kyrs to be minimal. The uncertainty contained within the
         structure of the idealised model, rather than its parameters, is impossible to quantify.
         To explore the parameter uncertainty in the model output, the whole experiment is
         replicated a further twenty times with different random parameter settings. There
         is little variation in the temporal structure (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). In summary, the limiting factor for the precision appears to be the temporal resolution
         of the compiled observations
         <span><a>3</a></span>, though the delay appears visible despite that (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The largest issues affecting the results of the idealised model are therefore associated
         with its applicability to the problem. There is a rich heritage of using idealised
         models to study the greening of the Sahara
         <span><a>27</a>,
            <a>28</a>,
            <a>31</a></span>, so the application here is not without precedent. The model appears to adequately
         capture the past behaviour under certain parameter settings. We cannot exclude the
         possibility that including other natural forcing factors may be beneficial. An alternate
         approach would use coupled general circulation models (GCMs). These GCMs are now used
         operationally for decadal climate predictions
         <span><a>32</a></span>. Unfortunately, the resources needed for the multi-millennia ensembles that would
         be required by this research preclude their application. Additionally, GCMs have been
         shown to have longstanding biases in simulating the greening of the Sahara
         <span><a>33</a></span>, likely arising from them poor capturing of vegetation and dust feedbacks
         <span><a>34</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model ensemble is treated above as multiple plausible instances of a single physical
         system. The sensitivity is therefore interpreted as a single metric for all three
         regions shown in Fig. 
         <a>2</a>. An alternate interpretation is that the ensemble members represent different local
         conditions, implying that the three sensitivity peaks in Fig. 
         <a>5c</a> each characterise a particular region. However, there is no noticeable regional pattern
         in the reconstructed collapse dates (Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>), although more southerly locations in the compilation do show a later response
         <span><a>3</a></span>. However, the majority of observational records showing a collapse between 6 and
         5 ka
         <span><a>3</a></span> occur at similar latitudes to the archaeological sites used to estimate the human
         occupancy
         <span><a>22</a></span>. Therefore the comparison of the sensitivity metric to the palaeoclimate and population
         reconstructions combined across northern Africa seems appropriate (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>).
