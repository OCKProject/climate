   <sub>2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees relative to non-fixing trees for a range of relative abundances of ecosystems containing obligate N-fixing trees and ecosystems containing facultative N-fixing trees under a range of N deposition rates. Global forest composition ranges from the scenario in which all N-fixing trees are facultative to the scenario in which all N-fixing trees are obligate, i.e. the relative abundances of ecosystems containing obligate N-fixing trees and ecosystems containing facultative N-fixing trees range from 0 to 100% and 100 to 0% respectively. Red represents a warming effect and blue represents a cooling effect relative to non-fixing trees. Global N deposition rate ranges from the minimum recent N deposition rate derived from Vet et al.
