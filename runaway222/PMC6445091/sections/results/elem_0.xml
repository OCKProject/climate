   <sub>2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees at the ecosystem scale
  </div>
  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model suggests that N-fixing trees can either mitigate climate change relative to non-fixing trees (a negative net CO
   <sub>2</sub>–N
   <sub>2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees relative to non-fixing trees) or exacerbate climate change relative to non-fixing trees (a positive net CO
   <sub>2</sub>–N
   <sub>2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees relative to non-fixing trees). The main controls that determine this balance are N fixation strategy and N deposition rate (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> displays results for tropical forests and Supplementary Figures 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> display results for temperate and boreal forests respectively; because patterns are analogous between tropical, temperate, and boreal forests we hereafter focus on tropical forests). For N-fixing trees that exacerbate climate change relative to non-fixing trees, soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions do not necessarily offset the absolute level of CO
   <sub>2</sub> sequestration (see Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a> for the absolute net CO
   <sub>2</sub>–N
   <sub>2</sub>O effects of ecosystems with and without N-fixing trees). Rather, the offset of CO
   <sub>2</sub> sequestration by soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions for ecosystems with N-fixing trees is greater than the offset of CO
   <sub>2</sub> sequestration by soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions for ecosystems without N-fixing trees. Similarly, for N-fixing trees that mitigate climate change relative to non-fixing trees, the offset of CO
   <sub>2</sub> sequestration by soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions for ecosystems with N-fixing trees is lower than the offset of CO
   <sub>2</sub> sequestration by soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions for ecosystems without N-fixing trees. Generally, under low N deposition rates, N-fixing trees promote CO
   <sub>2</sub> sequestration but only minimal soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions relative to non-fixing trees (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), whereas under high N deposition rates, N-fixing trees stimulate soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions but only minimal CO
   <sub>2</sub> sequestration relative to non-fixing trees (Fig.

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). Over succession, obligate and incomplete regulator N-fixers promote greater N supply to the ecosystem via sustained N fixation than facultative N-fixers (indicated by the vertical lines in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b, c</a>). Under low N deposition, N supplied via N fixation by obligate and incomplete regulator N-fixing trees facilitates non-fixing trees in meeting their N demand, amplifying ecosystem-scale CO

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increased N supply to the ecosystem via elevated N deposition induces N-fixing trees to downregulate N fixation to the greatest extent possible (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>): facultative N-fixers completely downregulate N fixation and incomplete regulator N-fixers partially downregulate N fixation, whereas obligate N-fixers do not downregulate N fixation. Because facultative N-fixing trees completely downregulate N fixation (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>), they have a negligible net CO

   <sub>2</sub>O effect relative to non-fixing trees under high N deposition rates (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>). Under high N deposition rates, N demand is satisfied by N deposition. As such, N fixed by obligate and incomplete regulator N-fixing trees due to sustained N fixation does not contribute to CO
   <sub>2</sub> sequestration (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). Rather, it contributes to soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions, which increase indefinitely with increasing N fixation (Fig.
