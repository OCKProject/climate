 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data fusion is necessary to understand the complex processes of vector-borne diseases. Fusing heterogeneous data provides a way to link the data model, the process model for the disease dynamics (including transmission rates), and R
  <sub>0</sub>, as well as account for varying levels of spatial resolution [
  <a rid="B178-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B178-vetsci-06-00040">178</a>]. Each of these components has been well-established but have not been integrated together in a disease model. Additionally, it can be a challenge to fuse data with a mechanistic understanding [
  <a rid="B179-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B179-vetsci-06-00040">179</a>,
  <a rid="B180-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B180-vetsci-06-00040">180</a>,
  <a rid="B181-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B181-vetsci-06-00040">181</a>]. Due to the complexity of modeling in both the process and the data, researchers generally focus on either a model-based (mathematical) or data-based (statistical) approach to understand predictions of ecological dynamics [
  <a rid="B182-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B182-vetsci-06-00040">182</a>]. However, both the data and the mechanistic process underlying the physical process are often of interest in disease modeling. Therefore, it is not enough to fit a statistical model to observations or only use a model-based approach that ignores the data [
  <a rid="B123-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B123-vetsci-06-00040">123</a>]. There are several statistical challenges associated with disease modeling, including modeling and estimating coupled systems, dealing with unobserved variables, and modeling the spatial-temporal dynamics [
  <a rid="B183-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B183-vetsci-06-00040">183</a>]. Statistical inference for time-series models with incomplete data and for process models can be particularly challenging as they may be computationally expensive and oftentimes intractable. Stochastic models, on the other hand, add flexibility to the model to fit real data. This provides a framework where parameters can be identified even when they can be unidentifiable in a deterministic setting. It focuses on the distribution associated with the characteristic of a process. However, it does not incorporate all sources of data from climate, water sources, and transmission.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A particular challenge present in vector-borne disease modeling is that the underlying phenomena are generally difficult or impossible to directly measure. In an ideal situation, knowledge of mosquito population distributions through time, broken up by species and then coupled with human population distributions through time, would be used to derive risk maps. This knowledge could directly inform a mechanistic or statistical model to provide high-fidelity forecasts. However, mosquito population distributions are difficult to capture. Ball et al. [
  <a rid="B184-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B184-vetsci-06-00040">184</a>] are developing an autonomous sensor that uses passive sugar baiting to lure mosquitoes in order to test their saliva for the presence of mosquito-borne viral pathogens [
  <a rid="B184-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B184-vetsci-06-00040">184</a>], but these sensors are still in their infancy, and deployment at the scale of a large city, state, or country is not yet possible. As a result, no large-scale mosquito population distribution data through time exist. This gap, along with complications coming from the structure of modern disease surveillance systems, has resulted in a revolution in the disease modeling literature in which 
  <span class="italic">proxy datasets</span> are used to fill in the disparity in our knowledge. Such datasets indirectly relate to the phenomenon at hand. For example, internet data (e.g., [
  <a rid="B185-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B185-vetsci-06-00040">185</a>,
  <a rid="B186-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B186-vetsci-06-00040">186</a>,
  <a rid="B187-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B187-vetsci-06-00040">187</a>,
  <a rid="B188-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B188-vetsci-06-00040">188</a>]) have been used to complete the gaps in our public health data; searches for specific disease-related keywords such as cough or fever, for instance, tend to highly correlate with actual disease incidence. Using knowledge of the mosquito lifecycle (i.e., that mosquitoes require certain temperature and precipitation conditions for breeding), proxy datasets such as weather, demographics, satellite imagery, and other related datasets can be used to provide additional insight into mosquito locations. The underlying hypothesis to these data fusion approaches is that, while no individual proxy dataset will provide enough information to accurately forecast disease incidence, the fusion of 
  <span class="italic">multiple weak indicators</span> derived from disparate data streams will provide a more complete picture.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once this approach is considered, however, the complexity of the data fusion problem greatly increases; it may not be intuitive, for example, how internet data coming from Wikipedia and spectral signals coming from satellite imagery could be fused. Furthermore, they will relate to disease incidence on different timescales, e.g., healthy vegetation in satellite imagery (as a proxy for standing water) will be a multi-week leading indicator [
  <a rid="B189-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B189-vetsci-06-00040">189</a>], whereas Wikipedia access logs will be closer to a real-time indicator. Another factor is that each data source has the potential to have large measurement errors, but because the data types include hard (e.g., physics-based phenomenologies) and soft (e.g., text) data sources, the mechanics of these errors are highly variable. Because each of the disparate data streams is important for forecasting and understanding disease dynamics, it is equally as important to appropriately account for leading/lagging indicators, error propagation, etc., when building the fusion models. The conditional model, for instance, is flexible as it accounts for the uncertainty in the data based upon prior knowledge of the data parameters and characterizes the relationships in the data and the inherent latent structure. The process model spatial and temporal rate variations are incorporated directly as an additional layer in the hierarchical model.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An added complexity of data fusion is that the sources for climate and mosquito data are generally inherently on different spatial and/or temporal scales, e.g., fine-scale data as in mosquito habitats, and coarse gridded data as in climate data. Oftentimes, the sources of data are spatially misaligned, meaning the data are on different grids. To account for the misalignments, a spatial interpolation method, such as kriging, can be used [
  <a rid="B190-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B190-vetsci-06-00040">190</a>]. Additionally, if the data layers are nested or data layers overlap (non-nested), spatial modeling approaches exist to account for the misalignment in the spatial grids [
  <a rid="B191-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B191-vetsci-06-00040">191</a>]. A hierarchical or multilevel model structure accommodates different spatial aggregations, as well as allowing for shared characteristics among the groups [
  <a rid="B192-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B192-vetsci-06-00040">192</a>,
  <a rid="B193-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B193-vetsci-06-00040">193</a>]. A conditional modeling framework, i.e., a Bayesian or maximum likelihood approach, can combine multiple processes and datasets in an analysis [
  <a rid="B194-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B194-vetsci-06-00040">194</a>]. The conditional model provides a way to pool data from multiple sources and weight them based upon the content of the information.
