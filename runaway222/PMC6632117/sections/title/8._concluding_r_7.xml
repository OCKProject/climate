 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">8. Concluding Remarks: What is Needed Now and in the Future for Forecasting the Impacts of Climate Change on Infectious Diseases</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rapid and large-scale environmental change is occurring globally, which is already leading to dramatic changes in animal, insect, and plant populations. While some wildlife species are able to adapt and others are not, infectious pathogens and their vectors will respond and take advantage of favorable situations. Additionally, as human populations move and expand, agricultural animals will continue to replace wildlife, and new hosts and vectors will move with these migrations and expansions. Coupling cutting-edge and validated climate models with scalable epidemiological models and ground-truth, real-time data will allow the models to be validated with statistical and sensitivity analyses in order to test hypotheses and predictions of future infectious disease conditions.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A focus on the potential impacts of climate change on natural, animal, and human systems will allow for better predictions and mitigations for how these impacts will influence zoonotic infectious diseases in animals and humans. While modeling has its limitations, especially when coupling large-scale systems models, the alternative includes guesses or waiting until infectious pathogens cross into new regions. Mitigations may include animal vaccination strategies that will take time to develop, including the time it takes to stockpile vaccines in areas where they are needed most. Having more knowledge of future vaccine requirements and the impact of animal trade and movement will ensure the best use of limited resources to reduce the threat of infectious diseases globally.</p>
