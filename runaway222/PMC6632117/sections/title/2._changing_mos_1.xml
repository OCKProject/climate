 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mosquito responses to environmental conditions are variable and often stray from predictions from models that take into account climate to determine future distributions. For example, when 
  <span class="italic">Ae. albopictus</span> invaded new continents (e.g., South America), it resulted in niche shifts, which may be due to adaptive genetic changes or result from founder effects [
  <a rid="B63-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-vetsci-06-00040">63</a>]. The ability to shift niches upon invading new areas may be one reason why 
  <span class="italic">Ae. albopictus</span> is so widespread. Additionally, several species have been shown to become more tolerant to saline and brackish waters. These species include 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles sundaicus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">An. culicifacies</span>, 
  <span class="italic">An. stephensi</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Ae. Albopictus</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Culex sitiens</span> [
  <a rid="B89-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89-vetsci-06-00040">89</a>]. Salinity tolerance may be important to consider in studies predicting future mosquito distributions because brackish and saline water along coastlines is predicted to increase [
  <a rid="B90-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90-vetsci-06-00040">90</a>]. Hybridization is another ecological factor that may determine the extent of species distribution and influence range expansion of certain species (reviewed in [
  <a rid="B91-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91-vetsci-06-00040">91</a>]). For example, 
  <span class="italic">An. gambiae</span> gained a critical gene from 
  <span class="italic">An. arabiensis</span> allowing it to move from rainforests to drier habitats, such as savannahs [
  <a rid="B92-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92-vetsci-06-00040">92</a>,
  <a rid="B93-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B93-vetsci-06-00040">93</a>]. Further research is needed to understand how hybridization may contribute to range expansion in other mosquito genera. Predicting shifts in range distributions of mosquito species is challenging and requires a comprehensive modeling approach that incorporates vegetation modeling, hydrology, epidemiological modeling, human movement behavior, mosquito behavior, and host, vector, and pathogen biology and evolution.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mosquitoes are closely tied to and track environmental conditions because their life cycle depends on environmental conditions. Mosquito expansion will likely continue well into the future because of increased temperatures, greater probabilities of overwintering, and changes to precipitation regimes. Although climate change directly influences mosquito distributions through changing environmental conditions, climate change can also impact distributions indirectly. Humans respond to climate change by altering their surroundings. For example, drought has caused southeast Australian communities to install water storage tanks, which is predicted to increase the distribution of 
  <span class="italic">Ae. aegypti</span> and increase the risk of emerging and re-emerging diseases in these areas [
  <a rid="B94-vetsci-06-00040" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94-vetsci-06-00040">94</a>]. Changes in human movement will also affect mosquito dispersal and impact future distributions. Predicting range expansions of mosquito vectors and mosquito-borne diseases therefore needs effective climate, human, and epidemiological modeling, which when combined, will provide more accurate forecasts for vector and disease risk.
