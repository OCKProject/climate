 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As climate warms under the influence of anthropogenic radiative forcing, many climate variables are affected, some of which affect the radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere and may tend to either increase or mitigate climate warming. These feedback mechanisms make it difficult to quantify the global surface temperature increase expected at the end of century, even for a known greenhouse gas emission scenario. It is now recognized that the largest source of uncertainty in global climate model predictions is due to cloud feedbacks

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Most climate models predict a positive net cloud feedback, with shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) cloud feedbacks both being positive
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. The simulated positive SW cloud feedback is primarily due to a decrease in low cloud cover
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. The positive LW cloud feedback is primarily due to an increase in cloud altitude
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. These results from climate model simulations do not directly provide physical explanations, however, and require validation against observations. The positive LW cloud altitude feedback is generally thought to be robust as it is persistently found in climate model simulations since the very first models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span> and is backed by a plausible physical explanation: high clouds should rise in a warming climate such that cloud temperatures remain nearly constant
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. However, it still needs to be better verified against observations. To directly observe an altitude trend a long enough dataset is needed, highly stable in time, to detect the small changes due to anthropogenic forcing imposed on top of natural variability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. Spaceborne passive instrument datasets are currently the longest records available
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span> but have shown limited accuracy due to LW surface radiation influence through thin clouds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> and limited calibration stability over decadal timescales mainly due to calibration drifts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>, which significantly increases the time required to detect climate trends. Another approach is to derive constraints on the long-term cloud feedbacks from observations of cloud natural variability on interannual scales, assuming there is a link between changes driven by natural variability and transient changes on multidecade scales
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Satellite active sensors (lidar, radar), have flown since 2006, provide profile observations which are highly stable in time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span> and capable of measuring the altitude of clouds at a resolution of 30 m with long-term stability of a few meters
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>, whatever the surface type, which is much better that the existing passive remote sensing satellite instruments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Here we propose to take advantage of seven years of space lidar observations to look for verification of the LW cloud altitude feedback mechanism in observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. The length of these lidar observations is not yet long enough to detect a climate change trend but can be used to look for a constraint on the short-term feedback from natural variability, which in turn might provide constraints on the long-term feedback.

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test the validity of the LW feedback mechanism we 1) decompose both observed and simulated LW cloud feedbacks into relative contributions due to different cloud properties, 2) evaluate the realism of the simulated short-term LW cloud feedback against observations, and 3) examine the implications for the long-term LW cloud feedback.</p>
