These feedbacks are poorly constrained by traditional satellite records because they do not provide robust and stable measurements of the cloud vertical profile independently, of the surface and independently, of the cloud opacity. As shown herein, active remote sensor records like the lidar on board CALIPSO or the lidar and radar on board the future Earth Clouds, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE)
