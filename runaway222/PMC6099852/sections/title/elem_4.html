      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alternative Stabilized Earth Pathway</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the world’s societies want to avoid crossing a potential threshold that locks the
         Earth System into the Hothouse Earth pathway, then it is critical that they make deliberate
         decisions to avoid this risk and maintain the Earth System in Holocene-like conditions.
         This human-created pathway is represented in 
         <a>Figs. 1</a> and 
         <a>2</a> by what we call Stabilized Earth (small loop at the bottom of 
         <a>Fig. 1</a>, 
         <span>Upper Right</span>), in which the Earth System is maintained in a state with a temperature rise no greater
         than 2 °C above preindustrial (a “super-Holocene” state) (
         <a>11</a>). Stabilized Earth would require deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, protection
         and enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, efforts to remove CO
         <sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, possibly solar radiation management, and adaptation to unavoidable
         impacts of the warming already occurring (
         <a>48</a>). The short broken red line beyond Stabilized Earth in 
         <a>Fig. 1</a>, 
         <span>Upper Right</span> represents a potential return to interglacial-like conditions in the longer term.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In essence, the Stabilized Earth pathway could be conceptualized as a regime of the
         Earth System in which humanity plays an active planetary stewardship role in maintaining
         a state intermediate between the glacial–interglacial limit cycle of the Late Quaternary
         and a Hothouse Earth (
         <a>Fig. 2</a>). We emphasize that Stabilized Earth is not an intrinsic state of the Earth System
         but rather, one in which humanity commits to a pathway of ongoing management of its
         relationship with the rest of the Earth System.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A critical issue is that, if a planetary threshold is crossed toward the Hothouse
         Earth pathway, accessing the Stabilized Earth pathway would become very difficult
         no matter what actions human societies might take. Beyond the threshold, positive
         (reinforcing) feedbacks within the Earth System—outside of human influence or control—could
         become the dominant driver of the system’s pathway, as individual tipping elements
         create linked cascades through time and with rising temperature (
         <a>Fig. 3</a>). In other words, after the Earth System is committed to the Hothouse Earth pathway,
         the alternative Stabilized Earth pathway would very likely become inaccessible as
         illustrated in 
         <a>Fig. 2</a>.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hothouse Earth is likely to be uncontrollable and dangerous to many, particularly
            if we transition into it in only a century or two, and it poses severe risks for health,
            economies, political stability (
            <a>12</a>, 
            <a>39</a>, 
            <a>49</a>, 
            <a>50</a>) (especially for the most climate vulnerable), and ultimately, the habitability of
            the planet for humans.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Insights into the risks posed by the rapid climatic changes emerging in the Anthropocene
            can be obtained not only from contemporary observations (
            <a>51</a><a>*</a><a>*</a><a>*</a>–
            <a>55</a>) but also, from interactions in the past between human societies and regional and
            seasonal hydroclimate variability. This variability was often much more pronounced
            than global, longer-term Holocene variability (
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span></span>). Agricultural production and water supplies are especially vulnerable to changes
            in the hydroclimate, leading to hot/dry or cool/wet extremes. Societal declines, collapses,
            migrations/resettlements, reorganizations, and cultural changes were often associated
            with severe regional droughts and with the global megadrought at 4.2–3.9 thousand
            years before present, all occurring within the relative stability of the narrow global
            Holocene temperature range of approximately ±1 °C (
            <a>56</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S4
               </span> summarizes biomes and regional biosphere–physical climate subsystems critical for
            human wellbeing and the resultant risks if the Earth System follows a Hothouse Earth
            pathway. While most of these biomes or regional systems may be retained in a Stabilized
            Earth pathway, most or all of them would likely be substantially changed or degraded
            in a Hothouse Earth pathway, with serious challenges for the viability of human societies.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, agricultural systems are particularly vulnerable, because they are spatially
            organized around the relatively stable Holocene patterns of terrestrial primary productivity,
            which depend on a well-established and predictable spatial distribution of temperature
            and precipitation in relation to the location of fertile soils as well as on a particular
            atmospheric CO
            <sub>2</sub> concentration. Current understanding suggests that, while a Stabilized Earth pathway
            could result in an approximate balance between increases and decreases in regional
            production as human systems adapt, a Hothouse Earth trajectory will likely exceed
            the limits of adaptation and result in a substantial overall decrease in agricultural
            production, increased prices, and even more disparity between wealthy and poor countries
            (
            <a>57</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The world’s coastal zones, especially low-lying deltas and the adjacent coastal seas
            and ecosystems, are particularly important for human wellbeing. These areas are home
            to much of the world’s population, most of the emerging megacities, and a significant
            amount of infrastructure vital for both national economies and international trade.
            A Hothouse Earth trajectory would almost certainly flood deltaic environments, increase
            the risk of damage from coastal storms, and eliminate coral reefs (and all of the
            benefits that they provide for societies) by the end of this century or earlier (
            <a>58</a>).

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human Feedbacks in the Earth System.</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the dominant climate change narrative, humans are an external force driving change
            to the Earth System in a largely linear, deterministic way; the higher the forcing
            in terms of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the higher the global average
            temperature. However, our analysis argues that human societies and our activities
            need to be recast as an integral, interacting component of a complex, adaptive Earth
            System. This framing puts the focus not only on human system dynamics that reduce
            greenhouse gas emissions but also, on those that create or enhance negative feedbacks
            that reduce the risk that the Earth System will cross a planetary threshold and lock
            into a Hothouse Earth pathway.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Humanity’s challenge then is to influence the dynamical properties of the Earth System
            in such a way that the emerging unstable conditions in the zone between the Holocene
            and a very hot state become a de facto stable intermediate state (Stabilized Earth)
            (
            <a>Fig. 2</a>). This requires that humans take deliberate, integral, and adaptive steps to reduce
            dangerous impacts on the Earth System, effectively monitoring and changing behavior
            to form feedback loops that stabilize this intermediate state.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is much uncertainty and debate about how this can be done—technically, ethically,
            equitably, and economically—and there is no doubt that the normative, policy, and
            institutional aspects are highly challenging. However, societies could take a wide
            range of actions that constitute negative feedbacks, summarized in 
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S5
               </span>, to steer the Earth System toward Stabilized Earth. Some of these actions are already
            altering emission trajectories. The negative feedback actions fall into three broad
            categories: (
            <span>i</span>) reducing greenhouse gas emissions, (
            <span>ii</span>) enhancing or creating carbon sinks (e.g., protecting and enhancing biosphere carbon
            sinks and creating new types of sinks) (
            <a>59</a>), and (
            <span>iii</span>) modifying Earth’s energy balance (for example, via solar radiation management, although
            that particular feedback entails very large risks of destabilization or degradation
            of several key processes in the Earth System) (
            <a>60</a>, 
            <a>61</a>). While reducing emissions is a priority, much more could be done to reduce direct
            human pressures on critical biomes that contribute to the regulation of the state
            of the Earth System through carbon sinks and moisture feedbacks, such as the Amazon
            and boreal forests (
            <a>Table 1</a>), and to build much more effective stewardship of the marine and terrestrial biospheres
            in general.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present dominant socioeconomic system, however, is based on high-carbon economic
            growth and exploitative resource use (
            <a>9</a>). Attempts to modify this system have met with some success locally but little success
            globally in reducing greenhouse gas emissions or building more effective stewardship
            of the biosphere. Incremental linear changes to the present socioeconomic system are
            not enough to stabilize the Earth System. Widespread, rapid, and fundamental transformations
            will likely be required to reduce the risk of crossing the threshold and locking in
            the Hothouse Earth pathway; these include changes in behavior, technology and innovation,
            governance, and values (
            <a>48</a>, 
            <a>62</a>, 
            <a>63</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">International efforts to reduce human impacts on the Earth System while improving
            wellbeing include the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the commitment
            in the Paris agreement to keep warming below 2 °C. These international governance
            initiatives are matched by carbon reduction commitments by countries, cities, businesses,
            and individuals (
            <a>64</a><a>*</a>–
            <a>66</a>) , but as yet, these are not enough to meet the Paris target. Enhanced ambition will
            need new collectively shared values, principles, and frameworks as well as education
            to support such changes (
            <a>67</a>, 
            <a>68</a>). In essence, effective Earth System stewardship is an essential precondition for
            the prosperous development of human societies in a Stabilized Earth pathway (
            <a>69</a>, 
            <a>70</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to institutional and social innovation at the global governance level,
            changes in demographics, consumption, behavior, attitudes, education, institutions,
            and socially embedded technologies are all important to maximize the chances of achieving
            a Stabilized Earth pathway (
            <a>71</a>). Many of the needed shifts may take decades to have a globally aggregated impact
            (
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S5
               </span>), but there are indications that society may be reaching some important societal
            tipping points. For example, there has been relatively rapid progress toward slowing
            or reversing population growth through declining fertility resulting from the empowerment
            of women, access to birth control technologies, expansion of educational opportunities,
            and rising income levels (
            <a>72</a>, 
            <a>73</a>). These demographic changes must be complemented by sustainable per capita consumption
            patterns, especially among the higher per capita consumers. Some changes in consumer
            behavior have been observed (
            <a>74</a>, 
            <a>75</a>), and opportunities for consequent major transitions in social norms over broad scales
            may arise (
            <a>76</a>). Technological innovation is contributing to more rapid decarbonization and the
            possibility for removing CO
            <sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere (
            <a>48</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ultimately, the transformations necessary to achieve the Stabilized Earth pathway
            require a fundamental reorientation and restructuring of national and international
            institutions toward more effective governance at the Earth System level (
            <a>77</a>), with a much stronger emphasis on planetary concerns in economic governance, global
            trade, investments and finance, and technological development (

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if a Stabilized Earth pathway is achieved, humanity will face a turbulent road
            of rapid and profound changes and uncertainties on route to it—politically, socially,
            and environmentally—that challenge the resilience of human societies (
            <a>79</a><a>*</a><a>*</a>–
            <a>82</a>). Stabilized Earth will likely be warmer than any other time over the last 800,000
            years at least (
            <a>83</a>) (that is, warmer than at any other time in which fully modern humans have existed).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the Stabilized Earth trajectory will almost surely be characterized by
            the activation of some tipping elements (
            <a><span>Tipping Cascades</span></a> and 
            <a>Fig. 3</a>) and by nonlinear dynamics and abrupt shifts at the level of critical biomes that
            support humanity (
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S4
               </span>). Current rates of change of important features of the Earth System already match
            or exceed those of abrupt geophysical events in the past (
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span></span>). With these trends likely to continue for the next several decades at least, the
            contemporary way of guiding development founded on theories, tools, and beliefs of
            gradual or incremental change, with a focus on economy efficiency, will likely not
            be adequate to cope with this trajectory. Thus, in addition to adaptation, increasing
            resilience will become a key strategy for navigating the future.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Generic resilience-building strategies include developing insurance, buffers, redundancy,
