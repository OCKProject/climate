         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trajectory of the Earth System through the Late Quaternary, particularly the Holocene,
            provides the context for exploring the human-driven changes of the Anthropocene and
            the future trajectories of the system (
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span></span> has more detail). 
            <a>Fig. 1</a> shows a simplified representation of complex Earth System dynamics, where the physical
            climate system is subjected to the effects of slow changes in Earth’s orbit and inclination.
            Over the Late Quaternary (past 1.2 million years), the system has remained bounded
            between glacial and interglacial extremes. Not every glacial–interglacial cycle of
            the past million years follows precisely the same trajectory (
            <a>7</a>), but the cycles follow the same overall pathway (a term that we use to refer to
            a family of broadly similar trajectories). The full glacial and interglacial states
            and the ca. 100,000-years oscillations between them in the Late Quaternary loosely
            constitute limit cycles (technically, the asymptotic dynamics of ice ages are best
            modeled as pullback attractors in a nonautonomous dynamical system). This limit cycle
            is shown in a schematic fashion in blue in 
            <a>Fig. 1</a>, 
            <span>Lower Left</span> using temperature and sea level as the axes. The Holocene is represented by the top
            of the limit cycle loop near the label A.

               <p>A schematic illustration of possible future pathways of the climate against the background
                  of the typical glacial–interglacial cycles (
                  <span>Lower Left</span>). The interglacial state of the Earth System is at the top of the glacial–interglacial
                  cycle, while the glacial state is at the bottom. Sea level follows temperature change
                  relatively slowly through thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and ice caps.
                  The horizontal line in the middle of the figure represents the preindustrial temperature
                  level, and the current position of the Earth System is shown by the small sphere on
                  the red line close to the divergence between the Stabilized Earth and Hothouse Earth
                  pathways. The proposed planetary threshold at ∼2 °C above the preindustrial level
                  is also shown. The letters along the Stabilized Earth/Hothouse Earth pathways represent
                  four time periods in Earth’s recent past that may give insights into positions along
                  these pathways (
                  <span><span>SI Appendix</span></span>): A, Mid-Holocene; B, Eemian; C, Mid-Pliocene; and D, Mid-Miocene. Their positions
                  on the pathway are approximate only. Their temperature ranges relative to preindustrial
                  are given in

                  thus, out of the glacial–interglacial limit cycle to its present position in the hotter
                  Anthropocene. The fork in the road in 
                  <a>Fig. 1</a> is shown here as the two divergent pathways of the Earth System in the future (broken
                  arrows). Currently, the Earth System is on a Hothouse Earth pathway driven by human
                  emissions of greenhouse gases and biosphere degradation toward a planetary threshold
                  at ∼2 °C (horizontal broken line at 2 °C in 
                  <a>Fig. 1</a>), beyond which the system follows an essentially irreversible pathway driven by intrinsic
                  biogeophysical feedbacks. The other pathway leads to Stabilized Earth, a pathway of
                  Earth System stewardship guided by human-created feedbacks to a quasistable, human-maintained
                  basin of attraction. “Stability” (vertical axis) is defined here as the inverse of
                  the potential energy of the system. Systems in a highly stable state (deep valley)
                  have low potential energy, and considerable energy is required to move them out of
                  this stable state. Systems in an unstable state (top of a hill) have high potential
                  energy, and they require only a little additional energy to push them off the hill
                  and down toward a valley of lower potential energy.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Anthropocene represents the beginning of a very rapid human-driven trajectory
            of the Earth System away from the glacial–interglacial limit cycle toward new, hotter
            climatic conditions and a profoundly different biosphere (
            <a>2</a>, 
            <a>8</a>, 
            <a>9</a>) (
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span></span>). The current position, at over 1 °C above a preindustrial baseline (
            <a>10</a>), is nearing the upper envelope of interglacial conditions over the past 1.2 million
            years (
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S1
               </span>). More importantly, the rapid trajectory of the climate system over the past half-century
            along with technological lock in and socioeconomic inertia in human systems commit
            the climate system to conditions beyond the envelope of past interglacial conditions.
            We, therefore, suggest that the Earth System may already have passed one “fork in
            the road” of potential pathways, a bifurcation (near A in 
            <a>Fig. 1</a>) taking the Earth System out of the next glaciation cycle (
            <a>11</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the future, the Earth System could potentially follow many trajectories (
            <a>12</a>, 
            <a>13</a>), often represented by the large range of global temperature rises simulated by climate
            models (
            <a>14</a>). In most analyses, these trajectories are largely driven by the amount of greenhouse
            gases that human activities have already emitted and will continue to emit into the
            atmosphere over the rest of this century and beyond—with a presumed quasilinear relationship
            between cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and global temperature rise (
            <a>14</a>). However, here we suggest that biogeophysical feedback processes within the Earth
            System coupled with direct human degradation of the biosphere may play a more important
            role than normally assumed, limiting the range of potential future trajectories and
            potentially eliminating the possibility of the intermediate trajectories. We argue
            that there is a significant risk that these internal dynamics, especially strong nonlinearities
            in feedback processes, could become an important or perhaps, even dominant factor
            in steering the trajectory that the Earth System actually follows over coming centuries.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This risk is represented in 
            <a>Figs. 1</a> and 
            <a>2</a> by a planetary threshold (horizontal broken line in 
            <a>Fig. 1</a> on the Hothouse Earth pathway around 2 °C above preindustrial temperature). Beyond
            this threshold, intrinsic biogeophysical feedbacks in the Earth System (
            <a><span>Biogeophysical Feedbacks</span></a>) could become the dominant processes controlling the system’s trajectory. Precisely
            where a potential planetary threshold might be is uncertain (
            <a>15</a>, 
            <a>16</a>). We suggest 2 °C because of the risk that a 2 °C warming could activate important
            tipping elements (
            <a>12</a>, 
            <a>17</a>), raising the temperature further to activate other tipping elements in a domino-like
            cascade that could take the Earth System to even higher temperatures (
            <a><span>Tipping Cascades</span></a>). Such cascades comprise, in essence, the dynamical process that leads to thresholds
            in complex systems (section 4.2 in ref. 
            <a>18</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This analysis implies that, even if the Paris Accord target of a 1.5 °C to 2.0 °C
            rise in temperature is met, we cannot exclude the risk that a cascade of feedbacks
            could push the Earth System irreversibly onto a “Hothouse Earth” pathway. The challenge
            that humanity faces is to create a “Stabilized Earth” pathway that steers the Earth
            System away from its current trajectory toward the threshold beyond which is Hothouse
            Earth (
            <a>Fig. 2</a>). The human-created Stabilized Earth pathway leads to a basin of attraction that
            is not likely to exist in the Earth System’s stability landscape without human stewardship
            to create and maintain it. Creating such a pathway and basin of attraction requires
            a fundamental change in the role of humans on the planet. This stewardship role requires
            deliberate and sustained action to become an integral, adaptive part of Earth System
            dynamics, creating feedbacks that keep the system on a Stabilized Earth pathway (
            <a><span>Alternative Stabilized Earth Pathway</span></a>).

            the system that can maintain it in a given state (negative feedbacks) and those that

            Some of the key negative feedbacks that could maintain the Earth System in Holocene-like

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the feedbacks can show both continuous responses and tipping point behavior
            in which the feedback process becomes self-perpetuating after a critical threshold
            is crossed; subsystems exhibiting this behavior are often called “tipping elements”
            (
            <a>17</a>). The type of behavior—continuous response or tipping point/abrupt change—can depend
            on the magnitude or the rate of forcing, or both. Many feedbacks will show some gradual
            change before the tipping point is reached.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A few of the changes associated with the feedbacks are reversible on short timeframes
            of 50–100 years (e.g., change in Arctic sea ice extent with a warming or cooling of
            the climate; Antarctic sea ice may be less reversible because of heat accumulation
            in the Southern Ocean), but most changes are largely irreversible on timeframes that
            matter to contemporary societies (e.g., loss of permafrost carbon). A few of the feedbacks
            do not have apparent thresholds (e.g., change in the land and ocean physiological
            carbon sinks, such as increasing carbon uptake due to the CO
            <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect or decreasing uptake due to a decrease in rainfall). For some
            of the tipping elements, crossing the tipping point could trigger an abrupt, nonlinear
            response (e.g., conversion of large areas of the Amazon rainforest to a savanna or
            seasonally dry forest), while for others, crossing the tipping point would lead to
            a more gradual but self-perpetuating response (large-scale loss of permafrost). There
            could also be considerable lags after the crossing of a threshold, particularly for
            those tipping elements that involve the melting of large masses of ice. However, in
            some cases, ice loss can be very rapid when occurring as massive iceberg outbreaks
            (e.g., Heinrich Events).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For some feedback processes, the magnitude—and even the direction—depend on the rate
            of climate change. If the rate of climate change is small, the shift in biomes can
            track the change in temperature/moisture, and the biomes may shift gradually, potentially
            taking up carbon from the atmosphere as the climate warms and atmospheric CO
            <sub>2</sub> concentration increases. However, if the rate of climate change is too large or too
            fast, a tipping point can be crossed, and a rapid biome shift may occur via extensive
            disturbances (e.g., wildfires, insect attacks, droughts) that can abruptly remove
            an existing biome. In some terrestrial cases, such as widespread wildfires, there
            could be a pulse of carbon to the atmosphere, which if large enough, could influence
            the trajectory of the Earth System (
            <a>29</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Varying response rates to a changing climate could lead to complex biosphere dynamics
            with implications for feedback processes. For example, delays in permafrost thawing
            would most likely delay the projected northward migration of boreal forests (
            <a>30</a>), while warming of the southern areas of these forests could result in their conversion
            to steppe grasslands of significantly lower carbon storage capacity. The overall result
            would be a positive feedback to the climate system.

            atmospheric CO
            <sub>2</sub> concentration (
            <a>31</a>), has increased the land carbon sink in recent decades (
            <a>32</a>). However, increasing atmospheric CO
            <sub>2</sub> raises temperature, and hotter leaves photosynthesize less well. Other feedbacks
            are also involved—for instance, warming the soil increases microbial respiration,

            several of the feedbacks that show negligible or very small magnitude by 2100 could
            nevertheless be triggered well before then, and they could eventually generate significant
            feedback strength over longer timeframes—centuries and even millennia—and thus, influence
            the long-term trajectory of the Earth System. These feedback processes include permafrost
            thawing, decomposition of ocean methane hydrates, increased marine bacterial respiration,
            and loss of polar ice sheets accompanied by a rise in sea levels and potential amplification
            of temperature rise through changes in ocean circulation (

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a>Fig. 3</a> shows a global map of some potential tipping cascades. The tipping elements fall
            into three clusters based on their estimated threshold temperature (
            <a>12</a>, 
            <a>17</a>, 
            <a>39</a>). Cascades could be formed when a rise in global temperature reaches the level of
            the lower-temperature cluster, activating tipping elements, such as loss of the Greenland
            Ice Sheet or Arctic sea ice. These tipping elements, along with some of the nontipping
            element feedbacks (e.g., gradual weakening of land and ocean physiological carbon
            sinks), could push the global average temperature even higher, inducing tipping in
            mid- and higher-temperature clusters. For example, tipping (loss) of the Greenland
            Ice Sheet could trigger a critical transition in the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation
            (AMOC), which could together, by causing sea-level rise and Southern Ocean heat accumulation,
            accelerate ice loss from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (
            <a>32</a>, 
            <a>40</a>) on timescales of centuries (
            <a>41</a>).

               <p>Global map of potential tipping cascades. The individual tipping elements are color-
                  coded according to estimated thresholds in global average surface temperature (tipping
                  points) (
                  <a>12</a>, 
                  <a>34</a>). Arrows show the potential interactions among the tipping elements based on expert
                  elicitation that could generate cascades. Note that, although the risk for tipping
                  (loss of) the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is proposed at &gt;5 °C, some marine-based sectors
                  in East Antarctica may be vulnerable at lower temperatures (
                  <a>35</a><a>*</a><a>*</a>–
                  <a>38</a>).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observations of past behavior support an important contribution of changes in ocean
            circulation to such feedback cascades. During previous glaciations, the climate system
            flickered between two states that seem to reflect changes in convective activity in
            the Nordic seas and changes in the activity of the AMOC. These variations caused typical
            temperature response patterns called the “bipolar seesaw” (
            <a>42</a><a>*</a>–
            <a>44</a>). During extremely cold conditions in the north, heat accumulated in the Southern
            Ocean, and Antarctica warmed. Eventually, the heat made its way north and generated
            subsurface warming that may have been instrumental in destabilizing the edges of the
            Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (
            <a>45</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If Greenland and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet melt in the future, the freshening and
            cooling of nearby surface waters will have significant effects on the ocean circulation.
            While the probability of significant circulation changes is difficult to quantify,
            climate model simulations suggest that freshwater inputs compatible with current rates
            of Greenland melting are sufficient to have measurable effects on ocean temperature
            and circulation (
            <a>46</a>, 
            <a>47</a>). Sustained warming of the northern high latitudes as a result of this process could
            accelerate feedbacks or activate tipping elements in that region, such as permafrost
            degradation, loss of Arctic sea ice, and boreal forest dieback.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While this may seem to be an extreme scenario, it illustrates that a warming into
            the range of even the lower-temperature cluster (i.e., the Paris targets) could lead
            to tipping in the mid- and higher-temperature clusters via cascade effects. Based
            on this analysis of tipping cascades and taking a risk-averse approach, we suggest
            that a potential planetary threshold could occur at a temperature rise as low as ∼2.0
            °C above preindustrial (
            <a>Fig. 1</a>).
