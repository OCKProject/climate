      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trajectory of the Earth System through the Late Quaternary, particularly the Holocene,
         provides the context for exploring the human-driven changes of the Anthropocene and
         the future trajectories of the system (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span></span> has more detail). 
         <a>Fig. 1</a> shows a simplified representation of complex Earth System dynamics, where the physical
         climate system is subjected to the effects of slow changes in Earth’s orbit and inclination.
         Over the Late Quaternary (past 1.2 million years), the system has remained bounded
         between glacial and interglacial extremes. Not every glacial–interglacial cycle of
         the past million years follows precisely the same trajectory (
         <a>7</a>), but the cycles follow the same overall pathway (a term that we use to refer to
         a family of broadly similar trajectories). The full glacial and interglacial states
         and the ca. 100,000-years oscillations between them in the Late Quaternary loosely
         constitute limit cycles (technically, the asymptotic dynamics of ice ages are best
         modeled as pullback attractors in a nonautonomous dynamical system). This limit cycle
         is shown in a schematic fashion in blue in 
         <a>Fig. 1</a>, 
         <span>Lower Left</span> using temperature and sea level as the axes. The Holocene is represented by the top
         of the limit cycle loop near the label A.

            <p>A schematic illustration of possible future pathways of the climate against the background
               of the typical glacial–interglacial cycles (
               <span>Lower Left</span>). The interglacial state of the Earth System is at the top of the glacial–interglacial
               cycle, while the glacial state is at the bottom. Sea level follows temperature change
               relatively slowly through thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and ice caps.
               The horizontal line in the middle of the figure represents the preindustrial temperature
               level, and the current position of the Earth System is shown by the small sphere on
               the red line close to the divergence between the Stabilized Earth and Hothouse Earth
               pathways. The proposed planetary threshold at ∼2 °C above the preindustrial level
               is also shown. The letters along the Stabilized Earth/Hothouse Earth pathways represent
               four time periods in Earth’s recent past that may give insights into positions along
               these pathways (
               <span><span>SI Appendix</span></span>): A, Mid-Holocene; B, Eemian; C, Mid-Pliocene; and D, Mid-Miocene. Their positions
               on the pathway are approximate only. Their temperature ranges relative to preindustrial
               are given in 
               <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S1
                  </span>.

            <p>Stability landscape showing the pathway of the Earth System out of the Holocene and
               thus, out of the glacial–interglacial limit cycle to its present position in the hotter
               Anthropocene. The fork in the road in 
               <a>Fig. 1</a> is shown here as the two divergent pathways of the Earth System in the future (broken
               arrows). Currently, the Earth System is on a Hothouse Earth pathway driven by human
               emissions of greenhouse gases and biosphere degradation toward a planetary threshold
               at ∼2 °C (horizontal broken line at 2 °C in 
               <a>Fig. 1</a>), beyond which the system follows an essentially irreversible pathway driven by intrinsic
               biogeophysical feedbacks. The other pathway leads to Stabilized Earth, a pathway of
               Earth System stewardship guided by human-created feedbacks to a quasistable, human-maintained
               basin of attraction. “Stability” (vertical axis) is defined here as the inverse of
               the potential energy of the system. Systems in a highly stable state (deep valley)
               have low potential energy, and considerable energy is required to move them out of
               this stable state. Systems in an unstable state (top of a hill) have high potential
               energy, and they require only a little additional energy to push them off the hill
               and down toward a valley of lower potential energy.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Anthropocene represents the beginning of a very rapid human-driven trajectory
         of the Earth System away from the glacial–interglacial limit cycle toward new, hotter
         climatic conditions and a profoundly different biosphere (
         <a>2</a>, 
         <a>8</a>, 
         <a>9</a>) (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span></span>). The current position, at over 1 °C above a preindustrial baseline (
         <a>10</a>), is nearing the upper envelope of interglacial conditions over the past 1.2 million
         years (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S1
            </span>). More importantly, the rapid trajectory of the climate system over the past half-century
         along with technological lock in and socioeconomic inertia in human systems commit
         the climate system to conditions beyond the envelope of past interglacial conditions.
         We, therefore, suggest that the Earth System may already have passed one “fork in
         the road” of potential pathways, a bifurcation (near A in 
         <a>Fig. 1</a>) taking the Earth System out of the next glaciation cycle (
         <a>11</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the future, the Earth System could potentially follow many trajectories (
         <a>12</a>, 
         <a>13</a>), often represented by the large range of global temperature rises simulated by climate
         models (
         <a>14</a>). In most analyses, these trajectories are largely driven by the amount of greenhouse
         gases that human activities have already emitted and will continue to emit into the
         atmosphere over the rest of this century and beyond—with a presumed quasilinear relationship
         between cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and global temperature rise (
         <a>14</a>). However, here we suggest that biogeophysical feedback processes within the Earth
         System coupled with direct human degradation of the biosphere may play a more important
         role than normally assumed, limiting the range of potential future trajectories and
         potentially eliminating the possibility of the intermediate trajectories. We argue
         that there is a significant risk that these internal dynamics, especially strong nonlinearities
         in feedback processes, could become an important or perhaps, even dominant factor
         in steering the trajectory that the Earth System actually follows over coming centuries.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This risk is represented in 
         <a>Figs. 1</a> and 
         <a>2</a> by a planetary threshold (horizontal broken line in 
         <a>Fig. 1</a> on the Hothouse Earth pathway around 2 °C above preindustrial temperature). Beyond
         this threshold, intrinsic biogeophysical feedbacks in the Earth System (
         <a><span>Biogeophysical Feedbacks</span></a>) could become the dominant processes controlling the system’s trajectory. Precisely
         where a potential planetary threshold might be is uncertain (
         <a>15</a>, 
         <a>16</a>). We suggest 2 °C because of the risk that a 2 °C warming could activate important
         tipping elements (
         <a>12</a>, 
         <a>17</a>), raising the temperature further to activate other tipping elements in a domino-like
         cascade that could take the Earth System to even higher temperatures (
         <a><span>Tipping Cascades</span></a>). Such cascades comprise, in essence, the dynamical process that leads to thresholds
         in complex systems (section 4.2 in ref. 
         <a>18</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This analysis implies that, even if the Paris Accord target of a 1.5 °C to 2.0 °C
         rise in temperature is met, we cannot exclude the risk that a cascade of feedbacks
         could push the Earth System irreversibly onto a “Hothouse Earth” pathway. The challenge
         that humanity faces is to create a “Stabilized Earth” pathway that steers the Earth
         System away from its current trajectory toward the threshold beyond which is Hothouse
         Earth (
         <a>Fig. 2</a>). The human-created Stabilized Earth pathway leads to a basin of attraction that
         is not likely to exist in the Earth System’s stability landscape without human stewardship
         to create and maintain it. Creating such a pathway and basin of attraction requires
         a fundamental change in the role of humans on the planet. This stewardship role requires
         deliberate and sustained action to become an integral, adaptive part of Earth System
         dynamics, creating feedbacks that keep the system on a Stabilized Earth pathway (
         <a><span>Alternative Stabilized Earth Pathway</span></a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We now explore this critical question in more detail by considering the relevant biogeophysical
         feedbacks (
         <a><span>Biogeophysical Feedbacks</span></a>) and the risk of tipping cascades (
         <a><span>Tipping Cascades</span></a>).
