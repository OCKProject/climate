      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a>Fig. 3</a> shows a global map of some potential tipping cascades. The tipping elements fall
         into three clusters based on their estimated threshold temperature (
         <a>12</a>, 
         <a>17</a>, 
         <a>39</a>). Cascades could be formed when a rise in global temperature reaches the level of
         the lower-temperature cluster, activating tipping elements, such as loss of the Greenland
         Ice Sheet or Arctic sea ice. These tipping elements, along with some of the nontipping
         element feedbacks (e.g., gradual weakening of land and ocean physiological carbon
         sinks), could push the global average temperature even higher, inducing tipping in
         mid- and higher-temperature clusters. For example, tipping (loss) of the Greenland
         Ice Sheet could trigger a critical transition in the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation
         (AMOC), which could together, by causing sea-level rise and Southern Ocean heat accumulation,
         accelerate ice loss from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (
         <a>32</a>, 
         <a>40</a>) on timescales of centuries (
         <a>41</a>).

            <p>Global map of potential tipping cascades. The individual tipping elements are color-
               coded according to estimated thresholds in global average surface temperature (tipping
               points) (
               <a>12</a>, 
               <a>34</a>). Arrows show the potential interactions among the tipping elements based on expert
               elicitation that could generate cascades. Note that, although the risk for tipping
               (loss of) the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is proposed at &gt;5 °C, some marine-based sectors
               in East Antarctica may be vulnerable at lower temperatures (
               <a>35</a><a>*</a><a>*</a>–
               <a>38</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observations of past behavior support an important contribution of changes in ocean
         circulation to such feedback cascades. During previous glaciations, the climate system
         flickered between two states that seem to reflect changes in convective activity in
         the Nordic seas and changes in the activity of the AMOC. These variations caused typical
         temperature response patterns called the “bipolar seesaw” (
         <a>42</a><a>*</a>–
         <a>44</a>). During extremely cold conditions in the north, heat accumulated in the Southern
         Ocean, and Antarctica warmed. Eventually, the heat made its way north and generated
         subsurface warming that may have been instrumental in destabilizing the edges of the
         Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (
         <a>45</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If Greenland and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet melt in the future, the freshening and
         cooling of nearby surface waters will have significant effects on the ocean circulation.
         While the probability of significant circulation changes is difficult to quantify,
         climate model simulations suggest that freshwater inputs compatible with current rates
         of Greenland melting are sufficient to have measurable effects on ocean temperature
         and circulation (
         <a>46</a>, 
         <a>47</a>). Sustained warming of the northern high latitudes as a result of this process could
         accelerate feedbacks or activate tipping elements in that region, such as permafrost
         degradation, loss of Arctic sea ice, and boreal forest dieback.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While this may seem to be an extreme scenario, it illustrates that a warming into
         the range of even the lower-temperature cluster (i.e., the Paris targets) could lead
         to tipping in the mid- and higher-temperature clusters via cascade effects. Based
         on this analysis of tipping cascades and taking a risk-averse approach, we suggest
         that a potential planetary threshold could occur at a temperature rise as low as ∼2.0
         °C above preindustrial (
         <a>Fig. 1</a>).
