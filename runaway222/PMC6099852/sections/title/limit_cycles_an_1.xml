  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a> shows a simplified representation of complex Earth System dynamics, where the physical climate system is subjected to the effects of slow changes in Earth’s orbit and inclination. Over the Late Quaternary (past 1.2 million years), the system has remained bounded between glacial and interglacial extremes. Not every glacial–interglacial cycle of the past million years follows precisely the same trajectory (
  <a rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" href="#r7">7</a>), but the cycles follow the same overall pathway (a term that we use to refer to a family of broadly similar trajectories). The full glacial and interglacial states and the ca. 100,000-years oscillations between them in the Late Quaternary loosely constitute limit cycles (technically, the asymptotic dynamics of ice ages are best modeled as pullback attractors in a nonautonomous dynamical system). This limit cycle is shown in a schematic fashion in blue in

   <p>A schematic illustration of possible future pathways of the climate against the background of the typical glacial–interglacial cycles (
    <span class="italic">Lower Left</span>). The interglacial state of the Earth System is at the top of the glacial–interglacial cycle, while the glacial state is at the bottom. Sea level follows temperature change relatively slowly through thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and ice caps. The horizontal line in the middle of the figure represents the preindustrial temperature level, and the current position of the Earth System is shown by the small sphere on the red line close to the divergence between the Stabilized Earth and Hothouse Earth pathways. The proposed planetary threshold at ∼2 °C above the preindustrial level is also shown. The letters along the Stabilized Earth/Hothouse Earth pathways represent four time periods in Earth’s recent past that may give insights into positions along these pathways (

    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a> is shown here as the two divergent pathways of the Earth System in the future (broken arrows). Currently, the Earth System is on a Hothouse Earth pathway driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases and biosphere degradation toward a planetary threshold at ∼2 °C (horizontal broken line at 2 °C in 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>), beyond which the system follows an essentially irreversible pathway driven by intrinsic biogeophysical feedbacks. The other pathway leads to Stabilized Earth, a pathway of Earth System stewardship guided by human-created feedbacks to a quasistable, human-maintained basin of attraction. “Stability” (vertical axis) is defined here as the inverse of the potential energy of the system. Systems in a highly stable state (deep valley) have low potential energy, and considerable energy is required to move them out of this stable state. Systems in an unstable state (top of a hill) have high potential energy, and they require only a little additional energy to push them off the hill and down toward a valley of lower potential energy.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Anthropocene represents the beginning of a very rapid human-driven trajectory of the Earth System away from the glacial–interglacial limit cycle toward new, hotter climatic conditions and a profoundly different biosphere (

  </span>). The current position, at over 1 °C above a preindustrial baseline (
  <a rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" href="#r10">10</a>), is nearing the upper envelope of interglacial conditions over the past 1.2 million years (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1810141115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S1
  </span>). More importantly, the rapid trajectory of the climate system over the past half-century along with technological lock in and socioeconomic inertia in human systems commit the climate system to conditions beyond the envelope of past interglacial conditions. We, therefore, suggest that the Earth System may already have passed one “fork in the road” of potential pathways, a bifurcation (near A in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>) taking the Earth System out of the next glaciation cycle (
  <a rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" href="#r11">11</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the future, the Earth System could potentially follow many trajectories (
  <a rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" href="#r12">12</a>, 
  <a rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" href="#r13">13</a>), often represented by the large range of global temperature rises simulated by climate models (
  <a rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" href="#r14">14</a>). In most analyses, these trajectories are largely driven by the amount of greenhouse gases that human activities have already emitted and will continue to emit into the atmosphere over the rest of this century and beyond—with a presumed quasilinear relationship between cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and global temperature rise (
  <a rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" href="#r14">14</a>). However, here we suggest that biogeophysical feedback processes within the Earth System coupled with direct human degradation of the biosphere may play a more important role than normally assumed, limiting the range of potential future trajectories and potentially eliminating the possibility of the intermediate trajectories. We argue that there is a significant risk that these internal dynamics, especially strong nonlinearities in feedback processes, could become an important or perhaps, even dominant factor in steering the trajectory that the Earth System actually follows over coming centuries.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This risk is represented in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Figs. 1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a> by a planetary threshold (horizontal broken line in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a> on the Hothouse Earth pathway around 2 °C above preindustrial temperature). Beyond this threshold, intrinsic biogeophysical feedbacks in the Earth System (
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s3" href="#s3">
   <span class="italic">Biogeophysical Feedbacks</span>
  </a>) could become the dominant processes controlling the system’s trajectory. Precisely where a potential planetary threshold might be is uncertain (
  <a rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" href="#r15">15</a>, 
  <a rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" href="#r16">16</a>). We suggest 2 °C because of the risk that a 2 °C warming could activate important tipping elements (
  <a rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" href="#r12">12</a>, 
  <a rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" href="#r17">17</a>), raising the temperature further to activate other tipping elements in a domino-like cascade that could take the Earth System to even higher temperatures (
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s4" href="#s4">
   <span class="italic">Tipping Cascades</span>
  </a>). Such cascades comprise, in essence, the dynamical process that leads to thresholds in complex systems (section 4.2 in ref. 
  <a rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" href="#r18">18</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This analysis implies that, even if the Paris Accord target of a 1.5 °C to 2.0 °C rise in temperature is met, we cannot exclude the risk that a cascade of feedbacks could push the Earth System irreversibly onto a “Hothouse Earth” pathway. The challenge that humanity faces is to create a “Stabilized Earth” pathway that steers the Earth System away from its current trajectory toward the threshold beyond which is Hothouse Earth (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>). The human-created Stabilized Earth pathway leads to a basin of attraction that is not likely to exist in the Earth System’s stability landscape without human stewardship to create and maintain it. Creating such a pathway and basin of attraction requires a fundamental change in the role of humans on the planet. This stewardship role requires deliberate and sustained action to become an integral, adaptive part of Earth System dynamics, creating feedbacks that keep the system on a Stabilized Earth pathway (
