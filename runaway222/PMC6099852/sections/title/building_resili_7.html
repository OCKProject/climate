      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if a Stabilized Earth pathway is achieved, humanity will face a turbulent road
         of rapid and profound changes and uncertainties on route to it—politically, socially,
         and environmentally—that challenge the resilience of human societies (
         <a>79</a><a>*</a><a>*</a>–
         <a>82</a>). Stabilized Earth will likely be warmer than any other time over the last 800,000
         years at least (
         <a>83</a>) (that is, warmer than at any other time in which fully modern humans have existed).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the Stabilized Earth trajectory will almost surely be characterized by
         the activation of some tipping elements (
         <a><span>Tipping Cascades</span></a> and 
         <a>Fig. 3</a>) and by nonlinear dynamics and abrupt shifts at the level of critical biomes that
         support humanity (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S4
            </span>). Current rates of change of important features of the Earth System already match
         or exceed those of abrupt geophysical events in the past (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span></span>). With these trends likely to continue for the next several decades at least, the
         contemporary way of guiding development founded on theories, tools, and beliefs of
         gradual or incremental change, with a focus on economy efficiency, will likely not
         be adequate to cope with this trajectory. Thus, in addition to adaptation, increasing
         resilience will become a key strategy for navigating the future.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Generic resilience-building strategies include developing insurance, buffers, redundancy,
         diversity, and other features of resilience that are critical for transforming human
         systems in the face of warming and possible surprise associated with tipping points
         (
         <a>84</a>). Features of such a strategy include (
         <span>i</span>) maintenance of diversity, modularity, and redundancy; (
         <span>ii</span>) management of connectivity, openness, slow variables, and feedbacks; (
         <span>iii</span>) understanding social–ecological systems as complex adaptive systems, especially
         at the level of the Earth System as a whole (
         <a>85</a>); (
         <span>iv</span>) encouraging learning and experimentation; and (
         <span>v</span>) broadening of participation and building of trust to promote polycentric governance
         systems (
         <a>86</a>, 
         <a>87</a>).
