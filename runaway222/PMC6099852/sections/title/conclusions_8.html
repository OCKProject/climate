      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our systems approach, focusing on feedbacks, tipping points, and nonlinear dynamics,
         has addressed the four questions posed in the Introduction.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis suggests that the Earth System may be approaching a planetary threshold
         that could lock in a continuing rapid pathway toward much hotter conditions—Hothouse
         Earth. This pathway would be propelled by strong, intrinsic, biogeophysical feedbacks
         difficult to influence by human actions, a pathway that could not be reversed, steered,
         or substantially slowed.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Where such a threshold might be is uncertain, but it could be only decades ahead at
         a temperature rise of ∼2.0 °C above preindustrial, and thus, it could be within the
         range of the Paris Accord temperature targets.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impacts of a Hothouse Earth pathway on human societies would likely be massive,
         sometimes abrupt, and undoubtedly disruptive.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Avoiding this threshold by creating a Stabilized Earth pathway can only be achieved
         and maintained by a coordinated, deliberate effort by human societies to manage our
         relationship with the rest of the Earth System, recognizing that humanity is an integral,
         interacting component of the system. Humanity is now facing the need for critical
         decisions and actions that could influence our future for centuries, if not millennia
         (
         <a>88</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How credible is this analysis? There is significant evidence from a number of sources
         that the risk of a planetary threshold and thus, the need to create a divergent pathway
         should be taken seriously:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, the complex system behavior of the Earth System in the Late Quaternary is well-documented
         and understood. The two bounding states of the system—glacial and interglacial—are
         reasonably well-defined, the ca. 100,000-years periodicity of the limit cycle is established,
         and internal (carbon cycle and ice albedo feedbacks) and external (changes in insolation
         caused by changes in Earth’s orbital parameters) driving processes are generally well-known.
         Furthermore, we know with high confidence that the progressive disintegration of ice
         sheets and the transgression of other tipping elements are difficult to reverse after
         critical levels of warming are reached.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, insights from Earth’s recent geological past (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span></span>) suggest that conditions consistent with the Hothouse Earth pathway are accessible
         with levels of atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature rise either already realized or projected for this
         century (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S1
            </span>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, the tipping elements and feedback processes that operated over Quaternary glacial–interglacial
         cycles are the same as several of those proposed as critical for the future trajectory
         of the Earth System (
         <a><span>Biogeophysical Feedbacks</span></a>, 
         <a><span>Tipping Cascades</span></a>, 
         <a>Fig. 3</a>, 
         <a>Table 1</a>, and 
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S2
            </span>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fourth, contemporary observations (
         <a>29</a>, 
         <a>38</a>) (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span></span>) of tipping element behavior at an observed temperature anomaly of about 1 °C above
         preindustrial suggest that some of these elements are vulnerable to tipping within
         just a 1 °C to 3 °C increase in global temperature, with many more of them vulnerable
         at higher temperatures (
         <a><span>Biogeophysical Feedbacks</span></a> and 
         <a><span>Tipping Cascades</span></a>) (
         <a>12</a>, 
         <a>17</a>, 
         <a>39</a>). This suggests that the risk of tipping cascades could be significant at a 2 °C
         temperature rise and could increase sharply beyond that point. We argue that a planetary
         threshold in the Earth System could exist at a temperature rise as low as 2 °C above
         preindustrial.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Stabilized Earth trajectory requires deliberate management of humanity’s relationship
         with the rest of the Earth System if the world is to avoid crossing a planetary threshold.
         We suggest that a deep transformation based on a fundamental reorientation of human
         values, equity, behavior, institutions, economies, and technologies is required. Even
         so, the pathway toward Stabilized Earth will involve considerable changes to the structure
         and functioning of the Earth System, suggesting that resilience-building strategies
         be given much higher priority than at present in decision making. Some signs are emerging
         that societies are initiating some of the necessary transformations. However, these
         transformations are still in initial stages, and the social/political tipping points
         that definitively move the current trajectory away from Hothouse Earth have not yet
         been crossed, while the door to the Stabilized Earth pathway may be rapidly closing.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our initial analysis here needs to be underpinned by more in-depth, quantitative Earth
         System analysis and modeling studies to address three critical questions. (
         <span>i</span>) Is humanity at risk for pushing the system across a planetary threshold and irreversibly
         down a Hothouse Earth pathway? (
         <span>ii</span>) What other pathways might be possible in the complex stability landscape of the
         Earth System, and what risks might they entail? (
         <span>iii</span>) What planetary stewardship strategies are required to maintain the Earth System
         in a manageable Stabilized Earth state?
