      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hothouse Earth is likely to be uncontrollable and dangerous to many, particularly
         if we transition into it in only a century or two, and it poses severe risks for health,
         economies, political stability (
         <a>12</a>, 
         <a>39</a>, 
         <a>49</a>, 
         <a>50</a>) (especially for the most climate vulnerable), and ultimately, the habitability of
         the planet for humans.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Insights into the risks posed by the rapid climatic changes emerging in the Anthropocene
         can be obtained not only from contemporary observations (
         <a>51</a><a>*</a><a>*</a><a>*</a>–
         <a>55</a>) but also, from interactions in the past between human societies and regional and
         seasonal hydroclimate variability. This variability was often much more pronounced
         than global, longer-term Holocene variability (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span></span>). Agricultural production and water supplies are especially vulnerable to changes
         in the hydroclimate, leading to hot/dry or cool/wet extremes. Societal declines, collapses,
         migrations/resettlements, reorganizations, and cultural changes were often associated
         with severe regional droughts and with the global megadrought at 4.2–3.9 thousand
         years before present, all occurring within the relative stability of the narrow global
         Holocene temperature range of approximately ±1 °C (
         <a>56</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S4
            </span> summarizes biomes and regional biosphere–physical climate subsystems critical for
         human wellbeing and the resultant risks if the Earth System follows a Hothouse Earth
         pathway. While most of these biomes or regional systems may be retained in a Stabilized
         Earth pathway, most or all of them would likely be substantially changed or degraded
         in a Hothouse Earth pathway, with serious challenges for the viability of human societies.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, agricultural systems are particularly vulnerable, because they are spatially
         organized around the relatively stable Holocene patterns of terrestrial primary productivity,
         which depend on a well-established and predictable spatial distribution of temperature
         and precipitation in relation to the location of fertile soils as well as on a particular
         atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration. Current understanding suggests that, while a Stabilized Earth pathway
         could result in an approximate balance between increases and decreases in regional
         production as human systems adapt, a Hothouse Earth trajectory will likely exceed
         the limits of adaptation and result in a substantial overall decrease in agricultural
         production, increased prices, and even more disparity between wealthy and poor countries
         (
         <a>57</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The world’s coastal zones, especially low-lying deltas and the adjacent coastal seas
         and ecosystems, are particularly important for human wellbeing. These areas are home
         to much of the world’s population, most of the emerging megacities, and a significant
         amount of infrastructure vital for both national economies and international trade.
         A Hothouse Earth trajectory would almost certainly flood deltaic environments, increase
         the risk of damage from coastal storms, and eliminate coral reefs (and all of the
         benefits that they provide for societies) by the end of this century or earlier (
         <a>58</a>).
