      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the dominant climate change narrative, humans are an external force driving change
         to the Earth System in a largely linear, deterministic way; the higher the forcing
         in terms of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the higher the global average
         temperature. However, our analysis argues that human societies and our activities
         need to be recast as an integral, interacting component of a complex, adaptive Earth
         System. This framing puts the focus not only on human system dynamics that reduce
         greenhouse gas emissions but also, on those that create or enhance negative feedbacks
         that reduce the risk that the Earth System will cross a planetary threshold and lock
         into a Hothouse Earth pathway.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Humanity’s challenge then is to influence the dynamical properties of the Earth System
         in such a way that the emerging unstable conditions in the zone between the Holocene
         and a very hot state become a de facto stable intermediate state (Stabilized Earth)
         (
         <a>Fig. 2</a>). This requires that humans take deliberate, integral, and adaptive steps to reduce
         dangerous impacts on the Earth System, effectively monitoring and changing behavior
         to form feedback loops that stabilize this intermediate state.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is much uncertainty and debate about how this can be done—technically, ethically,
         equitably, and economically—and there is no doubt that the normative, policy, and
         institutional aspects are highly challenging. However, societies could take a wide
         range of actions that constitute negative feedbacks, summarized in 
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S5
            </span>, to steer the Earth System toward Stabilized Earth. Some of these actions are already
         altering emission trajectories. The negative feedback actions fall into three broad
         categories: (
         <span>i</span>) reducing greenhouse gas emissions, (
         <span>ii</span>) enhancing or creating carbon sinks (e.g., protecting and enhancing biosphere carbon
         sinks and creating new types of sinks) (
         <a>59</a>), and (
         <span>iii</span>) modifying Earth’s energy balance (for example, via solar radiation management, although
         that particular feedback entails very large risks of destabilization or degradation
         of several key processes in the Earth System) (
         <a>60</a>, 
         <a>61</a>). While reducing emissions is a priority, much more could be done to reduce direct
         human pressures on critical biomes that contribute to the regulation of the state
         of the Earth System through carbon sinks and moisture feedbacks, such as the Amazon
         and boreal forests (
         <a>Table 1</a>), and to build much more effective stewardship of the marine and terrestrial biospheres
         in general.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present dominant socioeconomic system, however, is based on high-carbon economic
         growth and exploitative resource use (
         <a>9</a>). Attempts to modify this system have met with some success locally but little success
         globally in reducing greenhouse gas emissions or building more effective stewardship
         of the biosphere. Incremental linear changes to the present socioeconomic system are
         not enough to stabilize the Earth System. Widespread, rapid, and fundamental transformations
         will likely be required to reduce the risk of crossing the threshold and locking in
         the Hothouse Earth pathway; these include changes in behavior, technology and innovation,
         governance, and values (
         <a>48</a>, 
         <a>62</a>, 
         <a>63</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">International efforts to reduce human impacts on the Earth System while improving
         wellbeing include the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the commitment
         in the Paris agreement to keep warming below 2 °C. These international governance
         initiatives are matched by carbon reduction commitments by countries, cities, businesses,
         and individuals (
         <a>64</a><a>*</a>–
         <a>66</a>) , but as yet, these are not enough to meet the Paris target. Enhanced ambition will
         need new collectively shared values, principles, and frameworks as well as education
         to support such changes (
         <a>67</a>, 
         <a>68</a>). In essence, effective Earth System stewardship is an essential precondition for
         the prosperous development of human societies in a Stabilized Earth pathway (
         <a>69</a>, 
         <a>70</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to institutional and social innovation at the global governance level,
         changes in demographics, consumption, behavior, attitudes, education, institutions,
         and socially embedded technologies are all important to maximize the chances of achieving
         a Stabilized Earth pathway (
         <a>71</a>). Many of the needed shifts may take decades to have a globally aggregated impact
         (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S5
            </span>), but there are indications that society may be reaching some important societal
         tipping points. For example, there has been relatively rapid progress toward slowing
         or reversing population growth through declining fertility resulting from the empowerment
         of women, access to birth control technologies, expansion of educational opportunities,
         and rising income levels (
         <a>72</a>, 
         <a>73</a>). These demographic changes must be complemented by sustainable per capita consumption
         patterns, especially among the higher per capita consumers. Some changes in consumer
         behavior have been observed (
         <a>74</a>, 
         <a>75</a>), and opportunities for consequent major transitions in social norms over broad scales
         may arise (
         <a>76</a>). Technological innovation is contributing to more rapid decarbonization and the
         possibility for removing CO
         <sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere (
         <a>48</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ultimately, the transformations necessary to achieve the Stabilized Earth pathway
         require a fundamental reorientation and restructuring of national and international
         institutions toward more effective governance at the Earth System level (
         <a>77</a>), with a much stronger emphasis on planetary concerns in economic governance, global
         trade, investments and finance, and technological development (
         <a>78</a>).
