      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trajectory of the Earth System is influenced by biogeophysical feedbacks within
         the system that can maintain it in a given state (negative feedbacks) and those that
         can amplify a perturbation and drive a transition to a different state (positive feedbacks).
         Some of the key negative feedbacks that could maintain the Earth System in Holocene-like
         conditions—notably, carbon uptake by land and ocean systems—are weakening relative
         to human forcing (
         <a>19</a>), increasing the risk that positive feedbacks could play an important role in determining
         the Earth System’s trajectory. 
         <a>Table 1</a> summarizes carbon cycle feedbacks that could accelerate warming, while 
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S2
            </span> describes in detail a more complete set of biogeophysical feedbacks that can be triggered
         by forcing levels likely to be reached within the rest of the century.

               <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strength of the feedback is estimated at 2100 for an ∼2 °C warming.</p>

      </div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the feedbacks can show both continuous responses and tipping point behavior
         in which the feedback process becomes self-perpetuating after a critical threshold
         is crossed; subsystems exhibiting this behavior are often called “tipping elements”
         (
         <a>17</a>). The type of behavior—continuous response or tipping point/abrupt change—can depend
         on the magnitude or the rate of forcing, or both. Many feedbacks will show some gradual
         change before the tipping point is reached.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A few of the changes associated with the feedbacks are reversible on short timeframes
         of 50–100 years (e.g., change in Arctic sea ice extent with a warming or cooling of
         the climate; Antarctic sea ice may be less reversible because of heat accumulation
         in the Southern Ocean), but most changes are largely irreversible on timeframes that
         matter to contemporary societies (e.g., loss of permafrost carbon). A few of the feedbacks
         do not have apparent thresholds (e.g., change in the land and ocean physiological
         carbon sinks, such as increasing carbon uptake due to the CO
         <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect or decreasing uptake due to a decrease in rainfall). For some
         of the tipping elements, crossing the tipping point could trigger an abrupt, nonlinear
         response (e.g., conversion of large areas of the Amazon rainforest to a savanna or
         seasonally dry forest), while for others, crossing the tipping point would lead to
         a more gradual but self-perpetuating response (large-scale loss of permafrost). There
         could also be considerable lags after the crossing of a threshold, particularly for
         those tipping elements that involve the melting of large masses of ice. However, in
         some cases, ice loss can be very rapid when occurring as massive iceberg outbreaks
         (e.g., Heinrich Events).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For some feedback processes, the magnitude—and even the direction—depend on the rate
         of climate change. If the rate of climate change is small, the shift in biomes can
         track the change in temperature/moisture, and the biomes may shift gradually, potentially
         taking up carbon from the atmosphere as the climate warms and atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration increases. However, if the rate of climate change is too large or too
         fast, a tipping point can be crossed, and a rapid biome shift may occur via extensive
         disturbances (e.g., wildfires, insect attacks, droughts) that can abruptly remove
         an existing biome. In some terrestrial cases, such as widespread wildfires, there
         could be a pulse of carbon to the atmosphere, which if large enough, could influence
         the trajectory of the Earth System (
         <a>29</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Varying response rates to a changing climate could lead to complex biosphere dynamics
         with implications for feedback processes. For example, delays in permafrost thawing
         would most likely delay the projected northward migration of boreal forests (
         <a>30</a>), while warming of the southern areas of these forests could result in their conversion
         to steppe grasslands of significantly lower carbon storage capacity. The overall result
         would be a positive feedback to the climate system.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The so-called “greening” of the planet, caused by enhanced plant growth due to increasing
         atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration (
         <a>31</a>), has increased the land carbon sink in recent decades (
         <a>32</a>). However, increasing atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> raises temperature, and hotter leaves photosynthesize less well. Other feedbacks
         are also involved—for instance, warming the soil increases microbial respiration,
         releasing CO
         <sub>2</sub> back into the atmosphere.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis focuses on the strength of the feedback between now and 2100. However,
         several of the feedbacks that show negligible or very small magnitude by 2100 could
         nevertheless be triggered well before then, and they could eventually generate significant
         feedback strength over longer timeframes—centuries and even millennia—and thus, influence
         the long-term trajectory of the Earth System. These feedback processes include permafrost
         thawing, decomposition of ocean methane hydrates, increased marine bacterial respiration,
         and loss of polar ice sheets accompanied by a rise in sea levels and potential amplification
         of temperature rise through changes in ocean circulation (
         <a>33</a>).
