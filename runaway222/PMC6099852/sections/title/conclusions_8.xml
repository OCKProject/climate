 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our systems approach, focusing on feedbacks, tipping points, and nonlinear dynamics, has addressed the four questions posed in the Introduction.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis suggests that the Earth System may be approaching a planetary threshold that could lock in a continuing rapid pathway toward much hotter conditions—Hothouse Earth. This pathway would be propelled by strong, intrinsic, biogeophysical feedbacks difficult to influence by human actions, a pathway that could not be reversed, steered, or substantially slowed.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Where such a threshold might be is uncertain, but it could be only decades ahead at a temperature rise of ∼2.0 °C above preindustrial, and thus, it could be within the range of the Paris Accord temperature targets.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impacts of a Hothouse Earth pathway on human societies would likely be massive, sometimes abrupt, and undoubtedly disruptive.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Avoiding this threshold by creating a Stabilized Earth pathway can only be achieved and maintained by a coordinated, deliberate effort by human societies to manage our relationship with the rest of the Earth System, recognizing that humanity is an integral, interacting component of the system. Humanity is now facing the need for critical decisions and actions that could influence our future for centuries, if not millennia (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How credible is this analysis? There is significant evidence from a number of sources that the risk of a planetary threshold and thus, the need to create a divergent pathway should be taken seriously:</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, the complex system behavior of the Earth System in the Late Quaternary is well-documented and understood. The two bounding states of the system—glacial and interglacial—are reasonably well-defined, the ca. 100,000-years periodicity of the limit cycle is established, and internal (carbon cycle and ice albedo feedbacks) and external (changes in insolation caused by changes in Earth’s orbital parameters) driving processes are generally well-known. Furthermore, we know with high confidence that the progressive disintegration of ice sheets and the transgression of other tipping elements are difficult to reverse after critical levels of warming are reached.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, insights from Earth’s recent geological past (

  </span>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, the tipping elements and feedback processes that operated over Quaternary glacial–interglacial cycles are the same as several of those proposed as critical for the future trajectory of the Earth System (

  </span>) of tipping element behavior at an observed temperature anomaly of about 1 °C above preindustrial suggest that some of these elements are vulnerable to tipping within just a 1 °C to 3 °C increase in global temperature, with many more of them vulnerable at higher temperatures (

  <a rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" href="#r17">17</a>, 
  <a rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" href="#r39">39</a>). This suggests that the risk of tipping cascades could be significant at a 2 °C temperature rise and could increase sharply beyond that point. We argue that a planetary threshold in the Earth System could exist at a temperature rise as low as 2 °C above preindustrial.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Stabilized Earth trajectory requires deliberate management of humanity’s relationship with the rest of the Earth System if the world is to avoid crossing a planetary threshold. We suggest that a deep transformation based on a fundamental reorientation of human values, equity, behavior, institutions, economies, and technologies is required. Even so, the pathway toward Stabilized Earth will involve considerable changes to the structure and functioning of the Earth System, suggesting that resilience-building strategies be given much higher priority than at present in decision making. Some signs are emerging that societies are initiating some of the necessary transformations. However, these transformations are still in initial stages, and the social/political tipping points that definitively move the current trajectory away from Hothouse Earth have not yet been crossed, while the door to the Stabilized Earth pathway may be rapidly closing.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our initial analysis here needs to be underpinned by more in-depth, quantitative Earth System analysis and modeling studies to address three critical questions. (
  <span class="italic">i</span>) Is humanity at risk for pushing the system across a planetary threshold and irreversibly down a Hothouse Earth pathway? (
  <span class="italic">ii</span>) What other pathways might be possible in the complex stability landscape of the Earth System, and what risks might they entail? (
  <span class="italic">iii</span>) What planetary stewardship strategies are required to maintain the Earth System in a manageable Stabilized Earth state?
