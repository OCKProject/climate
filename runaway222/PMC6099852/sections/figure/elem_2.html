         <p>Global map of potential tipping cascades. The individual tipping elements are color-
            coded according to estimated thresholds in global average surface temperature (tipping
            points) (
            <a>12</a>, 
            <a>34</a>). Arrows show the potential interactions among the tipping elements based on expert
            elicitation that could generate cascades. Note that, although the risk for tipping
            (loss of) the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is proposed at &gt;5 °C, some marine-based sectors
            in East Antarctica may be vulnerable at lower temperatures (

            <a>38</a>).
