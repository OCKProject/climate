         <p>Stability landscape showing the pathway of the Earth System out of the Holocene and
            thus, out of the glacial–interglacial limit cycle to its present position in the hotter
            Anthropocene. The fork in the road in 
            <a>Fig. 1</a> is shown here as the two divergent pathways of the Earth System in the future (broken
            arrows). Currently, the Earth System is on a Hothouse Earth pathway driven by human
            emissions of greenhouse gases and biosphere degradation toward a planetary threshold
            at ∼2 °C (horizontal broken line at 2 °C in 
            <a>Fig. 1</a>), beyond which the system follows an essentially irreversible pathway driven by intrinsic
            biogeophysical feedbacks. The other pathway leads to Stabilized Earth, a pathway of
            Earth System stewardship guided by human-created feedbacks to a quasistable, human-maintained
            basin of attraction. “Stability” (vertical axis) is defined here as the inverse of
            the potential energy of the system. Systems in a highly stable state (deep valley)
            have low potential energy, and considerable energy is required to move them out of
            this stable state. Systems in an unstable state (top of a hill) have high potential
            energy, and they require only a little additional energy to push them off the hill
            and down toward a valley of lower potential energy.
