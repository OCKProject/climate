         <p>A schematic illustration of possible future pathways of the climate against the background
            of the typical glacial–interglacial cycles (
            <span>Lower Left</span>). The interglacial state of the Earth System is at the top of the glacial–interglacial
            cycle, while the glacial state is at the bottom. Sea level follows temperature change
            relatively slowly through thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and ice caps.
            The horizontal line in the middle of the figure represents the preindustrial temperature
            level, and the current position of the Earth System is shown by the small sphere on
            the red line close to the divergence between the Stabilized Earth and Hothouse Earth
            pathways. The proposed planetary threshold at ∼2 °C above the preindustrial level
            is also shown. The letters along the Stabilized Earth/Hothouse Earth pathways represent
            four time periods in Earth’s recent past that may give insights into positions along
            these pathways (
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span></span>): A, Mid-Holocene; B, Eemian; C, Mid-Pliocene; and D, Mid-Miocene. Their positions
            on the pathway are approximate only. Their temperature ranges relative to preindustrial
            are given in 
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Table S1
               </span>.
