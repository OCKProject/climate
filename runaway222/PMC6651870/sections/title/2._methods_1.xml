 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The symposium was designed to provide participants with opportunities to hear about the state of the science, engage in discussions around the real-world challenges of addressing wildfire smoke risk in communities, and to actively share their knowledge and expertise to help guide the development of a research agenda for future work. The symposium was coordinated by an interdisciplinary team of University of Washington faculty and students, and advertised through listservs and/or social media maintained by the University of Washington’s Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, Program on Climate Change, Climate Impacts Group, the Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center, and the Northwest Center for Public Health Practice. Additional promotion was achieved through faculty and students’ practice-based networks and collaborators. Of over 117 interested participants, a purposefully selected group of 76 regional stakeholders (including the organizing team and facilitators/notetakers) representing over 30 agencies, organizations, communities, and tribes attended the symposium (
  <a rid="ijerph-16-02398-t001" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02398-t001">Table 1</a>). Participants were selected to ensure a diverse representation of organizations and roles in assessing, communicating, managing, and/or researching wildfire smoke risk across Washington state. Symposium registration provided information about participants’ goals and interests, and the planning team aligned the content of the workshop to meet the needs and desired learning outcomes of the audience.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The symposium began with presentations on the health risks of wildfire smoke, the connection between wildfire smoke and climate change, and examples of ongoing research efforts to better characterize wildfire smoke impacts on health to inform disaster recovery and public health practice. Participants also heard from a panel of practitioners from across the state who discussed their experiences, challenges, and needs related to wildfire smoke events. Following these presentations and panel discussions, participants engaged in small group discussions using the “World Café Method,” a technique designed to foster large group dialogue that is deliberate in its appreciation of local knowledge [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-16-02398" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-16-02398">15</a>]. Eight tables were divided into four different subpopulations (two tables each): (1) Workers, (2) at-risk/susceptible populations, (3) rural communities, and (4) urban/suburban communities. Participants engaged in four 20-min interactive group discussions. At the end of each 20-min discussion, participants rotated to form new groups at different tables. Each 20-min discussion focused on the following overarching questions:
  <div list-type="order" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Who is uniquely susceptible to wildfire smoke in this community? Why?</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>How can we effectively communicate risk to this population?</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>How can we reduce risk to this population?</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>How can research improve preparedness and response to future wildfire smoke events?</p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eight notetakers and eight facilitators—one each for each table during each round of discussion—facilitated and documented the discussions. Facilitators were trained on the use of a discussion guide that included prompts and additional questions to ensure a robust discussion during each round. Facilitators remained at each table and provided a summary of prior discussions to each incoming group to build on. A room facilitator walked the group through the process and the overarching goals for each round of discussion.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Facilitators captured the discussion on a flip chart while notetakers documented each conversation. Participants were encouraged to write their ideas on post-it notes that were pinned on the flip chart. Tables were also draped with butcher paper and participants were provided with markers and note cards to organize ideas and promote creative energy and engagement across different personality types and learning styles. Participants were also provided the opportunity to contribute to discussions about other subpopulations by writing and submitting comments on index cards. Facilitators reported out the identified research needs and participants had the opportunity to clarify or add to the needs discussed. Notetakers at each table documented conversations during each discussion. Facilitators reviewed and edited notes for accuracy and completeness, and to ensure that they reflected notes captured on other media. After the final café session, table facilitators and notetakers met and synthesized the research needs discussed at their tables for each of the four subpopulations represented.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Qualitative content analysis methods were used to identify and synthesize research needs documented in the notes [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-16-02398" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-16-02398">16</a>]. Notes were first reviewed in their entirety to identify broad categories of research needs discussed. These broad categories of research needs were institutionalized into a codebook, wherein each category identified in the data familiarization process became a code with a code definition and examples of when to apply the code (NAE). A second member of the research team (TBI) reviewed the codebook to ensure that it was clear and comprehensive. A team-based, consensus-building coding approach was then employed wherein two coders (NAE and TBI) worked together to discuss and apply codes to qualitative data using NVivo qualitative data analysis software (QSR International Pty Ltd. Version 12, 2018). Coded text was reviewed to identify key themes and contextual considerations by research category (NAE). Analytic memos were then developed (NAE) for each code to summarize the research needs that emerged across the discussions. All members of the author team had also served as facilitators or note-takers during the symposium. They reviewed the findings outlined in the analytic memos to confirm that the research needs presented were reflective of the world café discussions, and that minor points and contextual factors were clearly and consistently considered.
