  <div class="title">Retreat of two outlet glaciers in a similar climatic setting between 2015 and 2315 for the RCP 4.5 scenario.</div>
  <p>(
   <span class="bold">A</span>) Upernavik Isstrøm South (UIS) shows a gradual retreat of about 50 km over the next 200 years. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) Store Gletscher (SG) is currently in a very stable position on a bedrock high. It takes almost a hundred years before substantial retreat happens. However, once the glacier loses contact with the bedrock high, retreat of 25 km occurs in less than a decade. The glacier retreats quickly until it is out of the water. Every line represents a year (A and B). (
