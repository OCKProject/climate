 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides the surface mass balance–elevation feedback and the outlet glacier–thinning feedback, additional negative and positive feedbacks are at play. A negative feedback that can reduce mass loss is glacio-isostatic adjustment that results from unloading of the lithosphere due to ice loss. The uplift of bedrock is caused by the viscoelastic response of the underlying mantle and, as a consequence, will reduce the surface area that is exposed to surface melt and the ice area in direct contact with ocean water. However, because of the high mantle viscosity, this process is relatively slow, causing millimeters to centimeters per year rates of uplift. For each RCP scenario, we perform a simulation without glacio-isostatic adjustment and find that this effect is negligible on the centennial time scale, and after a millennium, mass loss is reduced by only about 2%, which is much less than the variance of the ensemble simulations on the 16th or 84th percentile (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another negative feedback is the coastward advection of deep cold ice, which increases ice viscosity and basal stickiness and decreases mass loss by reducing flow rates. This feedback competes with the positive feedback of inland migration of decreased basal stickiness due to outlet glacier acceleration and thinning (fig. S1). Acceleration of outlet glaciers not only leads to enhanced ice discharge but also contributes indirectly to increased surface runoff via the surface mass balance–elevation feedback: Thinning induced by outlet glacier acceleration lowers the ice surface in the vicinity of the glacier terminus, resulting in enhanced melt. While our model takes these three feedbacks into account, their impact is, however, difficult to quantify.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Positive feedbacks that we have not considered, but are potentially relevant, are the effect of enhanced surface melt affecting basal motion (

  </a>)], and ice cliff failure (

   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>). These three feedbacks, if taken into account, could further increase our mass loss estimates. Last, geomorphological processes such as bedrock erosion, sediment transport, and deposition could affect ice sheet evolution on centennial and longer time scales (
