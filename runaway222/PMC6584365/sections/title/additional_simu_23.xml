 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also identified an optimal (control) simulation (CTRL) that best reproduces the 2000–2015 mean surface mass balance calculated by HIRHAM5. To characterize model behavior, we performed additional simulations at horizontal grid resolutions ranging from 450 m (G450) to 18 km (G18000) and found that outlet glacier behavior is well captured at horizontal grid resolutions less than 2 km (fig. S4), in agreement with (

  </a>). The simulation at 450 m was only performed for RCP 4.5 from 2008 until 2200 because of large file sizes. We also performed two additional simulations at a resolution of 900 m, one without glacio-isostatic adjustment (“NGIA”) and one without a lapse rate (“NTLR”). We used the surface meltwater runoff from the NTLR simulation to approximate the meltwater runoff due to anomaly air temperature warming. To characterize the importance of resolving outlet glacier flow, we performed a simulation that calculates flow due to horizontal shearing only at a horizontal grid resolution of 18 km (SIA18000).
