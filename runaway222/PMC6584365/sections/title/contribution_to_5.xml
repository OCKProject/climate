 <div class="title">Contribution to GMSL in centimeters relative to 2008 for the years 2100, 2200, 2300, and 3000.</div>
 <p>Uncertainties for the ensemble analysis (ENS) at 1.8-km horizontal grid resolution are given as the 16th and 84th percentile range. In addition, the GMSL contribution from the control simulation (CTRL) at 900-m horizontal grid resolution is shown. To study the sensitivity of mass loss to grid resolution, we run additional simulations at 18 km (G18000), 9 km (G9000), 4.5 km (G4500), 3.6 km (G3600), 1.8 km (G1800), and 600 m (G600). NGIA is a simulation without glacio-isostatic adjustment, and NTLR is a simulation without a temperature lapse rate; both simulations were performed at 900 m. We also performed a simulation at 18 km that used the shallow-ice approximation (SIA18000). G600â€“18000, SIA18000, NGIA, and NTRL use the same parameters as CTRL.</p>
