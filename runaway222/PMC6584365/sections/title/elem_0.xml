 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ice sheets lose mass through runoff of surface meltwater and ice discharge into the surrounding ocean, and increases in both over the past two decades have resulted in accelerated mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet (

   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). Between 1995 and 1998, subsurface ocean temperatures rose by about 1.5°C along the west coast of Greenland as a result of increasing subsurface water temperatures in the subpolar gyre (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). These warm waters led to a disintegration of buttressing floating ice tongues (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>), which triggered a positive feedback between retreat, thinning, and outlet glacier acceleration (outlet glacier–acceleration feedback) (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>). A stark example is Jakobshavn Isbræ, Greenland’s largest and fastest flowing outlet glacier. Following the loss of its floating tongue between 2000 and 2003, the glacier’s flow speeds doubled as the ice thinned (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>). Since then, rapid increases in ice discharge have been observed in many outlet glaciers around Greenland, including Sverdrup Gletscher and Ummiamaku Isbræ on the northwest coast and Køge Bugt and Kangerdlugssuaq Gletscher on the southeast coast (
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>). Between 1990 and 2008, surface melt nearly doubled in magnitude, most notably in southwest Greenland (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>), resulting in additional widespread thinning at lower elevations. Thinning lowers the ice surface and exposes it to higher air temperatures, thereby leading to enhanced melt (surface mass balance–elevation feedback), establishing a second positive feedback for mass loss. The existence of such positive feedbacks can lead to strongly nonlinear responses of the ice sheet to environmental forcings (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As recognized in previous reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the ability to track outlet glacier behavior is necessary to accurately project ice sheet evolution, yet previous studies (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>) had limited success due to a lack of accurate ice thickness (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>), a leading order constraint on ice flow. Consequently, major progress was not possible until 2014, when a new high-resolution ice thickness map (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>) became available that now allows capturing outlet glacier flow with high fidelity (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we present a new assessment of the response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to future warming using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model [PISM; (
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>)], which is capable of reproducing the complex flow patterns evident in Greenland’s outlet glaciers (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). PISM simulates the evolution of ice geometry and ice flow. We use three extended Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) emissions scenarios (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>): a pathway with reduced greenhouse gas emissions that aligns with meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement (RCP 2.6), an intermediate pathway (RCP 4.5), and a high-emissions pathway (RCP 8.5). For these pathways, we derive air temperature anomalies from global climate model (GCM) realizations (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>), which we use to adjust present-day temperatures and precipitation based on climatologies from the high-resolution (∼5.5 km) regional climate model HIRHAM5 (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>). Because most GCM projections are only available until 2300, we extend the temperature anomalies by linearly extrapolating the 2200–2300 trend to the year 2500 and keeping the 2500 monthly values constant afterward (see Materials and Methods). At the ice-ocean interface, we prescribe submarine melt (i.e., melt at the ice front and below ice shelves from the water in contact) with parameterizations informed by observations (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">

  </a>), numerical modeling (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>), and theoretical considerations (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>), and we assume that ocean temperatures rise at the same rate as atmospheric temperatures. To estimate the impact of parametric uncertainties for each of the three emissions scenarios, we perform a rigorous 500-member ensemble of simulations in which we vary 11 key model parameters governing atmospheric forcing, surface processes, submarine melt, calving, and ice dynamics. In addition, we identify a control simulation for each scenario, which we use for inter-scenario comparisons.
