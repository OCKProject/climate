      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recognition that human activities have already altered the climate system to some
         extent and that further human-forced changes in the Earth’s climate system seems inevitable
         <span><a>33</a></span> has led ecologists to reduce uncertainty and improve accuracy in model projections
         in order to better forecast the impact of human activities on biodiversity and ecosystems
         <span><a>4</a></span>. The development of EWIs of regime shifts represents a promising avenue in this context
         because it makes it possible to detect tipping points in dynamic systems before they
         occur and raise alarms to prevent shifting from one state to another
         <span><a>6</a></span>. Differences in the inferences obtained from different EWIs, although expected to
         behave in the same way at the vicinity of tipping point, has questioned the use of
         single EWI to detect upcoming critical transitions
         <span><a>47</a></span>. We have shown that using a composite indicator may represent an interesting alternative
         by making it possible to unravel congruent trends among individual EWIs and identify
         areas or systems where the likelihood of approaching critical transition is important.
         Nonetheless, the results provided here are insufficient in the sense that they indicate
         that “something” important may be about to happen in some areas but do not tell us
         what precisely that “something” would be, when exactly it will happen and what is
         the underlying mechanism. Consequently, the areas highlighted here as showing a strong
         probability of upcoming critical transitions warrants further investigation. Indeed,
         although it is likely that land-use and land-cover changes might be involved in the
         trends highlighted here, more knowledge is needed to precisely identify what are the
         underlying processes. Repeating the above analyses at a smaller spatial scale and
         with datasets having higher spatio-temporal resolutions, collected from governmental
         agencies or local institutions, for both biotic and/or abiotic variables might help
         in this regard. In particular, it would help (i) clarify what are the processes pushing
         the climate system toward a tipping point, (ii) evaluate the time before the critical
         transition, and (iii) quantify the potential consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem
         functioning.
