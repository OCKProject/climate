            V3.23; 
            <span>https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/</span>) at a 0.5° resolution for air temperature (AT) and from the Met Office Hadley Center

            <span>http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/</span>) at a 1° resolution for sea surface temperature (SST). These raster maps are composed
            of 67325 and 32619 monthly observations time series for AT and SST, respectively.
            The number reported for the latter excludes pixels that were mostly composed of ice
            as those pixels are not temperature time series and can’t be analyzed with EWIs.

            (WWF) Marine Ecoregions Of the World (MEOW; 
            <span>http://www.worldwildlife.org/</span>). The year band used for the Köppen-Geiger classification was 1986–2010. Note that
            we haven’t used the WWF classification for the terrestrial system because ecoregions
            were not comparable to the marine ecoregions. We nonetheless report result for this
            classification in the supplementary material (Table 
            <a>S2</a>).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature time series were analyzed separately after removing the seasonal component.
            For this purpose, we decomposed the times series into seasonal, trend, and irregular
            components using a moving average procedure
            <span><a>63</a></span> and only conserved the last two components for the remaining analyses. We then filtered
            out long-term trends in the time series to achieve stationarity using a Gaussian kernel
            smoother with a fixed bandwidth of 50
            <span><a>17</a></span>. We chose a bandwidth of 50 because preliminary analyses performed on several pixels
            revealed that this value was appropriate. From the resulting time series, we compiled
            eight EWIs using a sliding window of half the length of the original time series using
            the package earlywarnings
            <span><a>64</a></span> within the R environment software
            <span><a>65</a></span>. However, we did not conserve all EWIs as some of them were highly correlated (ρ &gt; 0.99;
            p &lt; 0.001) and thus redundant (Supplementary Material Table 
            <a>S1</a>). Consequently, our study is based on five EWIs: the first order autoregressive coefficient
            (i.e. a measure of temporal autocorrelation at first lag), the standard deviation,
            the coefficient of variation, the skewness, and the kurtosis. Although the first three
            EWIs are all expected to increase when approaching a critical transition, trends in
            skewness and kurtosis depend on whether the transition is toward an alternative state
            that is larger or smaller than the present state
            <span><a>10</a></span>. Nonetheless, given the global warming context, changes in the temperature regime,
            if any, are likely to be toward a warmer state and we therefore expect a rise in both
            indicators
            <span><a>22</a>,
               <a>41</a></span>. This is because an increase in the frequency of extreme warm temperatures is expected
            to create an asymmetry towards the right hand of the distribution while, at the same
            time, the distribution is expected to become more “leptokurtic” with an increase in
            the frequency of rare values.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the five above-mentioned EWIs, we computed a composite metric to determine whether
            it can reinforce evidence of an approaching transition relative to individual EWI.
            As a first step, we normalized each of the five EWIs by subtracting the long-run average
            of that indicator from the value of that indicator at time t, and divided it by the
            long-run standard deviation (i.e. z-score transformation)
            <span><a>8</a></span>. To obtain the composite EWI, we then summed the normalized values of individual
            EWIs at each time step for each pixel, providing us time series for the composite
            EWI. For all EWIs (individuals and composite), we used Kendall’s τ rank correlation
            coefficient as a measure of their tendency to increase or decrease over time in each
            pixel, as classically done and recommended
            <span><a>17</a></span>. From the trends obtained, we generated “risk evaluation maps” for each EWI using
            the packages rworldmap
            <span><a>66</a></span> and rasterVis
            <span><a>67</a></span> to highlight spatial variations in the trends obtained for the different EWIs. We
            do not report negative trends because they are non-informative of approaching a critical
            transition and might rather indicate “critical speeding-up” whereby resilience to
            perturbations increases after the system has crossed a tipping point
            <span><a>68</a></span>. To evaluate the contribution of the five EWIs to the trends estimated with the composite
            EWI, we used a cross-validation approach where we (i) recalculated the composite EWI
            by removing one of the five EWIs, (ii) re-estimated the trend, and (iii) calculated
            the absolute difference between the new trend and the original trend. To determine
            how trends in the composite indicator varied with latitude, we focused on positive
            trends (i.e. positive Kendall’s τ coefficient) and calculated the average value of
            trends for each latitudinal band. Given that skewness and kurtosis have mixed support
            from the theoretical literature
            <span><a>41</a></span>, we also generated “risk evaluation maps” using a composite metric computed without
            these two EWIs (see Supplementary Material Fig. 
            <a>S5</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because trends in EWIs can be sensitive to the choice of sliding window and detrending
            bandwidth
            <span><a>17</a></span>, we repeated our analyses for different combinations of these parameters. We calculated
            the coefficient of variation of the trends obtained from the different combinations
            and used this as a measure of sensitivity of our results to the choice of sliding
            window and detrending bandwidth. A high value indicated a strong influence of these
            parameters on the estimated trend and thus a low robustness of our results.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Identifying false positives</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For EWIs to be ecologically meaningful, one has to test whether the observed trends
            are different from the ones that would have been obtained by chance. To test whether
            trends computed for the composite EWI in each pixel were true positives, we generated
            1,000 surrogate time series with the same length and autocorrelation structure as
            the original residual time series i.e. after the seasonal component and the long-term
            trend have been removed
            <span><a>41</a></span>. The autocorrelation structure of the surrogate time series was set to the value
            estimated from the best linear autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) fitted to
            the original time series and identified using a stepwise selection procedure based
            on AIC. For each surrogate time series we then computed the composite EWI and calculated
            its long-term trend, as explained above. As a result we obtained a distribution of
            Kendall’s τ coefficients under the null hypothesis that there is no temporal trend
            in the composite EWI. Significance was defined as the percentage of simulated trends
            showing higher values than the observed trend with a threshold fixed to 10%. Because
            the overall procedure was very time-consuming, we only tested the significance of
            trends for the composite EWI.
