      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature time series were analyzed separately after removing the seasonal component.
         For this purpose, we decomposed the times series into seasonal, trend, and irregular
         components using a moving average procedure
         <span><a>63</a></span> and only conserved the last two components for the remaining analyses. We then filtered
         out long-term trends in the time series to achieve stationarity using a Gaussian kernel
         smoother with a fixed bandwidth of 50
         <span><a>17</a></span>. We chose a bandwidth of 50 because preliminary analyses performed on several pixels
         revealed that this value was appropriate. From the resulting time series, we compiled
         eight EWIs using a sliding window of half the length of the original time series using
         the package earlywarnings
         <span><a>64</a></span> within the R environment software
         <span><a>65</a></span>. However, we did not conserve all EWIs as some of them were highly correlated (ρ &gt; 0.99;
         p &lt; 0.001) and thus redundant (Supplementary Material Table 
         <a>S1</a>). Consequently, our study is based on five EWIs: the first order autoregressive coefficient
         (i.e. a measure of temporal autocorrelation at first lag), the standard deviation,
         the coefficient of variation, the skewness, and the kurtosis. Although the first three
         EWIs are all expected to increase when approaching a critical transition, trends in
         skewness and kurtosis depend on whether the transition is toward an alternative state
         that is larger or smaller than the present state
         <span><a>10</a></span>. Nonetheless, given the global warming context, changes in the temperature regime,
         if any, are likely to be toward a warmer state and we therefore expect a rise in both
         indicators
         <span><a>22</a>,
            <a>41</a></span>. This is because an increase in the frequency of extreme warm temperatures is expected
         to create an asymmetry towards the right hand of the distribution while, at the same
         time, the distribution is expected to become more “leptokurtic” with an increase in
         the frequency of rare values.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the five above-mentioned EWIs, we computed a composite metric to determine whether
         it can reinforce evidence of an approaching transition relative to individual EWI.
         As a first step, we normalized each of the five EWIs by subtracting the long-run average
         of that indicator from the value of that indicator at time t, and divided it by the
         long-run standard deviation (i.e. z-score transformation)
         <span><a>8</a></span>. To obtain the composite EWI, we then summed the normalized values of individual
         EWIs at each time step for each pixel, providing us time series for the composite
         EWI. For all EWIs (individuals and composite), we used Kendall’s τ rank correlation
         coefficient as a measure of their tendency to increase or decrease over time in each
         pixel, as classically done and recommended
         <span><a>17</a></span>. From the trends obtained, we generated “risk evaluation maps” for each EWI using
         the packages rworldmap
         <span><a>66</a></span> and rasterVis
         <span><a>67</a></span> to highlight spatial variations in the trends obtained for the different EWIs. We
         do not report negative trends because they are non-informative of approaching a critical
         transition and might rather indicate “critical speeding-up” whereby resilience to
         perturbations increases after the system has crossed a tipping point
         <span><a>68</a></span>. To evaluate the contribution of the five EWIs to the trends estimated with the composite
         EWI, we used a cross-validation approach where we (i) recalculated the composite EWI
         by removing one of the five EWIs, (ii) re-estimated the trend, and (iii) calculated
         the absolute difference between the new trend and the original trend. To determine
         how trends in the composite indicator varied with latitude, we focused on positive
         trends (i.e. positive Kendall’s τ coefficient) and calculated the average value of
         trends for each latitudinal band. Given that skewness and kurtosis have mixed support
         from the theoretical literature
         <span><a>41</a></span>, we also generated “risk evaluation maps” using a composite metric computed without
         these two EWIs (see Supplementary Material Fig. 
         <a>S5</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because trends in EWIs can be sensitive to the choice of sliding window and detrending
         bandwidth
         <span><a>17</a></span>, we repeated our analyses for different combinations of these parameters. We calculated
         the coefficient of variation of the trends obtained from the different combinations
         and used this as a measure of sensitivity of our results to the choice of sliding
         window and detrending bandwidth. A high value indicated a strong influence of these
         parameters on the estimated trend and thus a low robustness of our results.
