      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Across the past decade, several studies have used metrics of climate change to quantify
         the exposure of geographic areas to different facets of change and relate these facets
         to different threats and opportunities for biodiversity
         <span><a>1</a>–
            <a>3</a></span>. The originality of this approach lies in the fact that it relies on climatic data
         with high spatio-temporal resolution (e.g. HadISST dataset) to generate “risk evaluation
         maps” for various biodiversity components
         <span><a>4</a></span>. For instance, climate velocities have been used as a surrogate to describe the migration
         speed required for species to keep pace with climate change and avoid extinction
         <span><a>3</a></span>. Those maps are useful because they make it possible to point to areas where threats
         and extinction risks are important and to draw inferences for unknown or poorly described
         species which represent most of Earth’s biodiversity
         <span><a>4</a></span>. However, a general assumption behind this approach is that species (or any other
         biodiversity component) respond in a smooth and gradual way to environmental changes,
         whereas there is increasing evidence that ecological systems can display non-linear
         and abrupt responses to such changes
         <span><a>5</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although human activities are indeed exposing biodiversity and ecosystems to gradual
         changes such as climate change, nutrient loading, habitat fragmentation or biotic
         exploitation
         <span><a>5</a>,
            <a>6</a></span>, recent empirical
         <span><a>7</a>,
            <a>8</a></span> and theoretical
         <span><a>9</a>,
            <a>10</a></span> studies have revealed that these gradual changes may induce non-linear transitions
         where a system shifts from one stable state to another. Such critical transitions,
         or regime shifts, have been highlighted not only in systems such as lakes
         <span><a>11</a></span>, coral reefs
         <span><a>12</a></span> or forests
         <span><a>13</a></span>, but also in animal populations
         <span><a>14</a></span> as well as in a wide spectrum of complex systems including physiological systems,
         financial markets and human societies
         <span><a>5</a></span>. These critical transitions have important social and economic implications because
         ecosystem state shifts can cause large changes of ecological and economic resources,
         and restoring a desired state may require drastic and expensive interventions
         <span><a>15</a></span>. Furthermore, once a tipping (or bifurcation) point (i.e. the point where the system
         shifts from one state to another) is crossed, a system may display hysteresis, implying
         that returning back to the previous state requires restoring conditions to a state
         well before the point where the transition occurred
         <span><a>5</a></span>. Detecting critical transitions before they occur is therefore paramount as it may
         avoid spending human and economic resources into costly restoration plans.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, as complex systems such as the climate or ecosystems (e.g. a lake) approach
         a tipping point, their dynamics tend to become dominated by a phenomenon known as
         critical slowing down (CSD) where the system becomes increasingly slow in recovering
         from perturbations
         <span><a>6</a>,
            <a>16</a></span>. As a result, systems approaching critical transitions tend to display common features
         at the vicinity of tipping point that are statistically tractable. For instance, the
         temporal autocorrelation
         <span><a>17</a></span> and the variability of the system have been shown to increase before critical transitions
         <span><a>17</a>,
            <a>18</a></span>. Although CSD has been demonstrated in a variety of systems, another phenomenon,
         called flickering, has been proposed to characterize approaching transitions in highly
         stochastic environments where systems can shift to alternative basins of attraction
         far from tipping points
         <span><a>10</a>,
            <a>19</a></span>. Systems subject to this phenomenon have also been shown to display a rise variance
         and autocorrelation at the vicinity of tipping points in ways that resemble the effects
         of CSD
         <span><a>20</a></span>. Furthermore, because in the case of flickering external perturbations can push the
         system toward values that are close to the boundary between two alternative states,
         the asymmetry of fluctuations can change before critical transitions
         <span><a>21</a></span>, leading to a change in the skewness and the kurtosis of the system
         <span><a>10</a></span>. Overall, the return rate, the temporal autocorrelation, the variability, the skewness
         and the kurtosis are all expected to change as a system is approaching a critical
         transition and have collectively been referred to as generic early warning signals
         or indicators (EWIs) of regime shifts
         <span><a>6</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of EWIs as tools to detect tipping points has recently been challenged by
         studies showing either that catastrophic transitions can occur without EWI (i.e. false
         negatives)
         <span><a>22</a></span> or that EWI can occur in systems not experiencing catastrophic transitions (i.e.
         false positives)
         <span><a>23</a></span>. False positives can arise if there are changes in the stochastic regime of perturbations
         (e.g. increase in variability)
         <span><a>24</a></span> or if the system has experienced a smooth transition toward a new and more dynamic
         state (e.g. a non-point attractor)
         <span><a>25</a></span>. Alternatively, false negatives can emerge because of data limitations (e.g. sparse
         or short time series), process or observation errors, non-local bifurcations or multiple
         noise effects
         <span><a>19</a></span>. Considering several EWIs has been proposed as a solution to mitigate the problem
         of false negatives
         <span><a>16</a></span>. For instance, in 14 of the 16 time series analyzed by ref.
         <span><a>26</a></span>, known tipping points were detected by at least one of the four EWIs considered.
         However, the problem with this approach it that the rate of false positives is likely
         to increase because considering several EWIs increases the probability to detect significant
         effects (increase of type I error rate). An alternative and potentially more powerful
         approach may be the combination of several EWIs into a single composite metric, which
         could allow approaching critical transitions to be more reliably inferred
         <span><a>27</a></span>. For instance, by combining trends in different EWIs into a single composite EWI,
         ref.
         <span><a>8</a></span> found better estimates of an approaching transition in populations exposed to deteriorating
         environmental conditions relative to estimates using individual trends. Furthermore,
         because the signal in the composite EWI is weighted by the magnitude and the sign
         of individual trends, it can either reinforce or weaken the signal toward an approaching
         transition, with the consequence that the rate of both false positives and false negatives
         can be reduced. For instance, in systems where several EWIs are expected to increase
         e.g.
         <span><a>28</a>,
            <a>29</a></span>, the use of a composite EWI is particularly useful because if all individual trends
         are positives, then the trend in the composite EWI would also be positive and would
         provide further support for upcoming critical transitions. In contrast, if individual
         trends have different signs or magnitudes, the signal in the composite EWI would be
         weakened and provide lower support for approaching transitions.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One condition for critical transitions to be detected is that an underlying variable
         gradually pushes the system toward a tipping point
         <span><a>5</a>,
            <a>16</a></span>. This variable can have several origins (e.g. climate, inputs of nutrient, habitat
         fragmentation, species loss) and the likelihood that it triggers a catastrophic shift
         likely depends on the spatial and temporal scale of the study. Indeed, depending on
         the scale considered, a variable can either be considered as the one triggering the
         shift or as the one undergoing the shift. For instance, some studies e.g. ref.
         <span><a>30</a></span> have considered climatic variables such as temperature as the underlying variable
         triggering a shift in some ecosystem states. However, temperature is itself dependent
         on other variables such as greenhouse gases
         <span><a>31</a></span>, the concentrations of which have gradually increased across the past decades
         <span><a>32</a>,
            <a>33</a></span>. Beyond greenhouse gases, many areas over the world have experienced strong and gradual
         changes in land-use (e.g. conversion of grasslands to croplands, deforestation) and
         land-cover (e.g. ice melting) and several studies have shown that such changes could
         have strong effects on some climatic variables
         <span><a>34</a></span>. This is because surface energy budgets are strongly influenced by the bio-geophysical
         characteristics of the land surface controlling atmospheric exchanges of moisture
         and energy. Through forestry and agricultural activities, humans perturb these characteristics,
         with impacts on the surface energy balance, and in turn, on local and regional temperatures
         <span><a>35</a></span>. For instance, changes in forest cover have been shown to affect local temperature
         by modifying the land-atmosphere fluxes of energy and water
         <span><a>36</a></span>. Given gradual changes in greenhouse gases concentration as well as land-use and
         land-cover, one may ask whether those changes can trigger sudden shifts in temperature
         and whether these shifts can be detected using EWIs.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we used monthly temperature time series from 1950 to 2014 collected over the
         world for terrestrial and marine systems at a 0.5° and 1° resolution, respectively,
         to investigate whether air and sea surface temperatures show any evidence of approaching
         a critical transition. More specifically, we computed temporal trends in five EWIs
         classically used in the literature (the first order autoregressive coefficient, the
         standard deviation, the coefficient of variation, the skewness, and the kurtosis;
         see the methods for further details) for 99944 pixels; 67325 of which are terrestrial
         and 32619 of which are marine. From those trends, we generated “risk evaluation maps”
         to highlight whether particular areas over the world display evidence for upcoming
         critical transitions and to determine whether the signal and the spatial patterns
         highlighted were congruent among EWIs. Although the five EWIs may describe the influence
         of two different phenomena (i.e. CSD and flickering), they have all been shown to
         behave similarly (i.e. to increase) at the vicinity of tipping points
         <span><a>20</a>,
            <a>21</a></span>. Thus, in a second step, we built a composite metric (see the methods) using the
         five above-mentioned EWIs to highlight areas showing a strong congruency among EWIs
         and therefore a strong probability of upcoming critical transitions. Using this composite
         metric, we further investigated whether trends varied across latitudes, between terrestrial
         and marine systems or among ecoregions within systems. Given large spatial variation
         in greenhouse gases concentration, land-use and land-cover changes over the world,
         we expected large spatial variation in EWIs. To the best of our knowledge, this study
         is the first using EWIs of regime shift in a prospective way to describe spatial patterns
         of upcoming critical transition in the temperature regime at the worldwide scale.
