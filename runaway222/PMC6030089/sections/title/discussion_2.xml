 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of EWIs as tools to identify critical transition has gained substantial interest in the field of ecology over recent years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Most studies conducted so far used experiments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>, simulations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>, or empirical data from systems in which critical transitions occurred in the past
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> to investigate the ability of EWIs to detect tipping points before they occur. These retrospective studies revealed that several statistical features of time series can be used as EWIs of regime shifts, thus providing a framework to use them prospectively in order to explore systems in which tipping points are likely to be reached in the future. For instance, temperature has undergone several transitions in the past between a cold and a warm state
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> and may do so in the near future
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. Here, we aimed to generate “risk evaluation maps” of upcoming tipping points in the temperature regime in both terrestrial and marine systems. Although the underlying mechanisms cannot be assessed with certainty, such exploration is of interest from both a conservation and a management point of view because ecological systems are expected to track changes in the climate system.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, we found strong and positive long-term trends in several EWIs, suggesting that some areas over the world may undergo a transition toward a qualitatively different climate state in the future. Regardless of the EWI considered, trends were not uniformly distributed across the world which can be explained by several factors. For instance, if we consider that shifts in temperature time series occur for the same value of the forcing regime (e.g. land-use changes), then spatial variations in that regime will generate spatial variations in EWIs. Alternatively, transitions between alternative stable states may occur for different values of the forcing regime
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span> and may also explain spatial variations in EWIs. Temperature is also influenced by several components (e.g. surface reflectivity due to land-use changes, changes in greenhouse gases concentration) of which each can display a nonlinear response to some variables on different time scales
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Beyond spatial variations, we found differences regarding the information provided by the different EWIs either in their spatial distribution or in the strength and the sign of their trends. Those differences could be due to differences in the underlying phenomenon driving the system toward a tipping point. For instance, areas showing positive trends for the coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis (e.g. Amazonian forest) could indicate flickering where the system switches back and forth between alternative stable states in response to externally imposed perturbations having large impacts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. In contrast, positive trends for autocorrelation and variance (e.g. south Pacific) could suggest that CSD is the underlying phenomenon
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span> and therefore that small and gradual (as opposed to large and stochastic) changes in external conditions are driving the system to the bifurcation point
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. More complex combinations of trends can occur depending on the behavior and the mathematical properties of the systems. For instance, when the rates of change of the state variable are slow relative to the frequency characteristics of the regime, the variance may decrease close to a tipping point while the autocorrelation may increase
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trends highlighted for the five EWIs can also involve mechanisms that are not related to critical transitions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. For example, changes in noise and certain external drivers can push a system from a point attractor to a non-point attractor, where it starts to fluctuate more frequently
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>. Likewise, systems that have experienced strong environmental perturbations (e.g. hurricanes) can display transient responses before returning to their equilibrium
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. These changes do not involve tipping points or shifts between alternative stable states but would still be characterized by an increase in the variability of the system, mimicking an approaching critical transition, even though temporal autocorrelation is not expected to change in those cases
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. The direct consequence of this is that the use of a single EWI can be flawed and lead to false alarms under certain conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. To mitigate limitations and sources of uncertainty associated with the use of single EWI, several authors e.g.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> have suggested to use multiple EWIs, while others have argued that the detection of tipping points can only be achieved by considering both variance and autocorrelation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. Since multiple EWIs have been shown to increase at the vicinity of tipping points, either due to flickering or CSD
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>, the use of a composite indicator might be particularly useful because it would make it possible to highlight congruent patterns among various EWIs, and thus provide further support for upcoming critical transitions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using such an indicator, we found that particular areas over the world showed strong and positive trends with about one fourth of pixels in both systems being true positives. From those pixels at least, it suggest that some areas (e.g. Australia, Greenland, Equatorial Pacific) are likely to experience a drastic shift in the temperature regime in the future. For the remaining pixels (i.e. those showing negative trends or positive but weak trends), although they might indicate that the system is not approaching a critical transition, they might as likely be false negatives, given that EWIs may sometimes fail to indicate a critical transition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. Regarding our composite indicator, false negatives can occur in regions where EWIs are expected to have opposite signs, such as when different mechanisms are at play. Those cases are not easy to distinguish without additional knowledge about the behavior and the mathematical properties of the system. When such a knowledge is accessible, one can refine the composite indicator to reflect congruent trends among EWIs. For instance, ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span> multiplied the trends of some of their EWIs by −1 to match the positive trend expected for other EWIs. The spatial scale and the number of time series considered here do not make it possible to use such an approach and we therefore cannot rule out the possibility that the absence of signal found in some areas (e.g. Boreal forest ecoregions which have undergone strong changes in land-cover across the past decades) are false negatives.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As already shown for other facets of climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>, we found that the trends obtained from the composite EWI varied with latitude and between ecoregions for both terrestrial and marine systems. In particular, we found that both extremes of the latitudinal gradients along with areas located in between the Equator and the Tropics displayed strong signal in terrestrial systems, whereas the signal was the strongest around the Equator in marine systems. This discrepancy between the two systems might either stem from differences in the forcing regime or in the physical climate-related mechanisms between the two systems. For instance, deepening of the mixed layer is a physical mechanism related to water depth and wind speed that can explain the critical slowing down of sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific domain
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>. By contrast, positive feedbacks related to changes in snow cover can influence surface reflectivity (albedo) which can amplify changes at the poles
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span> and explain the strong signals found in the northern part of the latitudinal gradient in terrestrial systems. The contrasting pattern (i.e. low signal) found at this latitude for the marine system could, on the other hand, be explained by the fact that this region is already beyond a bifurcation point and in the middle of a critical transition to a warmer state.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importantly, most of the areas showing the strongest signals in the terrestrial system correspond to areas that have undergone strong changes in land-use (e.g. Australia, west coast of the US)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span> or land-cover (e.g. forest cover in Zambia, Angola, Surinam; snow cover in north Canada)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span> over the past decades. By modifying the energy budget balance, these changes have been shown to have consequences on several climatic variables, including temperature
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>, and our results suggest that these changes might trigger drastic changes in the temperature regime in the future. The strong signal highlighted in the northern part of the Canada is particularly concerning as a large proportion of this area is composed of permafrost containing large amounts of carbon with a potential high incidence for global warming
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span>. Likewise, the strong signal found in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean where the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO) takes place is worrisome given that this phenomenon is one of the most important process underlying climate variability at large spatial scales
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span> and that year to year transitions between a warm (El-Niño) and a cold (La Niña) state have already been highlighted
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. Overall, it is interesting to note that the areas showing the strongest signals (e.g. ENSO, Greenland) closely match with the tipping elements hypothesized by ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span> with respect to critical transitions in the climate system.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within systems, we found strong variations between ecoregions, as already highlighted, for climate velocities
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span> or other components of the climate system
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. This suggests that the probability of upcoming critical transitions is likely to vary depending on the ecological conditions prevailing in a given region and especially the changes to which this region has been submitted to. For instance, Mediterranean ecoregions have undergone large changes in land-use over the last decades
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span> and were those showing the strongest evidence of upcoming critical transitions. Likewise, some ecoregions rated as “arid” (e.g. Australia) showed strong signals, a pattern that is in line with some previous research e.g. ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span> showing that severe overgrazing and resultant land degradation led to higher temperatures in these ecoregions. Given that these ecoregions host many endemic species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span>, our results warn against future changes regarding species extinction risk, rearrangement of ecological communities, and ecosystem functioning.
