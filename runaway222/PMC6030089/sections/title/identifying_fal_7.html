      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For EWIs to be ecologically meaningful, one has to test whether the observed trends
         are different from the ones that would have been obtained by chance. To test whether
         trends computed for the composite EWI in each pixel were true positives, we generated
         1,000 surrogate time series with the same length and autocorrelation structure as
         the original residual time series i.e. after the seasonal component and the long-term
         trend have been removed
         <span><a>41</a></span>. The autocorrelation structure of the surrogate time series was set to the value
         estimated from the best linear autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) fitted to
         the original time series and identified using a stepwise selection procedure based
         on AIC. For each surrogate time series we then computed the composite EWI and calculated
         its long-term trend, as explained above. As a result we obtained a distribution of
         Kendall’s τ coefficients under the null hypothesis that there is no temporal trend
         in the composite EWI. Significance was defined as the percentage of simulated trends
         showing higher values than the observed trend with a threshold fixed to 10%. Because
         the overall procedure was very time-consuming, we only tested the significance of
         trends for the composite EWI.
