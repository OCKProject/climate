      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of EWIs as tools to identify critical transition has gained substantial interest
         in the field of ecology over recent years
         <span><a>6</a></span>. Most studies conducted so far used experiments
         <span><a>37</a></span>, simulations
         <span><a>10</a></span>, or empirical data from systems in which critical transitions occurred in the past
         <span><a>17</a></span> to investigate the ability of EWIs to detect tipping points before they occur. These
         retrospective studies revealed that several statistical features of time series can
         be used as EWIs of regime shifts, thus providing a framework to use them prospectively
         in order to explore systems in which tipping points are likely to be reached in the
         future. For instance, temperature has undergone several transitions in the past between
         a cold and a warm state
         <span><a>17</a></span> and may do so in the near future
         <span><a>38</a></span>. Here, we aimed to generate “risk evaluation maps” of upcoming tipping points in
         the temperature regime in both terrestrial and marine systems. Although the underlying
         mechanisms cannot be assessed with certainty, such exploration is of interest from
         both a conservation and a management point of view because ecological systems are
         expected to track changes in the climate system.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, we found strong and positive long-term trends in several EWIs, suggesting
         that some areas over the world may undergo a transition toward a qualitatively different
         climate state in the future. Regardless of the EWI considered, trends were not uniformly
         distributed across the world which can be explained by several factors. For instance,
         if we consider that shifts in temperature time series occur for the same value of
         the forcing regime (e.g. land-use changes), then spatial variations in that regime
         will generate spatial variations in EWIs. Alternatively, transitions between alternative
         stable states may occur for different values of the forcing regime
         <span><a>39</a></span> and may also explain spatial variations in EWIs. Temperature is also influenced by
         several components (e.g. surface reflectivity due to land-use changes, changes in
         greenhouse gases concentration) of which each can display a nonlinear response to
         some variables on different time scales
         <span><a>40</a></span>. Beyond spatial variations, we found differences regarding the information provided
         by the different EWIs either in their spatial distribution or in the strength and
         the sign of their trends. Those differences could be due to differences in the underlying
         phenomenon driving the system toward a tipping point. For instance, areas showing
         positive trends for the coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis (e.g. Amazonian
         forest) could indicate flickering where the system switches back and forth between
         alternative stable states in response to externally imposed perturbations having large
         impacts
         <span><a>20</a></span>. In contrast, positive trends for autocorrelation and variance (e.g. south Pacific)
         could suggest that CSD is the underlying phenomenon
         <span><a>41</a></span> and therefore that small and gradual (as opposed to large and stochastic) changes
         in external conditions are driving the system to the bifurcation point
         <span><a>42</a></span>. More complex combinations of trends can occur depending on the behavior and the
         mathematical properties of the systems. For instance, when the rates of change of
         the state variable are slow relative to the frequency characteristics of the regime,
         the variance may decrease close to a tipping point while the autocorrelation may increase
         <span><a>24</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trends highlighted for the five EWIs can also involve mechanisms that are not
         related to critical transitions
         <span><a>43</a>,
            <a>44</a></span>. For example, changes in noise and certain external drivers can push a system from
         a point attractor to a non-point attractor, where it starts to fluctuate more frequently
         <span><a>45</a></span>. Likewise, systems that have experienced strong environmental perturbations (e.g.
         hurricanes) can display transient responses before returning to their equilibrium
         <span><a>46</a></span>. These changes do not involve tipping points or shifts between alternative stable
         states but would still be characterized by an increase in the variability of the system,
         mimicking an approaching critical transition, even though temporal autocorrelation
         is not expected to change in those cases
         <span><a>41</a></span>. The direct consequence of this is that the use of a single EWI can be flawed and
         lead to false alarms under certain conditions
         <span><a>22</a>,
            <a>23</a></span>. To mitigate limitations and sources of uncertainty associated with the use of single
         EWI, several authors e.g.
         <span><a>10</a>,
            <a>16</a>,
            <a>18</a></span> have suggested to use multiple EWIs, while others have argued that the detection
         of tipping points can only be achieved by considering both variance and autocorrelation
         <span><a>47</a></span>. Since multiple EWIs have been shown to increase at the vicinity of tipping points,
         either due to flickering or CSD
         <span><a>20</a></span>, the use of a composite indicator might be particularly useful because it would make
         it possible to highlight congruent patterns among various EWIs, and thus provide further
         support for upcoming critical transitions
         <span><a>8</a>,
            <a>27</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using such an indicator, we found that particular areas over the world showed strong
         and positive trends with about one fourth of pixels in both systems being true positives.
         From those pixels at least, it suggest that some areas (e.g. Australia, Greenland,
         Equatorial Pacific) are likely to experience a drastic shift in the temperature regime
         in the future. For the remaining pixels (i.e. those showing negative trends or positive
         but weak trends), although they might indicate that the system is not approaching
         a critical transition, they might as likely be false negatives, given that EWIs may
         sometimes fail to indicate a critical transition
         <span><a>25</a>,
            <a>48</a></span>. Regarding our composite indicator, false negatives can occur in regions where EWIs
         are expected to have opposite signs, such as when different mechanisms are at play.
         Those cases are not easy to distinguish without additional knowledge about the behavior
         and the mathematical properties of the system. When such a knowledge is accessible,
         one can refine the composite indicator to reflect congruent trends among EWIs. For
         instance, ref.
         <span><a>27</a></span> multiplied the trends of some of their EWIs by −1 to match the positive trend expected
         for other EWIs. The spatial scale and the number of time series considered here do
         not make it possible to use such an approach and we therefore cannot rule out the
         possibility that the absence of signal found in some areas (e.g. Boreal forest ecoregions
         which have undergone strong changes in land-cover across the past decades) are false
         negatives.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As already shown for other facets of climate change
         <span><a>3</a>,
            <a>49</a></span>, we found that the trends obtained from the composite EWI varied with latitude and
         between ecoregions for both terrestrial and marine systems. In particular, we found
         that both extremes of the latitudinal gradients along with areas located in between
         the Equator and the Tropics displayed strong signal in terrestrial systems, whereas
         the signal was the strongest around the Equator in marine systems. This discrepancy
         between the two systems might either stem from differences in the forcing regime or
         in the physical climate-related mechanisms between the two systems. For instance,
         deepening of the mixed layer is a physical mechanism related to water depth and wind
         speed that can explain the critical slowing down of sea surface temperatures in the
         North Pacific domain
         <span><a>50</a></span>. By contrast, positive feedbacks related to changes in snow cover can influence surface
         reflectivity (albedo) which can amplify changes at the poles
         <span><a>51</a></span> and explain the strong signals found in the northern part of the latitudinal gradient
         in terrestrial systems. The contrasting pattern (i.e. low signal) found at this latitude
         for the marine system could, on the other hand, be explained by the fact that this
         region is already beyond a bifurcation point and in the middle of a critical transition
         to a warmer state.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importantly, most of the areas showing the strongest signals in the terrestrial system
         correspond to areas that have undergone strong changes in land-use (e.g. Australia,
         west coast of the US)
         <span><a>52</a></span> or land-cover (e.g. forest cover in Zambia, Angola, Surinam; snow cover in north
         Canada)
         <span><a>53</a></span> over the past decades. By modifying the energy budget balance, these changes have
         been shown to have consequences on several climatic variables, including temperature
         <span><a>35</a>,
            <a>36</a></span>, and our results suggest that these changes might trigger drastic changes in the
         temperature regime in the future. The strong signal highlighted in the northern part
         of the Canada is particularly concerning as a large proportion of this area is composed
         of permafrost containing large amounts of carbon with a potential high incidence for
         global warming
         <span><a>54</a></span>. Likewise, the strong signal found in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean where the El Niño-Southern
         Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO) takes place is worrisome given that this phenomenon
         is one of the most important process underlying climate variability at large spatial
         scales
         <span><a>55</a></span> and that year to year transitions between a warm (El-Niño) and a cold (La Niña) state
         have already been highlighted
         <span><a>56</a></span>. Overall, it is interesting to note that the areas showing the strongest signals
         (e.g. ENSO, Greenland) closely match with the tipping elements hypothesized by ref.
         <span><a>57</a></span> with respect to critical transitions in the climate system.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within systems, we found strong variations between ecoregions, as already highlighted,
         for climate velocities
         <span><a>3</a>,
            <a>58</a></span> or other components of the climate system
         <span><a>59</a></span>. This suggests that the probability of upcoming critical transitions is likely to
         vary depending on the ecological conditions prevailing in a given region and especially
         the changes to which this region has been submitted to. For instance, Mediterranean
         ecoregions have undergone large changes in land-use over the last decades
         <span><a>60</a></span> and were those showing the strongest evidence of upcoming critical transitions. Likewise,
         some ecoregions rated as “arid” (e.g. Australia) showed strong signals, a pattern
         that is in line with some previous research e.g. ref.
         <span><a>61</a></span> showing that severe overgrazing and resultant land degradation led to higher temperatures
         in these ecoregions. Given that these ecoregions host many endemic species
         <span><a>62</a></span>, our results warn against future changes regarding species extinction risk, rearrangement
         of ecological communities, and ecosystem functioning.
