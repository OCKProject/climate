 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For all EWIs, we found large spatial variations in their temporal trends but the patterns highlighted greatly varied with respect to their geographical distribution and the strength of their trends (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). For instance, Greenland and Northeast Canada displayed strong and positive trends for the autocorrelation at first lag, but no trends for the standard deviation. A similar discrepancy between these two indicators was found around the Equator in Africa, but in the opposite direction. In the marine system, we found a strong signal in the south Pacific with respect to standard deviation and autocorrelation at first lag but not signal for skewness and kurtosis (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>).

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the five EWIs, four contributed approximately equally to the trends estimated with the composite EWI whereas the coefficient of variation had less influence (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Trends for the composite EWI were also greatly variable in space, pointing to areas with strong and positive trends where the congruency among individual EWIs is maximized in both terrestrial (e.g. Center of Australia, Greenland; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>) and marine (e.g. the equatorial Pacific; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>) systems. The congruency among EWIs was further reinforced by the fact that more than 90% of the pixels showing positive trends for the composite EWI in terrestrial (94.5%) and marine (90.2%) systems also showed positive trends for at least three of the five EWIs. Using a type I error rate of 10% (see methods), we found that pixels showing the strongest trends (i.e. above 0.5) were mostly true positives (Supplementary Material Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>) and represented 27% and 22% of the pixels displaying positive trends in terrestrial and marine systems, respectively.

The contribution was calculated as the absolute difference between the original trends and the trends obtained after one of the five EWIs had been removed for the construction of the composite metric.

     <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7</a>, respectively). Latitudinal gradient is represented as the average value of positive trends calculated at each latitudinal band. To help visualize the gradient we overlaid a smooth linear component. This component was estimated with a generalized linear additive model with average Kendall’s τ as the dependent variable and Latitude as the independent variable. The degree of smoothness was estimated within the model using penalized likelihood maximization.

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In both systems, the average value of pixels with positive trends varied with latitude, although in different ways. Marine systems exhibited a strong signal around the Equator, which tended to decrease at higher or lower latitudes with a particularly low signal at the northern extreme of the latitudinal gradient (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>). The pattern was different in terrestrial systems. The signal was low around the equator and the two Tropics (i.e. 30° North and 30° South) but was higher in between those latitudes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). We further found a high signal at both extreme of the latitudinal gradient. Results obtained for the composite EWI were overall robust to varying window length and detrending bandwidth, with only slight variations in the estimated trends (Supplementary Material Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>–
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>). Given that skewness and kurtosis have mixed support in the literature, we also investigated spatial patterns in trends using a composite metric not including them. Overall, we found no obvious qualitative differences relative to the patterns highlighted with the full composite metric, although trends in some areas (e.g. Southern part of the latitudinal gradient in marine systems) were quantitatively affected (Supplementary Material Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>).

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within terrestrial systems, polar ecoregions showed the strongest trends in the composite EWI whereas cold and tropical regions were the ecoregions showing the lowest trends (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). At a finer scale, Mediterranean forests, woodlands and scrub showed the strongest trends (Supplementary Material Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). We also found differences within marine systems. The Indo-Pacific and the Southern Ocean ecoregions exhibited the strongest trends in the composite EWI, whereas the Arctic ecoregion showed the lowest trends (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Four marine ecoregions (temperate South-America, tropical Eastern-Pacific, Western Indo-Pacific and temperate Australasia) displayed particularly strong trends (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>).
