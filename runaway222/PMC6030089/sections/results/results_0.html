      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For all EWIs, we found large spatial variations in their temporal trends but the patterns
         highlighted greatly varied with respect to their geographical distribution and the
         strength of their trends (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). For instance, Greenland and Northeast Canada displayed strong and positive trends
         for the autocorrelation at first lag, but no trends for the standard deviation. A
         similar discrepancy between these two indicators was found around the Equator in Africa,
         but in the opposite direction. In the marine system, we found a strong signal in the
         south Pacific with respect to standard deviation and autocorrelation at first lag
         but not signal for skewness and kurtosis (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the five EWIs, four contributed approximately equally to the trends estimated
         with the composite EWI whereas the coefficient of variation had less influence (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). Trends for the composite EWI were also greatly variable in space, pointing to areas
         with strong and positive trends where the congruency among individual EWIs is maximized
         in both terrestrial (e.g. Center of Australia, Greenland; Fig. 
         <a>3a</a>) and marine (e.g. the equatorial Pacific; Fig. 
         <a>3c</a>) systems. The congruency among EWIs was further reinforced by the fact that more
         than 90% of the pixels showing positive trends for the composite EWI in terrestrial
         (94.5%) and marine (90.2%) systems also showed positive trends for at least three
         of the five EWIs. Using a type I error rate of 10% (see methods), we found that pixels
         showing the strongest trends (i.e. above 0.5) were mostly true positives (Supplementary
         Material Fig. 
         <a>S1</a>) and represented 27% and 22% of the pixels displaying positive trends in terrestrial
         and marine systems, respectively.

               <p>Contribution of the five EWIs to the trends estimated by the composite metric. The
                  contribution was calculated as the absolute difference between the original trends
                  and the trends obtained after one of the five EWIs had been removed for the construction
                  of the composite metric. The box represent the lower quartile, median, and upper quartile

                  <span>b</span>) and marine (
                  <span>c</span>,
                  <span>d</span>) systems. Since negative trends are not indicative of approaching critical transitions,
                  only positive trends are represented for graphical purposes (high resolution maps
                  are provided in the supplementary material for both terrestrial and marine systems;
                  Figs 
                  <a>S6</a> and 
                  <a>S7</a>, respectively). Latitudinal gradient is represented as the average value of positive
                  trends calculated at each latitudinal band. To help visualize the gradient we overlaid
                  a smooth linear component. This component was estimated with a generalized linear
                  additive model with average Kendall’s τ as the dependent variable and Latitude as
                  the independent variable. The degree of smoothness was estimated within the model
                  using penalized likelihood maximization.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In both systems, the average value of pixels with positive trends varied with latitude,
         although in different ways. Marine systems exhibited a strong signal around the Equator,
         which tended to decrease at higher or lower latitudes with a particularly low signal
         at the northern extreme of the latitudinal gradient (Fig. 
         <a>3d</a>). The pattern was different in terrestrial systems. The signal was low around the
         equator and the two Tropics (i.e. 30° North and 30° South) but was higher in between
         those latitudes (Fig. 
         <a>3b</a>). We further found a high signal at both extreme of the latitudinal gradient. Results
         obtained for the composite EWI were overall robust to varying window length and detrending
         bandwidth, with only slight variations in the estimated trends (Supplementary Material
         Figs 
         <a>S2</a>–
         <a>S4</a>). Given that skewness and kurtosis have mixed support in the literature, we also
         investigated spatial patterns in trends using a composite metric not including them.
         Overall, we found no obvious qualitative differences relative to the patterns highlighted
         with the full composite metric, although trends in some areas (e.g. Southern part
         of the latitudinal gradient in marine systems) were quantitatively affected (Supplementary
         Material Fig. 
         <a>S5</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within terrestrial systems, polar ecoregions showed the strongest trends in the composite
         EWI whereas cold and tropical regions were the ecoregions showing the lowest trends
         (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). At a finer scale, Mediterranean forests, woodlands and scrub showed the strongest
         trends (Supplementary Material Table 
         <a>S2</a>). We also found differences within marine systems. The Indo-Pacific and the Southern
         Ocean ecoregions exhibited the strongest trends in the composite EWI, whereas the
         Arctic ecoregion showed the lowest trends (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). Four marine ecoregions (temperate South-America, tropical Eastern-Pacific, Western
         Indo-Pacific and temperate Australasia) displayed particularly strong trends (Supplementary
         Table 
         <a>S3</a>).

                  according to the median value of the composite EWI (black dotted line; values are
                  shown next to the name of each ecoregion). Some ecoregions were grouped together to
                  improve graphical representation, but detailed information for individual ecoregions
                  is provided in the supplementary material (Tables 
                  <a>S2</a> and 
                  <a>S3</a>). The delineation of biomes in terrestrial and marine systems was obtained from the
                  Köppen-Geiger climatic classification (
                  <span>http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at</span>) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Marine Ecoregions Of the World.
