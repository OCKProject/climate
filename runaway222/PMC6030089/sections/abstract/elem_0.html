      <p>Climate change metrics have been used to quantify the exposure of geographic areas
         to different facets of change and relate these facets to different threats and opportunities
         for biodiversity at a global scale. In parallel, a suite of indicators have been developed
         to detect approaching transitions between alternative stable states in ecological
         systems at a local scale. Here, we explore whether particular geographic areas over
         the world display evidence for upcoming critical transitions in the temperature regime
         using five Early Warning Indicators (EWIs) commonly used in the literature. Although
         all EWIs revealed strong spatial variations regarding the likelihood of approaching
         transitions we found differences regarding the strength and the distribution of trends
         across the world, suggesting either that different mechanisms might be at play or
         that EWIs differ in their ability to detect approaching transitions. Nonetheless,
         a composite EWI, constructed from individual EWIs, showed congruent trends in several
         areas and highlighted variations across latitudes, between marine and terrestrial
         systems and among ecoregions within systems. Although the underlying mechanisms are
         unclear, our results suggest that some areas over the world might change toward an
         alternative temperature regime in the future with potential implications for the organisms
         inhabiting these areas.
