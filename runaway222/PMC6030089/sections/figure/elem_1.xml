  <p>Contribution of the five EWIs to the trends estimated by the composite metric. The contribution was calculated as the absolute difference between the original trends and the trends obtained after one of the five EWIs had been removed for the construction of the composite metric. The box represent the lower quartile, median, and upper quartile of the data while whiskers point to minimum and maximum values. AR1 = autocorrelation at first lag; CV = coefficient of variation; Kurt = kurtosis; SD = standard deviation and SK = skewness.</p>
