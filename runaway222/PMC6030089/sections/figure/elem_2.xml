  <p>Worldwide trends (Kendall’s τ) and latitudinal gradient in the composite EWI in terrestrial (
   <span class="bold">a</span>,
   <span class="bold">b</span>) and marine (
   <span class="bold">c</span>,
   <span class="bold">d</span>) systems. Since negative trends are not indicative of approaching critical transitions, only positive trends are represented for graphical purposes (high resolution maps are provided in the supplementary material for both terrestrial and marine systems; Figs 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7</a>, respectively). Latitudinal gradient is represented as the average value of positive trends calculated at each latitudinal band. To help visualize the gradient we overlaid a smooth linear component. This component was estimated with a generalized linear additive model with average Kendall’s τ as the dependent variable and Latitude as the independent variable. The degree of smoothness was estimated within the model using penalized likelihood maximization.
