         <p>Map of biomes and histograms of the trends within each biome for terrestrial (left
            column) and marine (right column) systems. Histograms are ordered by increasing trends
            according to the median value of the composite EWI (black dotted line; values are
            shown next to the name of each ecoregion). Some ecoregions were grouped together to
            improve graphical representation, but detailed information for individual ecoregions
            is provided in the supplementary material (Tables 
            <a>S2</a> and 
            <a>S3</a>). The delineation of biomes in terrestrial and marine systems was obtained from the
            Köppen-Geiger climatic classification (
            <span>http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at</span>) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Marine Ecoregions Of the World.
