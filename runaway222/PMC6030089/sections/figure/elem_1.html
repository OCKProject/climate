         <p>Contribution of the five EWIs to the trends estimated by the composite metric. The
            contribution was calculated as the absolute difference between the original trends
            and the trends obtained after one of the five EWIs had been removed for the construction
            of the composite metric. The box represent the lower quartile, median, and upper quartile
            of the data while whiskers point to minimum and maximum values. AR1 = autocorrelation
            at first lag; CV = coefficient of variation; Kurt = kurtosis; SD = standard deviation
            and SK = skewness.
