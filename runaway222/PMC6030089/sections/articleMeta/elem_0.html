         <p>Climate change metrics have been used to quantify the exposure of geographic areas
            to different facets of change and relate these facets to different threats and opportunities
            for biodiversity at a global scale. In parallel, a suite of indicators have been developed
            to detect approaching transitions between alternative stable states in ecological
            systems at a local scale. Here, we explore whether particular geographic areas over
            the world display evidence for upcoming critical transitions in the temperature regime
            using five Early Warning Indicators (EWIs) commonly used in the literature. Although
            all EWIs revealed strong spatial variations regarding the likelihood of approaching
            transitions we found differences regarding the strength and the distribution of trends
            across the world, suggesting either that different mechanisms might be at play or
            that EWIs differ in their ability to detect approaching transitions. Nonetheless,
            a composite EWI, constructed from individual EWIs, showed congruent trends in several
            areas and highlighted variations across latitudes, between marine and terrestrial
            systems and among ecoregions within systems. Although the underlying mechanisms are
            unclear, our results suggest that some areas over the world might change toward an
            alternative temperature regime in the future with potential implications for the organisms
            inhabiting these areas.
