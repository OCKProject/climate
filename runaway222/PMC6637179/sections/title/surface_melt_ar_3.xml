 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison of the ice sheet surface melt area extents in 2012, 2013, and 2014 between the all-sky and clear-sky NHM–SMAP simulations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a–c</a>) illustrates that the presence of clouds played a role in enhancing the surface melt area extent, especially during summer, in every year. The difference in the ice sheet melt area extent due to clouds during JJA in 2012, 2013, and 2014 was 3.1%, 0.3%, and 0.7% of the total ice sheet area, respectively; thus, clouds had an exceptionally large effect on the GrIS surface melt in 2012. This result is attributable to warm air associated with the record North American heat wave, the transport of water vapour via an atmospheric river over the Atlantic Ocean to Greenland, and the presence of anomalously warm ocean waters south of Greenland observed in summer 2012

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simulated CRE during JJA (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d–f</a>) of these periods was high over the inland area of the ice sheet but very low in the ablation areas, where most meltwater production and runoff occurs. Another surface energy balance (SEB) component (see Methods for the definition of SEB), however, was indirectly but significantly affected by the presence or absence of clouds: Turbulent heat fluxes (sensible and latent heat fluxes; see Methods) differed depending on whether clouds were present during JJA in 2012, 2013, and 2014 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1g–i</a>), and the changes were particularly large in the low-elevation (&lt;1000 m a.s.l.) ablation areas of the southeast, west, and southwest regions of the ice sheet. As a result, JJA surface melt energy (see Methods) was increased on the inland ice sheet by the CRE (i.e., surface melt area extent was enhanced under all-sky conditions), whereas it was decreased in the ice sheet ablation areas by the indirect CRE (more surface melt could occur under clear-sky conditions) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1j–l</a>). For reference, the NHM–SMAP-simulated all-sky SEB results for JJA are displayed in Supplementary Figure

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we define the low-elevation areas (less than 1000 m a.s.l.) of the southeast, west, and southwest ice sheet shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> as the ablation areas of the southern and western regions of the GrIS. The area-averaged cloud fractions during the study period were lower over the ablation areas of the southern and western regions of the GrIS compared to those over the entire ice sheet (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Although the relatively small CRE in low-elevation areas can be attributed to low albedo in those areas, the lower cloud fraction might also have led to a smaller CRE. Quantitative impacts of cloud fraction on the ice sheet ablation area CRE is beyond the scope of this study; however, it should be examined further in the future. Moreover, the main contributor to the changes in net turbulent heat flux in the ablation areas of the southern and western regions of the GrIS was the latent heat flux (17.3 to 24.1 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>; Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> and Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). This result highlights the fact that for a comprehensive understanding of the role of clouds in the climate system around the ice sheet, it is not sufficient to examine only instantaneous changes in downward radiant fluxes induced by the presence or absence of clouds; it is also necessary to consider indirect time-integrated atmospheric feedbacks caused by the CRE. We discuss the cause of the large changes in latent heat flux during JJA in the ablation areas of the southern and western regions of the GrIS in relation to the presence or absence of clouds in the last section of this paper.
