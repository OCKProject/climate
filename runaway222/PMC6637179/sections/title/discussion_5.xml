 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated the validity of the atmospheric responses in a clear-sky model sensitivity test, as well as the cause of the large changes in latent heat flux during JJA in the ablation areas of the southern and western regions of the GrIS depending on the presence or absence of clouds. For this purpose, we examined changes in surface pressure, air temperature, the water vapour mixing ratio, and wind speed attributable to clouds.</p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During JJA, surface pressure around the ice sheet was higher under clear-sky conditions (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3a–c</a>; also see Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, and Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Latent heating in the atmosphere has been recognized to play an important role in reducing surface pressure; for example, rapid intensification of the 
  <span class="italic">Queen Elizabeth II</span> storm, an extratropical cyclone that developed in September 1978, was attributed mainly to diabatically-induced processes including latent heating, which induced a positive feedback between adiabatic and diabatic movements

  </span>. In addition, such a numerical experiment with the atmospheric part of NHM–SMAP (JMA–NHM
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>) has ever been conducted
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Therefore, we judge the qualitative atmospheric responses induced by the absence of clouds simulated in this study to be robust. In general, the surface pressure system over the ice sheet is considered to be strongly related to the general circulation pattern (the North Atlantic Oscillation index is a useful indicator of the relationship)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Our results suggest that atmospheric latent heating due to cloud formation over the ice sheet has a great effect on the general circulation pattern in the area.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">JJA inland surface air temperature was simulated to be higher under the all-sky conditions (Supplementary Figures 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3d–f</a>, also see Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> and Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>); this result can be attributed mainly to the enhancement of inland surface melt under the all-sky conditions reported above; however, because the changes in surface air temperature were very low in the ablation areas, it cannot account for the changes in latent heat flux there.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, increased surface moisture was simulated in the ablation areas under clear-sky conditions (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3g–i</a>, also see Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> and Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Once a high-pressure system has developed over the ice sheet because of the absence of clouds, moisture transport from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere is restrained; as a result, moisture is trapped in the low-elevation ablation areas around the ice sheet and downward latent heat flux there is increased. These results account for the higher latent heat flux during JJA in the ablation areas of the southern and western regions of the GrIS under clear-sky conditions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although it is well known that surface wind speed also affects surface turbulent heat fluxes, we found that JJA average changes in surface wind speed associated with the presence or absence of clouds over the ablation areas of the southern and western regions of the GrIS were very low during the study period (0.03, –0.19, and –0.09 m s
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for 2011–2012, 2012–2013, and 2013–2014, respectively). However, changes in surface wind speed due to the presence or absence of clouds are relatively high especially in the northern GrIS (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3j–l</a>), suggesting that the response of katabatic winds to cloud condition is relatively strong in the northern GrIS.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we did not discuss the effects of light-absorbing impurities such as black carbon and dust
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span> on the CRE and its resultant feedback processes. Although detailed investigation of the effects is beyond the scope of this paper, we suppose the CRE and its resultant feedback can be restrained due to the presence of light-absorbing impurities, because these reduce snow and ice albedo, and thus the absolute value of shortwave CRE becomes larger.
