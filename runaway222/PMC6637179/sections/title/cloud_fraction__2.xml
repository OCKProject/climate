   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> showed that NHM–SMAP successfully reproduced measured GrIS climate conditions and diurnal variations during our study period (2011–2014), which includes the 2012 record surface melt event
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. We introduce here the concept of “mass balance year
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>”, defined as from September of the first year to August of the following year, because it is needed to calculate annual accumulated and averaged values. Simulated cloud fractions for the 2011–2012, 2012–2013, and 2013–2014 mass balance years are listed in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>, respectively. Overall, the annual average cloud fraction above the entire ice sheet was around 0.5, but the cloud fraction averaged over the summer (June, July, and August; JJA) was relatively low (around 0.45). The area-averaged value of the simulated annual average ice sheet CRE during each of the three mass balance years (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) was around 20 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>. In the northern part of the ice sheet, as well as in low-elevation areas, the CRE was relatively small. Low albedo mainly due to the exposure of bare ice in the low-elevation areas, where most melt and runoff occur, obviously affected the low CRE, because low albedo enhances the shortwave CRE. Cloud height above the surface might also affect the CRE, which should be investigated further in the future. At Summit station (72.68°N, 38.58°W; see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), the CRE was estimated to be 33 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> from January 2011 to October 2013 by a radiative transfer model that used 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> measurements
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. The NHM–SMAP-simulated CRE at Summit station from September 2011 to October 2013 was lower (25 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>). However, comparison of CREs calculated by different techniques requires careful consideration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. The observation-based study mentioned above
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span> considered only instantaneous changes in downward radiant fluxes, whereas in the present study, we considered additional atmospheric feedbacks, which might account for the different result. We discuss the validity of the atmospheric responses of the clear-sky model sensitivity test conducted with NHM–SMAP in the last section of this paper.
