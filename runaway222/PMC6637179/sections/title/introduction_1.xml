  </span>. Changes in the ice sheet mass (mass balance, MB) are a function of the surface mass balance (SMB) and ice discharge across the grounding line (D), where the ice starts to float: MB = SMB – D. Before the 2000s, the absolute values of the rates at which SMB was decreasing and discharge was increasing were almost the same
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Recently, however, SMB has played a dominant role in the GrIS’s negative mass balance with more than 80% of mass loss attributed to increased surface runoff

  </span>, which is defined as water that flows away from the ice sheet into the surrounding ocean. SMB is a consequence of energy and mass interactions between the atmosphere and the snow or ice surface. The lowest annual GrIS SMB since the 1990s, attributable largely to a record surface melt event

  <sub>net</sub> and

  <span class="italic">S</span>
  <sub>net, clear-sky</sub>) is negative whereas the longwave CRE (

  <sub>net, all-sky</sub> − 
  <span class="italic">L</span>
  <sub>net, clear-sky</sub>) is positive. In polar regions covered with snow, which has a very high albedo, the longwave CRE is sometimes greater than the shortwave CRE (CRE is positive). This situation is known as the “radiation paradox
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>” where by surface heating can occur even under cloudy-sky conditions, so clouds act as a forcing factor on the climate system.

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the radiation paradox
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span> is qualitatively valid, quantitative impacts of both the CRE and its resultant feedback processes on the changes in (not short time event scale but) climatic ice sheet physical conditions, namely ice sheet-wide surface melt and the resultant SMB have not yet been fully evaluated. Recently, one study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>, which examined climatic trends for cloud fraction and the ice sheet SMB simulated by a regional climate model, found a relation: a decreasing cloud fraction has driven an ice sheet SMB reduction since around 1995. However, the quantitative impacts of clouds, as well as the underlying physical mechanisms by clouds on surface melting have not been sufficiently understood to rank their effects relative to other melt processes, although the importance of changes in the atmospheric circulation pattern over the ice sheet especially during the summer has been highlighted
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Here, we used the regional climate model NHM–SMAP
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> to perform a model sensitivity test investigating the role and effects of clouds in which atmospheric conditions were assumed to be adiabatic as well as zero cloud water/ice amounts, thus eliminating the CRE (see Methods for more detail). Then by comparing the results between control (all-sky) and sensitivity (clear-sky) simulations, we evaluated the quantitative effects of clouds on the ice sheet surface melt area extent and SMB from 2011–2014. Our method has an advantage in that it allows us to consider time-integrated atmospheric feedback processes imposed by instantaneous changes in downward radiative properties caused by the presence or absence of clouds; these time-integrated feedback processes were not taken into account by any previous studies.
