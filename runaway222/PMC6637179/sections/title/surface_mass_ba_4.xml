 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to the surface melt area extent result, comparisons of the annual accumulated ice sheet SMB within a mass balance year between the all-sky and clear-sky NHM–SMAP simulations show exactly the opposite impact of the CRE (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a–c</a>): The annual accumulated ice sheet SMB at the end of August simulated under clear-sky conditions was less positive than (2011–2012), or almost equal (2012–2013 and 2013–2014), to that simulated under all-sky conditions, although the winter to spring accumulation rates under all-sky conditions were lower than those under clear-sky conditions during the entire study period. Here, note that the same spatial and temporal precipitation rate patterns were used in the sensitivity test as in the control all-sky simulation, because our focus here was on only the CRE and its resultant atmospheric feedbacks. The reason why the above-mentioned differences in the winter to spring accumulation rates were made is discussed later in this section.

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyses of each SMB component (see Methods) showed that surface sublimation during the winter to spring accumulation period was enhanced under all-sky conditions (see Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> and Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>; the difference during March, April, and May [MAM] of each year was 0.02 mm water equivalent [w.e.] day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). This result can be attributed to the difference in the simulated MAM surface air temperature due to the presence or absence of clouds; simulated MAM surface air temperatures over the entire ice sheet under all-sky conditions were higher by more than 2 K than those under clear-sky conditions in each year (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> and Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Note, however, that because air temperatures were still very low during MAM, the energy available for surface melt, was not affected by the difference between all-sky and clear-sky conditions. During JJA of 2012, 2013, and 2014, clouds played a role in reducing daily area-averaged runoff from the ice sheet by 0.91, 0.45, and 0.57 mm w.e. day
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (ice sheet-integrated runoff of 1.6, 0.8, and 1.0 Gt day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), respectively (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> and Supplementary Tables

 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, more refreezing can occur under clear-sky conditions, mainly because of night-time longwave cooling, than under all-sky conditions. Therefore, we investigated melt and refreezing rates during the study period (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d–f</a>; see also Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> and Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>) and found changes in these SMB-related area-averaged components due to the presence or absence of clouds for both the ablation areas of the southern and western regions of the GrIS and the entire ice sheet. These results indicate that refreezing in the ablation areas of the southern and western regions of the GrIS was not enhanced even under clear-sky conditions, because the higher latent heat flux under clear-sky conditions prevented surface cooling even at night in the ablation areas of the southern and western regions of the GrIS.
