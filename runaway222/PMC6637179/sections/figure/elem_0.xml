  <p>Impacts of clouds on the ice sheet surface melt area extent and on SEB simulated during JJA by NHM–SMAP. (

   <span class="bold">c</span>), Temporal changes in the ice sheet-wide surface melt area extent in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively, for the all-sky and clear-sky cases. (

   <span class="bold">f</span>), Cloud radiative effects; (

   <span class="bold">i</span>), changes in turbulent heat fluxes; and (
   <span class="bold">j</span>–
   <span class="bold">l</span>), changes in the surface melt energy during JJA due to the presence of clouds in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. All SEB values were obtained by subtracting the clear-sky simulation results from the all-sky simulation results. Contours on the ice sheet and peripheral ice caps indicate surface elevation (contour interval 1000 m). 
   <span class="italic">In situ</span> measurement stations mentioned in this paper are indicated in panel d. The southeast (SE), west (W), and southwest (SW) drainage regions of the ice sheet are shown in panels j, k, and l.
