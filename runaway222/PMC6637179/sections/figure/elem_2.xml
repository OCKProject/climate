  <p>Impacts of clouds on the ice sheet-wide SMB simulated by NHM–SMAP. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>–
   <span class="bold">c</span>) Temporal evolution of the accumulated ice sheet SMB during the three mass balance years (2011–2012, 2012–2013, and 2013–2014) under all-sky and clear-sky conditions. (
   <span class="bold">d</span>–
   <span class="bold">f</span>) Temporal changes in the daily differences in melt and refreezing rates caused by the presence of clouds averaged over the ablation areas of the southern and western regions of the ice sheet as well as the entire ice sheet during the 2011–2012, 2012–2013, and 2013–2014 mass balance years; all values were obtained by subtracting clear-sky simulation results from all-sky simulation results.
