  <p>Enhanced ice sheet surface melt area and melt amount due to clouds during JJA simulated by NHM–SMAP. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>–
   <span class="bold">c</span>), Differences in ice sheet-wide accumulated surface melt area and accumulated melt amount with respect to 1 June between all-sky and clear-sky simulations during 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. These properties were obtained by subtracting the clear-sky accumulated surface melt area and melt amount from those of the all-sky simulation.
