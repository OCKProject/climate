 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We applied a state-of-the-art physically based spatially and temporally high-resolution regional climate model called NHM–SMAP (Non-Hydrostatic atmospheric Model with the Snow Metamorphism and Albedo Process model) to the GrIS

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>; Japan Meteorological Agency Non-Hydrostatic atmospheric Model), we employed the “weather forecast mode”, in which the atmospheric profile is initialized every day by referring to parent reanalysis data (NHM–SMAP boundary conditions; in this study, the Japanese 55-year reanalysis JRA-55
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span> dataset) to prevent large deviations between the parent (JRA-55) and NHM–SMAP atmospheric fields. In the weather forecast mode calculations, a 30-h-long simulation was carried out every day, starting from 18:00 UTC of the previous day; model outputs from the initial 6 h spin-up period were discarded, and model outputs from the last 24 h were used. In JMA-NHM, the improved Mellor-Yamada Level 3 turbulence closure boundary layer scheme

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In numerical investigations of the effects of clouds on the changes in atmospheric field, it is not sufficient to modify only atmospheric radiation, because the presence or absence of clouds affects not only atmospheric radiation but also latent heating in the atmosphere (temperature profile in the atmosphere)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. According to a previous study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>, the interaction between clouds and circulation primarily results from three processes: phase changes, radiative transfer, and turbulent transport of air parcels, where condensation and evaporation processes associated with the formation, the maturation or the dissipation of clouds, and the interaction of clouds with solar and infrared radiation, lead to atmospheric heating and cooling perturbations, which stimulate waves and turbulence and which affect the horizontal and vertical distributions of temperature on a wide range of scales. Therefore, in the clear-sky numerical sensitivity test with NHM–SMAP performed in this study, we omitted latent heating in the atmosphere (i.e., condensation heating is set to zero; an adiabatic simulation was conducted) to account for the impacts of phase change, and also set cloud water/ice amounts to zero to assess the impacts of radiative transfer in the atmosphere. By omitting latent heating, the temperature lapse rate in the atmosphere does not follow the moist adiabatic lapse rate but always follows the dry adiabatic lapse rate. The dry adiabatic lapse rate (9.8 °C km
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) is higher than the moist adiabatic lapse rate because the latter is a result of latent heat release by the cloud formation. By setting cloud water/ice amounts to zero, clear-sky downward shortwave and longwave radiant fluxes can be calculated. At the same time, the model calculates changes in turbulent transport of air parcels in response to changes in the temperature lapse rate and downward radiant fluxes. In general, under the clear-sky condition, upward and downward vertical motions are expected to be suppressed, which would result in higher surface pressure
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Consideration of all the cloud-atmosphere interaction processes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span> in the numerical sensitivity experiment is a significant advantage of the present study. However, the same spatial and temporal precipitation rate patterns were used in the sensitivity test as in the control all-sky simulation, because our focus here was on only the CRE and its resultant atmospheric feedbacks.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mentioned above, temporal evolution of atmospheric fields was calculated in weather forecast mode in the control simulation. This model setting was also used in the sensitivity test; therefore, deviations in the atmospheric fields between the all-sky and clear-sky simulations are not expected to be large. Clouds are known as a “fast process” in the terrestrial climate system; therefore, examining the results of the clear-sky numerical sensitivity test on the weather forecast mode time scale can provide insights into the possible atmospheric responses to changes in cloud fraction not only over a period of several days but also on a much longer time scale

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the sensitivity test, profiles of snow and ice physical conditions were reset at the beginning of the 2011–2012, 2012–2013, and 2013–2014 mass balance years by referring to the control simulation data. As a result, feedbacks with a timescale of more than a year are beyond the scope of this study.
