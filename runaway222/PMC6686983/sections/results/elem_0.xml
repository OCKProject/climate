 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify the impacts on temperature and circulation of prescribing stratospheric ozone climatologies with different ZAO on temperature and circulation, we must first examine the behavior of ozone in each simulation which is ultimately driving our model differences. We can then compare the climatological performance of each of the noninteractive simulations using prescribed ozone to the fully coupled UKCA simulation. In this way we can identify which method results in the least divergence from the UKCA simulation and so could be said to have performed best.</p>

The figure highlights the interannual variability in the very good spatial correlation between ZAO and large‐scale dynamical features in the fully coupled UKCA and CALC‐AZ simulations, as well as the inconsistencies introduced between dynamical features and ozone distributions when fixed ozone is prescribed in both SPEC‐ZM and SPEC‐AZ. It also shows that the year with the lowest spatial correlation in UKCA (top left) occurs when there is substantial ozone depletion in the Arctic lower stratosphere, which reinforces the idea that the regression coefficient 
   <div class="inline-formula">

Much like the NH, the year with the lowest PV/ozone spatial correlation also has reduced polar cap ozone compared to the year of highest ozone (Figures

This is because the dynamical asymmetry of the Antarctic stratosphere is generally smaller than that of the Arctic, but it may also be influenced by our choice of the UKCA model for our interactive simulation, which has been shown to underrepresent the degree of zonal asymmetry seen in observational analyses (Dennison et al.,

    <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>e) and CALC‐AZ (Figure 
    <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>f). Neely et al. (
    <a rid="jame20869-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0028">2014</a>) showed that prescribing monthly mean climatological ozone leads to systematic biases in the temperature of the Antarctic lower stratosphere, and this undoubtedly is influencing SPEC‐ZM, SPEC‐AZ, and CALC‐AZ equally (hence the warming in SPEC‐ZM, Figure 
    <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>d). The inclusion of ZAO in SPEC‐AZ and CALC‐AZ is also enhancing the vertical wave flux into the lower stratosphere, which is facilitated by weakened westerlies during this period (as the descending easterlies of the final warming do not reach down to this level in the SH). The enhancement of vertical wave flux further warms and weakens the Antarctic vortex in SPEC‐AZ (Figure 
    <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>e) and CALC‐AZ (Figure 
    <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>f), which forces the final warming date to occur about a week earlier in these simulations (compared to 3 days earlier in SPEC‐ZM). Sheshadri and Plumb (
    <a rid="jame20869-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0036">2016</a>) suggest that differences in planetary wave activity, rather than changes in the final warming date itself, are responsible for influencing surface weather patterns around this time of year. Our results reinforce that idea, as we find the distribution of MSLP during NDJ is most similar to UKCA in the CALC‐AZ simulation with more realistic stratospheric dynamics, despite the change in final warming date. It follows that these zonal‐mean temperature differences in the lower stratosphere during NDJ are caused by a small number of days with large temperature differences, rather than as a seasonally warmer Antarctic cap over the 3‐month period.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to this logic, however, the ZAO present in UKCA must also warm the Antarctic vortex in a similar manner to SPEC‐AZ and CALC‐AZ. We conclude that there must exist processes which are resolved only in UKCA that work to cool the vortex to counter the dynamical heating from ZAO in the simulation. Indeed, the biases described by Neely et al. (
    <a rid="jame20869-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0028">2014</a>) are driven by processes like heterogeneous chemistry which allows zonal‐mean ozone to change on time scales much shorter than a prescribed monthly mean climatology can represent. These processes in UKCA are connected to negative values of 
    <div class="inline-formula">
     <span class="italic">α</span>
    </div> (e.g., Figure 
    <a rid="jame20869-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0002">2</a>) where dynamical asymmetries do not represent the behavior of ZAO in the atmosphere. Hence, the regions enclosed by the dashed contours in Figures 
    <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>d–
    <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>f highlight where heterogeneous ozone losses occur in UKCA, which keeps the vortex cold against the dynamical heating from ZAO. Furthermore, the NDJ temperature differences in the lower stratosphere are shifted slightly from the dashed contour region, highlighting the missing process of eddy transport which displaces the effects of heterogeneous chemistry from the vortex edge toward the pole in the UKCA simulation.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since both ZAO and dynamical asymmetries are much smaller in the SH than in the NH, zonal‐mean differences are more representative of the 3‐D system. Nevertheless, we present a series of Antarctic stereographs in Figure 
    <a rid="jame20869-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0008">8</a> of PV differences at 450 K (top row, measured in potential vorticity units), temperature differences at 70 hPa (middle row, measured in kelvins), and MSLP differences (bottom row, measured in hectopascals) for each simulation (columns). The PV differences in Figures 
    <a rid="jame20869-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0008">8</a>a–
    <a rid="jame20869-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0008">8</a>c are all centered on the Antarctic cap and show that the Antarctic vortex is consistently too strong when ozone is prescribed compared to UKCA. In SPEC‐AZ, these PV differences are significant more in the Western Hemisphere (and not as much in the Eastern Hemisphere), which is where the prescribed ZAO is lowest (Figures 
    <a rid="jame20869-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0004">4</a>c and 
    <a rid="jame20869-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0004">4</a>g). The magnitude of Antarctic ZAO is underestimated during wintertime in all prescribed‐ozone simulations compared to UKCA because we are unable represent ZAO arising from heterogeneous chemistry, and this decreased ZAO leads to a stronger and more circular vortex in these simulations.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are some consistent differences between UKCA and each of the three prescribed‐ozone simulations, which result from factors other than the direct interaction of ZAO and dynamics through the P1 pathway. For example, all prescribed ozone simulations show a large temperature increase in the uppermost stratosphere and mesosphere, of about 17 K above 1 hPa, below which there is significant cooling of about 0.5 K between 60
   <div class="inline-formula">
    <span class="sup">°</span>
   </div>S and 60
   <div class="inline-formula">
    <span class="sup">°</span>
   </div>N extending into the tropical midstratosphere (not shown). This feature in the mesosphere was described by Sassi et al. (
   <a rid="jame20869-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0035">2005</a>), and these high‐altitude temperature differences have also been remarked upon in studies by Gillett et al. (
   <a rid="jame20869-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0015">2009</a>), McCormack et al. (
   <a rid="jame20869-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0025">2011</a>), Peters et al. (
   <a rid="jame20869-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0030">2015</a>), and Silverman et al. (
   <a rid="jame20869-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0038">2017</a>) all of which compare zonally averaged ozone in a CCM to a fully interactive configuration. Sassi et al. (
   <a rid="jame20869-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0035">2005</a>) attribute this feature to the nonlinear addition of variations in radiative heating over diurnal cycles and bands of longitude, that acts only on the diurnal component of ZAO (this dominates the ZAO pattern in the mesosphere and tropical upper stratosphere).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we see a robust shift in the frequency (speeding up) of the quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO) in our experiments which prescribe the zonal‐mean value of ozone. The Unified Model has an internally generated QBO, which in the interactive UKCA simulation used for this study has a period of approximately 32 months. When ozone fields are prescribed, the QBO period becomes shorter; ~29 months in SPEC‐ZM and in CALC‐AZ, and ~30 months in SPEC‐AZ. All three of these simulations show significant cooling in the tropical upper stratosphere extending into midlatitudes, mentioned above. The small temperature decreases in this region suggest a general strengthening of tropical upwelling (vertical velocities from these simulations were not available, unfortunately), which would provide a consistent link with the shortening of the QBO period (e.g., Kawatani &amp; Hamilton, 
   <a rid="jame20869-bib-0322" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0322">2013</a>) in these simulations which prescribe ozone compared to UKCA. A recent study by Silverman et al. (
   <a rid="jame20869-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0038">2017</a>) has provided evidence that the QBO may modulate ZAO at midlatitudes. However, our results indicate that ZAO can in turn influence the QBO, a conclusion which can only be reached by using a model with an internally generated QBO (such as UKCA), setting up the possibility for two‐way interactions between ZAO and the QBO.
