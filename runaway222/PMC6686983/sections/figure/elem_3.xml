The dynamical behavior in the Southern Hemisphere is more similar across simulations than the Northern Hemisphere in Figure 
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0003">3</a>. This is because the dynamical asymmetry of the Antarctic stratosphere is generally smaller than that of the Arctic, but it may also be influenced by our choice of the UKCA model for our interactive simulation, which has been shown to underrepresent the degree of zonal asymmetry seen in observational analyses (Dennison et al.,
