 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are some consistent differences between UKCA and each of the three prescribed‐ozone simulations, which result from factors other than the direct interaction of ZAO and dynamics through the P1 pathway. For example, all prescribed ozone simulations show a large temperature increase in the uppermost stratosphere and mesosphere, of about 17 K above 1 hPa, below which there is significant cooling of about 0.5 K between 60

  <a rid="jame20869-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0035">2005</a>), and these high‐altitude temperature differences have also been remarked upon in studies by Gillett et al. (
  <a rid="jame20869-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0015">2009</a>), McCormack et al. (
  <a rid="jame20869-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0025">2011</a>), Peters et al. (
  <a rid="jame20869-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0030">2015</a>), and Silverman et al. (
  <a rid="jame20869-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0038">2017</a>) all of which compare zonally averaged ozone in a CCM to a fully interactive configuration. Sassi et al. (
  <a rid="jame20869-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0035">2005</a>) attribute this feature to the nonlinear addition of variations in radiative heating over diurnal cycles and bands of longitude, that acts only on the diurnal component of ZAO (this dominates the ZAO pattern in the mesosphere and tropical upper stratosphere).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we see a robust shift in the frequency (speeding up) of the quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO) in our experiments which prescribe the zonal‐mean value of ozone. The Unified Model has an internally generated QBO, which in the interactive UKCA simulation used for this study has a period of approximately 32 months. When ozone fields are prescribed, the QBO period becomes shorter; ~29 months in SPEC‐ZM and in CALC‐AZ, and ~30 months in SPEC‐AZ. All three of these simulations show significant cooling in the tropical upper stratosphere extending into midlatitudes, mentioned above. The small temperature decreases in this region suggest a general strengthening of tropical upwelling (vertical velocities from these simulations were not available, unfortunately), which would provide a consistent link with the shortening of the QBO period (e.g., Kawatani &amp; Hamilton, 
  <a rid="jame20869-bib-0322" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0322">2013</a>) in these simulations which prescribe ozone compared to UKCA. A recent study by Silverman et al. (
  <a rid="jame20869-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0038">2017</a>) has provided evidence that the QBO may modulate ZAO at midlatitudes. However, our results indicate that ZAO can in turn influence the QBO, a conclusion which can only be reached by using a model with an internally generated QBO (such as UKCA), setting up the possibility for two‐way interactions between ZAO and the QBO.
