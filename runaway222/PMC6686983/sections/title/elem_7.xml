 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis of temperature and dynamics is largely confined to the lower stratosphere at high latitudes throughout the duration of the polar vortex, where the interaction between our prescription of ZAO with dynamics has a significant impact on the modeled stratosphere. Significant temperature differences arising outside of the polar vortex are not related to our prescription of ZAO and are not considered in this section Additional information on differences during the final warming may be found in Figures

We attribute this polar cap temperature difference to a suppression in vertical wave flux entering the Arctic stratosphere in SPEC‐ZM, reducing poleward eddy heat transport and the dynamical heating of the vortex in this simulation.

Vector differences are consistently more upward pointing in SPEC‐AZ and CALC‐AZ compared to SPEC‐ZM within the solid contoured region during DJFM, which demonstrates the physical role of ZAO in enhancing planetary wave activity in the Arctic vortex during wintertime.

During this time of year, easterly winds descending into the lower stratosphere significantly reduce planetary wave activity, and the influence of ZAO on stratospheric dynamics becomes severely limited. As a result, the zonal‐mean temperature differences in SPEC‐ZM, SPEC‐AZ, and CALC‐AZ look very similar during April through June (Figures

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An interesting feature is the pattern of PV differences which arise in the SPEC‐ZM and SPEC‐AZ simulations. The significant enhancement of Arctic PV in SPEC‐ZM at 450 K (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0006">6</a>a) is very annular in shape, and closer inspection reveals that PV is further enhanced over northern Canada, where ozone in UKCA is higher on average (as seen in the prescribed SPEC‐AZ ozone field in Figures

   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0006">6</a>b shows that the North Atlantic region is too cold compared to UKCA. Finally, Figure

   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>e) and CALC‐AZ (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>f). Neely et al. (
   <a rid="jame20869-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0028">2014</a>) showed that prescribing monthly mean climatological ozone leads to systematic biases in the temperature of the Antarctic lower stratosphere, and this undoubtedly is influencing SPEC‐ZM, SPEC‐AZ, and CALC‐AZ equally (hence the warming in SPEC‐ZM, Figure 
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>d). The inclusion of ZAO in SPEC‐AZ and CALC‐AZ is also enhancing the vertical wave flux into the lower stratosphere, which is facilitated by weakened westerlies during this period (as the descending easterlies of the final warming do not reach down to this level in the SH). The enhancement of vertical wave flux further warms and weakens the Antarctic vortex in SPEC‐AZ (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>e) and CALC‐AZ (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>f), which forces the final warming date to occur about a week earlier in these simulations (compared to 3 days earlier in SPEC‐ZM). Sheshadri and Plumb (
   <a rid="jame20869-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0036">2016</a>) suggest that differences in planetary wave activity, rather than changes in the final warming date itself, are responsible for influencing surface weather patterns around this time of year. Our results reinforce that idea, as we find the distribution of MSLP during NDJ is most similar to UKCA in the CALC‐AZ simulation with more realistic stratospheric dynamics, despite the change in final warming date. It follows that these zonal‐mean temperature differences in the lower stratosphere during NDJ are caused by a small number of days with large temperature differences, rather than as a seasonally warmer Antarctic cap over the 3‐month period.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to this logic, however, the ZAO present in UKCA must also warm the Antarctic vortex in a similar manner to SPEC‐AZ and CALC‐AZ. We conclude that there must exist processes which are resolved only in UKCA that work to cool the vortex to counter the dynamical heating from ZAO in the simulation. Indeed, the biases described by Neely et al. (
   <a rid="jame20869-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0028">2014</a>) are driven by processes like heterogeneous chemistry which allows zonal‐mean ozone to change on time scales much shorter than a prescribed monthly mean climatology can represent. These processes in UKCA are connected to negative values of 
   <div class="inline-formula">
    <span class="italic">α</span>
   </div> (e.g., Figure 
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0002">2</a>) where dynamical asymmetries do not represent the behavior of ZAO in the atmosphere. Hence, the regions enclosed by the dashed contours in Figures 
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>d–
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>f highlight where heterogeneous ozone losses occur in UKCA, which keeps the vortex cold against the dynamical heating from ZAO. Furthermore, the NDJ temperature differences in the lower stratosphere are shifted slightly from the dashed contour region, highlighting the missing process of eddy transport which displaces the effects of heterogeneous chemistry from the vortex edge toward the pole in the UKCA simulation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since both ZAO and dynamical asymmetries are much smaller in the SH than in the NH, zonal‐mean differences are more representative of the 3‐D system. Nevertheless, we present a series of Antarctic stereographs in Figure 
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0008">8</a> of PV differences at 450 K (top row, measured in potential vorticity units), temperature differences at 70 hPa (middle row, measured in kelvins), and MSLP differences (bottom row, measured in hectopascals) for each simulation (columns). The PV differences in Figures 
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0008">8</a>a–
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0008">8</a>c are all centered on the Antarctic cap and show that the Antarctic vortex is consistently too strong when ozone is prescribed compared to UKCA. In SPEC‐AZ, these PV differences are significant more in the Western Hemisphere (and not as much in the Eastern Hemisphere), which is where the prescribed ZAO is lowest (Figures 
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0004">4</a>c and 
   <a rid="jame20869-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0004">4</a>g). The magnitude of Antarctic ZAO is underestimated during wintertime in all prescribed‐ozone simulations compared to UKCA because we are unable represent ZAO arising from heterogeneous chemistry, and this decreased ZAO leads to a stronger and more circular vortex in these simulations.
