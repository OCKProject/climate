 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We now consider differences in the SH during both the wintertime (July through October), when the magnitude of ZAO is large (though not as large as in the NH winter, Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0001">1</a>e), and the springtime (November through January, NDJ) covering the breakup of the Antarctic polar vortex and onset of stratospheric summer. Analogous to Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0005">5</a>, Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a> shows the zonal‐mean temperature differences in the Antarctic stratosphere during these two periods of interest, with the top row showing how the wintertime vortex differs from UKCA and the bottom row showing how the final warming differs from UKCA.

  </div>S. Both dynamical asymmetries and ZAO are much smaller during wintertime in the Antarctic than in the Arctic (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0001">1</a>e), and so the overall differences in ozone between the simulations are much smaller in this region. The inclusion of ZAO in SPEC‐AZ (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>b) and CALC‐AZ (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>c) leads to an increase in vertical wave flux in the solid contoured region, which was also seen in the Arctic wintertime (Figures 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0005">5</a>b and 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0005">5</a>c).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the final warming was well represented in the NH (Figures

  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>f show that all the prescribed‐ozone simulations are unable to accurately represent the final warming SH, particularly SPEC‐AZ (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>e) and CALC‐AZ (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>f). Neely et al. (
  <a rid="jame20869-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0028">2014</a>) showed that prescribing monthly mean climatological ozone leads to systematic biases in the temperature of the Antarctic lower stratosphere, and this undoubtedly is influencing SPEC‐ZM, SPEC‐AZ, and CALC‐AZ equally (hence the warming in SPEC‐ZM, Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>d). The inclusion of ZAO in SPEC‐AZ and CALC‐AZ is also enhancing the vertical wave flux into the lower stratosphere, which is facilitated by weakened westerlies during this period (as the descending easterlies of the final warming do not reach down to this level in the SH). The enhancement of vertical wave flux further warms and weakens the Antarctic vortex in SPEC‐AZ (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>e) and CALC‐AZ (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>f), which forces the final warming date to occur about a week earlier in these simulations (compared to 3 days earlier in SPEC‐ZM). Sheshadri and Plumb (
  <a rid="jame20869-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0036">2016</a>) suggest that differences in planetary wave activity, rather than changes in the final warming date itself, are responsible for influencing surface weather patterns around this time of year. Our results reinforce that idea, as we find the distribution of MSLP during NDJ is most similar to UKCA in the CALC‐AZ simulation with more realistic stratospheric dynamics, despite the change in final warming date. It follows that these zonal‐mean temperature differences in the lower stratosphere during NDJ are caused by a small number of days with large temperature differences, rather than as a seasonally warmer Antarctic cap over the 3‐month period.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to this logic, however, the ZAO present in UKCA must also warm the Antarctic vortex in a similar manner to SPEC‐AZ and CALC‐AZ. We conclude that there must exist processes which are resolved only in UKCA that work to cool the vortex to counter the dynamical heating from ZAO in the simulation. Indeed, the biases described by Neely et al. (
  <a rid="jame20869-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20869-bib-0028">2014</a>) are driven by processes like heterogeneous chemistry which allows zonal‐mean ozone to change on time scales much shorter than a prescribed monthly mean climatology can represent. These processes in UKCA are connected to negative values of 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <span class="italic">α</span>
  </div> (e.g., Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0002">2</a>) where dynamical asymmetries do not represent the behavior of ZAO in the atmosphere. Hence, the regions enclosed by the dashed contours in Figures 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>d–
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0007">7</a>f highlight where heterogeneous ozone losses occur in UKCA, which keeps the vortex cold against the dynamical heating from ZAO. Furthermore, the NDJ temperature differences in the lower stratosphere are shifted slightly from the dashed contour region, highlighting the missing process of eddy transport which displaces the effects of heterogeneous chemistry from the vortex edge toward the pole in the UKCA simulation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since both ZAO and dynamical asymmetries are much smaller in the SH than in the NH, zonal‐mean differences are more representative of the 3‐D system. Nevertheless, we present a series of Antarctic stereographs in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0008">8</a> of PV differences at 450 K (top row, measured in potential vorticity units), temperature differences at 70 hPa (middle row, measured in kelvins), and MSLP differences (bottom row, measured in hectopascals) for each simulation (columns). The PV differences in Figures 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0008">8</a>a–
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0008">8</a>c are all centered on the Antarctic cap and show that the Antarctic vortex is consistently too strong when ozone is prescribed compared to UKCA. In SPEC‐AZ, these PV differences are significant more in the Western Hemisphere (and not as much in the Eastern Hemisphere), which is where the prescribed ZAO is lowest (Figures 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0004">4</a>c and 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0004">4</a>g). The magnitude of Antarctic ZAO is underestimated during wintertime in all prescribed‐ozone simulations compared to UKCA because we are unable represent ZAO arising from heterogeneous chemistry, and this decreased ZAO leads to a stronger and more circular vortex in these simulations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temperature differences from UKCA at 70 hPa are largely insignificant in all simulations, although the Antarctic vortex in SPEC‐ZM shows some significant differences well within 1 K over the continent (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20869-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20869-fig-0008">8</a>d). All simulations overestimate MSLP in the Weddell sea (Figures
