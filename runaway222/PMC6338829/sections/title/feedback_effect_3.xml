 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Integrating economic processes into our model changed the sign and magnitude of the gain of the carbon–climate feedback because of the relatively strong temperature sensitivity of fossil fuel emissions. We illustrate this sensitivity in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>. In our model, a 1% decline in fossil fuel emissions per °C of climate warming corresponded to a decrease in the gain of the carbon–climate feedback of about 0.05, a decrease in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> of 28 ppm compared with our net natural scenario, and a feedback-driven temperature decline of 0.1 °C by 2100. Although the sensitivity function was nonlinear, we fit a linear model through our upper and lower bounds from our fully coupled scenario to estimate this unit effect. Because our fully coupled scenario had an average emissions sensitivity of about −3% per °C, this reduced the gain of the carbon–climate feedback from a positive value in our net natural scenario (+0.13) to slightly below zero in our fully coupled scenario (−0.02) (

   <p>The carbon cycle response to economic damages in our model under RCP8.5. The black curve was derived by simulating a range of potential emissions damages per degree (shown along the 
    <span class="italic">x</span> axis) in our model and computing the resultant cumulative carbon–climate feedback gain over the period from 1800 to 2100. The steep slope of the curve suggests that even small changes in the temperature sensitivity of fossil fuel emissions may have significant consequences for the carbon cycle. Overlaid on the curve are points showing specific results from our fully coupled and net natural scenarios. Comparing these scenarios shows the overall effect on the carbon cycle of including an economic carbon–climate feedback in our model. The fully coupled scenario has an approximate fossil fuel temperature sensitivity of −3.1% per °C, resulting in a decrease in the gain of 0.15 from the net natural scenario.
