  <p>Diagram of the relationship between the economic and natural carbon cycle processes considered in this analysis. In our model, we included carbon–climate feedbacks on the natural carbon cycle from warming effects on ocean stratification, soil decomposition, and net primary productivity (NPP). We then used this base model to explore effects from global temperatures on the economic carbon cycle through population, GDP, the energy intensity of GDP, and the carbon intensity of energy. These effects translate into a temperature-driven effect on fossil fuel emissions through the Kaya identity (

   </a>) in our model, which then has consequences for atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> and land and ocean uptake of carbon, as well as temperature. The signs shown indicate a net direct (+) or inverse (−) relationship between each upstream and downstream process in our model. Further discussion of the uncertainty of the signs of the economic relationship is given in
