  <p>Net effects of including only natural, only economic, or both sets of feedbacks in our model compared with the baseline (no feedbacks) scenario. All values shown are given as the difference between the baseline and that scenario. (
   <span class="italic">A</span> and 
   <span class="italic">B</span>) Air temperature and atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> over the 21st century with uncertainty bounds on the fully coupled and net economic scenarios. Natural carbonâ€“climate feedbacks (net natural) increased atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> and temperature, whereas economic feedback processes (net economic) decreased them. The net economic effect more than offset the net natural, so the fully coupled scenario showed an overall negative effect on temperature and atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub>. (
   <span class="italic">C</span> and 
   <span class="italic">D</span>) The change in temperature and atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> from 1800 to 2100 for these scenarios along with decompositions of the contributions to each net effect. For the natural carbon cycle, effects from the land and ocean in our model were similar in magnitude. Temperature effects on GDP drove the net economic effect strongly down, and although the carbon intensity of energy (carbon intensity) response caused a slight increase, the overall effect was dominated by GDP. Both net natural and net economic simulations also had some nonlinear interaction effects that were not captured by our decoupled scenarios.
