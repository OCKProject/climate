  <p>The carbon cycle response to economic damages in our model under RCP8.5. The black curve was derived by simulating a range of potential emissions damages per degree (shown along the 
   <span class="italic">x</span> axis) in our model and computing the resultant cumulative carbon–climate feedback gain over the period from 1800 to 2100. The steep slope of the curve suggests that even small changes in the temperature sensitivity of fossil fuel emissions may have significant consequences for the carbon cycle. Overlaid on the curve are points showing specific results from our fully coupled and net natural scenarios. Comparing these scenarios shows the overall effect on the carbon cycle of including an economic carbon–climate feedback in our model. The fully coupled scenario has an approximate fossil fuel temperature sensitivity of −3.1% per °C, resulting in a decrease in the gain of 0.15 from the net natural scenario.
