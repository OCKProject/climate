 <div class="caption">
  <p>A comparison of different economic and natural carbon cycle feedbacks on the Earth system. (
   <span class="italic">A</span>–
   <span class="italic">C</span>) The effect on the carbon cycle of including economic feedback effects over the 21st century. Our fully coupled scenario (solid), which includes both natural and economic carbon–climate feedbacks, has lower emissions, atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub>, and temperature than our net natural scenario (dashed), which includes no temperature effects on fossil fuel emissions. These effects are seen most strongly in the latter half of the century when temperature increases are larger. (
   <span class="italic">D</span>–
   <span class="italic">F</span>) Changes in cumulative fluxes, atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration, and temperature for each scenario from 1800 to 2100. The net natural carbon–climate feedback drives atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> and temperature above the no feedbacks scenario baseline, whereas the net economic feedback lowers these values below baseline. Our GDP and population scenarios both result in negative effects on emissions, although the GDP effect is considerably more pronounced, whereas our energy intensity and carbon intensity scenarios contribute to slight increases in fossil fuel emissions.
