Our analysis provides a framework for assessing such economic responses and comparing climate feedbacks in integrated assessment and earth system models. A better understanding of the potential effect of an economically driven feedback may improve our ability to estimate limits on cumulative emissions necessary to meet specific climate stabilization targets. We find that a net negative feedback from economic damages on fossil fuels may be strong enough to offset the positive feedback from terrestrial and marine ecosystems; however, these economic losses may disproportionately affect vulnerable populations and make climate mitigation more difficult.</p></abstract><abstract><p>As the Earth warms, carbon sinks on land and in the ocean will weaken, thereby increasing the rate of warming. Although natural mechanisms contributing to this positive climate&#x02013;carbon feedback have been evaluated using Earth system models, analogous feedbacks involving human activities have not been systematically quantified. Here we conceptualize and estimate the magnitude of several economic mechanisms that generate a carbon&#x02013;climate feedback, using the Kaya identity to separate a net economic feedback into components associated with population, GDP, heating and cooling, and the carbon intensity of energy production and transportation. We find that climate-driven decreases in economic activity (GDP) may in turn decrease human energy use and thus fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In a high radiative forcing scenario, such decreases in economic activity reduce fossil fuel emissions by 13% this century, lowering atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> by over 100 ppm in 2100. The natural carbon&#x02013;climate feedback, in contrast, increases atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> over this period by a similar amount, and thus, the net effect including both feedbacks is nearly zero. Our work highlights the importance of improving the representation of climate&#x02013;economic feedbacks in scenarios of future change. Although the effects of climate warming on the economy may offset weakening land and ocean carbon sinks, a loss of economic productivity will have high societal costs, potentially increasing wealth inequity and limiting resources available for effective adaptation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>carbon cycle feedbacks</kwd><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>economic damages</kwd><kwd>integrated assessment models</kwd><kwd>fossil fuels</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">National Science Foundation (NSF)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000001</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">DGE-1321846</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Dawn Woodard</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000104</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">80NSSC18K0179</award-id><principal-award-recipient>James T Randerson</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs3"><funding-source id="sp3">Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (Gordon E. and Betty I.

In the oceans, increasing stratification weakens anthropogenic carbon flow into the ocean interior, while rising temperatures simultaneously reduce CO<sub>2</sub> solubility (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Previous studies have quantified the relative importance of different natural feedback processes by using Earth system models to isolate and estimate the gain of the carbon&#x02013;climate feedback as a function of the models&#x02019; climate sensitivity, the sensitivity of ocean and land carbon reservoirs to warming, and the sensitivity of these same reservoirs to rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, although there are a number of mechanisms by which fossil fuel emissions may be affected by temperature (see, for example, ref. <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), emissions remain an exogenous, temperature-insensitive input to most Earth system models (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).

Rising temperatures will have direct effects on human mortality through various avenues including heat exposure, disease spread, extreme weather events, and food and water scarcity (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Climate change will also alter economic productivity through direct effects on labor productivity from heat stress, infrastructure damage, and resource diversion and losses (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These effects on population and economic output overall tend to indirectly decrease energy use and thus fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Increased temperatures will also change energy use more directly by influencing heating and cooling demands in residential and commercial sectors, the balance of which determines the overall sign of this effect (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Additionally, rising temperatures will affect thermoelectric power production, electricity distribution, and transportation systems by decreasing energy efficiency and thereby increasing emissions from fossil fuel-burning infrastructure (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Diagram of the relationship between the economic and natural carbon cycle processes considered in this analysis.

We conceptualize drivers of the economic carbon&#x02013;climate feedback through the Kaya identity, using a set of scenarios to isolate feedbacks on population (hereafter referred to as our population scenario), GDP per capita (GDP scenario), the energy intensity of GDP (energy intensity scenario), and the carbon intensity of energy (carbon intensity scenario) individually, as well as a scenario combining GDP and carbon intensity processes (net economic scenario). We also include a baseline (no feedbacks scenario), which allows natural carbon fluxes in our model to respond to rising CO<sub>2</sub> but not to rising temperatures, and a scenario that includes only natural carbon&#x02013;climate feedback processes (net natural scenario). Previous work has referred to this latter scenario as fully coupled (for example, refs. <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), but we reserve the term fully coupled here for our final scenario, which is the combination of the net natural and net economic scenarios (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1805187115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S1</ext-link>, for more detail on our simulation design).</p><p>For our baseline forcing data, we use historical socioeconomic data and assume future fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and energy and population projections from the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) simulation for Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).

The fully coupled scenario has an approximate fossil fuel temperature sensitivity of &#x02212;3.1% per &#x000b0;C, resulting in a decrease in the gain of 0.15 from the net natural scenario.</p></caption><graphic id="gra4" xlink:href="pnas.1805187115fig04"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p content-type="flushleft">Our results indicate that the economic feedback has the potential to reverse the sign of the overall carbon&#x02013;climate feedback, but the significance of the effect is highly sensitive to the relationship between climate and GDP. If the effect of climate on GDP is large and dominates the feedback, the economic carbon feedback counteracts the response of the natural carbon cycle. However, if this temperature&#x02013;GDP effect is more in line with estimates like those in the 2016 version of DICE model (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), we can expect that the economic contribution to the carbon&#x02013;climate feedback will instead add slightly to the natural positive gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>), somewhat increasing future temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p>Our estimate of climate effects on fossil emissions is substantially higher than a previous analysis from the Environmental Impact and Sustainability Applied General Equilibrium (ENVISAGE) model, which found a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 4.7% from their economic feedbacks by 2100 (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This is likely driven by the choice of economic damage function. The damages found by Burke et al. (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) are larger than those used in ENVISAGE as well as those used in many other models because Burke&#x02019;s analysis broadly includes any climate-driven effects that would be reflected in GDP over the past half century. The sum of the effects considered in ENVISAGE we expect to be lower because only certain economic sectors were included. For example, both extreme weather and catastrophic events are not included in the ENVISAGE simulations (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), whereas the GDP damages from Burke et al. (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) are general enough to include such effects.</p><p>By propagating upper and lower uncertainty bounds for each term in the Kaya identity through our model, we have attempted to illustrate the spread of potential outcomes. Additionally, although we have made every effort to use reasonable values, it was necessary to make several major assumptions to maintain the simplicity of our model and not attempt to replicate a full integrated assessment model, because that is beyond the scope of this work. A key future challenge is to quantify economic carbon&#x02013;climate feedbacks within and across integrated assessment models that account for more complex interactions among different sectors and processes.</p><p>Improving estimates of the economic carbon&#x02013;climate feedback is particularly relevant because important tradeoffs exist with respect to the societal effects of strong versus weak economic damage functions. Although a stronger damage function in response to rising temperature appears to imply that it may be easier to match emissions reductions targets, this comes at an economic cost that would likely make it more difficult for vulnerable regions to respond to climate change effects (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Moreover, such economic and social costs entailed by stronger damage functions are likely to be large and inequitably distributed because climate change is expected to worsen already existing economic vulnerabilities (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Natural disasters, for example, have higher death tolls in lower-income areas and in countries without democratic institutions (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In our globally averaged model, the Burke et al. relationship led to GDP losses of 22% by 2100 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1805187115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S2</ext-link>). In just the United States by the end of the century, the poorest third of counties are predicted to experience losses of 2&#x02013;20% of income, whereas the richest third may experience losses of only 7% up through potential benefits of 1.2% of income (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Any potential benefit in terms of lower emissions from a negative economic feedback only exists because nations necessarily lose so much productivity, in the form of human lives, agriculture, infrastructure, and labor, that this reduction in economic activity lowers their fossil fuel emissions.</p><p>Strong versus weak economic damage functions also may have implications for the distribution of climate effects across natural and human systems. A weaker economic damage function, for example, would allow more CO<sub>2</sub> to accumulate in the atmosphere, causing higher surface air temperatures. Accelerated warming, in turn, would cause greater damages in terrestrial and marine ecosystems, including losses of net primary production and biodiversity on land (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and the disruption of critical nutrient supply pathways in the ocean (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Thus, although natural and economic feedbacks are likely opposite in sign, carbon&#x02013;climate feedbacks driven by higher temperatures have net damaging effects on both natural and human systems.</p><p>The strength of both economic and natural feedbacks varies significantly over the globe, so regional carbon cycle effects may be considerably stronger or weaker than the global mean (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Economic activities driving the carbon&#x02013;climate feedback at the local level will include changes in tourism revenue, damages from sea level rise and wildfires, and locally varying patterns of energy use. For example, Isaac and Van Vuuren (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) found that India showed a very strong effect of temperature on energy demand, in contrast to their finding of a much less significant effect globally. The economic climate feedback from energy use would overall be expected to be higher in areas with quickly increasing GDP and population as well as larger predicted climate effects.</p><p>In the model used here, we have considered a limited number of both natural and economic processes. We tuned our simple natural carbon cycle model to match the mean behavior of the CMIP5 models, but these models are missing key natural processes such as the permafrost carbon reservoir and its sensitivity to thaw (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and are weak in their representation of other drivers of the carbon&#x02013;climate feedback including the representation of ecological tipping points within the Amazon (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). On the economic-driven side, we do not include any feedbacks associated with climate effects on land use. Recent work indicates these would be expected to contribute to a positive economic carbon&#x02013;climate feedback (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), mitigating slightly the negative effects of the GDP feedback described here. It is also worth acknowledging that there are other human-driven feedbacks that fall outside of the carbon&#x02013;climate feedback. One example is an economic carbon&#x02013;concentration feedback associated with the benefits of increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> on crops. There are also potential economic effects associated with climate-driven human migration, which could have varied effects on climate through both carbon and noncarbon pathways. Beyond carbon feedbacks entirely, there may be policy-driven feedbacks that influence aerosols and albedo.</p><p>Our results provide a baseline effort to assess the economic carbon&#x02013;climate feedback and compare it to the natural feedback by unifying the different contributing mechanisms and processes within a single framework. More broadly, we show how methodology for carbon cycle feedback analysis can be extended to the economic sector, for future assessment of integrated assessment models. Our model results have demonstrated that an economic carbon&#x02013;climate feedback has the potential to significantly counteract the warming contribution of land and ocean feedbacks; however, the benefits of this negative economic feedback in terms of the carbon cycle will likely be offset by substantial economic and societal costs. Earth system models that neglect these economic feedback processes may significantly overestimate the carbon&#x02013;climate feedback. Future research to better characterize the nature and scale of economic disruptions from climate change will reduce uncertainty and allow this feedback to be better incorporated into integrated assessment and Earth system models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s5"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p content-type="flushleft">Details of our analytic method are available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1805187115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, <italic>SI Materials and Methods</italic></ext-link>.

All scenarios include natural carbon&#x02013;concentration feedback processes, but carbon&#x02013;climate feedbacks are isolated in different scenarios as summarized in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1805187115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S1</ext-link>. The no feedbacks scenario is our baseline for comparison and includes only natural carbon cycle responses to rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, neglecting both human responses and land and ocean responses to warming.

The population scenario adds estimates of climate-related deaths (but no other human responses) (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) onto the baseline scenario. The energy intensity scenario includes only modeled changes in energy demand for heating and cooling of residential and commercial buildings (following ref. <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) on top of the baseline. The carbon intensity scenario includes only temperature-related changes in the efficiency of electricity production, electricity distribution, and transportation (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1805187115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, <italic>SI Materials and Methods</italic>, Fig. S4, and Table S7</ext-link> for details) in addition to the baseline. The GDP scenario incorporates economic damages due to climate change, using the nonlinear relationship found by Burke et al. (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) as a best estimate. The net economic scenario is the economic parallel to the net natural and includes carbon intensity responses and GDP responses (i.e., effects on the Kaya factors <inline-formula><mml:math id="i3"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="i4"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which influence emissions in opposite directions as temperature increases) but excludes our independent estimates of population and energy intensity responses because these may be subsumed into GDP damages. Finally, our fully coupled scenario combines the net natural and net economic scenarios to include both economic and natural carbon&#x02013;climate feedbacks on top of the baseline scenario.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.1805187115.sapp.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program under Grant DGE-1321846.
