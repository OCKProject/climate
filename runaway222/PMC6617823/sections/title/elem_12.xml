 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How to interpret consensus when all models have common systematic biases?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is often assumed that model agreement means less uncertainty in the prediction. This is a warranted conclusion in those cases in which the simulated response is consistent with established theory—the obvious example being the projection of warming for the global mean temperature. Yet there are cases in which theory does not set firm expectations and common systematic biases across models suggest caution, as all models might be wrong in the same way.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two common model shortcomings have the potential to greatly affect projections of Sahel rainfall. First, the equatorial ocean–atmosphere system is poorly simulated, leading to biases in the simulated structure of the ITCZ and of El Niño anomalies (Li &amp; Xie, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0085">2014</a>). It has been suggested (Coats &amp; Karnauskas, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0028">2017</a>) that a systematic bias is why CMIP‐class models simulate equatorial warming in historical simulations, contrary to observations. The equatorial warming is also a major feature of future projections. What would it mean for the Sahel if those projections were to be proven wrong? Following our current understanding of the mechanisms by which the tropical SSTs affect Sahel rainfall, we speculate that the wetting signal would strengthen without the additional warming in the equatorial Pacific, because of a lesser increase in stability and a more pronounced relative warming in the Atlantic and Mediterranean.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second shortcoming of GCMs is their misrepresentation of development and organization of rain systems over land. One known consequence is that the modeled profile of time‐mean ascent is biased toward deep clouds (Roehrig, Bouniol, Guichard, Hourdin, &amp; Redelsperger, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0113" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0113">2013</a>). We can speculate that if the models simulated a more realistic bottom‐heaviness in the ascent profile, the simulated Sahel rainfall would probably be less susceptible to the increase stability driven by the tropical warming (Giannini et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0048">2013</a>; Hill et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0062">2017</a>), resulting in even wetter conditions in response to GHG. Limitations in the convective parametrization have also been implicated in common biases in the diurnal cycle, the intensity distribution, and the temporal coherence of rainfall (Covey et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0031">2016</a>; Roehrig et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0113" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0113">2013</a>). The effects of these systematic biases on the response to GHG are not amenable to speculation, as they depend on the interaction of clouds and radiation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Convection resolving simulations are coming online and may provide further guidance (Marsham et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0093">2013</a>; Stratton et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0131" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0131">2018</a>; Vizy &amp; Cook, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0146" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0146">2017a</a>). These simulations are an important addition to our toolkit. In particular, because they resolve the dynamics of rain‐bearing systems, they provide our best assessment of the mechanisms by which rainfall characteristics and intensity distribution might change in the coming decades. Nevertheless, they are not a panacea that can increase overall model reliability and reduce uncertainty in projections. For one thing, even though they have improved rainfall characteristics at the weather scale, models that resolve the convective scale can show persistent regional and seasonal biases (e.g., in Stratton et al. (
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0131" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0131">2018</a>) summertime rainfall biases are much reduced near orography, but not elsewhere). Additionally, most convection‐resolving simulations are performed on regional domains and thus depend on boundary conditions from global models, which are likely to affect the character of the regional projections (Kendon et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0073">2017</a>). The experience with regional climate models paired with different global models suggests that convection‐resolving models would both inherit uncertainties from the driving models and introduce their own (Mariotti, Coppola, Sylla, Giorgi, &amp; Piani, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0091">2011</a>; Pinto, Jack, &amp; Hewitson, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0111" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0111">2018</a>). Moreover, the coupling between the atmosphere and the vegetation might be as significant as the characteristics of rainfall in determining outcomes such as land productivity (see Box 
  <a rid="wcc591-fea-0002" ref-type="boxed-text" href="#wcc591-fea-0002">2</a>), so that one should be mindful of the trade‐offs between prioritizing model resolution (cloud‐resolving models) or model complexity (earth system models).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crop models driven by idealized or projected changes in atmospheric drivers (temperature, rainfall, radiation) simulate a decline in grain yields across the entire Sahel due primarily to increased mean temperature, with potential wetter or drier conditions and elevated CO
    <sub>2</sub> concentrations acting to modulate the loss (Sultan &amp; Gaetani, 
    <a rid="wcc591-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0132">2016</a>). But the effect of warming on vegetation has itself generally been interpreted as increased water stress, via an increase in water vapor deficit (which is a robust consequence of warming through the Clausius Clapeyron equation). Commonly used measures of aridity include an evaporative demand term and thus increase with increases in vapor deficit (Scheff &amp; Frierson, 
    <a rid="wcc591-bib-0121" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0121">2015</a>)—even in regions where precipitation is not declining.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within such a perspective, evapotranspiration variability is seen as driven by the atmospheric demand; in reality, plants exert a much stronger control. High CO
    <sub>2</sub> concentration affects the physiological behavior of plants: CO
    <sub>2</sub> fertilization increases vegetation and leaf area but at the same time reduces stomata opening. The net effect is to limit transpiration, which in turns leads to additional warming and drying of the near‐surface atmosphere. But if a reduction in evapotranspiration is, 
    <span class="italic">in part</span>, a cause of warming, the latter should not be used to infer changes in the former. Yet, this is what is done in offline calculations of aridity, which therefore overestimate the effect of warming, water stress, and crop loss (Berg &amp; Sheffield, 
    <a rid="wcc591-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0007">2018</a>). Coupled calculations sidestep this problem and generally indicate overall increase of net primary productivity even where aridity measures trend up. In the Sahel, coupled models indicate negligible change in net primary productivity and root‐zone soil moisture (Berg, Sheffield, &amp; Milly, 
    <a rid="wcc591-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0008">2017</a>; Wieder, Cleveland, Smith, &amp; Todd‐Brown, 
    <a rid="wcc591-bib-0150" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0150">2015</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even so, bulk measures of greenness do not capture grain yield (total mass in seed filling, as opposed to leaf area), nor the nutritional value of the grains (which is likely to decrease as the growing season shortens; Uddling, Broberg, Feng, &amp; Pleijel, 
    <a rid="wcc591-bib-0142" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0142">2018</a>). A refined assessment using climate‐crops coupled models and real‐world manipulations is necessary to fully understand the effect of CO
    <sub>2</sub> on agricultural productivity.
