 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A ZOOMING PERSPECTIVE ON SAHEL RAINFALL</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variability in Sahel rainfall is inextricably connected with the variability of the atmospheric circulation. We can think of ascent in the African rain band as a facet of the planetary Hadley circulation, which exports energy from regions of net energy input (the warm tropics) to regions of net energy output (the higher latitudes) (Biasutti et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0016">2018</a>). According to this perspective, Sahel rainfall variations are governed by global‐scale constraints.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yet, the seasonal accumulation of rainfall across the Sahel is the aggregate of weather features that are, in comparison, short‐lived (a few hours) and small‐scale (a few 100s km in diameter). Specifically, 70–90% of the annual precipitation (the smaller percentage in the southern–Sudanian–zone) in West Africa is produced by Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs): fast‐moving squall lines and larger Mesoscale Convective Complexes (Fink, Vincent, &amp; Ermert, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0041">2006</a>; Mathon, Laurent, &amp; Lebel, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0094">2002</a>). For this reason, the same continental‐scale variability that has been explained through planetary‐scale constraints also ought to be explained in terms of what controls the triggering and growth of storms. This leads to a more regional perspective, one that emphasizes the dynamical features controlling wind shear and moisture, which are key environmental variables for the development of mesoscale storms (Houze, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0063">2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Explaining the mechanisms of variability of Sahel rainfall, thus, might require that we emphasize aspects of the system that range from the planetary to the mesoscale. We review these complementary perspectives here and we refer to them in our discussion of trends.</p>

   <a ref-type="fn" rid="wcc591-note-0002" href="#wcc591-note-0002">1</a> variability for seasonal to multidecadal time scales, namely its meridional shift, can be explained considering the role of atmospheric circulation in the planetary energy budget. The Hadley cell transports moisture into the ITCZ in its lower branch and transports energy away from the ITCZ in its upper branch (see the faded circulation depicted in Figure 
   <a rid="wcc591-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc591-fig-0002">2</a>a). In the mean, the ITCZ is just north of the equator, with the net result that energy is moved from the Northern Hemisphere (NH) into the Southern Hemisphere (SH) (Marshall, Donohoe, Ferreira, &amp; McGee, 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0092">2014</a>). If the NH experiences anomalous heating, the atmosphere partially compensates by rearranging the circulation so that there is enhanced transport of heat 
   <span class="italic">away</span> from the NH. For this to happen, more moisture needs to be transported 
   <span class="italic">into</span> the NH and the ITCZ must shift to the north (see schematic in Figure

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The regional convective center</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explain tropical influences on Sahel rainfall variability, it is useful to emphasize that the Sahel is a zonally‐confined rainy region, that is, to emphasize the distinction from the ITCZ without necessarily emphasizing the specific geography of the region. The essential process is that strong convection is happening elsewhere in the tropics and the Sahel feels its effect (see schematic in Figure 
   <a rid="wcc591-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc591-fig-0003">3</a>). The key elements of the teleconnection mechanism are (a) moist convection links surface temperature (more accurately, surface moist energy) to the free troposphere temperature and (b) the tropics can sustain only weak temperature gradients. Where convection happens frequently, the environment comes to be in statistical equilibrium with it: convection dissipates any new Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), updrafts from the boundary layer homogenize the atmospheric column, and the final result is that the temperature of the troposphere is close to moist neutrality. With a weak Coriolis effect, the tropics cannot support pressure gradients away from the surface, and thus their free‐troposphere temperature must be homogeneous at time scales longer than those of atmospheric waves. Putting these two constraints together requires that the temperature profile of the tropics be that of the moist adiabat corresponding to the precipitation‐weighted average of the tropical surface temperature (Flannaghan et al., 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0042">2014</a>).

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We recognize the effect of this mechanism in the response of the Sahel to ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) variability (Giannini, Biasutti, Held, &amp; Sobel, 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0047">2008</a>; Rowell, 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0115">2001</a>): During an El Niño, the Warm Pool rainfall extends further into the warmer water, the entire tropical troposphere warms up, and the warm upper‐level anomalies increase the atmospheric stability over the Sahel region, thus dampening rain‐producing moist convection and causing drought. The same mechanism applies more widely than in the ENSO case—and in particular it ought to apply to the global warming case (Giannini, 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0046">2010</a>; Giannini et al., 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0047">2008</a>): If the tropical oceans warm, the tropical atmosphere will switch to a warmer moist adiabat. And because warmer moist adiabats are also more stable, the Sahel will experience an upped ante for convection (Chou &amp; Neelin, 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0026">2004</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dynamics of Sahel rainfall variability are inextricably connected with the dynamics of the West African Monsoon (WAM). Associated with ascent in the rain band is a divergent circulation, with low‐level southerly flow converging moisture into the Sahel and compensating divergence extending over the depth of the free troposphere. Intertwined with the divergent circulation are the geostrophic circulations: into the Sahara Heat Low (SHL) at low levels and around the anticyclones at mid and upper levels. The anticyclones are associated with two distinct jets, the African Easterly Jet, AEJ, and the Tropical Easterly Jet, TEJ. In Figure 
   <a rid="wcc591-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc591-fig-0001">1</a>a we have shown the low‐level circulation that accompanies the seasonal rainfall. The map view highlights the westerly component of the monsoonal wind and the easterly component of the Harmattan crossing the Sahara (stream lines); also highlighted is the position of the band of maximum mid‐level easterlies that comprise the AEJ. But the zonal component of the flow is not the only important regional feature distinguishing the monsoon circulation from the Hadley cell. Another difference is emphasized in Figure 
   <a rid="wcc591-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc591-fig-0004">4</a> which provides a schematic of the meridional structure of the circulation over West Africa. Superimposed on the deep moist cell that produces the rain band is a shallow circulation: at the surface the southerly flow penetrates well north of the rain band and into the pressure minimum associated with the SHL, shallow and dry ascent maximizes at the ITD, and the northerly return flow of Saharan dry air at about 600mb penetrates into the rain band.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many previous reviews (e.g., Nicholson, 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0099">2013</a>) have provided an in depth discussion of the dynamics of the WAM. Here we just want to highlight how its complexity leads to several paths of influence on Sahel rainfall. Changes in the position of the SHL, in the strength of the dry advection within the shallow circulation return flow, or in the moisture supplied by the monsoon flow can independently affect the large‐scale moisture convergence and atmospheric stability at the latitude of the Sahel. Additionally, because vertical and horizontal wind shears are a source of energy for atmospheric waves, changes in the mean flow can influence rainfall indirectly, via the coupling of synoptic disturbances with moist convection. This coupling is discussed below.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">About 80–90% of the total rainfall amount in the Sahel comes from storms that are especially well organized—they are larger than 80–100,000 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> and live longer than 6 hr—in spite of those storms being just 11% of the total MCS population (Mathon et al., 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0094">2002</a>). Seasonal rainfall variability, thus, likely depends on the controls upon the number and intensity of such organized storms. The complex links between rainfall, mesoscale storms, and synoptic‐scale forcings are shown in Figure 
   <a rid="wcc591-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc591-fig-0005">5</a>. Wind shear is a key source of organization for convective systems (Houze, 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0063">2004</a>) and indeed most squall lines in West Africa are associated with the presence of the AEJ (see also Figure 
   <a rid="wcc591-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc591-fig-0001">1</a>a), their tracks shifting north and south over West Africa in association with the jet's seasonal migration (Fink &amp; Reiner, 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0040">2003</a>; Mathon et al., 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0094">2002</a>). Convective episodes are triggered by thermal forcing (especially from elevated terrain, Laing et al., 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0081">2008</a>), but they are often organized by the moist and sheared environment provided by AEW, which transport moisture northward between the trough and ridge and enhance the low‐level vertical shear ahead of the trough (Figure 
   <a rid="wcc591-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc591-fig-0005">5</a>b). The system is coupled, as AEW are also enhanced by moist convection (Cornforth, Hoskins, &amp; Thorncroft,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the importance of AEW for weather prediction in West Africa cannot be overstated, at the climate scale (monthly and longer) the connection between rainfall variability and either the number or the amplitude of AEW is still debated. For example, while Lafore et al. (
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0080">2017</a>) show from case studies how some of the most intense storms in West Africa are associated with the passage of multiple AEWs, in general AEW‐forced squall lines “exhibit no extraordinary characteristics (lifetime, propagation speed, size, and rain rate)” (Fink &amp; Reiner, 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0040">2003</a>). Moreover, Laing et al. (
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0081">2008</a>) show that rainfall propagates faster than most AEWs, which would seem to suggest that internal organization of the convective system might be more important than the organization provided by the waves (see Figure 
   <a rid="wcc591-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc591-fig-0005">5</a>c). Even so, the variability in the large‐scale fields is bound to imprint on the variability of MCSs, as both shear and mid‐level moisture can directly affect the organization of convective systems by their influence on evaporative downdraughts, cold pools, and inflow.
