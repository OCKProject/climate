 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How to handle model disagreement in climate projections?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the other end of the uncertainty spectrum is the possibility that the ensemble of coupled models provides a broad range of contradicting projections (Chadwick et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0023">2016</a>) or that outlier models buck what would otherwise be a consensus (Held et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0058">2005</a>). Is it still possible to extract reliable information?
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate models are routinely validated against observations, but there is no single metric by which we can rank models from worst to best (Gleckler, Taylor, &amp; Doutriaux, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0050">2008</a>; Pierce, Barnett, Santer, &amp; Gleckler, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0110">2009</a>). Depending on our research interest, we may focus on the distribution of clouds, or the position of the wind jets, or the timing of monsoon onset, and different models would rank differently for these different metrics.
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="wcc591-note-0009" href="#wcc591-note-0009">8</a> The impact literature has often focused on assessing the consequence of climate change by considering anomalies that are either the middle‐of‐the‐road estimate or the estimate by some “better” model. This approach is risky, because it does not consider the full spectrum of possible futures (Kendon, Jones, Kjellström, &amp; Murphy, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0074">2010</a>). Better to embrace the diversity of model projections as a (partial) estimate of the uncertainty in the climate forecast. Unfortunately, this requires large resources, especially when dynamical downscaling is required, and might not always be advisable.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An emerging approach was described by Zappa and Shepherd (
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0153" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0153">2017</a>). Their starting point is that, in most cases, uncertainty in climate sensitivity translates into stronger or weaker regional anomalies for warmer or cooler futures, but it does not cause uncertainty in the sign of regional changes, while the intractable uncertainty in regional climate change comes from discrepancies in projected circulation anomalies (Collins et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0029">2018</a>; Xie et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0151" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0151">2015</a>). Observed teleconnections and theoretical arguments are then used to provide a link between qualitatively different global patterns (the “storylines”) and regional circulation anomalies. A full range of plausible future climate anomalies is thus created from plausible storylines, and an optimal set of boundary conditions for impact studies is obtained by selecting for downscaling at least one global model per storyline. This approach has not yet been exploited for African climate, but it promises to be useful to integrate low‐probability‐high‐risk scenarios in impact studies. Given what we have learned about the mechanisms driving Sahel rainfall anomalies, we suggest that the relevant storylines would describe (a) a range of developments for the SHL and (b) a range of SST gradients between the global tropics and the northern Atlantic. For the former, model uncertainty lies mostly in the specific location of the anomalous low and is most relevant for the determination of subregional gradients in rainfall anomalies. For the latter, the uncertainty is much larger, as it includes uncertain outcomes in the ocean dynamic response in the Pacific (resulting in El Niño‐like or La Niña like SST anomalies) and in the Atlantic overturning circulation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A complementary approach would seek to reduce uncertainty regarding the steps to be taken for adaptation, rather than in the climate information that underpins it (Kalra et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0069">2014</a>). For example, adaptation planning might start with the assessment of a system's vulnerabilities to climate and test whether an adaptation is robust to uncertain climate scenarios or whether the uncertainty is so great that an adaptive management plan is needed. This approach requires that decision‐makers and scientists collaborate in the co‐production of climate information (Kniveton et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0076">2015</a>), namely to determine and explore the range of plausible scenarios relevant to a given adaptation problem.
