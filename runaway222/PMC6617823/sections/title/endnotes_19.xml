  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ITCZ has been defined in the literature in many ways (see the discussion in Nicholson, 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0100" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0100">2018</a>). Here we use the term to refer to the zonal mean tropical precipitation and we characterize its position as the latitude of the precipitation centroid (Bischoff &amp; Schneider,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A Mediterranean source for moisture is also found when moisture sources are calculated a posteriori from reanalyses, but this is possibly an artifact of the back trajectory method in cases where rainfall is caused by convergence at low levels along a line between humid and arid air.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We consider the two together because reduced leaf cover and dry soils have qualitatively similar effects: they cause increases in albedo, but decreases in evapotranspiration and a net warming of surface temperature.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most simulations also include the history of solar output and volcanic eruptions, but the effect of such natural forcings is not considered here. The general understanding is that solar variability has had little impact on the surface climate, and that volcanic eruptions have tended to decrease monsoon rainfall in general, and in the Sahel in particular (Haywood et al., 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0057">2013</a>; Iles &amp; Hegerl,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The “direct” path is also known in the literature as “fast” response because it emerges within months in simulations that instantaneously quadruple CO
   <sub>2</sub>, the indirect path is known also as the “slow” response because it requires that the oceans come in equilibrium with the forcing, as heat penetrates first into the surface mixed layer and finally into the abyssal depths.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The literature on emerging constraints provides some important refinement to our assessment of model performance with respect to climate sensitivity, but little progress has been made in translating these insights to the problem of regional climate change (Xie et al., 
   <a rid="wcc591-bib-0151" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0151">2015</a>).
