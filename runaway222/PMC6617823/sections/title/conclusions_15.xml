 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decades of research have made clear that seasonal rainfall variability in the Sahel can be explained as the response to anomalies in the atmospheric circulation that are planetary or regional in scale and that are mostly driven from afar—by changes in the surface temperature of the global oceans, by direct effect of increasing anthropogenic emissions of pollutants, or by a combination of both. The fact that the dominant drivers of Sahel rainfall seasonal accumulation are large scale (and thus well resolved by the current generation of climate models) lends some confidence in projections for the future. These suggest increases in rainfall totals in the central and eastern Sahel, but decreases in the westernmost regions and a concentrated rainy season characterized by more intense and intermittent rainfall, drier condition at the onset, and wetter conditions during the core and the demise of the growing season. Yet, uncertainty in future projections remains, due to both disagreement across models and the unresolved presence of systematic biases common to all state‐of‐the‐art climate models.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An additional challenge is posed by the need for climate information at spatial scales much smaller than the grid point of a climate model and with much finer detail than a seasonal average. For example, adaptation efforts might require projections for advanced climate metrics such as extreme rain frequency, dry spell length, rainfall distribution over the season, maximum wind gusts from storms, and many more. These quantities are not simulated realistically by climate models, especially where storm organization is key, and their change under enhanced GHG conditions is not quantitatively constrained by theory.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The task ahead for the climate science community, then, is to create reliable projections for spatial scales and physical quantities that are neither resolved by current climate models nor, especially in the case of Africa, well observed. This goal can be met, but must be approached from several angles. One powerful tool is the dynamical downscaling of GCMs by high‐resolution models run on large regional domains (Kendon et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0073">2017</a>). Another is advanced techniques for statistical downscaling that link observed localized phenomena to characteristics of the large‐scale environment (Lee, Tippett, Sobel, &amp; Camargo, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0084">2018</a>; Pinto et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0111" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0111">2018</a>; Trapp et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0141" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0141">2007</a>). Yet, these tools should be used with caution, as they can only add value to existing projections if the latter are believable to begin with (Maraun et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0090" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0090">2017</a>). This will require better global climate models and better observations to constrain them. Fortunately, the international research community is mobilized in ongoing observational and modeling efforts (Dinku et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0035">2017</a>; FCFA, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0039">2017</a>; GFDRR, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0045">2015</a>; James et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0068">2018</a>; Washington et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0148" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0148">2012</a>) that have the potential to close our knowledge gaps and further reduce uncertainties in projections. In the meantime, new approaches for the co‐production of climate knowledge by scientists and users are coming into focus (Bhave, Conway, &amp; Dessai, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0009">2018</a>; Haasnoot, van t Klooster, &amp; van Alphen,

  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0145" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0145">2018</a>) and promise a way forward in planning for adaptation under deep uncertainty.
