  <p>(a) Schematic that describes how inter‐hemispheric extratropical thermal forcing is balanced by the adjustment of the Hadley circulation. Suppose the northern (southern) extratropics are warmed (cooled). The faded (dark) gray contours in the upper panel indicate the Hadley circulation in the reference (perturbed) state. The Hadley circulation transports moisture equatorward following its lower branch (blue arrow) and transports energy poleward following its upper branch (red arrow).
