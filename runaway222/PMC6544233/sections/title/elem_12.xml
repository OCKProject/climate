  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref002">2</a>] (IPCC AR5) on climate change impact on crop yield/production notes that between the AR4 and AR5 the required connection of climate change impact to food security impact was missing. Our study directly addresses this by translating the potential impact of recent climate change on crop yields (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217148.g001" href="#pone.0217148.g001">Fig 1</a>) to consumable food calories change in each country (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s017" href="#pone.0217148.s017">S4 Table</a>). While translating crop production change to consumable food caloric change, we accounted for the current dietary consumption pattern of individual crops per country, including bookkeeping for directly and indirectly consumed calories in each country [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref034">34</a>]. We found that out of the studied 53 countries with a hunger index of serious, alarming, or seriously alarming [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref032">32</a>] in 2008, 27 countries (or ~51%) had decreased consumable calories due to mean climate changes (~ -0.4% in these ten crops or ~ -0.3% across all food calories consumed across all 53 countries studied–
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s017" href="#pone.0217148.s017">S4 Table</a>). Though we detected subnational level crop yield and production changes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217148.g001" href="#pone.0217148.g001">Fig 1</a>), determining consumable food caloric changes at that level would require data not available globally: subnational dietary patterns, evaluation of the climate change impact in the entire food supply chain [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref035">35</a>] and socio-economic conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref036">36</a>]. These individual issues should be explored in future studies to understand mean climate change impacts on local scale food security.

  <sub>2</sub> is (1) highly correlated with time [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref011">11</a>] and further (2) several lines of investigations [

These studies varied across methods, scales, and time periods and were for the top four global crops–maize, rice, wheat and soybean. Consequently a range of impacts was found; the rice and soybean 10

Some such as cassava and sorghum are a major source of calories in food insecure regions (~3.5% and ~3.4% of total food calories provided respectively). Sugarcane, oil palm and rapeseed are important commodity crops with the latter two having greatly expanded in recent decades. Another implicit advancement in our report is from computing the harvested area weighted weather statistics from reported harvesting information each year at the unit of the study ~20,000 political units.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find a range of impacts of mean climate change on crop yields (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s017" href="#pone.0217148.s017">S4 Table</a>) and production in different regions. We found that crop yields across Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa and Australia had in general decreased because of climate change, though exceptions are present. Similar variations are seen in other crops and regions all over the world. They are indicative of the underlying variations of agronomic growing conditions that range from the agro-meteorological to crop management. Precipitation variations for example are much heterogeneous in their trends (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s004" href="#pone.0217148.s004">S3</a> and

Various agronomic changes and advancements can also mask climate change adaptation measures: irrigation expansion can occur for stabilizing crop production, expansion into new areas, or for double cropping in the dry season; but they can also serve as a measure to counter the effects of extreme heat [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref044">44</a>]. Crop planting dates can advance in colder regions of the world as agronomic techniques advance but also because climate is getting warmer on average [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings here illustrate that climate change has potentially already affected global production of the ten largest crops and the production of consumable food calories in specific countries and globally. The approach used here complements the long-range projections, avoids many of the challenges faced by process-based models, and analyzes a broader set of crops. Although recent climate change has likely reduced overall consumable food calories in these ten crops by ~1% (or ~0.5% across all food calories), there is much variability among crops and regions. These findings can be used to target interventions for adaptation to climate change through better management, crop breeding, and switching crops as climate continues to evolve.</p>
