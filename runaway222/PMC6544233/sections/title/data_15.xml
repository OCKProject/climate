 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We studied the top ten global crops from around the world where they are commonly harvested. Not all crops are harvested everywhere and each year.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To conduct the study we used two datasets 1) climate and weather, and 2) crop yields and harvested areas. Climate and weather variables were all derived from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) TS4.01 [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref018">18</a>] dataset and its previous data versions have been commonly used in previous studies [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref013">13</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref016">16</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref020">20</a>]. The CRU TS4.01 data is a major upgrade and supersedes all previous versions of the CRU data. We mapped the half-degree CRU derived climate and weather information to the crop harvested areas of each political unit (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We carried out two major revisions to our crop data that were accessed from public sources [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref016">16</a>] and links to the sources are provided in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s001" href="#pone.0217148.s001">S1 Text</a> section 1. We increased the spatial resolution tracked to ~20,000 political units, and from four major crops being tracked–maize, rice, wheat, and soybean–to tracking the top ten global crops–barley, cassava, maize, oil palm, rapeseed, rice, sorghum, soybean, sugarcane, and wheat. Further details of the crop data and the countries now being tracked at the sub-national levels (one or two levels below the national scale) are provided in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s001" href="#pone.0217148.s001">S1 Text</a> section 1. The new political units were mapped using information from the public source GADM (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inclusion of sub-national information enables capturing geographical differences, which is missed when studies are restricted to country level political units, especially applicable in cases dealing with geographically large countries. We could not entirely remove this challenge i.e. countries such as Kazakhstan were studied as a single political unit, but in 86 large countries (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s001" href="#pone.0217148.s001">S1 Text</a>) we conducted the study at one to two administrative divisions down from the country level.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To show the effects of studying large countries as a single unit versus sub-national analysis consider the impact of climate change on rice in Cambodia and Malaysia. When analyzed at the country level, rice yield change of -0.03, and +0.15 tons/ha/year was found for Cambodia and Malaysia respectively. Analysis conducted at the subnational scale when summarized to the country level however shows -0.12, and -0.06 tons/ha/year rice yield change for Cambodia and Malaysia respectively. The difference is because when studied at subnational level we are able to isolate the impacts among regions. In the case of Cambodia in the rice bowl central plains region (like Kampong Thom district) and surrounding districts large rice yield losses occur. In the southern districts along the Gulf of Thailand (districts like Koh Kong) climate change benefitted rice yields, but the gains were not enough to overcome the losses elsewhere, leading to overall national level rice yield losses. Similar effect of geography is seen in Malaysia between the eastern (gains in rice yield) and western parts (losses in rice yields) of peninsular Malaysia on the two parts of the natural divide of the Titiwangsa Range; this subnational signal can only be captured through sub-national high-resolution analysis. Thus where possible higher resolution analysis will lead to more precise results.</p>
