 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yields for all the dominant (non-tropical) crops in western and southern Europe decreased 6.3–21.2% because of climate change (
  <a rid="pone.0217148.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0217148.t001">Table 1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217148.g001" href="#pone.0217148.g001">Fig 1</a>). This may partially explain the stagnation of yields in Europe [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref022">22</a>]. We observed a decrease in the yields of major crops–wheat, barley, maize and rapeseed–for parts of the steppe region in European Russia and in the grain belt of Western Siberia agreeing with case studies [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref023">23</a>]; annual temperature in the Russian Federation has increased since the 1970s at ~0.4°C/decade [

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s003" href="#pone.0217148.s003">S2 Fig</a>). Barley, maize and sorghum productivity has been negatively affected by climate change in Ukraine, confirming observations [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref024">24</a>]. Annual yield losses in western and southern Europe are high though exceptions abound as in Andalucía in southern Spain where wheat yields gained from mean climate changes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217148.g001" href="#pone.0217148.g001">Fig 1</a>). Similarly, in eastern and northern Europe yield losses are widespread for maize (-24.5%), barley (-9.1%), and wheat (-2.1%). The large yield / production losses across crops in France reduced consumable food calories production in these ten crops by ~24% or ~-7% of all food calories consumed (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s017" href="#pone.0217148.s017">S4 Table</a>). Large reductions in consumable food calories in these ten crops due to climate change have also occurred in Germany (~-11%), Spain (~-4%), Italy (~-7%) as well as in other major Western European agricultural countries (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s017" href="#pone.0217148.s017">S4 Table</a>). In Eastern and Northern Europe the largest reductions in consumable food calorie from these ten crops due to mean climate changes occurred in Hungary (~-35% or ~-10% overall), Romania (~-18% or ~-7% overall), and Ireland (~-12% in these ten crops or ~-3% overall).
