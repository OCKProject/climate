 <p id="Par80" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The socio-environmental context influences the farmers’ individual cognition and thus agricultural adaptation intention and avoidance. We distinguish between farmers’ personal characteristics, farm characteristics including farm succession, and regional characteristics. Criteria related to the farmers’ personal characteristics include the farmers’ state of knowledge, their age as well as their attitude towards agriculture and the environment. The farmers’ personal characteristics seem to be related to their perceived self-efficacy, which is expressed in terms of their perceived personal responsibility for their farms. In our data material, we find knowledgeable farmers who search actively for detailed information (climate change adaptors), ambitious farmers with pronounced environmental awareness (integrative adaptors), determined mainly young farmers following profit and efficiency principles (cost-benefit calculators), and conservative farmers who have developed strong habits (climate change fatalists). Knowledge, environmental awareness and economic interests seem to inspire self-efficacy and encourage adaptation intention, whereas conservatism seems to inhibit adaptation and induce avoidance. Other studies have also addressed personal characteristics and find that market-oriented farmers that perceive farming as profession or vocation as well as well-educated farmers with a high pro-environmental attitude have a higher adaptation intention than traditionalists (Eggers et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>; Hyland et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par81" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Farm characteristics and farm succession are other important contexts for agricultural adaptation. For the integrative adaptors and the cost-benefit calculators, they seem to be related to the farmers’ personal characteristics. The sense of environmental responsibility of integrative adaptors becomes apparent in organically certified farms (except for one farm that follows organic production standards in most years). Full-time farming (except for one farm specialized in direct marketing that is run part-time) reflects the economic orientation of cost-benefit calculators. Organic and full-time farming seem to increase adaptation intention. The farms managed by the climate change adaptors differ in size and major production activity and farm succession is fixed. The availability of a farm successor seems to stimulate adaptation intention and the so-called ‘successor-effect’ (Chiswell 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2016</a>) motivates even older farmers to adapt. The farms run by the climate change fatalists are specialized, i.e. no diversification, and farm succession is not determined. These results are similar to the findings from Eggers et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>, which indicate that full-/part-time farming, conventional/organic farming as well as farm succession are factors that influence adaptation decision-making.
 </p>
 <p id="Par82" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regional characteristics such as water availability, land cover, land use, and landscape patterns have been addressed by all farmers, with exception of the climate change fatalists. This indicates that the farmers’ perception of their environment is important in the context of agricultural adaptation, regardless if the farmers refer to regional characteristics as stimulating or inhibiting factors.</p>
 <p id="Par83" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results emphasize that not only climate change and adaptation appraisal affect the formation of agricultural adaptation intention and avoidance, but personal, farm and regional characteristics are also of importance as well. This finding supports conceptual and empirical literature proposing that adaptation is often a response to a mix of climatic and non-climatic factors (Berrang-Ford et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2011</a>; Knox et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2010</a>; McLeman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2008</a>; Mitter et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2018</a>; Smit and Skinner 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">2002</a>). Farmers indicating that economic factors are of major relevance for decision-making and even more important than climatic factors, e.g. the cost-benefit calculators, can be interpreted in the context of the ‘finite pool of worry effect’ (Hansen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2004</a>; Weber 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">2006</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2010</a>), which suggests that increased concern, e.g. about market development, may result in decreased concern about climate change. It may also be useful to follow the concept of ‘multi-purpose’ and ‘hidden adaptation’ (Grüneis et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2016</a>), when referring to measures that are mainly motivated by non-climatic factors but contribute to climate change adaptation as well. For instance and following the argumentation by the integrative adaptors, changes in crop rotations may result from the desire to support humus formation (environmental factor) but may positively affect crop production through changes in the growing period (climatic factor) as well.
