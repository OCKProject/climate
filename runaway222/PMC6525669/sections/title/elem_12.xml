  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Formation of Climate Change Appraisal</div>
  <p id="Par71" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis shows that all interviewed farmers perceive changes in regional climate conditions even though they do not always link these perceptions to global climate change or find these changes alarming. The identified four groups of farmers differ with respect to their belief in global climate change and its materialization at regional level, e.g. through perceived changes in regional climate conditions and impacts on regional farming. While the climate change adaptors and the climate change fatalists believe in global climate change leading to massive changes in regional climate conditions, the integrative adaptors and the cost-benefit calculators are skeptical and argue that perceived changes are an indication for natural variation in climate.</p>
  <p id="Par72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interviewed farmers report a broad variety of experienced impacts on their farms, which they interpret as climate change risks or opportunities. The climate change adaptors and the climate change fatalists mainly feel affected by risks, but while the climate change adaptors experienced severe negative impacts in the past, the fatalists did not. The fatalists’ risk appraisal seems to be part of a general negative attitude towards future developments. Although the farmers forming part of the two other groups, i.e. integrative adaptors and cost-benefit calculators, report a bandwidth of negative impacts in the context of changing regional climate conditions, they mention non-climatic factors such as changes in land cover as major reasons and do not appraise them as a serious risk for their farms. The integrative adaptors believe in the resilience of their environmental-friendly farming practices and consciously accept some associated challenges, e.g. with pest control. The cost-benefit calculators are aware of climate change risks but appraise them as ‘regular’ management task and are thus not concerned. Except for the climate change fatalists, the farmers forming part of all other groups also reflect on potential opportunities related to climate change. Most of them address opportunities in the context of increasing mean temperatures and the prolongation of the growing period.</p>
  <p id="Par73" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results suggest that climate change appraisal is stimulated by pre-existing beliefs in climate change, which influence how regional climate conditions are perceived and how experienced and expected risks and opportunities are interpreted. Similar findings have been presented in the empirical literature and are known as ‘motivated reasoning’, i.e. prior belief in or knowledge on climate change influences people’s perceptions (Hart and Nisbet

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2013</a>), and ‘assimilation bias’, i.e. people look for and accept evidence that confirm their individual beliefs but ignore dissenting evidence (Lord et al.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Formation of Adaption Appraisal</div>
  <p id="Par74" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation appraisal consists of farmers’ perceptions of adaptation efficacy, self-efficacy, and adaptation costs. With regard to adaptation efficacy, the climate change adaptors, the integrative adaptors and the cost-benefit calculators know a bandwidth of effective climate change adaptation measures and have already implemented several of them on their farms. The climate change fatalists are not aware of adaptation measures and have not implemented any on their farms. While climate change adaptors try to balance a broad mix of adaptation measures, integrative adaptors focus on environmental-friendly farming practices adjusted to a farm’s resource base, which they assess to be adequate for climate change adaptation as well. Cost-benefit calculators are continuously taking adaptation measures that bring about slight or moderate changes on their farms. They are also aware of effective adaptation measures that may change the farms’ characteristics or strategic orientation but consider related benefits too low, compared to the costs. These results are in line with previous empirical analyses, which have revealed that preferred adaptation measures differ between groups of farmers sharing, for instance, climate change belief, attitudes, value systems, and perceived risks (Barnes and Toma 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2012</a>; Hyland et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par75" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perceived self-efficacy and the capacity to respond to climate change-related challenges has received growing attention in the empirical literature suggesting its relevance in the agricultural context (e.g. Arbuckle et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2014</a>; Duinen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2014</a>). In our empirical data, self-efficacy is expressed as the farmers’ sense of personal responsibility for their farms and their perceived capability to act. Except for the climate change fatalists, the farmers show high levels of self-efficacy paired with a high flexibility to respond to changes. While the climate change adaptors and the cost-benefit calculators additionally show a high level of knowledge on climate change, related impacts and potential adaptation measures, perceived self-efficacy of the integrative adaptors is embedded into an environmental-friendly value system. Furthermore, it is notable that farmers belonging to the group of climate change adaptors report personal political engagement in order to increase peoples’ climate change awareness and to evoke adaptation beyond their farms.
  </p>
  <p id="Par76" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The four groups of farmers address adaptation costs differently. While the climate change adaptors consciously accept high costs for successful adaptation, the integrative adaptors emphasize potential savings from measures that yield benefits for both the environmental and adaptation performance of their farms, and the climate change fatalists appraise costs for adaptation measures as too high. The cost-benefit calculators balance expected benefits against adaptation costs, and highlight adaptation costs as major determining factor for implementing long-term adaptation measures. Park et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2012</a> have come to a similar conclusion showing that adaptation costs are particularly decisive for long-term, transformative adaptation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Formation of Agricultural Adaptation Intention and Avoidance</div>
  <p id="Par77" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The formation of agricultural adaptation intention and avoidance is stimulated by the farmers’ individual cognition represented by the components of climate change and adaptation appraisal. Our empirical results indicate that a high level of climate change appraisal does not necessarily evoke agricultural adaptation intention and—vice versa—a low level of climate change appraisal does not automatically lead to avoidance. For example, although climate change adopters and climate change fatalists have experienced negative impacts and feel threatened by climate change risks, only the first intend to adapt. Otherwise, integrative adaptors and cost-benefit calculators appraise climate change risks as low for their farms but show adaptation intention in the short- or long-term.</p>
  <p id="Par78" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While experienced as well as expected positive and negative climate change impacts do not always stimulate adaptation intention, we find that farmers’ adaptation appraisal is key for the formation of adaptation intention. In particular, awareness of effective and efficient adaptation measures as well as perceived self-efficacy greatly affect whether farmers intend to adapt. The results demonstrate that the climate change adaptors, the integrative adaptors, and the cost-benefit calculators appraise adaptation positively and form adaptation intention, whereas the climate change fatalists appraise adaptation negatively and solely form avoidance. Other case studies have come to a similar conclusion and highlight the strong positive effect of perceived self-efficacy on adaptation intention (Burnham and Ma 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2017</a>; Niles et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2016</a>) given that the farmers know adaptation measures with a convincing cost-benefit ratio. This result is also conform to the MPPACC suggesting that the combination of positive climate change and adaptation appraisal result in adaptation intention (Grothmann 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2005</a>; Grothmann and Patt 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2005</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par79" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Avoidance is expressed in terms of wishful thinking, denial, religious faith, and fatalism, in our qualitative data material. In case of wishful thinking, the cost-benefit calculators expect adverse climate change impacts in the future but belief to remain unaffected and thus show avoidance. This belief is typically fostered by rather irrational justifications or paired with ‘unrealistic optimism’ (Weinstein 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">1980</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">1983</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">1987</a>) suggesting that adaptation is not yet very relevant. Denial and religious faith is revealed when integrative adaptors doubt to be negatively affected by climate change in the future even though they have already experienced adverse impacts. While wishful thinking, denial, and religious faith degrade the risk of climate change, fatalism requires risk perception. In combination with the lack of knowledge on viable adaptation measures, perceived risk turns into resignation within the group of fatalist farmers. These findings also support the crucial role of adaptation appraisal. While the avoidance strategies of wishful thinking, denial and religious faith are related to risk appraisal and leave room for adaptation intention, fatalism is connected to negative adaptation appraisal and farmers belonging to this group do not form adaptation intention.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Socio-Environmental Context Factors</div>
  <p id="Par80" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The socio-environmental context influences the farmers’ individual cognition and thus agricultural adaptation intention and avoidance. We distinguish between farmers’ personal characteristics, farm characteristics including farm succession, and regional characteristics. Criteria related to the farmers’ personal characteristics include the farmers’ state of knowledge, their age as well as their attitude towards agriculture and the environment. The farmers’ personal characteristics seem to be related to their perceived self-efficacy, which is expressed in terms of their perceived personal responsibility for their farms. In our data material, we find knowledgeable farmers who search actively for detailed information (climate change adaptors), ambitious farmers with pronounced environmental awareness (integrative adaptors), determined mainly young farmers following profit and efficiency principles (cost-benefit calculators), and conservative farmers who have developed strong habits (climate change fatalists). Knowledge, environmental awareness and economic interests seem to inspire self-efficacy and encourage adaptation intention, whereas conservatism seems to inhibit adaptation and induce avoidance. Other studies have also addressed personal characteristics and find that market-oriented farmers that perceive farming as profession or vocation as well as well-educated farmers with a high pro-environmental attitude have a higher adaptation intention than traditionalists (Eggers et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>; Hyland et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par81" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Farm characteristics and farm succession are other important contexts for agricultural adaptation. For the integrative adaptors and the cost-benefit calculators, they seem to be related to the farmers’ personal characteristics. The sense of environmental responsibility of integrative adaptors becomes apparent in organically certified farms (except for one farm that follows organic production standards in most years). Full-time farming (except for one farm specialized in direct marketing that is run part-time) reflects the economic orientation of cost-benefit calculators. Organic and full-time farming seem to increase adaptation intention. The farms managed by the climate change adaptors differ in size and major production activity and farm succession is fixed. The availability of a farm successor seems to stimulate adaptation intention and the so-called ‘successor-effect’ (Chiswell 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2016</a>) motivates even older farmers to adapt. The farms run by the climate change fatalists are specialized, i.e. no diversification, and farm succession is not determined. These results are similar to the findings from Eggers et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>, which indicate that full-/part-time farming, conventional/organic farming as well as farm succession are factors that influence adaptation decision-making.
  </p>
  <p id="Par82" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regional characteristics such as water availability, land cover, land use, and landscape patterns have been addressed by all farmers, with exception of the climate change fatalists. This indicates that the farmers’ perception of their environment is important in the context of agricultural adaptation, regardless if the farmers refer to regional characteristics as stimulating or inhibiting factors.</p>
  <p id="Par83" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results emphasize that not only climate change and adaptation appraisal affect the formation of agricultural adaptation intention and avoidance, but personal, farm and regional characteristics are also of importance as well. This finding supports conceptual and empirical literature proposing that adaptation is often a response to a mix of climatic and non-climatic factors (Berrang-Ford et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2011</a>; Knox et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2010</a>; McLeman et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2008</a>; Mitter et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2018</a>; Smit and Skinner 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">2002</a>). Farmers indicating that economic factors are of major relevance for decision-making and even more important than climatic factors, e.g. the cost-benefit calculators, can be interpreted in the context of the ‘finite pool of worry effect’ (Hansen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2004</a>; Weber 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">2006</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2010</a>), which suggests that increased concern, e.g. about market development, may result in decreased concern about climate change. It may also be useful to follow the concept of ‘multi-purpose’ and ‘hidden adaptation’ (Grüneis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2016</a>), when referring to measures that are mainly motivated by non-climatic factors but contribute to climate change adaptation as well. For instance and following the argumentation by the integrative adaptors, changes in crop rotations may result from the desire to support humus formation (environmental factor) but may positively affect crop production through changes in the growing period (climatic factor) as well.
