 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A variety of recent analyses has investigated farmers’ perceptions of climate change and their intended adaptation behaviour. They differ in theoretical assumptions and identified drivers for agricultural adaptation, which are reviewed and summarized in the following. Reviewing theories relevant to agricultural adaptation intentions highlights their complementarities and summarizing results from their application in various farming regions emphasizes their usefulness for understanding causes of intended behaviour. Based on the review results, we have chosen a theoretical model for our empirical analysis, which is presented below.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Review of Theories Relevant for Climate Change Adaptation in Agriculture</div>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Behavioural theories explain adaptation intentions through various perceptual and socio-cognitive processes. Of particular relevance to agricultural adaptation are (i) the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB; Ajzen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1985</a>) that draws on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA; Fishbein and Ajzen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">1975</a>), (ii) the Values Beliefs Norms Theory (VBN; Stern 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2000</a>), (iii) the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT; Rogers 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1983</a>; Rogers and Prentice-Dunn 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1997</a>), and (iv) the Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change (MPPACC; Grothmann 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2005</a>; Grothmann and Patt 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2005</a>), which has its roots in PMT.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TRA and its extension, the TPB, are based on proximal causes of an individuals’ particular behaviour and focus on intra- and interpersonal factors such as ‘attitude toward the behavior’ and ‘subjective norm’ (Ajzen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1985</a>; Fishbein and Ajzen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">1975</a>). Compared to TRA, TPB incorporates ‘perceived behavioural control’ as an additional factor, which refers to the person’s perception of personal control over the outcome of a particular behaviour. TRA and TPB have proven useful for explaining how the mentioned factors affect intended behaviour. However, they do not provide insights into other relevant intrapersonal factors such as habits, emotions or experience and do not reflect on socio-environmental context factors. This is also true for VBN, which emphasizes normative influences on intended behaviour and pays limited attention to socio-environmental context factors. VBN suggests that personal values are antecedents of environmental beliefs, and personal norms are activated when a person believes that their violation would adversely affect things he or she values. Together, personal values, beliefs (including environmental worldviews, understanding causes and effects of environmental threats, and personal capacity to address these threats), and moral norms explain a considerable amount of variance in pro-environmental behaviour (Stern 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2000</a>). Similarly, PMT assumes that the perception of threat and the desire to avoid damage motivates people to change their behaviour or protect themselves (Floyd et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2000</a>). PMT is organized along the two cognitive processes of ‘threat’ and ‘coping appraisal’, whereas socio-environmental context factors are not considered. In their MPPACC, Grothmann and Patt 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2005</a> reframe the two cognitive processes of PMT to ‘climate change risk’ and ‘adaptation appraisal’ and extend the model by socio-environmental context factors.
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although TPB, VBN, and MPPACC share two major components, i.e. perceptual and cognitive processes that stimulate and guide behaviour as well as the perceived personal capacity to engage in risk reduction (McLeod et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2015</a>) the reviewed theories differ in their focus and consideration of intrapersonal and socio-environmental context factors. Perceptual and cognitive processes that stimulate and guide behaviour refer to behavioural, normative and outcome beliefs in TPB, to personal values and beliefs (i.e. ecological worldview paradigm) in VBN, and to climate change risk appraisal (i.e. perceived probability and severity) in MPPACC. The perceived personal capacity to engage in risk reduction refers to perceived behavioural control in TPB, to perceived ability to reduce threat in VBN, and to perceived self-efficacy in MPPACC. In contrast to the other theories explained above, only the MPPACC introduces context factors with particular relevance for climate change adaptation.

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reviewed theories and models have been empirically tested, modified, or refined for the agricultural adaptation context at different locations. For instance, Roesch-McNally et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2017</a> combine TRA and TPB with the ‘anatomy of adaptation’ suggested by Smit et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2000</a> to build a new conceptual framework for investigating adaptation intentions under a climate change scenario. They show that U.S. Corn Belt farmers intend to implement particular adaptation measures if they believe in their efficacy which farmers may learn from own experience or experience of their peers. Niles et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2016</a> apply TPB in two farming regions in New Zealand and find that intended and actual implementation of adaptation measures are influenced by different factors. They highlight that climate change attitudes and beliefs are only related to intended but not to actual adaptation. Arunrat et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2017</a> use TPB and show that adaptation intention of farmers in a Thai region is mostly affected by perceived behavioural control factors, followed by attitude and subjective norm. Behavioural control is operationalized by assessing farmers’ self-confidence in adjusting current farming practices in the next three years, attitude refers to perceived importance and usefulness of adaptation, and subjective norm relates to perceived social pressure on adaptation behaviour. Hu et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2006</a> use TPB to examine farmers’ use of weather and climate forecasts in eastern Nebraska and the U.S. Corn Belt. Their results suggest that farmers perceive the usefulness of forecasts as rather low and depend on expert knowledge for a regular use.
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research on farmers in the U.S. state of Iowa is based on the VBN and reveals that farmers’ belief in climate change significantly influences perceived risks from climate change, which, in turn, fosters agricultural adaptation. Their findings also suggest that farmers who believe in human induced climate change are more likely to support public action on greenhouse gas emissions. However, causal attribution seems to be less relevant for decision-making in agricultural adaptation (Arbuckle et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2015</a>). Sanderson and Curtis 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">2016</a> operationalize VBN and demonstrate the importance of cultural factors for farmers’ climate change risk perception, which informs their decisions to apply adaptive water conservation strategies in an Australian region.
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Duinen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2014</a> base their investigation on PMT and find that Dutch farmers’ motivation to adapt to droughts can be explained to a significant extent by cognitive factors, i.e. perceived severity of potential consequences, perceived control efficacy, adaptation cost and self-efficacy. McClaran et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2015</a> use PMT to structure their analysis on livestock ranchers in the U.S. state of Arizona. Their findings suggest that the perceived efficacy of selected drought adaptation measures is positively related with implementation. Dang et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2014</a> draw on PMT to explore farmers’ perceived risks and adaptation intentions in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, and find that risk perception increases with belief in climate change, experienced impacts and lack of public adaptation programs. Building upon PMT, Truelove et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">2015</a> analyse paddy farmers’ drought adaptation intentions in Sri Lanka and conclude that efficacy beliefs are the most substantial predictor.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2011</a> adopt elements from MPPACC for the small island of Kiribati and reveal that belief in self-efficacy drive intentions to adapt to water stress. Similarly, Burnham and Ma 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2017</a> use MPPACC and find that perceived self-efficacy including human and financial capital, institutions and entitlements as well as information, technology and other infrastructure increases adaptation intention among small-holder farmers in China. Woods et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">2017</a> build on MPPACC and find a positive correlation between Danish famers’ concern about climate change and intended adaptation to negative impacts. Their results also suggest that farmers respond to potential opportunities emerging from climate change. Frank et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2011</a> incorporate social identity, which represents an individual’s sense or knowledge of membership in a social group, in MPPACC and confirm its importance for the formation of adaptation intentions in an empirical analysis of coffee farmers in Chiapas, Mexico. Consistent with MPPACC, Eakin et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2016</a> explore the effects of objective and subjective capacities on farmers’ adaptive capacity in central Arizona, U.S. and suggest that ‘linking’ capacities such as political and social capital are required for collective action.
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The summarized empirical results imply that pertinent adaptation measures, prevailing farming systems, cultural values, and norms as well as geographic regions are contexts that need to be considered for operationalizing theories and framing research questions.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Theoretical Model for the Empirical Analysis</div>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have chosen the theoretical MPPACC as heuristic for our empirical research, because it is well suited for structuring farmers’ narratives and analyzing farmers’ climate change and adaptation appraisal as well as their effects on adaptation intention and avoidance including socio-environmental context factors. Building on MPPACC, we empirically examine farmers’ individual perceptions towards climate change and adaptation and consider how socio-environmental context factors affect adaptation intention (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). We assume that an individual has to perceive and evaluate a certain risk or opportunity in a first step (climate change appraisal), and evaluate his or her subjective capability to deal with this risk or opportunity in a second step (adaptation appraisal). While MPPACC is limited to risks and explicitly excludes opportunities (Grothmann and Patt 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2005</a>), we consider both risks and opportunities following the commonly accepted definition of climate change adaptation (IPCC 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2014</a>). Adaptation appraisal consists of three sub-components, i.e. ‘perceived adaptation efficacy’, ‘perceived self-efficacy’, and ‘perceived adaptation costs’, which are closely related and thus added up.
  </p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depending on the outcome of the two steps, we consider two socio-cognitive pathways an individual may follow to deal with climate change, i.e. agricultural adaptation intention or avoidance. Agricultural adaptation refers to measures that prevent physical or monetary damage or provide new opportunities, whereas avoidance relates to reactions such as ‘wishful thinking’, ‘denial’, ‘religious faith’, and ‘fatalism’ that typically prevent negative emotional consequences of perceived risks and expected impacts. Climate change appraisal (including risk and opportunity appraisal) and adaptation appraisal (including perceived adaptation efficacy, self-efficacy, and adaptation costs) are assumed to be positively related to adaptation intention (as indicated by the ‘+’ sign in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Risk appraisal is assumed to be positively (+) and adaptation appraisal is assumed to be negatively related (−) to avoidance indicating that an individual would respond with ‘avoidance’ if he or she appraises climate change as a risk but is not aware of adaptation measures that are effective, practicable and efficient.
  </p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to MPPACC, adaptation intention is the necessary prerequisite for actual adoption of adaptation measures, while avoidance is discerned as a barrier to adaptation (Grothmann and Patt 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2005</a>). Additionally and similar to MPPACC, socio-environmental context factors such as farmers’ personal characteristics, farm characteristics including farm succession, regional characteristics, adaptation barriers as well as an individual’s perception thereof are considered. With respect to farmers’ personal characteristics, we follow the classification by Schmitzberger et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">2005</a> and consider farmers’ state of knowledge, their age as well as their attitude towards agriculture and the environment. Farm characteristics include farm size, farm type, cultivation system, major production activities, and future perspectives (i.e. farm succession). Criteria related to regional characteristics comprise freshwater availability as well as land cover, land use, and landscape patterns.
