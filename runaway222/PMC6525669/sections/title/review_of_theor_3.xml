 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Behavioural theories explain adaptation intentions through various perceptual and socio-cognitive processes. Of particular relevance to agricultural adaptation are (i) the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB; Ajzen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1985</a>) that draws on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA; Fishbein and Ajzen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">1975</a>), (ii) the Values Beliefs Norms Theory (VBN; Stern 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2000</a>), (iii) the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT; Rogers 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1983</a>; Rogers and Prentice-Dunn 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1997</a>), and (iv) the Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change (MPPACC; Grothmann 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2005</a>; Grothmann and Patt 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2005</a>), which has its roots in PMT.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TRA and its extension, the TPB, are based on proximal causes of an individuals’ particular behaviour and focus on intra- and interpersonal factors such as ‘attitude toward the behavior’ and ‘subjective norm’ (Ajzen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1985</a>; Fishbein and Ajzen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">1975</a>). Compared to TRA, TPB incorporates ‘perceived behavioural control’ as an additional factor, which refers to the person’s perception of personal control over the outcome of a particular behaviour. TRA and TPB have proven useful for explaining how the mentioned factors affect intended behaviour. However, they do not provide insights into other relevant intrapersonal factors such as habits, emotions or experience and do not reflect on socio-environmental context factors. This is also true for VBN, which emphasizes normative influences on intended behaviour and pays limited attention to socio-environmental context factors. VBN suggests that personal values are antecedents of environmental beliefs, and personal norms are activated when a person believes that their violation would adversely affect things he or she values. Together, personal values, beliefs (including environmental worldviews, understanding causes and effects of environmental threats, and personal capacity to address these threats), and moral norms explain a considerable amount of variance in pro-environmental behaviour (Stern 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2000</a>). Similarly, PMT assumes that the perception of threat and the desire to avoid damage motivates people to change their behaviour or protect themselves (Floyd et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2000</a>). PMT is organized along the two cognitive processes of ‘threat’ and ‘coping appraisal’, whereas socio-environmental context factors are not considered. In their MPPACC, Grothmann and Patt 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2005</a> reframe the two cognitive processes of PMT to ‘climate change risk’ and ‘adaptation appraisal’ and extend the model by socio-environmental context factors.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although TPB, VBN, and MPPACC share two major components, i.e. perceptual and cognitive processes that stimulate and guide behaviour as well as the perceived personal capacity to engage in risk reduction (McLeod et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2015</a>) the reviewed theories differ in their focus and consideration of intrapersonal and socio-environmental context factors. Perceptual and cognitive processes that stimulate and guide behaviour refer to behavioural, normative and outcome beliefs in TPB, to personal values and beliefs (i.e. ecological worldview paradigm) in VBN, and to climate change risk appraisal (i.e. perceived probability and severity) in MPPACC. The perceived personal capacity to engage in risk reduction refers to perceived behavioural control in TPB, to perceived ability to reduce threat in VBN, and to perceived self-efficacy in MPPACC. In contrast to the other theories explained above, only the MPPACC introduces context factors with particular relevance for climate change adaptation.
