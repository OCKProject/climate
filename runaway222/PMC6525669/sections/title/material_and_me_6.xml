 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drawing on MPPACC, we have employed a qualitative interview approach for investigating farmers’ climate change and adaptation appraisals, adaptation intentions, and avoidance. The qualitative interview approach allows us to examine how farmers’ mental conditions, their adaptation actions and socio-environmental context factors are interlinked. Furthermore, it enables us to better understand farmers’ social construction of reality and analyze individuals’ cognition, subjective views and social realities, including beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions. Its major strength is to identify patterns in the formation process of adaptation intentions that exist in the Austrian agrarian society. These patterns may correspond to the assumptions of the theoretical model but may also go beyond.</p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We aimed at interviewing a diverse group of farmers from two major farming regions in Austria, the Mostviertel and South-East Styria, in order to record a broad spectrum of farmers’ climate change and impact perceptions as well as adaptation intentions. We applied the technique of maximal variation sampling where the sample size is typically small but maximizes the diversity relevant to the research question (Flick 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2009</a>). The farmers’ and the farms’ diversity was considered with respect to gender and age, major production activities, chosen cultivation system, farm size, full/part-time farming, and topographic and pedo-climatic heterogeneities of the location (see SM 4 in the supplementary material).
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used direct and indirect approaches for getting in contact with potential interviewees. Direct approaches imply that scientists identify potential interviewees contributing to the maximal variation sample directly, e.g. via online search or established professional or personal networks. Indirect approaches mean that potential interviewees are suggested by a ‘gatekeeper’ such as extension experts affiliated to the regional chambers of agriculture or through snowball sampling where already interviewed farmers provide new contacts (Helfferich 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2005</a>). Most interviewees were recruited indirectly, i.e. via extension experts who provided farmers’ contact details, and directly through the interviewer’s network (see SM 4). We aimed at conducting the interviews with the person(s) responsible for adaptation decision-making. Depending on the decision competences on the farms, we included farm managers and possibly other family members. In total, twenty semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 29 persons. Thirteen interviews were held with a single farm manager and another four interviews with a farming couple. One interview took place with a farmer and his successor and one with a farming couple and their successor. Another interview involved three generations, i.e. a farmer and his daughter and grandson. Participation in the interview was voluntary and the interviewees decided on the number of participants. Involving all persons responsible for adaptation decision-making on a farm in an interview is reasonable because such an approach stimulates the interviewees, supports them in recalling activities and events, provides some quality control, and can lead beyond the responses of individuals (Flick 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2009</a>; Patton 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2002</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The face-to face interviews were carried out on the farms of the interviewees during the growing period in 2016. An interview guide with open-ended questions was designed (see SM 1) covering the concepts of the theoretical model introduced above. Open-ended questions were asked in order to encourage farmers to report more rather than less, to gain farmers’ personal information, and to elicit new phenomena and unexpected structures, as recommended by Lamnek 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2010</a> and Weischer 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2007</a>. The interview guide supported the interviewer in tailoring the questions to the interviewees and in ensuring that all relevant aspects were covered. It was pre-tested with farmers who were not included in the original sample and slightly changed based on the received feedback. Each interview started with the introductory question: “
  <span class="italic">To start with, would you please share your view on climate change?”</span> with the intention of stimulating narration, and obtaining information on farmers’ belief in and attitude towards climate change. Further topical areas of the interview guide were (i) perceived and expected changes in climate conditions, (ii) perceived and expected climate change-related impacts, (iii) adaptation measures already implemented or planned to be implemented in the future, and (iv) factors stimulating or impairing the implementation of adaptation measures. The sequence of the questions and their particular wording were adjusted to the interview situation in order to keep up the ‘narrative line’ (Weller et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the end of the semi-structured interviews, which lasted between 30 and 120 min the interviewees were asked to fill out a standardized one-page questionnaire about demographic data, i.e. year of birth, gender, and farm structural data, i.e. major production activity, cultivation system, farm size, and full/part-time farming (see SM 2). After the interview, the interviewer took structured notes to summarize interview atmosphere and context (see SM 3).</p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the criterion of ‘theoretical saturation’ (Glaser and Strauss 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">1967</a>), sampling was stopped when informational saturation was reached, i.e. when no new insights were obtained. The sample size is sufficient because of the explorative character of our study which aims at describing a detailed picture of Austrian farmers’ perceptions and adaptation intentions in various farming contexts and because of combining the maximum variation sample and the saturation criterion (Baker and Edwards 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2012</a>; Crouch and McKenzie 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2006</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each farmer agreed to a confidential use of the word-for-word transcript of the interview by signing a consent form. The farmers were given the opportunity to correct factual errors in the interview transcript before data were further analyzed. The interviewees were coded in the transcripts in order to guarantee confidentiality. The codes describe the farming regions (M for Mostviertel, and S for South-East Styria), the interview held in the region numbered consecutively from 1 to 10, and—in case of multiple interviewees in one interview—an additional number referring to the interviewee (e.g. M4,1 and M4,2; see SM 4). These codes are used in the results section to trace the interviews.</p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interview transcripts were analysed systematically by means of a qualitative content analysis (see Mayring 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2010</a>, Kuckartz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2014</a>). Facilitated by the software Atlas.ti (see atlasti.com for more information), the qualitative content analysis was performed in two steps. In the first step, codes were deductively defined based on the theoretical model outlined above, and relevant text passages of the empirical material were assigned to these codes in Atlas.ti. Deductive codes included, for example, belief in climate change, perceived/expected changes in climate conditions, perceived/expected climate change-related risks/opportunities, already implemented/planned adaptation measures, perceived effectiveness/efficiency of adaptation measures, and perceived adaptation costs. Code definitions were based on the relevant theoretical literature (Grothmann 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2005</a>; Grothmann and Patt 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2005</a>; Grothmann and Reusswig 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2006</a>) and saved as code comments in Atlas.ti. In a second step, these codes were further decomposed inductively, i.e. based on the empirical material, for instance to introduce sub-categories or an evaluation. Furthermore, new codes were added for emerging topics. The combination of theoretically- and empirically-driven coding is known as deductive-inductive strategy and widely recommended in the literature in order to increase analytical flexibility and thus utilize the qualitative material as effectively as possible (Gläser and Laudel 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2013</a>; Kuckartz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2014</a>; Schreier 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">2014</a>). It should be noted that there is no algorithm for automatically assigning text passages of the interview transcripts to the defined codes. Developing and applying the code system is an interpretative process based on the intellectual performance of the analysts. The code system was developed in close cooperation by a team of researchers, whereby text segments of the interview transcripts and respective coding were discussed thoroughly in order to improve and refine the code system iteratively.
