 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reviewed theories and models have been empirically tested, modified, or refined for the agricultural adaptation context at different locations. For instance, Roesch-McNally et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2017</a> combine TRA and TPB with the ‘anatomy of adaptation’ suggested by Smit et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2000</a> to build a new conceptual framework for investigating adaptation intentions under a climate change scenario. They show that U.S. Corn Belt farmers intend to implement particular adaptation measures if they believe in their efficacy which farmers may learn from own experience or experience of their peers. Niles et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2016</a> apply TPB in two farming regions in New Zealand and find that intended and actual implementation of adaptation measures are influenced by different factors. They highlight that climate change attitudes and beliefs are only related to intended but not to actual adaptation. Arunrat et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2017</a> use TPB and show that adaptation intention of farmers in a Thai region is mostly affected by perceived behavioural control factors, followed by attitude and subjective norm. Behavioural control is operationalized by assessing farmers’ self-confidence in adjusting current farming practices in the next three years, attitude refers to perceived importance and usefulness of adaptation, and subjective norm relates to perceived social pressure on adaptation behaviour. Hu et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2006</a> use TPB to examine farmers’ use of weather and climate forecasts in eastern Nebraska and the U.S. Corn Belt. Their results suggest that farmers perceive the usefulness of forecasts as rather low and depend on expert knowledge for a regular use.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research on farmers in the U.S. state of Iowa is based on the VBN and reveals that farmers’ belief in climate change significantly influences perceived risks from climate change, which, in turn, fosters agricultural adaptation. Their findings also suggest that farmers who believe in human induced climate change are more likely to support public action on greenhouse gas emissions. However, causal attribution seems to be less relevant for decision-making in agricultural adaptation (Arbuckle et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2015</a>). Sanderson and Curtis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">2016</a> operationalize VBN and demonstrate the importance of cultural factors for farmers’ climate change risk perception, which informs their decisions to apply adaptive water conservation strategies in an Australian region.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Duinen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2014</a> base their investigation on PMT and find that Dutch farmers’ motivation to adapt to droughts can be explained to a significant extent by cognitive factors, i.e. perceived severity of potential consequences, perceived control efficacy, adaptation cost and self-efficacy. McClaran et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2015</a> use PMT to structure their analysis on livestock ranchers in the U.S. state of Arizona. Their findings suggest that the perceived efficacy of selected drought adaptation measures is positively related with implementation. Dang et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2014</a> draw on PMT to explore farmers’ perceived risks and adaptation intentions in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, and find that risk perception increases with belief in climate change, experienced impacts and lack of public adaptation programs. Building upon PMT, Truelove et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">2015</a> analyse paddy farmers’ drought adaptation intentions in Sri Lanka and conclude that efficacy beliefs are the most substantial predictor.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kuruppu and Liverman 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2011</a> adopt elements from MPPACC for the small island of Kiribati and reveal that belief in self-efficacy drive intentions to adapt to water stress. Similarly, Burnham and Ma 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2017</a> use MPPACC and find that perceived self-efficacy including human and financial capital, institutions and entitlements as well as information, technology and other infrastructure increases adaptation intention among small-holder farmers in China. Woods et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">2017</a> build on MPPACC and find a positive correlation between Danish famers’ concern about climate change and intended adaptation to negative impacts. Their results also suggest that farmers respond to potential opportunities emerging from climate change. Frank et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2011</a> incorporate social identity, which represents an individual’s sense or knowledge of membership in a social group, in MPPACC and confirm its importance for the formation of adaptation intentions in an empirical analysis of coffee farmers in Chiapas, Mexico. Consistent with MPPACC, Eakin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2016</a> explore the effects of objective and subjective capacities on farmers’ adaptive capacity in central Arizona, U.S. and suggest that ‘linking’ capacities such as political and social capital are required for collective action.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The summarized empirical results imply that pertinent adaptation measures, prevailing farming systems, cultural values, and norms as well as geographic regions are contexts that need to be considered for operationalizing theories and framing research questions.</p>
