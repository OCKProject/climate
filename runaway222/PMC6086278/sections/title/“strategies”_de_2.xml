 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In ICA-RUS, we developed a concept of “strategies” of global climate risk management and defined through three steps described below (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The “strategies” are treated as risk management alternatives that are available to society. Note that the subject adopting a “strategy” in this sense is intended to be the human society or the global community as a whole through collective decision-making and actions, rather than any particular actor or group of actors. Breaking down a “strategy” into decisions and actions of each actor needs further discussion, which is not covered in this study.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mitigation targets are defined by three considerations: (a) target temperature level, (b) risk averseness, and (c) assumptions about the pathway. Here, the choice regarding risk averseness means deciding on the basis of scientific uncertainty how likely it is that the target temperature would be exceeded. The assumptions about the pathway include a choice as to whether “overshoot” (the concentration or temperature decreases after an initial increase) is allowed or not (Huntingford and Lowe 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2007</a>). The pathways of global GHG emissions consistent with these considerations were identified in Step 1.

     <p>Deriving a range of consequences for each mitigation target under uncertainties.</p>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The range of possible consequences for each mitigation target is determined taking into account various uncertainties, such as climate (and impact) uncertainties, uncertainties concerning mitigation actions, and socio-economic uncertainties. Climate uncertainties arise from uncertainties in the scientific estimates of factors such as climate sensitivity (Freeman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2015</a>). Uncertainties in mitigation actions arise from the possibility that a mitigation action considered necessary to achieve a target is only partially implemented, or else is fully implemented but does not prove as effective as anticipated, and gives rise to the risk that the temperature rise may be greater than initially projected (Mabey et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2011</a>). Socio-economic uncertainties (excluding those relating to climate policy) arise from uncertainties in future projections of variables such as world population, economic development, and social inequality (Riahi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2017</a>).

     <p>Considering necessary adaptation levels (plus need for geoengineering).</p>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The necessary level of adaptation action is considered for each mitigation target and costs are estimated where possible. As a range of consequences is possible for each mitigation target due to the existence of various uncertainties, there is a risk that the temperature rise may exceed the target. It is, therefore, important to take this possibility into account when considering what adaptation action will be required. Where a mitigation target remains subject to the risk of a large temperature rise, consideration should also be given to geoengineering, and in particular to the use of solar radiation management (Royal Society 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In practice, different “strategies” based on the above concept were only partially explored in ICA-RUS. In Step 1, different levels of overshoot were not assessed. In Step 2, uncertainties only due to climate sensitivity and socio-economic scenarios were explicitly considered. Finally, Step 3 was not systematically assessed and was discussed only conceptually. In particular, the lack of a comprehensive assessment of adaptation is a notable limitation of the project. Although we did assess certain aspects of adaptation for agriculture and health, the results are not described in this paper as it focuses on the overall results. None the less, we believe that the concept is useful for further research in the future, where those uncertainties and factors are more fully assessed.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In ICA-RUS, we explored several “strategies” with different combinations of target temperature level and risk averseness. In this paper, however, we mainly discuss only three “strategies” which we eventually focus on. They are T15, T20, and T25 with the GHG emission scenario that would have a 66% probability of limiting the global mean temperature rise to no more than 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 °C, respectively, above the pre-industrial levels. From the next section, they are simply referred to as three different temperature goals rather than “strategies”.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To briefly summarize our findings on different risk averseness, the results for a “strategy” with a 2.0 °C limit and an 80% probability for staying below the limit were broadly similar to those for 1.5 °C and 50%. Likewise, a “strategy” with a 2.5 °C limit and an 80% probability produced similar results for 2.0 °C and 50%. Although a 66% probability was adopted for the main “strategies” in ICA-RUS, as it is frequently used in the literature (e.g., Rogelj et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2015</a>), we argue that the choice of risk averseness is one of the central factors in risk management and needs more discussion.
