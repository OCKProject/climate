 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change caused by human activities mainly through increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) is one of the major threats to the current civilization of humankind. Since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) aiming at “preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system” was established in 1992 (United Nations 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">1992</a>), long-term goals of climate change mitigation in more concrete terms have long been discussed both scientifically and politically (Randalls 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2010</a>; UNFCCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2015a</a>). As a culmination of such discussions, a set of statements on long-term climate goals were included in the Paris Agreement which was agreed by the international community under UNFCCC in 2015 and came into force in the following year (UNFCCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2015b</a>). Namely, “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels” was agreed (hereafter, referred to as “the Paris temperature goals”). To be roughly consistent with this, to “achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century” is also stated in the agreement (“the Paris emission goal”), which essentially means reducing net global anthropogenic GHG emissions to zero sometime between 2051 and 2100.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been widely recognized that such a goal cannot be determined based solely on science, as it involves decisions under uncertainties and diverse value judgments (O’Neill et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2017</a>). Nonetheless, obviously, it should be underpinned by science. Tremendous efforts have been made so far to assess risks due to climate change impacts for different temperature levels. To be as comprehensive as possible, some efforts rely on extensive surveys of assessments in the existing literature (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2014a</a>; Warren et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2015</a>), which are usually based on diverse conditions, assumptions, and scenarios. There have been some attempts of multiple-sector impact assessments based on consistent sets of underlying scenarios (Arnell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2014</a>; Schleussner et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2016a</a>), but that kind of work heavily depends on coordination efforts and thus are still very limited. Mitigation scenarios have also been extensively assessed through literature surveys or a dedicated database as a community effort (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2014b</a>; Schleussner et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2016b</a>). Attempts to combine assessments of impacts and response options are still rare except for the Synthesis Reports of IPCC (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2014c</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ICA-RUS project (“Integrated Climate Assessment—Risks, Uncertainties and Society”) was commenced in 2012 as a “Comprehensive Research on the Development of Global Climate Change Risk Management Strategies” S-10 Strategic Research Project supported by the Environmental Research and Technology Fund of the Ministry of the Environment of Japan, and finished its 5-year plan in March, 2017. It was an inter-disciplinary research project pulling together experts of climate science, impact assessment, energy economics, and studies on science and technology from various institutes and universities in Japan, aiming at assessing climate risks and ways to manage them in a systematic manner. Motivated partly by a reflection on the Fukushima nuclear crisis that Japanese society had experienced in 2011, just before we started the project, we framed the climate issue as a risk management problem at a global scale. By the term risk management, we mean (1) decision-making under uncertainty, (2) decision-making based on scientific evidence, (3) consideration, insofar as possible, of all kinds of circumstances and options, (4) flexible revision according to changes in conditions, and (5) involvement of social value judgments. Viewpoints 3–5 were highlighted particularly in the wake of Fukushima, as we thought the Fukushima case seemed to lack an adequate consideration of these aspects of risk management (Fujigaki 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2015</a>). From a risk management perspective, incorporation of a full range of uncertainties into decision-making is required, which has not been successfully done in most of the discussions on climate goals so far (Mabey et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2011</a>). Note that, although climate risk management often means climate change adaptation and disaster management at a local scale (e.g., Fünfgeld 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2010</a>), in the context of our “global climate risk management”, adaptation is not necessarily the main focus and is regarded only as one of the options.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research in the ICA-RUS project was undertaken in the following five themes: (1) synthesis of global climate risk management strategies, (2) optimization of land, water, and ecosystem uses for climate risk management, (3) identification and analysis of critical climate risks, (4) evaluation of climate risk management options under technological, social, and economic uncertainties, and (5) interactions between scientific and social rationalities in climate risk management. This paper presents the overall conclusions from the discussion in ICA-RUS invoked by this inter-disciplinary research, following brief descriptions of the design and results of the essential parts of assessment done in the project.
