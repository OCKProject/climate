      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alternatives left for the case of high climate sensitivity</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have identified the following three options that we could take if we found that
         climate sensitivity was substantially high and 2 °C would be exceeded even if the
         Paris emission goal was achieved.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
         <div>
            <div>
               <p>Option A: Accepting and adapting to a warmer world</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Option B: Boosting mitigation</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Option C: Climate geoengineering.</p>
            </div>
         </div>
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Option A means taking no additional mitigation action and letting the temperature
         exceed 2 °C, accepting the risks of more severe climate change impacts, and possibly
         making efforts and paying costs for additional adaptation.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Option B means accelerating mitigation actions exceeding the Paris emission goal,
         which possibly means that we should aim at substantially net negative GHG emissions
         in the second half of this century, accepting additional costs and risks due to possible
         side-effects. For example, bio-energy with CCS (BECCS) is one of the negative emission
         technologies that could be adopted then (and is often adopted in many scenarios to
         achieve even the Paris emission goal), but its large-scale deployment requires huge
         land areas and might compromise food security and/or ecosystem services (Fuss et al.
         
         <a>2014</a>; Kato and Yamagata 
         <a>2014</a>). See also Yamagata et al. (
         <a>2018</a>) in this Special Feature.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Option C basically refers to the so-called solar radiation management, which is to
         cancel the warming effect of increased GHGs by the reduction of incoming solar radiation
         due to stratospheric aerosol injection or other means (Royal Society 
         <a>2009</a>). The adoption of this option means to accept risks due to possible side-effects
         and governance failure associated with this techno-fix solution (Preston 
         <a>2013</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obviously, no option is easy to adopt, as any of them entails additional risks, which
         can be disastrous. However, the international community should prepare to choose one
         or any combination of them, in case we find that climate sensitivity is high. That
         decision will require the deepest understanding and most careful deliberation of scientific
         and moral aspects of risks associated with each option.
