         <a>2</a> summarizes our climate change impact assessment at a global scale. Though our analysis
         also provides regional information, we focus on the overall results for brevity in
         this paper, keeping in mind that regional impacts could be essential in the assessment
         of different goals. The impacts in terms of relative change in affected populations
         for selected sectors are shown depending on different goals (T15, T20, and T25) as
         well as business as usual (BaU; without mitigation actions) and fixed climate cases,
         for three different socio-economic pathways (SSP1-3). The fixed climate case shown
         at 0.5 °C temperature increase from the pre-industrial level represents an imaginary
         case only with socio-economic development occurring without climate change, as a reference.
         Climate scenarios from multiple climate models were used to represent uncertainty
         ranges. The populations affected by heat stress (defined by the number of additional
         heat-related deaths) and flooding (the population living in inundated areas) increase
         from the current values with increasing temperature. The malaria-affected population
         (the population living in malaria endemic areas) would be reduced to close to zero
         due to socio-economic development in the fixed climate case, but the reduction would
         be less for a larger temperature increase. The water-stressed population (the population
         living in areas where per capita runoff is less than 1700 m
         <span>3</span>/capita/year, based on Falkenmark 
         <a>1989</a>) shows a slight decrease with increasing temperature due to increasing precipitation.
         The affected populations are larger for a less sustainable socio-economic pathway
         mainly due to a greater population increase.

                  cases, for three different socio-economic pathways (SSP1-3). The abscissa is a global

                  which are 0.5, 1.4, 1.8, 2.2, and 3.0 °C (or over, depending on SSP) for the fixed
                  climate case, T15, T20, T25, and BaU, respectively. Shades represent the uncertainty
                  range assessed using multiple climate models. The water-stress impact for the fixed

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
         <a>3</a> shows the cumulative consumption loss for different goals (including BaU) and socio-economic
         pathways, as a rough indicator of the magnitude of mitigation efforts needed for each
         case, derived from our assessment of economic impacts of mitigation actions. The results
         from four IAMs are shown to represent an indication of uncertainty. A discount rate
         of 5% was used for calculating the present values before temporal accumulation, but
         a different discount rate (ranging from 0 to 5%) changes only the overall scale and
         not the shapes of the graphs (not shown). The cumulative consumption loss naturally
         increases with decreasing temperature (i.e., increasing ambition of a goal). Note
         that, for the T15 goal, some of the IAMs used in ICA-RUS could not provide a feasible
         solution. For SSP1, only one model was unable to solve the T15 case. For SSP2 and
         3, the number of models unable to solve the T15 case increased to two and three, respectively.
         This clearly demonstrates that the T15 goal is less feasible for a less sustainable
         socio-economic pathway.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparing the two figures, we can see that the climate change impacts are generally
         less sensitive to the choice of a goal than to the magnitude of efforts needed to
         achieve a certain goal. The impacts for any goal (T15, T20, or T25) are substantially
         smaller than those for BaU (except for water stress, for which the impact is insensitive
         to mitigation actions). However, the difference in impacts between any two different
         goals is generally smaller than or comparable to climate uncertainties. On the other
         hand, mitigation efforts increase sharply with increasing ambition of a goal, and
         some models cannot provide a feasible solution when a goal is more ambitious than
         a certain limit, although the inter-model spread is considerably large.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We do not claim any quantitative (cost–benefit type) conclusion from this comparison,
         as all the impacts cannot be represented in economic terms and the sectors covered
         are limited. Moreover, there are many unresolved limitations and disputed assumptions
         for a globally aggregated economic assessment of climate change in general (IPCC 
         <a>2014c</a>). Having said that, the existing estimates available so far with known limitations
         do not necessarily show that economic loss due to climate change impacts is greater
         than that due to mitigation actions. For example, according to IPCC (
         <a>2014c</a>), global annual economic losses for warming of ~ 2.5 °C above pre-industrial levels
         are 0.2–2.0% of income, while global consumption losses for mitigation scenarios to
         limit warming to below 2 °C through the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels
         are 3–11% in 2100 relative to baseline scenarios, though the numbers are not directly
         comparable. With this rough quantitative consideration in mind, we can suggest at
         least that a preference to a more ambitious goal (e.g., T15 as compared to T20) is
         not necessarily supported by our globally aggregated assessment. Rather, seen from
         a risk management perspective, we argue that how climate uncertainties (e.g., risks
         due to high climate sensitivity) and risks of failure to achieve a goal are managed
         are as important as the choice of a goal.
