      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change caused by human activities mainly through increasing concentrations
         of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) is one of the major threats to the current
         civilization of humankind. Since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
         Change (UNFCCC) aiming at “preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
         climate system” was established in 1992 (United Nations 
         <a>1992</a>), long-term goals of climate change mitigation in more concrete terms have long been
         discussed both scientifically and politically (Randalls 
         <a>2010</a>; UNFCCC 
         <a>2015a</a>). As a culmination of such discussions, a set of statements on long-term climate
         goals were included in the Paris Agreement which was agreed by the international community
         under UNFCCC in 2015 and came into force in the following year (UNFCCC 
         <a>2015b</a>). Namely, “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C
         above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase
         to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels” was agreed (hereafter, referred to as “the
         Paris temperature goals”). To be roughly consistent with this, to “achieve a balance
         between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases
         in the second half of this century” is also stated in the agreement (“the Paris emission
         goal”), which essentially means reducing net global anthropogenic GHG emissions to
         zero sometime between 2051 and 2100.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been widely recognized that such a goal cannot be determined based solely on
         science, as it involves decisions under uncertainties and diverse value judgments
         (O’Neill et al. 
         <a>2017</a>). Nonetheless, obviously, it should be underpinned by science. Tremendous efforts
         have been made so far to assess risks due to climate change impacts for different
         temperature levels. To be as comprehensive as possible, some efforts rely on extensive
         surveys of assessments in the existing literature (IPCC 
         <a>2014a</a>; Warren et al. 
         <a>2015</a>), which are usually based on diverse conditions, assumptions, and scenarios. There
         have been some attempts of multiple-sector impact assessments based on consistent
         sets of underlying scenarios (Arnell et al. 
         <a>2014</a>; Schleussner et al. 
         <a>2016a</a>), but that kind of work heavily depends on coordination efforts and thus are still
         very limited. Mitigation scenarios have also been extensively assessed through literature
         surveys or a dedicated database as a community effort (IPCC 
         <a>2014b</a>; Schleussner et al. 
         <a>2016b</a>). Attempts to combine assessments of impacts and response options are still rare
         except for the Synthesis Reports of IPCC (IPCC 
         <a>2014c</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ICA-RUS project (“Integrated Climate Assessment—Risks, Uncertainties and Society”)
         was commenced in 2012 as a “Comprehensive Research on the Development of Global Climate
         Change Risk Management Strategies” S-10 Strategic Research Project supported by the
         Environmental Research and Technology Fund of the Ministry of the Environment of Japan,
         and finished its 5-year plan in March, 2017. It was an inter-disciplinary research
         project pulling together experts of climate science, impact assessment, energy economics,
         and studies on science and technology from various institutes and universities in
         Japan, aiming at assessing climate risks and ways to manage them in a systematic manner.
         Motivated partly by a reflection on the Fukushima nuclear crisis that Japanese society
         had experienced in 2011, just before we started the project, we framed the climate
         issue as a risk management problem at a global scale. By the term risk management,
         we mean (1) decision-making under uncertainty, (2) decision-making based on scientific
         evidence, (3) consideration, insofar as possible, of all kinds of circumstances and
         options, (4) flexible revision according to changes in conditions, and (5) involvement
         of social value judgments. Viewpoints 3–5 were highlighted particularly in the wake
         of Fukushima, as we thought the Fukushima case seemed to lack an adequate consideration
         of these aspects of risk management (Fujigaki 
         <a>2015</a>). From a risk management perspective, incorporation of a full range of uncertainties
         into decision-making is required, which has not been successfully done in most of
         the discussions on climate goals so far (Mabey et al. 
         <a>2011</a>). Note that, although climate risk management often means climate change adaptation
         and disaster management at a local scale (e.g., Fünfgeld 
         <a>2010</a>), in the context of our “global climate risk management”, adaptation is not necessarily
         the main focus and is regarded only as one of the options.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research in the ICA-RUS project was undertaken in the following five themes: (1) synthesis
         of global climate risk management strategies, (2) optimization of land, water, and
         ecosystem uses for climate risk management, (3) identification and analysis of critical
         climate risks, (4) evaluation of climate risk management options under technological,
         social, and economic uncertainties, and (5) interactions between scientific and social
         rationalities in climate risk management. This paper presents the overall conclusions
         from the discussion in ICA-RUS invoked by this inter-disciplinary research, following
         brief descriptions of the design and results of the essential parts of assessment
         done in the project. A fuller project report is available at the project website (
