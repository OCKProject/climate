      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this section, we present an interpretation of the Paris goals in the light of our
         assessment described above (The ICA-RUS project was originally intended to provide
         alternatives in terms of long-term climate goals. However, in the Paris Agreement,
         the international community has already chosen long-term goals. Therefore, we changed
         the purpose of our project and made an interpretation of the Paris goals.)
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, we found in the above that temperature goals as low as 2 or 1.5 °C cannot necessarily
         be supported from a globally aggregated cost–benefit perspective, as far as we can
         tell within the scope of our assessment. Although maximizing the aggregated economic
         value is often seen as an objective principle to optimize a policy intervention, we
         should note that the adoption of this principle, which is a form of utilitarian approach,
         heavily involves value judgments. By value judgments, we mean judgments on a question
         like “what should be protected?”, “what should be avoided?”, or “what is acceptable/unacceptable?”
         To appreciate the grounds of the Paris temperature goals, values other than the globally
         aggregated economic value should be taken into consideration. As has been discussed
         in the literature (Okereke 
         <a>2010</a>), such values involve ethical dimensions, particularly a concept called “climate
         justice”, which draws attention to a structural social injustice that those who are
         least responsible (i.e., people in developing countries and future generations, who
         have emitted least amount of GHGs) suffer the most harm. The Paris temperature goals
         can be supported by an ethical position that such an inequality is unacceptable. Other
         grounds may come from concerns of crossing a “tipping point” of any sub-system of
         the Earth system (tipping element). Although the scientific understanding on tipping
         elements still has large uncertainties, and thus, our assessment of them is also limited;
         the lowest possible temperature goals might well be supported to reduce the risks
         of crossing any tipping point. This could also involve value judgments, as triggering
         a catastrophic change in the Earth system by the current generation, which entails
         grave consequences for future generations, is unacceptable by a certain ethical position.
         The issue of tipping elements is further discussed by Iseri et al. (
         <a>2018</a>) in this Special Feature.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, actions needed to meet a temperature goal are not very clear, given the uncertainty
         in climate system (including climate sensitivity, carbon-cycle feedback, and possibly
         others). On the other hand, the emission goal of the Paris Agreement (net zero global
         anthropogenic GHG emissions in the second half of this century) is a clearer one in
         terms of actions needed. In that sense, seen from the framework of our assessment,
         we appreciate the Paris emission goal as a more “actionable” goal. The two kinds of
         goals, the temperature and emission goals, are roughly, but not precisely, consistent
         with each other, and the relationship of the two should be made clearer. This conclusion
         of our echoes that of Geden (
         <a>2016</a>)’s, who also recommended a net zero emissions’ target as an actionable one, although
         his conclusion was based on his political science arguments.
