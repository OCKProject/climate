      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The decision to choose global and long-term goals or options as described in Sect. 
         <a>5.3</a> cannot be made based solely on science. It involves uncertainties and value judgments.
         Thus, social processes play an essential role in such a decision-making, possibly
         involving citizen participation to democratize the process.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, we found in our survey that climate change, as compared with other risk issues,
         has a characteristic that an average person typically feels that it is difficult to
         be engaged in, as it is complex, uncertain, long-term, and hard-to-feel self-efficacy
         (Moser 
         <a>2010</a>; Wolf and Moser 
         <a>2011</a>). Nonetheless, citizens do not necessarily want authorities to make the whole decision.
         There is a gap between the understanding of climate risk issues by experts and that
         by citizens. Experts’ understanding should be translated into contexts of citizens’
         everyday lives. In addition, citizens may want to know the ethical dimensions and
         value judgments that are embedded in seemingly objective experts’ arguments.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To bridge this gap, we propose that an “intermediate layer” of experts be designed
         to mediate among scientific experts, citizens, and stakeholders to deal with ethical
         dimensions, value judgments, and translations. This layer will consist of experts
         from various disciplines particularly including the humanities and social sciences,
         who can translate scientific results into the contexts of everyday life and can explain
         how value judgements are embedded in certain scientific statements by revealing the
         hidden power and knowledge structures of society. The selection process of the members
         of this layer should be done by the government as well as by the public. The members
         of this layer should have an open meeting day with concerned people in public. The
         quality control of this layer will be ensured by continuous discussion. This proposal
         is discussed in detail by Fujigaki (
         <a>2018</a>) in this Special Feature.
