  <p>Impacts of climate change in the 2080s in terms of relative change in global affected populations for selected sectors (heat stress, malaria, flooding, and water stress) depending on different goals (T15, T20, and T25) as well as BaU and fixed climate cases, for three different socio-economic pathways (SSP1-3). The abscissa is a global mean temperature change in the 2080s relative to pre-industrial levels for each case, which are 0.5, 1.4, 1.8, 2.2, and 3.0 °C (or over, depending on SSP) for the fixed climate case, T15, T20, T25, and BaU, respectively. Shades represent the uncertainty range assessed using multiple climate models. The water-stress impact for the fixed climate case is not shown as it was not calculated</p>
