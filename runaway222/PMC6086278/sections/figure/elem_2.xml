  <p>Loss rates of global cumulative consumption (from present to the 2080s) for different goals (T15, T20, and T25) and BaU and for three different socio-economic pathways (SSP1-3). The abscissa is a global mean temperature change in the 2080s relative to pre-industrial levels for each case, which are 1.4, 1.8, 2.2, and 3.0 °C (or over, depending on SSP) for T15, T20, T25, and BaU, respectively. The results from four integrated assessment models are shown</p>
