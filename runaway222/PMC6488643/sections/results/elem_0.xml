  <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have retrieved in situ LSTs from 11 sites in China, shown together with modern air temperature data from nearby meteorological stations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The two temperatures during bacterial growth seasons (March to November, “Methods”) diverge with reducing vegetation cover, indicated by total organic carbon (TOC) contents. The temperature difference could reach ~5 °C in little vegetated regions, while minimal in vegetated regions (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The LSTs from four selected meteorological stations, representing different vegetation zones in China (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>), are quite similar to air temperatures in winter but increase faster in summer (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The difference between the two temperatures increases with reduced vegetation cover, reaching maximal ~10 °C in July in the desert region (Moyu, Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Therefore, our modern observations strongly support that LSTs tend to be amplified as compared to air temperatures, due to poor vegetation cover. It remains intriguing whether such vegetation feedbacks could also be identified particularly during past glacial periods when vegetation coverage was substantially reduced in northern China

The reconstructed temperatures at Luochuan and Xifeng sections show a glacial–interglacial change of 4–10 °C, a range that is consistent with those from the Weinan section located at the southern tip of the CLP
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>

  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While our reconstructed temperatures are consistent among themselves and in tight correspondence with magnetic susceptibility/mean grain size (MS/MGS) variations derived from the same sections (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>), our new data show a couple of novel, and rather surprising, features. First, we have observed consistent offsets of the timing for the transitions from glacial to interglacial periods relative to the changing times in the onsite MS/MGS and TOC content, and ice volume and global temperature variations that are mainly derived from marine records (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Taking the Last Glacial period as an example, our Xifeng and Luochuan temperatures started to rise around 36 ka (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>); that is ~16 kyr in advance of the onsite MS/MGS and TOC changes, in addition to global ice volume maxima as indicated by global benthic δ

   <sub>2</sub> variations

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
   </span>. Our temperature records further indicate that such early warming at the center CLP occurred at nearly every glacial termination during the last seven glacial–interglacial periods spanning the past 800 kyr (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). As a result, the timing of our reconstructed temperatures changes from Luochuan and Xifeng sections does not match with cold and warm events recorded in SST records or the marine benthic δ
   <span class="sup">18</span>O stack from previous studies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–

   </span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Usually, during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (25–15 ka) when continental ice sheets were at their greatest extension during the last glacial period, the lowest global temperatures of this period were recorded through marine proxies. However, this low temperature period is not reflected by our brGDGT-based reconstructions at either Luochuan or Xifeng (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Similarly, instead of recording the Holocene thermal maximum of a relatively warming period between ~11 and 5 ka, our reconstructed temperature curves show a much longer warming duration between ~20 and 5 ka at the center CLP.

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compare our LSTs with previously published brGDGT data from other three CLP sections: Mangshan (34° 56′ N, 113° 22′ E), Lantian (34° 12′ N, 109° 12 ′E), and Weinan (34° 21′ N, 109° 32′ E) (see Fig.

   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). An obvious increasing trend of early warming times from the southeastern Mangshan to central Luochuan and Xifeng sections can be well identified. The onset of warming began around ~36 ka at Luochuan and Xifeng, compared with ~23 ka at Lantian and Weinan, and then decreased to 15–20 ka at Mangshan (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). In contrast, MS/MGS records from those same sections, as well as TOC contents to indicate vegetation changes here, show largely synchronous changes, with transitions typically taking place between ~20 and 10 ka, consistent with the global pattern of the last deglaciation (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). In other words, the early warming reflected in the brGDGT-derived LSTs, relative to their onsite MS/MGS and TOC changes, is a robust feature, irrespective of any chronological uncertainty.
