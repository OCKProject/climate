 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compare our LSTs with previously published brGDGT data from other three CLP sections: Mangshan (34° 56′ N, 113° 22′ E), Lantian (34° 12′ N, 109° 12 ′E), and Weinan (34° 21′ N, 109° 32′ E) (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> for locations) over the past 60 kyr (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). An obvious increasing trend of early warming times from the southeastern Mangshan to central Luochuan and Xifeng sections can be well identified. The onset of warming began around ~36 ka at Luochuan and Xifeng, compared with ~23 ka at Lantian and Weinan, and then decreased to 15–20 ka at Mangshan (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). In contrast, MS/MGS records from those same sections, as well as TOC contents to indicate vegetation changes here, show largely synchronous changes, with transitions typically taking place between ~20 and 10 ka, consistent with the global pattern of the last deglaciation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). In other words, the early warming reflected in the brGDGT-derived LSTs, relative to their onsite MS/MGS and TOC changes, is a robust feature, irrespective of any chronological uncertainty.
