 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our current understanding of the patterns and processes of Quaternary temperature changes has heavily relied on studies of marine records, mainly due to ocean’s uniformity and large capacity of taking up excess heat. For example, the timing and magnitudes of sea surface temperature (SST) variations are recorded by the alkenone unsaturation index

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>, sea level and ice volume cycles are reflected in benthic oxygen isotope values (δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O) from marine sediments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>, and polar air temperatures can also be reconstructed using ice cores
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Even though these proxy-derived oceanic climate reconstructions have served as benchmarks for global climatic changes during the Quaternary, earlier response in marine realm, relative to ice volume changes, has been reported
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>, some of which has been linked to orbital obliquity control
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Although the classical terrestrial Devils Hole chronology
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span> has been revised to be more closely aligned with the marine record
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, as the heterogeneity of land surface, such as topography and vegetation changes, can affect regional climate, direct comparisons between marine and land climate records remain to be difficult
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. More terrestrial records are thus badly needed to better understand the general patterns and mechanisms of climatic changes on land. While cave records, elemental data, and lipid isotope signals offer records of monsoon intensity, and tree ring and pollen records can serve as short-term temperature proxies, long-term land paleotemperature reconstructions have been rare, primarily due to lacking of suitable proxies. Yet, a better understanding of terrestrial temperature variation is essential in deciphering global climatic changes, enhancing the development of climatic models, and predicting regional temperature variations on land. Particularly, amplified temperature changes due to global warming have become a typical feature at the middle and high latitudes of the Asian continent, with northern China, in particular

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The loess–paleosol sequences on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) provide a valuable climatic archive with established and well-constrained chronological controls

  <span class="sup">

  </span>. Recent studies have shown that branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGTs) (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> for structures) derived from membranes of some heterotrophic bacteria are widely distributed in loess deposits, and the newly developed brGDGT proxy holds great potential for paleotemperature reconstruction

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. Here we apply this method to two well-dated loess–paleosol sections, Luochuan (~800 kyr) and Xifeng (~600 kyr), at the center CLP (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and “Methods”) to reconstruct the longest terrestrial paleotemperatures, covering the last seven glacial–interglacial periods. A comparison with other geochemical records reconstructed from the same loess–paleosol sections, as well as marine/global records, reveals distinctive features of brGDGT-recorded land surface temperatures (LSTs) under the influence of vegetation coverage. We have found that such vegetation feedbacks are linked with the intensity of EAM, illustrating the importance and complicity of terrestrial vegetation coverage in affecting LST variations, at least in semi-humid and semi-arid regions. To assist our interpretation, we also present modern observations demonstrating progressively increased contrast between air and in situ LSTs toward desert regions.
