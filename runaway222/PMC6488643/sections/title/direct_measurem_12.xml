 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To better understand possible controlling factors, we measured in situ LSTs in one whole year at 11 sites along a roughly south–north transact in China, covering various latitudinal, topographical, vegetation, and climatic variables. The geographic coordinates of these locations are as follows: Haikou (19° 56’ 40” N, 110° 12’ 10” E), Guilin (109° 58’ 14” E, 24° 59’ 05” N), Taoyuan (28° 49’ 25” N, 111° 30’ 08“E), Manchuanguan (33° 09’ 39“N, 110° 09’ 09” E), Yijun (35° 23’ 20” N, 109° 07’ 58” E), Luochuan (35° 42’ 42” N, 109° 25’ 02” E), Yulin (38° 33’ 5” N, 109° 39’ 28” E), Dengkou (40° 09’ 14” N, 106° 54’ 4” E), Wuyuan (41° 18’ 35” N, 108° 25’ 30” E), Baiyunebo (41° 24’ 35” N, 109° 57’ 47” E), and Aershan (41° 31’ 31” N, 119° 25’ 24” E) (See Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> for the locations). Temperature loggers (Thermochron iButton DS1922L-F5#) were deployed at ca. 5 cm soil depth for these sites to record LSTs at time intervals of every 2 h. After 1 year of burial, the temperature loggers were retrieved and the measured LST was exported and analyzed. The defined temperature in bacterial growth seasons was averaged over March to November.
