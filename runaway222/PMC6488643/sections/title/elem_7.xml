The Xifeng section lies also at the center CLP, ~250 km away from the Luochuan section, with its current MAT and MAP of 9.2 °C and 480 mm, respectively. Samples were taken from two sites at Xifeng: the 16 m eastern site covers the S

   <sub>1</sub>, whereas the nearby 40 m western site (3 km away) extends the sequence continuously down to S

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
   </span> and our robust age model that is verified by independently dated records (Supplementary Fig.

   <span class="sup">

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
   </span>. Major sources of age uncertainty in our age model can be from the determination of age control points and the interpolation methods, since a transition period exists between high and low MGS values and the stratigraphic boundary defined by the MGS signal may be time-transgressive, depending upon the rates of weathering and dust deposition at each section
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
   </span>. However, comparison between the tie points and mid-points of the intervals shows that differences between them are 1.58 ± 1.84 kyr (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 1083) for the Luochuan section
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
   </span>. Therefore, although this correlation approach probably bears some uncertainties of &lt;2 kyr, such uncertainties will not affect our main conclusion based on at a much larger period (i.e., &gt;10-kyr difference).

   <sub>mrs</sub> based on duplicate injections of a selected set of loess–paleosol samples is ca. 0.5 °C. A laboratory internal standard (lacustrine sediment) was also injected after every 30 samples in order to check the repeatability of the sample test and the average analytical reproducibility of the MAT

  </p>
  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It should also be noted that there exist several proxies and calibrations for the paleotemperature reconstruction using brGDGT distributions. Although absolute values of reconstructed temperatures may vary, the structures of paleotemperature curves reconstructed by different proxies and calibrations are generally similar for the same section, especially for the timing of deglacial warmings

  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To better understand possible controlling factors, we measured in situ LSTs in one whole year at 11 sites along a roughly south–north transact in China, covering various latitudinal, topographical, vegetation, and climatic variables. The geographic coordinates of these locations are as follows: Haikou (19° 56’ 40” N, 110° 12’ 10” E), Guilin (109° 58’ 14” E, 24° 59’ 05” N), Taoyuan (28° 49’ 25” N, 111° 30’ 08“E), Manchuanguan (33° 09’ 39“N, 110° 09’ 09” E), Yijun (35° 23’ 20” N, 109° 07’ 58” E), Luochuan (35° 42’ 42” N, 109° 25’ 02” E), Yulin (38° 33’ 5” N, 109° 39’ 28” E), Dengkou (40° 09’ 14” N, 106° 54’ 4” E), Wuyuan (41° 18’ 35” N, 108° 25’ 30” E), Baiyunebo (41° 24’ 35” N, 109° 57’ 47” E), and Aershan (41° 31’ 31” N, 119° 25’ 24” E) (See Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> for the locations). Temperature loggers (Thermochron iButton DS1922L-F5#) were deployed at ca. 5 cm soil depth for these sites to record LSTs at time intervals of every 2 h. After 1 year of burial, the temperature loggers were retrieved and the measured LST was exported and analyzed. The defined temperature in bacterial growth seasons was averaged over March to November.
