 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MS was measured using a MS
  <sub>2</sub> Bartington magnetic susceptibility meter at the Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences. For TOC analysis, the carbonate fraction of homogenized materials was removed using 2 mol/l HCl, then rinsed thoroughly four times in deionized water and dried. For MGS analysis, all samples were pretreated to remove organic matter and calcium carbonate using 30% hydrogen peroxide (H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>) and 6 N hydrochloric acid (HCl), respectively
