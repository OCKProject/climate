 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Luochuan section (35° 47’ N, 109° 26’ E) lies at the center of the CLP (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), with a current mean annual temperature (MAT) of 9.6 °C and a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 592 mm (based on China Meteorological Administration climate records during 1981–2010, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cma.gov.cn" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.cma.gov.cn</span>). The total thickness of the Luochuan loess section is 138 m. We collected samples from the upper 60 m, including 7 consecutive loess layers (L
  <sub>1</sub>–L
  <sub>7</sub>) and paleosol layers (S
  <sub>0</sub>–S
  <sub>7</sub>) spanning the past 800 kyr. A total of 270 samples were collected and analyzed from the Luochuan section at 25 cm intervals, giving an average sampling resolution of 3 kyr.

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another loess–paleosol sequence from the Xifeng section (35° 42’ N, 107° 38’ E), spanning the past 600 kyr, was also sampled and analyzed. The Xifeng section lies also at the center CLP, ~250 km away from the Luochuan section, with its current MAT and MAP of 9.2 °C and 480 mm, respectively. Samples were taken from two sites at Xifeng: the 16 m eastern site covers the S
  <sub>0</sub> (Holocene) and S
  <sub>1</sub>, whereas the nearby 40 m western site (3 km away) extends the sequence continuously down to S
  <sub>8</sub> (Marine Isotope Stage 15). A total of 363 samples with an approximate sampling resolution of 0.4 kyr were taken from the eastern site, while a total of 145 samples with a resolution of 3.3 kyr were taken from the western site.
