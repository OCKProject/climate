 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have retrieved in situ LSTs from 11 sites in China, shown together with modern air temperature data from nearby meteorological stations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The two temperatures during bacterial growth seasons (March to November, “Methods”) diverge with reducing vegetation cover, indicated by total organic carbon (TOC) contents. The temperature difference could reach ~5 °C in little vegetated regions, while minimal in vegetated regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The LSTs from four selected meteorological stations, representing different vegetation zones in China (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>), are quite similar to air temperatures in winter but increase faster in summer (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The difference between the two temperatures increases with reduced vegetation cover, reaching maximal ~10 °C in July in the desert region (Moyu, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Therefore, our modern observations strongly support that LSTs tend to be amplified as compared to air temperatures, due to poor vegetation cover. It remains intriguing whether such vegetation feedbacks could also be identified particularly during past glacial periods when vegetation coverage was substantially reduced in northern China

TOC content is used here to indicate vegetation cover. Bacterial growth seasons are defined as the period from March to November. The purple triangles represent the locations with low vegetation biomass, while green triangles represent the locations with high vegetation biomass. The highlighted low TOC (≤1.2%) interval indicates high temperature contrast in little vegetated regions. See Supplementary Fig.
