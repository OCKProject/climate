  <p>Measured land surface and air temperatures in bacterial growth seasons and the temperature difference against total organic carbon (TOC) contents at 11 locations in China. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Measured in situ land surface and air temperatures. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Temperature difference between measured in situ land surface and air temperatures. (1) Aershan, (2) Haikou, (3) Yijun, (4) Guilin, (5) Manchuanguan, (6) Taoyuan, (7) Luochuan, (8) Baiyunebo, (9) Wuyuan, (10) Yulin and (11) Dengkou. TOC content is used here to indicate vegetation cover. Bacterial growth seasons are defined as the period from March to November. The purple triangles represent the locations with low vegetation biomass, while green triangles represent the locations with high vegetation biomass. The highlighted low TOC (≤1.2%) interval indicates high temperature contrast in little vegetated regions. See Supplementary Fig.
