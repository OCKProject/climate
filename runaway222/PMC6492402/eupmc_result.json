    "BACKGROUND:Schools can play a vital role in the resettlement of refugee children and their families. Yet, the body of research examining school environmental factors that support the mental health and acculturation of refugee children is methodologically heterogeneous, investigates numerous and disparate school factors, and is often \"hidden\" in broader qualitative studies. This limits the capacity to apply the findings in a practical manner. METHODS:Based on PRISMA statement principles, we review the relevant literature to investigate the relationship between school climate and the emotional wellbeing and resettlement outcomes of refugee students. Six electronic databases will be systematically searched: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAL, Web of Science, and ERIC, supplemented by a systematic review of the grey literature, relevant international websites, and sequential, site-specific internet searches. Finally, subject area experts will be consulted and backward and forward citation searches of included articles will be completed. Two independent reviewers will screen identified articles against eligibility criteria and extract data for included studies. Quality of included studies will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) for mixed studies reviews. Data will be synthesised using a convergent qualitative narrative approach. DISCUSSION:Given the centrality of school in the daily lives of resettled refugee children, it is vital to assess the impact of school climate on the psychosocial wellbeing and resettlement trajectories of this population. This review will identify evidence-based school factors which support good mental health and resettlement outcomes for refugee students and make recommendations for translation of this knowledge into the school environment.
