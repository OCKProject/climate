 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To isolate the impact of lowered sea level on IPWP glacial climate, we focus on the SL
  <sub>MC</sub> response, which captures the effect of lower LGM sea level over the Maritime Continent (exposure of the Sunda and Sahul shelves, altered Indonesian throughflow passages, and tidal mixing) but holds GHGs and ice sheet extent at preindustrial conditions (see the Supplementary Materials for details). These sea level effects explain many patterns of hydroclimate change at the LGM inferred from our proxy network, including the large-scale drying over the Maritime Continent and northern Australia, as well as the wetter conditions over equatorial East Africa (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>). These rainfall changes are accompanied by colder SSTs over the eastern IO and warmer SSTs over the western IO (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>, shading), also evident in the proxy data after removing the mean IO cooling (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>, circles). The simulated dipole of drier/wetter conditions across the equatorial IO reflects a greatly weakened Walker circulation in the IO, with increased ascending motion and convection in the western IO and reduced ascending motion and convection over the eastern IO and the Maritime Continent (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>).

Maps show, from left to right, annual mean changes in rainfall, SST and surface wind stress (vectors), and upwelling (shading) and thermocline depth (contours). Overlaid circles show proxy-inferred changes in hydroclimate (left) and SST (center). The simulated and proxy SST change averaged over the domain was removed to emphasize the changes in horizontal gradients. The value of the simulated SST cooling averaged over the tropics (30°S to 30°N) is shown in blue. Upwelling is defined as the ocean vertical velocity at a 50-m depth. Thermocline depth is computed as the depth of the maximum vertical temperature gradient. Thermocline depth change contours are at 5-m intervals. Note the different proportions of the right panels focusing on the equatorial IO. The color schemes for relative SST and rainfall change are not linear.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These changes represent a marked departure from the modern Walker circulation, albeit not a complete reversal of the large-scale overturning over the IO. The changes in SST are a critical part of this response, as the warmer western IO becomes more favorable for ascending motion—and deep convection—while the colder eastern IO favors subsiding motion and drying. This SST dipole drives anomalous easterly winds along the equator (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>, vectors), which drive the ocean into a state that also represents a major departure from modern conditions. The equatorial thermocline, which is uniformly deep across the modern equatorial IO, responds to the easterly winds, establishing a large-scale east-west tilt with shoaling of more than 15 m over the eastern side of the basin (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>, contours). In addition, the easterly winds drive equatorial upwelling (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>, shading), also in contrast to the present-day climate, in which upwelling is restricted off the coast of Sumatra. These two processes act to cool the eastern IO, reinforcing the SST gradient and the easterly winds, consistent with a positive feedback loop akin to the Bjerknes feedback (
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>). This feedback is excited by an atmospheric response to exposure of the Sahul shelf, with drying and anomalous subsidence over the shelf and anomalous easterly winds over the eastern IO. These wind changes shoal the thermocline in the east, initiating the cooling (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). In addition, anomalous westward currents advect the climatological temperature gradient (warmer in the east, less warm in the west), effectively warming the western IO and establishing the characteristic SST dipole seen in the simulations and proxy data.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is significant proxy-model agreement between SL
  <sub>MC</sub> and both hydroclimate and SSTs (κ
  <sub>max</sub> = 0.26 and 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.38), indicating that lowered sea level during the LGM relative to modern conditions is responsible for key features of the proxy patterns (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>). Among the sea level boundary conditions, exposure of both the Sahul and Sunda shelves is the main driver of these responses, as shown by the superior agreement with both the hydroclimate (κ
  <sub>max</sub> = 0.26; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>) and the SST (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.27, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.1; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>) proxies. Exposure of the Sunda shelf explains drying over Borneo, Sumatra, and Thailand, while the Sahul shelf explains the drying over New Guinea and northern Australia and wetter equatorial East Africa (fig. S2). Statistically significant κ values occur for a limited range of thresholds used to categorize the model changes into drier, unchanged, or wetter LGM (fig. S3), suggesting that each shelf in isolation cannot explain data. Proxy-inferred SST changes are best explained by exposure of both shelves combined (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>), with Sahul dominating the agreement, a result that demonstrates that this shelf is most effective at exciting the Bjerknes feedback (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). Further inclusion of GHG and orbital forcing does not change the agreement for hydroclimate (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>) and degrades the agreement with SSTs (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>). Together, these results demonstrate that shelf exposure and Bjerknes amplification best explain the proxy-inferred hydrological changes over the IO and Maritime Continent.
