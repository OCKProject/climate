 <p>Approach used to compute the climate response to different LGM boundary conditions. First column identifiers are used throughout the study to identify each climate response. The third column is the operation between climatologies used to compute each climate response. See tables S3 and S4 for a list of simulations. PI, preindustrial; GHG, greenhouse gases; ITF, Indonesia throughflow; SL, sea level; MC, Maritime Continent.</p>
