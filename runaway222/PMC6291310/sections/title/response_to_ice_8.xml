 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We isolate the response to ice sheets (topography and albedo) using single-forcing simulations that change only these aspects. Additional simulations allowed us to isolate the responses to ice sheet albedo (IS
  <sub>albedo</sub>) and topography (IS
  <sub>topo</sub>). The IS
  <sub>albedo</sub> response shows that the higher albedo of the LGM ice sheets causes dry conditions over the northern IPWP, India, and southeastern Asia, a key feature of the proxy-inferred patterns that cannot be explained by shelf exposure (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>), which show pronounced glacial cooling in these areas (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2H</a>, circles). The changes in response to ice sheet topography are generally opposite and weaker over the IPWP domain, confirming the preeminence of ice sheet albedo as a driver of glacial changes in IPWP climate (see section S7.1 for full details on the responses to albedo and topography and their nonlinear interactions).
