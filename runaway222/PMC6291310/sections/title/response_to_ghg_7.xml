 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We followed the same approach to determine whether lower GHGs could explain any part of the patterns seen in the proxy data. Here, we use our single-forcing simulation that reduces GHG concentrations to LGM levels but holds ice extent and sea level effects at preindustrial values. The associated response shows wetter conditions over the Maritime Continent and drying over the western IO and equatorial East Africa (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a>, shading). GHG forcing also drives drying in inland East Africa, explaining the proxy-inferred patterns over that region. The simulated wetter conditions over the Maritime Continent are not supported by the proxies (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a>, circles), resulting in low model-proxy agreement (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>). Reduced GHGs drive a tropical mean cooling of −1.9 K and produce an SST pattern that is largely the opposite of the sea level response, with a warmer eastern IO (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2E</a>, vectors). Accordingly, the pattern correlation with the SST proxy data is negative but not significant at the 1σ level (

  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.33; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>). Together, these changes are consistent with stronger ascending motion over the IPWP center (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3B</a>), anomalous westerly winds along the equatorial IO (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2E</a>, vectors), suppression of equatorial upwelling (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2F</a>, shading), and a deeper thermocline in the east (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2F</a>, contours). These responses also indicate Bjerknes amplification, as in the sea level case, but with circulation and SST gradient changes in the opposite direction, hence the lack of proxy-model agreement (
