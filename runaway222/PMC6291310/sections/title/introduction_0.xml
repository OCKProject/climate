 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP)—the region of warm waters and strong rainfall straddling the Indian Ocean (IO) and Pacific Ocean—experienced large climate changes during the Pleistocene glacial periods (

   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>); yet the drivers and mechanisms behind these changes remain unclear. This is an important question because a better understanding of these past intervals could help evaluate models and theories used to predict future changes in this key component of the global hydrological cycle. These glacial changes are expected to be driven by changes in the Pacific Ocean (

  </a>), a basin that dominates IPWP climate variability on year-to-year time scales associated with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation phenomenon. The patterns in the paleodata, however, are spatially heterogeneous and could reflect multiple processes, such as the influence of seasonal insolation forcing (

  </a>). Models simulate a large diversity of responses during the most recent glacial period, many of which do not match inferred signals from paleoclimate proxies (

  </a>), limiting our ability to attribute the drivers of IPWP climate on glacial-interglacial time scales.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we explore the drivers and mechanisms of IPWP climate change using a suite of model simulations and two multiproxy reconstructions of rainfall and sea surface temperature (SST) of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ca. 21,000 years ago). We focus our study on the LGM because it is firmly dated and well sampled, allowing us to infer robust patterns of hydroclimate change and ocean surface cooling. To identify key atmospheric and oceanic processes, we use a synthesis of rainfall-sensitive proxies and a reconstruction of LGM SST anomalies derived from sedimentary alkenone

To diagnose the mechanisms driving glacial changes in IPWP climate, we compare these reconstructions to simulations performed with the Community Earth System Model version 1.2 (CESM1). Our modeling approach includes a simulation of the LGM climate and a series of “single-forcing” simulations with different combinations of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, ice sheet topography, ice cover, and sea level (table S3). We also perform a hierarchy of simulations with different degrees of air-sea coupling to isolate the importance of atmospheric versus ocean processes. See the Supplementary Materials for further details on the proxy syntheses, the model simulations, and the coupling hierarchy.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Different methodologies are used to quantify model-proxy agreement. The hydroclimate reconstruction is categorical, and therefore, we estimate the model-proxy agreement using the weighted Cohen’s κ statistic, following previous work (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>). Cohen’s κ values are computed as a function of thresholds used to categorize the model changes as a drier, unchanged, or wetter LGM (relative to preindustrial conditions). Our main metric of proxy-model agreement is the maximum κ value with 2σ significance (κ
  <sub>max</sub>) resulting from this sensitivity analysis. The ocean temperature reconstruction is quantitative, and therefore, we simply calculate the pattern correlation between proxy and simulated values at the core sites. Further details on the proxy syntheses, implementation of the glacial boundary conditions, the single-forcing simulations, the coupling hierarchy, and the proxy-model agreement quantification may be found in the Supplementary Materials.
