 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most important transitions in the evolution of the GPI is the establishment of a favorable region for genesis centered over the western North Pacific, with a concurrent reduction in favorability over the South Indian Ocean (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). The timing of this transition must have occurred after the Late Miocene and before the Late Pliocene (LMLP; ~10‒3 Ma), given the similarity in global TC distribution between the Late Pliocene and the present-day (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What causes this shift in the TC genesis potential during the LMLP transition? Tectonic motions and changes in CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration are two potential factors, as these are the two most obvious differences in boundary conditions between the Late Miocene and Late Pliocene experiments and can exert a significant influence on tropical climate. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the geographic distribution of genesis potential in the Late Miocene is broadly insensitive to the CO
  <sub>2</sub> level applied (i.e., 350 vs. 560 ppmv), and the pattern of modern genesis regions largely remains unchanged in response to rising CO
  <sub>2</sub> (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). Thus, the LMLP transition in TC genesis may be largely attributed to changes in the position of the continents—among which the restriction of Indonesian seaway and the closure of Panama seaway stand out.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test the effect of the tropical seaway closures in potential TC formation, we perform two sensitivity experiments with the NorESM-L. Taking the Late Pliocene experiment with closed Indonesian and Panama seaways as the baseline (referred to as LP_closeIP), in the first experiment we keep the Indonesian seaway closed but open the Panama seaway (referred to as LP_closeI); in a second experiment (referred to as LP_noclosure), we open both tropical seaways. The results indicate that the closure of the tropical seaways leads to higher temperatures over the western North Pacific with weakened surface wind speed (i.e., LP_closeIP minus LP_noclosure; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>) and cooling in the South Indian Ocean (except at very low latitudes) with enhanced surface wind speed—changes that are supported by geological evidence

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. Higher ocean heat convergence in the equatorial Pacific leads to higher SSTs, and these contribute directly to larger potential intensity here, with additional support from decreases in surface wind speeds in the western end of the basin near Indonesia (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a> and Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). Conversely, decreases in ocean heat convergence in the Indian Ocean between 10° and 20°S lead to surface cooling and reductions in potential intensity, with contribution from enhanced surface wind speeds. Vertical wind shear is reduced over the western North Pacific, consistent with the weaker meridional temperature gradient in the troposphere, whereas it exhibits an increase south of 10°S over the South Indian Ocean (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c, d</a>). Moist entropy deficits rise over the South Indian Ocean, which arises from decreased mid-tropospheric relative humidity, consistent with anomalous descent (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4e, f</a>). In the equatorial Pacific, moist entropy deficits are lower, mainly as a result of larger relative humidity from stronger ascent. Each of these factors contributes to a more favorable environment over the western North Pacific, but a less favorable one in the South Indian Ocean (except at very low latitudes where GPI is increased) when the tropical seaways are closed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4g</a>), and there is an overall equatorward migration of genesis regions.

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial changes in the genesis regions induced by the tropical seaway closures (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4g</a>) are qualitatively consistent with the differences between the Late Miocene and Late Pliocene over the western North Pacific and South Indian Ocean (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>). These results suggest the role of tropical seaway closures in the LMLP transition dominates in terms of genesis distribution. Further, the restriction of the Indonesian seaway is more important in the reduced genesis potential over the Southern Indian Ocean, while the closure of the Panama seaway has a larger effect on increasing favorable conditions over the western North Pacific. The narrowing Indonesian seaway affects the large-scale environmental conditions important to storm formation over the western Pacific (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11</a>) via the regulation of the Indonesia Throughflow (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12</a>). However, these effects are more profound over the equatorial Pacific in our simulations, where storms rarely form as the Coriolis parameter is weak. In contrast, the closure of the Panama seaway strongly affects the genesis potential over the western North Pacific, and shows limited influence over the low latitudes of the South Indian Ocean (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">13</a>).
