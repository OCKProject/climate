 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the Cenozoic TC evolution, we first simulate a wide range of Cenozoic climates using the low-resolution version of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM-L), which includes the Early Eocene, Late Eocene, Late Oligocene, Early Miocene, Late Miocene, Late Pliocene, and today. We then adopt a genesis potential index (GPI), which summarizes changes in the large-scale environments that spawn and support storms, to estimate TC locations and frequencies, as low-resolution climate models are better able to reproduce these large-scale genesis factors than the TC-like systems themselves

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study highlights that TC genesis varied substantially with the climate shifts of the Cenozoic. During the Early Eocene, simulated annual sea surface temperatures (SSTs) averaged over the tropics (30°S‒30°N) reach ~30 °C (5 °C higher than in the pre-industrial), resulting from high CO
  <sub>2</sub>, and within the range suggested by proxy-based estimates
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. Although the 26 °C isotherm is often used in modern meteorology to highlight areas with favorable thermodynamic conditions for TC production and high potential intensity, this indicator is not useful in other climates. The isotherm is displaced poleward to ~40°N/S during the Early Eocene (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), but many locations enclosed by it are shown to be much less favorable for storm formation than today. This is attributed to the fact that the isotherm separating regions that support deep convection (e.g. potential intensity &gt; 50 m/s
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>) from those that do not, varies with climate. For example, relative to the present-day, the North Pacific and North Atlantic in the Early Eocene were much less favorable for TC genesis in the deep tropics, whereas some regions with conditions that support storms appear at higher subtropical latitudes in the central North Pacific (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a, g</a>). During the Early Eocene, when the Australian continent was confined south of ~30°S, there was a zonal band with favorable conditions for genesis extending from ~30°E to 120°W across the Southern Hemisphere tropics. The South Indian Ocean was the basin most conducive to storm formation during this period, rather than the western North Pacific.

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We consider this reorganization of potential TC distribution in the Early Eocene to be due to the adjustment of the atmospheric thermal structure and its associated circulations. Over the western North Pacific, the decreased potential intensity in the Early Eocene at low latitudes (5‒12°N) is mainly caused by the reduced air-sea disequilibrium relative to present (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) resulting from weakened surface radiative flux and enhanced surface wind speed (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>), whereas it is largely attributed to higher outflow temperatures at higher latitudes, which leads to smaller thermodynamic efficiency given larger warm temperature anomalies in the upper troposphere than the surface (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The meridional temperature gradient in the troposphere is intensified south of ~22°N and leads to enhanced vertical wind shear in thermal wind balance (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>); the reduced temperature gradient contributes to the weakened wind shear at the north of ~22°N. The moist entropy deficit anomaly broadly exhibits a tripole pattern, with a decrease at the zonal band of ~12‒20°N and an increase along its northern and southern sides (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). The increased moist entropy deficit is largely caused by a decreased temperature contrast between the mid-troposphere and the surface, which weakens the strength of the surface heat fluxes, whereas the smaller deficit between 12‒20°N results from increased relative humidity (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). The lower potential intensity, enhanced wind shear, and larger moist entropy deficit all point to decreasing favorability for TC genesis in the Early Eocene over the deep tropics (~ 5‒15°N) of the western North Pacific (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>).

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, all of the genesis factors point to more favorable conditions for storm generation in the Early Eocene over the South Indian Ocean, except equatorward of 10°S (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e-h</a>). The higher potential intensity south of 10°S is attributed to the increased air-sea disequilibrium because of the weakened surface wind speed and larger thermodynamic efficiency owning to the lower outflow temperature (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2f</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). The reduced wind shear between ~12‒26°N results from decreased meridional temperature gradient that leads to a smaller vector difference in the winds between the upper and lower troposphere (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2g</a>). The decreased moist entropy deficit over the majority of South Indian Ocean results from the larger relative humidity, though the vertical temperature contrast is also decreased (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2h</a>). The favorability of TC formation is also decreased over the entire eastern North Pacific, arising largely from enhanced wind shear and larger moist entropy deficits, while favorable conditions shift poleward in both the Southern Pacific and North Atlantic (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>), consistent with a prior study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Overall, favorable conditions for genesis in the Early Eocene shift to higher tropical latitudes and away from very low ones, which may be tied to the poleward migration of the Hadley circulation in the Early Eocene relative to present (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the climate cools through the Cenozoic, conditions across the Northern Hemisphere become more favorable with time, while the Southern Hemisphere becomes less favorable later in the era (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a, e</a>). The latitude of peak GPI broadly shifts equatorward in both hemispheres over the era. However, the environments supporting storm genesis over time are very different between ocean basins. Over the western North Pacific (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>), conditions remain relatively unfavorable for genesis from the Early Eocene through the Late Miocene, but this is followed by a remarkable increase and equatorward shift in the GPI at the transition to the Pliocene. Broadly similar behavior is seen in the North Atlantic (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>). The GPI over the eastern North Pacific also increases during the Cenozoic, but actually begins to rise in earlier time-intervals, peaking in the Late Miocene (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). In the Southern Hemisphere (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e–h</a>), the GPI is more varied by region, but there is a large decrease in the latitude of the peak GPI—shifting nearly 10° equatorward from the Early Eocene to the present-day over each ocean basin.
