  </span>. Taking the aforementioned Late Pliocene experiment as the reference run (referred to as LP_closeIP), we perform two sensitivity experiments to examine the potential role of tropical seaway closures (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). In one sensitivity experiment, we open both the Indonesian and Panama seaways (referred to as LP_noclosure), leaving the other boundary conditions unchanged from the Late Pliocene run. Specifically, the Indonesian seaway is broadened by converting the northern part of New Guinea (11 grid cells) to ocean with a depth of ~50 m (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">19</a>). The Panama seaway is opened by removing one land grid cell and setting the depth of new ocean grid cell to 25 m (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">19</a>); we verify there are through-flows between the Atlantic and Pacific under this scenario. In the other sensitivity experiment, only the Panama seaway is opened (referred to as LP_closeI). The modifications of tropical seaways in these sensitivity experiments are designed to roughly represent the Pliocene palaeoceanographic conditions. It should be noted that the modeled climate responses may be dependent on the depth and width of tropical seaways applied in the model
