 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tropical cyclones (TCs) are one of nature’s most destructive hazards and can result in catastrophic losses of life and massive economic losses over populated coastal regions. They respond to changes in climate and may also feedback on climate via modulating oceanic heat transport

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Today, TCs originate over tropical and subtropical oceans, biased towards the western sides of individual basins, and with more storms forming over the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. The western North Pacific accounts for approximately one third of all global TCs today and is the most productive storm basin in the world. This basic spatial distribution of TC genesis largely holds for simulations of climates with land-sea configurations similar to the present-day

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, even though there are important shifts poleward with warming

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the Cenozoic era—spanning from ~65 Ma ago to present—the Earth’s climate has undergone substantial changes, including a long-term cooling, which moved the planet from a hothouse world with ice-free poles, to an icehouse world with ice-covered poles
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Several important climatic events and transitions, some driven by tectonic plate motions and others by changes in greenhouse gas concentrations

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>, created a rich diversity of climates during this era. Although there has been progress in our understanding of how storms may vary with climate during the Late Quaternary

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>, the history of global TC activity during most of the Cenozoic remains unknown, owing to the dearth of paleo-storm records. Given the potential climate impact of TCs

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span> and its dependence on the location of TC-induced mixing

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>, it is of great interest to explore how the regions that support and sustain TCs may have varied during the large climate shifts of the Cenozoic—especially when and how the modern pattern of TC genesis was established.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we present a possible scenario for the Cenozoic evolution of TC genesis on tectonic timescales based on a suite of coupled climate model simulations. We find that conditions during the warmer Early Eocene are more conducive to storm formation over the Southern Hemisphere, with the South Indian Ocean being the most favorable basin. There is then an increasing favorability for genesis in the Northern Hemisphere and a coincident decrease in the Southern Hemisphere as the climate cools, alongside an equatorward shift in the most favorable conditions. In particular, we identify the important role of the closure of the tropical seaways during the Pliocene in establishing the modern-day TC distribution over the western North Pacific and Southern Indian Oceans.</p>
