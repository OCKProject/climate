  </span> at the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research. NorESM-L is built under the structure of the Community Earth System Model and consists of four components coupled together. The atmospheric component is the Community Atmospheric Model version 4 (CAM4), which has a horizontal resolution of ~3.75° × 3.75° with 26 vertical levels. The land component is the Coummunity Land Model version 4 and adopts the same horizontal resolution as CAM4. The ocean and sea-ice component is the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM) and Los Alamos Sea Ice Model version 4 (CICE4), respectively. MICOM has a nominal 3° horizontal resolution and 32 vertical levels. The model has been proven to be skillful in capturing the present-day climate and performs well in reproducing the majority of features across a wide range of paleoclimates
