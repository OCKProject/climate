   <span class="sup">−1</span> in the modeled present climate, but the isotherm that correlates with high potential intensity varies across climates. Storm season is defined as Aug–Sep–Oct for the Northern Hemisphere and Jan–Feb–Mar for the Southern Hemisphere. The units of genesis potential are events m
