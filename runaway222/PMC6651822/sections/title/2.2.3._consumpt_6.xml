 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A data backend ecosystem was developed to support the interoperable data flow to enable a big data oriented approach that generates valuable services. The ecosystem allows continuous interaction with the mobile application. This enables participative data gathering, interoperability among different sources, analysis and modelling over the widest array of information, interventions support, and data production to be consumed by users through the application.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In turn, the design and development of the mobile application integrates a data flow process that allows a continuous real time interaction and flow between the data production and consumption processes. To do so, four steps were followed defining four overlapping data contextual layers, as presented in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02940-f001" href="#sensors-19-02940-f001">Figure 1</a>. These data layers were mirrored to the backend infrastructure for data processing and visualization of processed data and consumed through the mobile application, enabling real-time information delivery.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The four steps for data production and consumption flow comprise the following:

   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Citizen science data gathering: this allows data gathering from the world of IoT and wearable devices that provide health status, presence, and use of a specific service. This includes a data acquisition phase binding the data streams to a common representational scheme to prepare the data for the sensor fusion and to counter some conditions with some pre-processing and elimination procedures (avoiding overloading of data), thus harvesting the data from the sensor units, tagging them with location and time information and storing data in real time. This supports data production and leverages data science.</p>

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The collected information enables the Usersâ€™ Context and comprises sensing and capturing of perceptual data regarding health, lifestyle, and habits behaviour (e.g., exercise, food, mobility). These data are linked with data coming from the Environmental Context.</p>
 <div list-type="bullet" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Data sampling and collection: this process gathers environmental data from public data sources; mainly air quality data coming from satellites, fixed and mobile stations, as well as through the city sensors and citizen science mobile devices (smartphones and wearables). The collected information enables data production to be handled by the Environmental Context within the data ecosystem.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Data set fusion: this process brings together data sampling and collection with high-quality pre-existing datasets (i.e., environment and health) to provide a comprehensive view of the environmental domain (e.g., risks, potential exposure) and integration with health information (e.g., asthma related symptoms). The collected information enables the Big Data Context, which is the operating environment that allows data fusion and spatio-temporal modelling in order to provide, for example, health risk estimates or pollution estimated exposure real-time information. This data layer also provides the urban data lake (including cloud-based servers), which stores the data and applies interpolation models to allow an interactive data consumption process, providing valuable insights and data to enable information-oriented services.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Data interaction: this supports interactive data consumption through the mobile context and application. The collected information enables the Mobile Context. It provides a tool that hides the complexity of the data flows and provides the information in one coherent integrated visualization. It is a robust, user-friendly, and appealing interactive data layer that aims at providing data value and empowerment to citizens.</p>
