 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This research work shares the design and development of the PulsAir application, as part of the technological developments and big data-oriented ecosystem approach of the PULSE project. Nowadays, it is recognized that the sum of individual or household behaviours should have a substantial impact on improving the surrounding environmental and health context. However, it is difficult for citizens to relate their personal behaviour to large-scale problems such as climate change, pollution, or health. Under this context, this work gathers and shares evidence, and models perceptual sensing data, coupled with a citizen science data capturing participatory approach, to do the following: (a) analyse and model health, socio-economic, and air quality data to improve lifestyle, healthier, and greener behaviours; and (b) support further policy planning and city design by creating the urban data lake, which stores the measured pollution levels as well as data from citizens regarding their mobility (i.e., geolocation) through the city, health, and socio-economic status. Moreover, the development and deployment of PulsAir helps to better understand urban air pollution and its health impacts, as well as the participatory approach through citizen science challenges and data-driven analysis of defined areas in large cities. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The presented mobile application is being deployed and evaluated in seven major cities, in seven different countries covering three continents (Europe, Asia, and North America) with a total of 1500 users. The PulsAir application and data ecosystem was designed under a multidomain perspective (e.g., health, social, environmental, and economic) and an iterative user centric and co-creation approach. Key stakeholders and users provided feedback to several incremental mock-up versions during the system design process, ensuring the integration of requirements from citizens belonging to all regions. This means that the PulsAir application and data ecosystem have been designed to be a tool used worldwide and particularly in cities with high levels of pollution such as Paris, Singapore, or New York. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A layered approach for data production and consumption links the interaction between the PulsAir application and the backend processing. This generates a dynamic data ecosystem that enables citizen science data capturing, fusing these data with data captured from satellites or environmental sensors in cities and the existing legacy data, which are modelled and sent to the application for visualization and use by the citizens. Smartphones, wearables, fixed/mobile environmental/weather stations, and satellites serve as nodes for environmental, mobility, and socio-economic data capturing and sharing, while public health and urban climate local repositories provide existing targeted domain information. The system integrates the smartphone application for data gathering and sharing through data uploading into the centralized repository and data lake. As data are collected from many users in different cities, the data density increases, so modelling of the data is required to provide more accurate estimates of citizen health risks and exposure to pollution. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comprehensive developments of the PulsAir application and supporting data demonstrate the capacity of producing an integrated and more condensed data ecosystem. The continuous large-scale collection of citizen science data (e.g., socio-economic, health, and geolocation), data from city sensors and satellites, and related legacy data will enlarge the current data environment and provide a higher data spatial resolution. This higher density of data allows richer and more accurate big data-oriented analytics and machine learning predictive models to provide more personalized feedback and environmental-health risk information to citizens (through the application) and policymakers (through the data ecosystem). Consequently, this approach will empower users by providing more informed and data-driven feedback for decision making. The citizens can move towards healthier and greener behaviours based on the recommendations received. The policy decision makers can have more clear spatial references linked to environmental and health data to better analyse the situation in the defined areas (e.g., neighbourhoods), in order to generate spatially targeted health-oriented interventions (e.g., health policies that prevent hospitalizations or better health recommendations). The actions taken by the PHOs in defined spaces or areas in the cities can produce a direct impact on citizens’ perception, generating greater motivation and empowerment, encouraging their participation in citizen science.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The application and data ecosystem still have to be validated, but the initial deployment of the seven pilots enabled a preliminary positive feedback demonstrating that the PulsAir and data ecosystem aims are realizable. Both developments are being deployed in seven major cities, in seven different countries covering three continents (Europe, Asia, and North America) with a total of 1500 users. The evaluation will provide information regarding the level of acceptance, satisfaction, effectiveness, and user experience for further scalability and larger deployments. Moreover, further results from the PULSE pilots are needed to validate the development of the context-specific and personalized risk models. Notwithstanding, our findings and approach demonstrate a step forward for understanding the infrastructure and tools needed for the full potential of citizen science. The PulsAir and data ecosystem approach provides tangible foundational developments that empower citizens to address health problems in urban environments, while enabling scientifically sound citizen science data that could be used in defined local areas of cities where the infrastructure does not provide enough volume for environmental-health predictive analytics, and thus produce appreciable value to the participant citizens that are exposed to pollution in large cities.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PulsAir application and data ecosystem can be seen a “toolkit” that collects and process information that is rarely integrated—health data from citizens in the same area where environmental pollution is measured or identified. This approach offers to citizens a set of specifically designed applications and data ecosystems, as well as the chance to contribute to environmental science and evidence for environmental policy in a remote manner, changing the way that environmental research, monitoring, and policymaking are carried out.</p>
