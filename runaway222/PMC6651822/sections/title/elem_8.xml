 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3. Results</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main results comprise the development of the interactive PulsAir application and the data ecosystem. The PulsAir was designed and developed integrating game-design elements, and feedback received from end users regarding requirements and needs for interface designs, functionalities, and workflow. The data production and consumption flow links the application with the backend processing, enabling a data ecosystem supported by four contextual data layers: the Mobile Context, the User Context, the Environmental Context, and the overall Big Data Context. In the following sections, a detailed description of these elements is presented.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. User Needs and Requirements Driving the Citizen Science-Based Application</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Users’ needs and requirements were collected during the first phase. Needs and requirements were collected through qualitative research techniques (e.g., focus groups), which took place in the different cities where the project is being piloted. The results from conducted research comprise the following key requirements:
   <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Mobile information and generation of higher density of data: there is a need to use heterogeneous mobile technologies (different brands and operating systems), commercial health trackers (e.g., Fitbit, Garmin), and the integration of new fixed IoT-based sensors in cities, thus engaging citizens for integrating citizen science. This is driven by the need for increasing the continuous gathering of quantitative and dynamic health and environmental perceptual data, in order to generate a higher density of health data and air quality measurements to provide a more accurate spatial and temporal data for health and environmental risk prediction and estimation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Privacy: the need of privacy requirements that ensure the system compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to grant full control of the shared information to the users and a secure process of data gathering that can confer anonymization of the information.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Air quality status and information: citizens reported the need to receive information and increase the awareness of pollution levels and exposure in the area where they live and perform activities. Also, it was reported as crucial to understand the pollutants and the status of the air pollution in the city. The city can leverage on the community’s air quality stations and on other networks of environmental devices available in the market that can be installed at home in balconies, gardens, rooftops, and so on. Furthermore, users would like to be able to see contributions to improve environmental actions in the city, and reported the need of having prospective routes, with alternative low polluted paths, to reach a destination in the mapping.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Health-related assessment and recommendations: users reported the need to receive tailored feedback and information that will show areas and parameters that indicate health risk for their health situation. Also, recommendations, guidelines, and information that will impact on their health-oriented behavioural habits; showing somehow the contribution of the actions regarding health and community improvements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>An appealing, easy to use, and robust application: users reported the need for an easy to use interface that will provide an enjoyable application. This meant to have a user-friendly and intuitive setting that could easily manage processes, data sharing, and participation with robust real-time processing and feedback.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. Non-Functional Prototype and Gamification Approach</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A team of user interaction experts, bioengineers, and graphical designers worked together to define a first approach of the user interaction solution. To do so, a first non-functional prototype (mock-up) was sketched based on the requirements gathered and iteratively validated with public health organizations through the pilot sites. The result of this phase was the characterization and design of the gamified application idea that visualizes interactive data and supports data consumption, based on citizens’ needs. The first activity was to consolidate a home page that will be able to show requirements, which were split as a twofold macro-functionality; one comprising requirements related to the users’ profile (“Me”) and the other with requirements related to the city in which the users are living (“My City”). For this purpose, the development team came up with two versions of the user interface (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02940-f002" href="#sensors-19-02940-f002">Figure 2</a>). 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When requirements and feedback from the first iteration were integrated, a first version of the home page was consolidated, defining the specific functionalities for the citizens and city pages. </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02940-f002" href="#sensors-19-02940-f002">Figure 2</a>a shows the first design of the home screen that was modified later, as shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02940-f002" href="#sensors-19-02940-f002">Figure 2</a>b, according to integrated feedback and detection of new users’ needs. This process aimed at finding a robust and appealing home screen that reflects the concept and rationale of the application. Changes included a new avatar and look and feel backgrounds, which were co-designed with users to provide a more city-oriented context. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02940-f002" href="#sensors-19-02940-f002">Figure 2</a>c,d show the initial designs of the air quality information sections of “My city” and the Leaderboard of the application.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the design of the application integrates game-design elements in order to generate empowerment and motivation to users. To boost engagement and motivation, a live view of personal targets, benchmarks and/or achievements, and green and healthier behavioural values are provided in the home screen. This approach also enables clear goals and inspires more focused and efficient engaged citizens (e.g., higher scoring in using non polluted routes, higher scoring sharing air quality data) with a real impact on targeted activities. The following gamification mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics were selected and integrated in the application for this purpose:
   <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Avatar: the visual representation of the user’s status in terms of health and green habits; it is the main character of the application. With this element, it is expected that users have a much higher chance of developing personal ownership.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Points: used as status indicators and to reward users for their different behaviours or objectives achieved in the application, such as use of wearable activity tracker devices or filling in questionnaires and getting extra points depending on the answer, oriented to promote or to follow healthy and green habits checked with the data collected. Points are used to enable a reward mechanism that drives motivational and engagement behaviours through citizen science.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Levels: Five levels were defined within the gamification strategy. The Level-up is achieved through the accumulation of points from the activities completed by the user. The levels represent the air quality conditions of the city in which the Avatar lives. User’s interactions with the application and accumulated points improve the conditions of the city. Level 1 is a highly polluted city, and Level 5 represents a clean and sustainable city.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Rewards: tangible recompense (either physically or virtually) for the achievement of an objective through an action or series of actions proposed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Leaderboard: an ordered list with the user’s score (achieved points). Two categories are implemented, per city and worldwide.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The overall system proposed comprises two main components: the PulsAir mobile application and the platform or processing data ecosystem. Design iterations are transversal to the system components development, allowing an incremental buildout progress. In the following sections, the system components, which naturally emerged during the iterative and co-creation design processes, are described in detail.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mobile application was developed enabling perception and sensing to be monitored and evolve over time. It collects and integrates environmental data and health information including patterns, demographics, and health and weather statistics, in order to provide citizens and authorities with a decision-making tool. The application was conceived as an engine to support valuable data interaction, data consumption, data capturing, and data sharing. The use of wearables linked to the application enables participatory sensing by using these devices as tools to collect and share health and air quality data obtained from personal sensing units. The application also gathers and provides personalised information by scheduling different type of questionnaires related to health and air quality, educational contents, and feedback to the users; the contents are personalized according to the usage of the app, the answered questions, and the profile of the user. 
    <a rid="sensors-19-02940-t001" ref-type="table" href="#sensors-19-02940-t001">Table 1</a> presents a list of the selected questionnaires.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mobile application is composed of two main modules:
    <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
     <div class="list-item">
      <p>“Me” module contains information about the citizen. It gathers all the specific information regarding the user, from questionnaires and from the wearable devices (e.g., Fitbit band). It also provides specific educational content to promote healthy lifestyles and feedback about the health risks using state of the art models for cardiovascular risk (Framingham, [
       <a rid="B30-sensors-19-02940" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-sensors-19-02940">30</a>]), TD2M (FindRisk, [
       <a rid="B34-sensors-19-02940" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-sensors-19-02940">34</a>]), and asthma (Verlato, [
       <a rid="B35-sensors-19-02940" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-sensors-19-02940">35</a>]). The “Me” module shows the daily physical activity (steps) of the user and historical data of total activity from the previous days. The wearable device information is integrated in the app. The user can also access the “Health tips” to learn how to improve lifestyle based on the results of the answered questionnaires.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="list-item">
      <p>“My city” module contains all the data related to the city and neighbourhood of the user. Through this module, the user has access to a page that summarizes the status of the city (i.e., pollution levels), specific contents about the city, the pollutants, and possible more sustainable mobility and household habits that can contribute to the reduction of polluted emissions. The module provides a detailed map to show pollution levels in different areas of the city. In addition, it allows the user to tag or input data through questionnaires to inform about the status of the neighbourhood. The information is personalized for each user, aiming at empowering the citizens with personal tools that estimate and manage their pollution exposure, and thus take healthier actions (i.e., less polluted routes when walking).</p>

    <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mobile Application Workflow</div>
    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The application workflow was conceived as a bidirectional interactive path. On one hand, the user shares gathered data with the platform, from physical activity measurements through wearable activity trackers and by answering the questionnaires. On the other hand, users receive back general or customized interventions depending on their profile. This intervention is composed of educational health and environmental guidelines or content, health risk awareness, geo-localized air pollution exposure and data, as well as gamification-oriented information and rewards based on their performance. This intervention aims at making data relevant to citizens to support greener and healthier sustainable behaviours. The process was defined using an incremental strategy, which comprises the following steps:
     <div list-type="order" class="list">
      <div class="list-item">
       <p>Monitor: the application tracks GPS position and integrates data of wellness sensor (e.g., Fitbit) and air quality. From time to time, some questionnaire are triggered to the users. The application also tracks the degree of use of the application.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="list-item">
       <p>Personalize: according to the assessment, the application triggers specific contents and recommendations to the users.

      </div>
      <div class="list-item">
       <p>Act: the application promotes specific healthy habits by proposing a specific goal to the users (e.g., 8000 daily steps). According to this goal, the application creates a follow-up procedure to check if the goal is achieved in the proposed time (e.g., one day).</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This represents the core business logic that gathers all the contextual information of the user and uses it to assess the individual health risk and pollution exposure. This layer supports data fusion, which provides personalized interventions that are implemented considering a context for risk and resilience, which results from the local policies and directives‘ assessment on urban health and resilience [
     <a rid="B38-sensors-19-02940" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-sensors-19-02940">38</a>]. The intervention is then personalized according to the available local resources in terms of educational materials, events to join, recommended places, or challenging activities to adopt specific household or healthy behaviours.
    </p>
    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, this layer enables data fusion, which supports the integration of data and knowledge from several sources. Three data fusion schemes are used: (i) data association, (ii) state estimation, and (iii) decision fusion. These schemes support the combination of data from multisensory environments and data modelling, and allow parameter estimation from the multiple sources by providing resources that enable multi-level process dealing with the association, correlation, and combination of data and information from single and multiple sources to complete and provide timely assessments of situations and their significance.</p>
    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The big data context, presented in 
     <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02940-f005" href="#sensors-19-02940-f005">Figure 5</a>, comprises three main components: storage infrastructure, modelling and predictive resources, and visualization (presentation) resources. The storage infrastructure component stores all readings in a central repository, named an “urban data lake”. Data are harvested and semantically treated to allow interoperability. 
    </p>
    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model and intervention resources allow data modelling and abstraction over the collected data enabling data consumption; aiming at linking health, citizens’, and environmental data to detect and predict risk factors. Spatio-temporal and risk stratification models, as well as statistical analysis (such as regression and correlation analysis), are used to personalize environmental and health risk estimations, support interpolation of data, estimate pollution concentrations on urban spaces, or enable individual assessments in these domains [
     <a rid="B39-sensors-19-02940" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-sensors-19-02940">39</a>]. In this context, the models comprise the data production and fusion stage, in order to support personalized interventions and information for the app, such as air pollution level and exposure to be presented in the maps (e.g., users’ data consumption) [
     <a rid="B40-sensors-19-02940" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-sensors-19-02940">40</a>]. The presentation resources push produces data to the mobile application, enabling data and information presentation, and interaction trough the mobile application modules and maps. This allows the user to input data, sense-based air quality inputs, and present data to application modules (e.g., pollution value points for the pollution exposure map).
