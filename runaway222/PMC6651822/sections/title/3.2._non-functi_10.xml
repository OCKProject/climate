 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A team of user interaction experts, bioengineers, and graphical designers worked together to define a first approach of the user interaction solution. To do so, a first non-functional prototype (mock-up) was sketched based on the requirements gathered and iteratively validated with public health organizations through the pilot sites. The result of this phase was the characterization and design of the gamified application idea that visualizes interactive data and supports data consumption, based on citizens’ needs. The first activity was to consolidate a home page that will be able to show requirements, which were split as a twofold macro-functionality; one comprising requirements related to the users’ profile (“Me”) and the other with requirements related to the city in which the users are living (“My City”). For this purpose, the development team came up with two versions of the user interface (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When requirements and feedback from the first iteration were integrated, a first version of the home page was consolidated, defining the specific functionalities for the citizens and city pages. </p>

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02940-f002" href="#sensors-19-02940-f002">Figure 2</a>a shows the first design of the home screen that was modified later, as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02940-f002" href="#sensors-19-02940-f002">Figure 2</a>b, according to integrated feedback and detection of new users’ needs. This process aimed at finding a robust and appealing home screen that reflects the concept and rationale of the application. Changes included a new avatar and look and feel backgrounds, which were co-designed with users to provide a more city-oriented context.

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the design of the application integrates game-design elements in order to generate empowerment and motivation to users. To boost engagement and motivation, a live view of personal targets, benchmarks and/or achievements, and green and healthier behavioural values are provided in the home screen. This approach also enables clear goals and inspires more focused and efficient engaged citizens (e.g., higher scoring in using non polluted routes, higher scoring sharing air quality data) with a real impact on targeted activities. The following gamification mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics were selected and integrated in the application for this purpose:
  <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Avatar: the visual representation of the user’s status in terms of health and green habits; it is the main character of the application. With this element, it is expected that users have a much higher chance of developing personal ownership.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Points: used as status indicators and to reward users for their different behaviours or objectives achieved in the application, such as use of wearable activity tracker devices or filling in questionnaires and getting extra points depending on the answer, oriented to promote or to follow healthy and green habits checked with the data collected. Points are used to enable a reward mechanism that drives motivational and engagement behaviours through citizen science.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Levels: Five levels were defined within the gamification strategy. The Level-up is achieved through the accumulation of points from the activities completed by the user. The levels represent the air quality conditions of the city in which the Avatar lives. User’s interactions with the application and accumulated points improve the conditions of the city. Level 1 is a highly polluted city, and Level 5 represents a clean and sustainable city.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Rewards: tangible recompense (either physically or virtually) for the achievement of an objective through an action or series of actions proposed.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Leaderboard: an ordered list with the user’s score (achieved points). Two categories are implemented, per city and worldwide.</p>
   </div>
