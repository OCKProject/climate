 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3.1. PulsAir Mobile Application</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mobile application was developed enabling perception and sensing to be monitored and evolve over time. It collects and integrates environmental data and health information including patterns, demographics, and health and weather statistics, in order to provide citizens and authorities with a decision-making tool. The application was conceived as an engine to support valuable data interaction, data consumption, data capturing, and data sharing. The use of wearables linked to the application enables participatory sensing by using these devices as tools to collect and share health and air quality data obtained from personal sensing units. The application also gathers and provides personalised information by scheduling different type of questionnaires related to health and air quality, educational contents, and feedback to the users; the contents are personalized according to the usage of the app, the answered questions, and the profile of the user. 
  <a rid="sensors-19-02940-t001" ref-type="table" href="#sensors-19-02940-t001">Table 1</a> presents a list of the selected questionnaires.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mobile application is composed of two main modules:
  <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>“Me” module contains information about the citizen. It gathers all the specific information regarding the user, from questionnaires and from the wearable devices (e.g., Fitbit band). It also provides specific educational content to promote healthy lifestyles and feedback about the health risks using state of the art models for cardiovascular risk (Framingham, [
     <a rid="B30-sensors-19-02940" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-sensors-19-02940">30</a>]), TD2M (FindRisk, [
     <a rid="B34-sensors-19-02940" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-sensors-19-02940">34</a>]), and asthma (Verlato, [
     <a rid="B35-sensors-19-02940" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-sensors-19-02940">35</a>]). The “Me” module shows the daily physical activity (steps) of the user and historical data of total activity from the previous days. The wearable device information is integrated in the app. The user can also access the “Health tips” to learn how to improve lifestyle based on the results of the answered questionnaires.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>“My city” module contains all the data related to the city and neighbourhood of the user. Through this module, the user has access to a page that summarizes the status of the city (i.e., pollution levels), specific contents about the city, the pollutants, and possible more sustainable mobility and household habits that can contribute to the reduction of polluted emissions. The module provides a detailed map to show pollution levels in different areas of the city. In addition, it allows the user to tag or input data through questionnaires to inform about the status of the neighbourhood. The information is personalized for each user, aiming at empowering the citizens with personal tools that estimate and manage their pollution exposure, and thus take healthier actions (i.e., less polluted routes when walking).</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mobile Application Workflow</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The application workflow was conceived as a bidirectional interactive path. On one hand, the user shares gathered data with the platform, from physical activity measurements through wearable activity trackers and by answering the questionnaires. On the other hand, users receive back general or customized interventions depending on their profile. This intervention is composed of educational health and environmental guidelines or content, health risk awareness, geo-localized air pollution exposure and data, as well as gamification-oriented information and rewards based on their performance. This intervention aims at making data relevant to citizens to support greener and healthier sustainable behaviours. The process was defined using an incremental strategy, which comprises the following steps:
   <div list-type="order" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Monitor: the application tracks GPS position and integrates data of wellness sensor (e.g., Fitbit) and air quality. From time to time, some questionnaire are triggered to the users. The application also tracks the degree of use of the application.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Assess: the gathered information is used to assess the citizens in terms of health risks (risk of the onset of T2D, asthma, and cardiovascular disease).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Personalize: according to the assessment, the application triggers specific contents and recommendations to the users. The application can identify healthy or green behaviour that needs to be improved and prepare a set of tips to help the user to be aware and understand the importance of modifying a specific behaviour.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Act: the application promotes specific healthy habits by proposing a specific goal to the users (e.g., 8000 daily steps). According to this goal, the application creates a follow-up procedure to check if the goal is achieved in the proposed time (e.g., one day).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Support and reward: when the user finish the proposed activity, the application triggers a mechanism of reward and supports the user to be motivated.</p>
    </div>
   </div>
