 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pilots plan comprises the following phases:
  <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Stage 1, training: municipal leaders, community leaders, NGOs, and local businesses received training, covering the objectives of the study and the PulsAir application functioning, in order to execute the recruitment of users.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Stage 2, deployment: included the recruitment of users, the distribution of the wearable trackers, installation of PulsAir app in the smartphones, sign up with individual user access codes, and synchronization of the wearable trackers with PulsAir app.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Stage 3, follow-up: during this phase, interactions with the pilot organisations are being maintained in order to perform refinements on the application according to usersâ€™ feedbacks and cultural requirements of each pilot city (e.g., language, educative systems, ethnic groups, religions, and metric systems among others).</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Stage 4, evaluation: includes the technical validation (e.g., performance evaluation, safety, and reliability assessment) and the assessment of data quality, user experience and usability, as well as social acceptance and effectiveness of the PulsAir application. The evaluation criteria includes the following measures: (a) social acceptance and effectiveness determined taking into account the working conditions (e.g., citizen science environment), attitude towards the outcome, reciprocity, and performance of the tools; (b) usability, which measures the effectiveness efficiency, learnability, robustness, and utility of the application and ecosystem; and (c) user experience taking into account embodiment, emotion, feeling of trust, and satisfaction. This phase is currently being implemented in the different cities involved in PULSE project deployment.</p>
