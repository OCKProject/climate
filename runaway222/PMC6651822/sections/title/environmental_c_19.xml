 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This provides relevant information on the environment in the city area where the user is located. Data are captured from public information measurement nodes or infrastructure; mainly produced by the city sensors’ network (i.e., fixed or mobile sensors) or satellites (e.g., satellite optical or hyperspectral images). Additionally, these data are coupled with public services data (e.g., public health data) and resources, such as transportation, police, or other related public services aiming at supporting mobility.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, this layer supports the data sampling and collection process. The data obtained comes from public access sources, which allows the most relevant information to be integrated in a single system for the user, and thus uploaded to the cloud infrastructure. The most relevant data gathered within the environmental and public services context comprise the following:
  <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Air Quality (AQ): Air quality data of the area where the user is located, coming from fixed and mobile sensors or measurement stations deployed throughout the city or satellites, among others.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Weather: updated information of the weather in the user’s location.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Mobility: public transport stops, pedestrian routes, bike lanes, public rental bicycles, and other types of green transportation.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Public Services: information of police and firemen stations, public health organizations, hospitals, and schools, among others.</p>
