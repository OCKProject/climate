    <p>Smartphones: these are the devices (i.e., iPhone and Samsung) used to validate the correct development of the application in both operating systems, iOS and Android. The minimum requirements of these devices are GPS, Bluetooth, and 4G connectivity in order to perform all the application functionalities. These devices are also the tool for citizen science data capture.</p>
