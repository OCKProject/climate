 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This represents the core business logic that gathers all the contextual information of the user and uses it to assess the individual health risk and pollution exposure. This layer supports data fusion, which provides personalized interventions that are implemented considering a context for risk and resilience, which results from the local policies and directives‘ assessment on urban health and resilience [
  <a rid="B38-sensors-19-02940" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-sensors-19-02940">38</a>]. The intervention is then personalized according to the available local resources in terms of educational materials, events to join, recommended places, or challenging activities to adopt specific household or healthy behaviours.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, this layer enables data fusion, which supports the integration of data and knowledge from several sources. Three data fusion schemes are used: (i) data association, (ii) state estimation, and (iii) decision fusion. These schemes support the combination of data from multisensory environments and data modelling, and allow parameter estimation from the multiple sources by providing resources that enable multi-level process dealing with the association, correlation, and combination of data and information from single and multiple sources to complete and provide timely assessments of situations and their significance.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The big data context, presented in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02940-f005" href="#sensors-19-02940-f005">Figure 5</a>, comprises three main components: storage infrastructure, modelling and predictive resources, and visualization (presentation) resources. The storage infrastructure component stores all readings in a central repository, named an “urban data lake”. Data are harvested and semantically treated to allow interoperability. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model and intervention resources allow data modelling and abstraction over the collected data enabling data consumption; aiming at linking health, citizens’, and environmental data to detect and predict risk factors. Spatio-temporal and risk stratification models, as well as statistical analysis (such as regression and correlation analysis), are used to personalize environmental and health risk estimations, support interpolation of data, estimate pollution concentrations on urban spaces, or enable individual assessments in these domains [
  <a rid="B39-sensors-19-02940" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-sensors-19-02940">39</a>]. In this context, the models comprise the data production and fusion stage, in order to support personalized interventions and information for the app, such as air pollution level and exposure to be presented in the maps (e.g., users’ data consumption) [
  <a rid="B40-sensors-19-02940" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-sensors-19-02940">40</a>]. The presentation resources push produces data to the mobile application, enabling data and information presentation, and interaction trough the mobile application modules and maps. This allows the user to input data, sense-based air quality inputs, and present data to application modules (e.g., pollution value points for the pollution exposure map).
