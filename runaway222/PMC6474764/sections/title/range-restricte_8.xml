 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Saving species and populations is a key feature of a GDN, targeting first the rarest, most range-limited species under the most threat for immediate conservation (
  <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">
   <span class="italic">44</span>
  </a>). To ensure that under the 30% by 2030 milestone these additions by ecoregion include irreplaceable sites (e.g., those with narrow endemic taxa found nowhere else), we intersected several widely used fine-scale maps of biodiversity distributions with the ecoregion map and the current database on terrestrial protected areas (
  <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">
   <span class="italic">45</span>
  </a>). For each of these overlays, we calculated the area for that theme found in each ecoregion that is currently unprotected but not accounted for by other overlays (to avoid double counting, as the spatial extent of these various mapping efforts depicting species rarity often overlaps considerably). We summed these extensions to present the percent and amount (in km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) added to the global total toward the 30% by 2030 milestone (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>). These data layers that are included inform milestones and targets (
  <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>):
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1) The Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) sites that are currently unprotected (
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
   <span class="italic">46</span>
  </a>). AZE sites pinpoint extreme rarity by seeking to protect those birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, cycads, and conifers whose entire global distribution is limited to a single site and ranked as Critically Endangered or Endangered. The total is 928, of which 34% are unprotected (
  <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>). All unprotected AZE sites, plus a 1-km buffer surrounding them, are included in the 2030 milestone. These 320 unprotected sites, plus buffer, add 0.46% to the expansion of the global terrestrial protected areas, or 619,490 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a> and fig. S1A). In the marine realm, unprotected AZE sites represent 9955 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> and would contribute less than 0.1% to the expansion of the global MPAs (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2) A map of range rarity derived from the IUCN Red List data for the world’s birds, mammals, and amphibians, showing where sites supporting high densities of narrow-range species remain unprotected. The unprotected hotspots of range rarity add 0.12% to the expansion of the global terrestrial protected areas total percent or 162,491 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, not including AZE sites (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a> and fig. S1B). In the ocean, conservation priority hotspots (top 5%) for range-restricted species (
  <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
   <span class="italic">47</span>
  </a>) represent 14.7 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> and can account for 4.75% of the expansion of the global MPAs (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a> and fig. S1C).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3) A map of the density of threatened species from the IUCN Red List, showing where concentrations of species threatened with extinction remain unprotected. This layer includes nearly 64,000 species evaluated to date by the IUCN Red List, with almost 20,000 deemed as threatened with extinction. The unprotected polygons could add 0.03% to the expansion of the global terrestrial protected areas total percent or 34,631 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> excluding overlapping data from the first two layers (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a> and fig. S1D). Conservation priority hotspots (top 5%) for threatened marine species (
  <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
   <span class="italic">47</span>
  </a>) represent 8.5 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> and account for 2.8% of the expansion of the global MPAs (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a> and fig. S1E).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4) KBAs map globally important sites that meet a number of biodiversity criteria, including the presence of threatened or significant species (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>). Though incomplete for some regions of the world (e.g. New Guinea), KBAs are identified by national constituencies using globally standardized criteria and quantitative thresholds and thus are useful to guide the expansion of protected area networks. Currently, approximately 15,000 such sites have been designated, with about 60% within IUCN category I to IV reserves (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>). Adding in the unprotected portion of KBAs and a 1-km buffer expands the global terrestrial protected areas total by 1.3% percent or 1,759,341 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a> and fig. S1D). Unprotected KBAs in the oceans represent 5.8 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> and can contribute 1.6% to the expansion of the global MPAs (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a> and fig. S1G).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summing the total area of all of these unprotected sites (plus 1-km buffers) from the first four layers, and removing double counting, adds 1.9% to the existing 14.9% of the terrestrial realm and 9.2% to the existing 7.3% of the marine realm already designated for protection (
  <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">
   <span class="italic">45</span>
  </a>). The unexpectedly small area contribution of these irreplaceable terrestrial sites is due to the high spatial overlap present among layers 1 to 4.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5) The remaining contribution to the milestone of 30% by 2030 is drawn from High Biodiversity Importance Ecoregions (HBIEs) that depict 455 of the most biologically distinct ecoregions by biome (fig. S1H). It is a slightly revised and updated map of the most biodiverse ecoregions on Earth (
  <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">
   <span class="italic">48</span>
  </a>). This is subdivided into three themes encompassing small fragments or larger landscapes that remain unprotected and not covered in the above four layers:
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">i) The 36 Biodiversity Hotspots are included in the HBIE layer and contain a combined total of 114 category 3 and category 4 ecoregions, the most threatened categories. Adding the remaining unprotected habitat fragments found in these ecoregions contributes 0.51% or 439,569 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> to the expansion of the global terrestrial protected areas total (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a> and fig. S1I).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ii) Biodiversity Hotspots (fig. S1F) represent educated guesses (or sometimes comprehensive lists) by botanists of regions where plant endemism is concentrated globally. These lists are often based on counts of endemics at particular sites—a depiction known as alpha-diversity. Equally important as a conservation metric, but rarely measured, is beta-diversity—the replacement or turnover of the rosters of plant communities with distance or along elevational gradients (fig. S1J). High beta-diversity ecoregions are most common in five biomes: Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests; Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests; Mediterranean Climate Shrublands; Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas, and Woodlands; and the tropical and subtropical ecoregions found in Desert and Xeric Shrublands. Many of the ecoregions in these five biomes overlap with the biodiversity hotspots; adding in unprotected habitat in some missing ecoregions adds 6.9% to the global total or 9,188,027 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">iii) The strongholds of large wide-ranging species that require vast areas to maintain viable populations are another important metric of biodiversity value. HBIEs capture where these large mammals occur by overlaying a map of intact vertebrate assemblages (fig. S1K) (
  <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">
   <span class="italic">49</span>
  </a>). Adding in unprotected intact large mammal habitat in some missing ecoregions adds 8.5% to the global total or 11,304,493 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a> and fig. S1H).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conserving the unprotected terrestrial areas selected above would add 17.7% to the existing 14.9% currently protected and exceed the 30% milestone while creating a more representative global system of protected areas that incorporate the major aspects of terrestrial biodiversity (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>). Our approach uses what we consider to be the most important biodiversity features, but we recognize that there are multiple pathways to achieve a 30% protected milestone.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Complete protection requires closer to 50% of the Earth’s land surface achieved by combining the above analysis with 20% designated as CSAs (see below section and 
  <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>).
