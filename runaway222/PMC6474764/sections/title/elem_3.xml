 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our objective is to present scientific guidance for three major themes that should be included in a GDN and a short list of key milestones and targets that could underpin these themes, which would be complementary and, in many cases, reinforcing of the Paris Climate Agreement. These themes are (1) protecting biodiversity, (2) mitigating climate change, and (3) reducing threats to ecosystem intactness and persistence of species. We also propose that the GDN embrace monitoring progress from the ground, or below the sea surface, to space, using powerful new technologies, much of it publicly available.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Theme 1: Protecting biodiversity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We support calls to conserve at least 30% of the Earth’s surface by 2030 (
   <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
    <span class="italic">40</span>
   </a>). This is viewed as a milestone toward the larger end goal of half of the planet protected by 2050, if not sooner, made elsewhere (
   <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
    <span class="italic">16</span>
   </a>). The 30% by 2030 milestone has also been proposed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and its member organizations as a critical step for marine conservation (IUCN Resolution: WCC-2016-Res-050-EN).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These global milestones and targets are useful: They are easy to comprehend and help simplify policy and communications strategies. But because biodiversity is unevenly distributed, conservation biologists and planners must be careful to avoid two major risks inherent in a single global percentage: (i) adding more land to reach the global target that is similar to what is already well accounted for at the expense of underrepresented habitats and species, and (ii) the temptation by some governments to protect low-conflict areas that may be lower priority from a biodiversity perspective (
   <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
    <span class="italic">41</span>
   </a>). Adhering to the first goal of biodiversity conservation—representation—greatly reduces these risks. This is the rationale for setting milestones and targets at both levels—global and ecoregional—and shows how the latter helps to operationalize the former to better conserve life on Earth (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate how biodiversity might be protected under theme 1, we conducted two related assessments: (i) how using the 846 ecoregions as a “conservation template” can achieve increased representation of critical habitats and species in networks of well-connected protected areas, and (ii) how that 30% fraction could be distributed to better protect areas of concentrated terrestrial biodiversity—from narrow-range endemic species in fragmented landscapes to endangered large vertebrate populations ranging across intact primary forests and grasslands. The remaining 20% of intact and semi-intact land is also essential for climate targets to avoid negative impacts on humanity and species populations (
   <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
    <span class="italic">15</span>
   </a>). In addition to expansion of protected areas, we propose climate stabilization areas (CSAs) that would meet the criteria for Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs), recently defined by the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (
   <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
    <span class="italic">42</span>
   </a>). Working in cohort with the Paris Agreement, CSAs would concentrate in habitats like mangroves, tundra, other peatlands, ancient grasslands, and boreal and tropical rainforest biomes that store vast reserves of carbon and other greenhouse gases, and prevent large-scale land cover change. These complementary approaches are detailed below.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess how reserve expansion to meet the 30% by 2030 milestone could improve representation, we sorted the world’s 846 terrestrial ecoregions into four categories (

    <span class="italic">43</span>
   </a>), showing a total of 14.9% of the terrestrial realm with the amount of remaining habitat—totaling 49.9% of natural habitat across the 14 terrestrial biomes—and partitioned by ecoregion. This total sums all intact and semi-intact habitats but excludes permanent ice in Greenland and the highly degraded Sahara ecoregions (table S1). The categories are as follows:
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1) Milestone Achieved: ≥30% protected (26% of 846 ecoregions; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 219);
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2) High Potential: less than 30% currently protected, but enough habitat remains outside protected areas to reach 30% by 2030 (41% of 846 ecoregions; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 347);
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3) Moderate Potential: the sum of area protected and habitat remaining outside protected areas is between 20 and 30%. These ecoregions could meet the 2030 target with some restoration (10% of 846 ecoregions; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 88); and
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4) Nature Imperiled: &lt;20% total habitat remaining (protected + unprotected), often much less (23% of 846 ecoregions; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 192).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Achieving ecoregion milestones of 30% protected by 2030 would greatly improve representation in the global targets (
   <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Tables 1</a> and 
   <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">2</a>). Of the 347 High Potential (category 2) ecoregions, a median of 47% habitat remains outside protected areas. This provides the possibility for changes in land designation to increase the total number of ecoregions achieving 30% protection from 219 (26% of total ecoregions) to 566 ecoregions (67% of the total). A further 88 ecoregions in category 3 (10% of total) can achieve the 30% by 2030 milestone with some restoration. The 566 ecoregions (categories 1 and 2) that have reached or could reach 30% protected by 2030 are distributed among all of the 14 terrestrial biomes. The most complete representation would fall within the Tundra, Boreal, and Tropical and Subtropical Coniferous biomes (
   <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). The least representation would be in the Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests and the Temperate Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands biomes (
   <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>), the latter of which is the center of global food production.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One hundred and thirteen ecoregions (13%) have already exceeded 50% protection. Yet, these rarely include the largest ecoregions containing the vast carbon reservoirs. Thus, a critical caveat in the representation approach is that some ecoregions may need much more area under protection to sustain species and processes and avoid biospheric feedback from release of greenhouse gases after conversion (see below discussion on CSAs for Amazon, Congo Basin, Southeast Asia, boreal, and tundra). At the other end of the spectrum, species extinctions will likely be most swift and severe in the 192 Nature Imperiled ecoregions, category 4 (
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a> and table S1). Thus, efforts to bring the Nature Imperiled ecoregions to a protection level of 10% emerges as a clear 2030 restoration and recovery milestone. These ecoregions constitute known centers of endemism but have only a median of 4% protected habitat and 1% remaining outside protected areas. An approach to create a “species safety net”—to ensure the representation of vanishing biota ranging from single-site endemics to intact large mammal assemblages requiring large landscapes—is presented below (and more in greater detail in

To ensure that under the 30% by 2030 milestone these additions by ecoregion include irreplaceable sites (e.g., those with narrow endemic taxa found nowhere else), we intersected several widely used fine-scale maps of biodiversity distributions with the ecoregion map and the current database on terrestrial protected areas (

    <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">
     <span class="italic">48</span>

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">i) The 36 Biodiversity Hotspots are included in the HBIE layer and contain a combined total of 114 category 3 and category 4 ecoregions, the most threatened categories. Adding the remaining unprotected habitat fragments found in these ecoregions contributes 0.51% or 439,569 km
    <span class="sup">2</span> to the expansion of the global terrestrial protected areas total (
    <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a> and fig. S1I).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ii) Biodiversity Hotspots (fig. S1F) represent educated guesses (or sometimes comprehensive lists) by botanists of regions where plant endemism is concentrated globally. These lists are often based on counts of endemics at particular sites—a depiction known as alpha-diversity. Equally important as a conservation metric, but rarely measured, is beta-diversity—the replacement or turnover of the rosters of plant communities with distance or along elevational gradients (fig. S1J). High beta-diversity ecoregions are most common in five biomes: Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests; Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests; Mediterranean Climate Shrublands; Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas, and Woodlands; and the tropical and subtropical ecoregions found in Desert and Xeric Shrublands. Many of the ecoregions in these five biomes overlap with the biodiversity hotspots; adding in unprotected habitat in some missing ecoregions adds 6.9% to the global total or 9,188,027 km

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">iii) The strongholds of large wide-ranging species that require vast areas to maintain viable populations are another important metric of biodiversity value.

    <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">
     <span class="italic">49</span>

Today, these primary habitats, as represented by unlogged forests, ungrazed deserts, ancient grasslands, and savannas—and in the marine realm, the untrawled seafloor and unfished seamounts—are now remnants. These ancient repositories of rich and vulnerable biodiversity are optimal arenas for life-sustaining processes (

    <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
     <span class="italic">22</span>

    <a rid="R59" ref-type="bibr" href="#R59">
     <span class="italic">59</span>
    </a>), these estimates highlight enormous gaps in marine conservation.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to biodiversity, marine ecosystems are also important carbon sinks. Coastal ecosystem such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds sequester astonishing amounts of carbon per hectare and thus play a disproportionately large role in the global capture and storage of carbon (
    <a rid="R60" ref-type="bibr" href="#R60">
     <span class="italic">60</span>
    </a>, 
    <a rid="R61" ref-type="bibr" href="#R61">
     <span class="italic">61</span>
    </a>). Although the spatial extent of the world’s 20 mangrove ecoregion complexes is minute compared to other biomes (300,294 km
    <span class="sup">2</span> or 0.23%), conservation and restoration of mangroves are vital to climate and marine conservation scenarios, and buffer storm surges and hurricanes.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ocean also harbors old-growth ecosystems equivalent to primary forests, such as unfished seamounts with deep corals thousands of years old (
    <a rid="R62" ref-type="bibr" href="#R62">
     <span class="italic">62</span>
    </a>). In the coastal zone, some seagrass species such as the Mediterranean 
    <span class="italic">Posidonia oceanica</span> have complex belowground organs that help accrete sediment and bury carbon over millennia (
    <a rid="R63" ref-type="bibr" href="#R63">
     <span class="italic">63</span>
    </a>). Preserving the vegetative cover of these coastal habitats is important, but preserving their megafauna is essential, as studies suggest that intact predator populations are critical to maintaining or growing reserves of carbon stored in marine ecosystems (
    <a rid="R64" ref-type="bibr" href="#R64">
     <span class="italic">64</span>
    </a>). For example, tiger sharks in seagrass beds in Australia create a “landscape of fear,” where sea turtles and dugongs preferentially forage in seagrass microhabitats that are low in predation risk. The majority of the habitat, with high predation risk, has greater carbon stocks.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ongoing efforts are identifying priority areas that will help protect biodiversity at multiple levels (from species to ecosystems), help produce food through fish spillover from fully protected reserves, and help mitigate climate change through the protection and restoration of important carbon sinks. Here, we present general targets and categories that should be prioritized as part of the GDN (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Protecting 30% of the Earth as high-priority conservation areas will be essential but insufficient for holding emissions below 1.5°C (
    <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
     <span class="italic">2</span>
    </a>). Carbon storehouses, our terrestrial carbon sink, currently absorb one-quarter of emissions, and the conservation of natural habitats as stabilization areas under the GDN reinforces this role. Natural habitats outside protected areas can also be managed to maintain intactness and enhance conservation of area-sensitive species. These lands can be considered under the term OECMs (
    <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
     <span class="italic">43</span>
    </a>). CSAs can fit under the OECM umbrella and contribute to area-based conservation targets. Simply put, CSAs are areas where conservation of vegetative cover occurs and greenhouse gas emissions are prevented, which can be achieved under various forms of land management. A key target of the GDN would enhance efforts to maintain at least 85% forest cover in critical areas such as the Amazon. Some parts of the planet work as a system and need to be managed for a high proportion of intactness to continue to function as a weather machine for the planet (
    <a rid="R65" ref-type="bibr" href="#R65">

    </a>, 
    <a rid="R66" ref-type="bibr" href="#R66">
     <span class="italic">66</span>
    </a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These essential carbon storehouses could be retained and protected under CSAs. The tundra and boreal biomes, which together comprise 24,162,700 km
    <span class="sup">2</span> (approximately 18%) of Earth’s terrestrial landmass, are exceptional because of their carbon storage [fig. S2A and (
    <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
     <span class="italic">13</span>
    </a>)]. Examples of forests with high carbon density include the temperate rain forests of the Pacific Northwest United States and Canada, the temperate moist eucalypt forests in southeast Australia, Congo Basin peat swamp forests, and intact forest reserves in Malaysian Borneo [e.g., (
    <a rid="R67" ref-type="bibr" href="#R67">
     <span class="italic">67</span>
    </a>, 
    <a rid="R68" ref-type="bibr" href="#R68">
     <span class="italic">68</span>
    </a>)]. In recent years, more than 60% of global emissions from natural habitats (which accounted for 15% of annual greenhouse gas emissions), stemmed from clearing and fires in just two provinces—Riau province in Sumatra, Indonesia, and Matto Grosso state in Brazil. Protection for these and other “high-biomass forests” that are disproportionately important in climate mitigation could be enabled through their designation as CSAs.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tundra and boreal biomes, aside from extensive belowground carbon storage, retain the largest areas of intact large mammal assemblages and are home to some of the most extensive and extant large mammal migrations on Earth (fig. S1K) (
    <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
     <span class="italic">28</span>
    </a>, 
    <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">
     <span class="italic">49</span>
    </a>). Globally, the world’s intact large mammal assemblages coincide with the carbon storehouses and overlap substantially with the world’s remaining wilderness areas, excepting permanent ice in Greenland and in the heavily degraded, defaunated, and overgrazed ecoregions of the Sahara (fig. S2B) (
    <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
     <span class="italic">15</span>
    </a>). However, preventing the transformation of large vegetated regions is not sufficient to maximize their carbon sequestration role. In some major ecosystems, the presence of large predators and herbivores helps store more carbon (
    <a rid="R69" ref-type="bibr" href="#R69">
     <span class="italic">69</span>
    </a>). For example, many large tropical trees with sizeable contributions to carbon stock rely on large vertebrates for seed dispersal and regeneration (
    <a rid="R70" ref-type="bibr" href="#R70">
     <span class="italic">70</span>
    </a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conservation of tiger habitat provides another example of how CSAs could also help improve species protection and recovery efforts. Tigers are habitat generalists, but today, extant populations are largely restricted to forests, and many of these forested habitats lack formal protection under IUCN reserves. Approximately 434 protected areas fall with the tiger’s current range (fig. S3), not all of which contain breeding tigers, and not a single protected area is large enough to support a viable population over the long term (
    <a rid="R71" ref-type="bibr" href="#R71">
     <span class="italic">71</span>
    </a>). These adjacent reserves must be managed as metapopulations, populations linked by occasional dispersal, and so connectivity, and in many cases restoring forest corridors, is essential. The sum of all protected areas in the tiger range is 495,807 km
    <span class="sup">2</span> or 42% of the total area of all 76 Tiger Conservation Landscapes combined (fig. S3). Between now and 2030, only a fraction of the remaining habitat outside formally protected areas will be incorporated into expanded or new reserves. Yet, enough habitat remains to achieve the target of a near-tripling the wild tiger population (
    <a rid="R72" ref-type="bibr" href="#R72">
     <span class="italic">72</span>
    </a>), and management of this habitat could be supported under the OECM umbrella as megafaunal landscapes in that part of the breeding tiger population, especially in India, that occurs outside formal protected areas. The payoff for climate stabilization is dramatic: An earlier study showed that forested areas that contain tigers have three times the carbon density compared to forests and degraded lands where tigers have been eradicated (
    <a rid="R71" ref-type="bibr" href="#R71">
     <span class="italic">71</span>
    </a>). Restoration in tiger habitat and other megafaunal landscapes could center on protecting remaining fragments of natural habitat, reconnecting and buffering them by restoring degraded lands, thus aligning with the Bonn Challenge that seeks to restore 350 million ha of forest by 2030 (
    <a rid="R73" ref-type="bibr" href="#R73">
     <span class="italic">73</span>
    </a>). The same rationale could be used to extend protection in high-carbon density habitats for gibbons and other primates, hornbills and other large fruit-eating birds, and fruit-eating bats.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The central role of indigenous lands</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potentially prominent among OECMs are indigenous peoples’ lands, which account for 37% of all remaining natural lands across the Earth, and these lands store &gt;293 gigatons of carbon (
    <a rid="R74" ref-type="bibr" href="#R74">
     <span class="italic">74</span>
    </a>). Although many of these lands meet the definition of a protected area, many others may be appropriately characterized as OECMs. Here, the global policies articulated in the Paris Agreement and the proposed GDN merge with addressing human rights. The direction, insights, rights, and voices of indigenous peoples are essential but rarely published in scientific journals. The GDN could assist indigenous peoples, where requested, to keep lands intact—for hunting areas, protection of traditional lifestyles, or other features—and provide a mechanism to assist these communities with securing tenure rights. Supporting efforts to maintain these lands, many of which are critical to global terrestrial biodiversity conservation, in many cases would result in lower rates of deforestation and better protection of the biodiversity and ecosystem functions upon which these communities depend (
    <a rid="R75" ref-type="bibr" href="#R75">
     <span class="italic">75</span>
    </a>). Furthermore, more than one-third of the carbon identified in community lands across the tropics lies in areas without secure tenure rights. The Amazon Basin, Congo Basin, boreal, tundra, Borneo, and New Guinea ecoregions all store massive amounts of above- and belowground carbon (fig. S2A) and overlap greatly with indigenous lands.

Slowing and stopping the clearing of intact natural habitat for agriculture, the dominant form of land use today, is critical as part of the overall strategy to stay below 1.5°C. By increasing intensification and directing cropland expansion to degraded lands, and by reducing food waste, the 2050 world food demand could be met without additional land clearing (

    <span class="italic">81</span>

    <span class="italic">83</span>
   </a>). Illegal and unsustainable trade in animals and plants, especially in threatened species, must also be curtailed. Further, resources will be needed to enforce protection as protected areas expand under a GDN. The most commonly invoked intervention to counteract poaching and overhunting is law enforcement patrolling to deter, detect, and punish poachers. Halting illegal and unsustainable trade in animals and plants, in particular of species threatened with extinction and where trade adds to the pressure on that species, is essential (
