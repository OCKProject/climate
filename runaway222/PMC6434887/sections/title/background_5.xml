 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tight coordination of flowering time to environmental conditions is crucial for crop reproductive success and has a major impact on yield [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Barley (
  <span class="italic">Hordeum vulgare</span> L.) and wheat (
  <span class="italic">Triticum</span> spp.) are long-day (LD) plants, flowering earlier under increasing day-lengths. Depending on their growth habit, cereals are classified as winter or spring. Winter cereals need a period of exposure to low temperature (vernalization), which must be completed in a timely manner so the plant is prepared to take full advantage of the induction of flowering by long days [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. This requirement could make winter cereals more susceptible to climate change, since the probability of accumulating enough cold hours will likely decrease in warming winters. Winter barley varieties are sown in autumn, benefiting from the warmth of the soils and the humidity from autumn rains, which are essential at the beginning of the cycle. In the Mediterranean region, they have to survive a range of mild to harsh winters, and then flower sufficiently early in the spring to avoid the heat and drought of late spring or early summer. Barley ideotypes for future climatic conditions in Europe must present combinations of vernalization requirement and photoperiod responses tuned to the needs of each specific region [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. For this reason, plant breeding for upcoming conditions demands comprehensive studies on the effect of photoperiod on major flowering genes, and their interaction with the vernalization pathway. In this regard, special emphasis should be given to environmental conditions closer to natural ones, as it is not known “whether the current model of photoperiodic flowering regulation can recapitulate the seasonal flowering mechanisms in complicated natural LD environments” [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The accepted gene model for vernalization-responsive varieties establishes that, during winter, cold exposure upregulates the floral promoter 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span>, which is required to downregulate the flowering repressor 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span>, allowing expression of the flowering inducer 
  <span class="italic">HvFT1</span> in leaves [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2,</span> a 
  <span class="italic">ZCCT-H</span> gene, is member of the 
  <span class="italic">CONSTANS</span>-like gene family, which delays flowering until plants have satisfied their cold needs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Winter barleys have the dominant variant, whose expression is highly dependent on day-length, being induced in long days [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span> encodes an 
  <span class="italic">AP1</span>-like MADS-box transcription factor [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. It presents several alleles as a result of deletions or insertions in the first intron, associated with different degrees of vernalization requirement [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. In winter barley, 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span> is expressed after exposure to low-temperatures [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>], although it can be activated by other pathways such as the developmental pathway, with a marked delay compared with induction by vernalization [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. Induction of 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span> is related to changes in the pattern of histone methylation, whose maintenance provides a memory of cold exposure in winter barley plants [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. This general mechanism is well established; however, important questions remain open. For instance, what are the precise environmental cues that govern the dynamics of this process? A second open question is which additional genes may play important roles in the vernalization pathway. In this respect, Bouché et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>] remarked that much remains to be learned about this process, including identifying additional components, beyond the 
  <span class="italic">VRN1</span>/
  <span class="italic">VRN2</span> system. Indeed, there are phenotypic differences in vernalization effect among winter cultivars sharing 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span>/
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> haplotypes that are still unexplained [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. For instance, it has been suggested that additional genes may be acting as regulators of 
  <span class="italic">VRN2</span> when exposed to cold [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. Some genes are good candidates to play a role in the vernalization pathway, like 
  <span class="italic">ODDSOC2</span> (in barley, 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>), the monocot ortholog of 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS C</span> (
  <span class="italic">FLC</span>). This gene is a flowering repressor also downregulated by vernalization in barley [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>] and 
  <span class="italic">Brachypodium distachyon</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>], probably caused by binding of VRN1 to its promoter region [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>].

  <span class="italic">HvFT3</span>, a FT-like member of the PEBP family, and candidate gene for 
  <span class="italic">PPD-H2</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>], it was described as a promoter of flowering under short days (SD) in winter cultivars [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>], particularly under Mediterranean conditions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. Its role has been recently clarified specifically controlling spikelet initiation, but not floral development [

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The photoperiod response regulator gene 
  <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span>, also known as

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>], and accelerates flowering mediating the induction of 
  <span class="italic">HvFT1,</span> in winter cultivars after vernalization is fulfilled. There is also evidence of the involvement of several members of the family of 
  <span class="italic">CONSTANS</span>-like genes in the vernalization and photoperiod pathways. 
  <span class="italic">CO1</span> and 
  <span class="italic">CO2</span> are LD-flowering promoters modulated by circadian clock and day-length [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. In wheat, CO2 competes with VRN2 to bind the NF-Y proteins, in a mechanism to integrate environmental cues through regulation of 
  <span class="italic">HvFT1</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. Another member of this family,

  <span class="italic">HvCMF11</span> in Cockram et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]) is a paralog of 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>], and has been identified as a negative regulator of flowering, whose expression has been reported under non-inductive SD conditions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study focuses on the identification of factors (genes and environmental conditions) responsible for repression of flowering in winter barley. Previous studies have demonstrated that 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> expression needs induction by long days [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>], but the exact day-length that triggers this gene is unknown, as most studies have been performed in growth chambers, under fixed photoperiods. This question is relevant from the agronomic point of view. Song et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>] highlighted the importance of optimizing controlled conditions to reflect closely the natural environments. Thus, our approach was addressed trying to mimic the photoperiod conditions in natural Mediterranean environments. We hypothesize that there is a vernalization window for satisfying the cold requirement, in order to make the plant competent to flower at the right time and achieve a good yield. In the experiments presented here, the first objective was to determine the day-length threshold leading to induction of the repressor 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span>. A second objective was to characterize further the role of other possible inducers and repressors of flowering under incomplete or null vernalization. We investigate the effects of photoperiod on the transcript levels of selected genes in winter barley, by examining photoperiod responses in the medium-long term (21–90 days) in two winter cultivars, ‘Hispanic’ and ‘Barberousse’, that present different adaptation patterns [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. Our final aim was to provide new information on the complex mechanism of flowering in suboptimal conditions, to facilitate breeding for present and future climate conditions.
