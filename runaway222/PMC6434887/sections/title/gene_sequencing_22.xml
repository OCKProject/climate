  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S5). The resulting sequences have been deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive as part of project PRJEB27962. BLASTN sequence comparisons [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>] were carried out against the barley Morex reference genome [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>]. Scores below 0.05 are predicted to affect protein function. Putative VRN1 regulatory elements were predicted by scanning a motif compiled from ChIP-seq peaks reported in Deng et al. [
