 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experiment 1 made evident that gene expression was dependent on the plant’s developmental stage (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Therefore, for some genes, induction was dependent on plant age. A second experiment was conceived, to assess the relevance of other factors on gene expression, namely day-length, plant age and degree of vernalization. Thus, we set the day-length at 12 h, representative of day-length around the start of stem elongation in natural conditions in our region, and short enough not to elicit LD responses. This was combined with increasing yet insufficient vernalization.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Time to awn tipping was shortened in an inversely proportional manner to the duration of the VER treatment (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). NV ‘Hispanic’ plants reached awn tipping (DEV49) after 126 days, whereas ‘Barberousse’ did not reach that stage during the entire duration of the experiment (136 days). Plants from both VER treatments reached DEV49 before the NV plants did. Most of this shortening occurred in the period until first node appearance (DEV31), although some additional acceleration was observed between DEV31 and DEV49.

  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>) across treatments and genotypes agree with the patterns of development observed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). Four weeks after vernalization, apex transition from vegetative to reproductive stage (from W2 to W3; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>a), occurred only in ‘Hispanic’ VER 28 days plants. ‘Barberousse’ apices at all treatments, and ‘Hispanic’, VER 0 or 14 days, only reached this stage much later in time (Fig.
