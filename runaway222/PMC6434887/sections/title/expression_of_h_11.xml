 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Expression of

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under typical autumn sowings, winter barley is capable of responding to long photoperiods only after fulfilling a variety-specific low temperature requirement. Current accepted hypotheses indicate that 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span> is gradually induced under SD and low temperature conditions, and then represses 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> to promote flowering [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. In addition, that 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> expression is triggered by LD (16 h light) and downregulated in SD (8 h light), to almost complete repression [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surprisingly, we found expression of 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2,</span> even if at low levels, in NV plants under natural SD (sowings 1–4 in experiment 1). This finding opens the possibility that 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> may have an effect in autumn sowings, prior to its downregulation by 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span>. Although it was not expected, some recently published experiments agree with this result. Research in 
  <span class="italic">Brachypodium</span> found low expression of the 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> orthologue in short days, with level of expression dependent on day-length [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. In barley, expression of 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> under SD, caused by overexpression of 
  <span class="italic">HvCO2</span>, has also been reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. Sampling time was not optimum for 
  <span class="italic">HvCO2</span> in our experiments, since this gene is expressed mainly during the night [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Accordingly, the levels of 
  <span class="italic">HvCO2</span> expression detected in our study were low. This notwithstanding, we observed shifts in its expression, concurrent with changes in 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> expression, which confirm their connection as hypothesized by Mulki and von Korff [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> gene expression remained low until a surge around sowing event 5 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), coincident with an increase of natural daylight between 12 - 13 h (end of March), and a concurrent change of pattern of expression of 
  <span class="italic">HvCO2</span>, responding to photoperiod cues, in unvernalized conditions. We propose that these events indicate an important shift in gene expression patterns in winter barleys, which could have an effect in plant development. In this sense, Karsai et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>] also found a heading date QTL, co-locating with 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span>, but only when day-length exceeded 12 h, although it is possible that the vernalization period of 42 days provided in that experiment was not enough to fulfil the needs of all those plants. This is more evidence that the role of an active 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> allele has observable phenotypic consequences at around 12 h of day-length.
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The control of these two genes has been linked to 
  <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span>. Mulki and von Korff [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>] presented evidence of a feedback loop, between 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> and 
  <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span>, whereas the induction of 
  <span class="italic">HvCO2</span> by 
  <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span>, proposed in the past [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>], is currently questioned [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. A competition between VRN2 and CO2 proteins for binding to NF-Y proteins has been reported [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>], which is consistent with the feedback loop described by Mulki and von Korff [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>] for non-vernalized plants. 
  <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span> shows a broad expression peak around 12 h of light in LD [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Consequently, to reach maximum expression levels, days of 12 h or longer are required. The gradual increase of expression of 
  <span class="italic">HvCO2</span> and 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> with longer days observed in our study is consistent with their position downstream of 
  <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span>. The tipping point at 12 h 30 min actually agrees with the date when natural day-length surpasses the maximum expression threshold for 
  <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span>.
