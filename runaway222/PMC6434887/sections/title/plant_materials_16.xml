 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two winter cultivars, representative of barleys grown in Spain, with adaptation patterns likely related to differences in vernalization requirement [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>], were studied. ‘Barberousse’ (six-rowed, (‘Hauter’ x (‘Hatif de Grignon’ x ‘Ares’)) x ‘Ager’) is an old French cultivar developed by Ringot and registered in 1977, well adapted to the coldest areas of Spain. ‘Hispanic’ (two-rowed, ‘Mosar’ x (‘Flika’ x ‘Lada’)) is a French commercial cultivar developed by Florimond Desprez and registered in 1993, showing broad adaptation in Spain, and even acceptable agronomics in the Nile delta [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. Both cultivars were multiplied in isolation at the EEAD-CSIC farm, collected from bagged spikes, from original seed provided by the companies. They have the same allelic combination in 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span> (winter allele), 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span>, but differ in 
  <span class="italic">HvFT1</span> and 
  <span class="italic">HvFT3</span> (
  <span class="italic">PPD-H2</span>, present in ‘Hispanic’, defective allele in ‘Barberousse’) [
