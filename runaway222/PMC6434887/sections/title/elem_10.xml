 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main purpose of our study was to shed light on the genes affecting development of winter barley before they receive full vernalization. This is an understudied area in barley and other cereals, and its knowledge may open new opportunities for fine-tuning the development of new cultivars to the expected winter temperatures. Vernalization and photoperiod pathways in winter cereals and 
  <span class="italic">Brachypodium</span> are remarkably similar [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. This proximity has allowed a direct translation of knowledge regarding genes and mechanisms between species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Therefore, any progress made in barley will be easily transferred to other crop species, like wheat. The experiments were performed under controlled conditions, carefully chosen to respond to questions that arise when barley is grown under natural conditions. The complexity found is challenging, leading to new questions but, on the other hand, brings attention to the richness of responses within winter barleys that result from the interplay of several genes.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Expression of 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> is upregulated beyond 12 h 30 min natural daylight in absence of vernalization
  </div>
  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under typical autumn sowings, winter barley is capable of responding to long photoperiods only after fulfilling a variety-specific low temperature requirement. Current accepted hypotheses indicate that 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span> is gradually induced under SD and low temperature conditions, and then represses 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> to promote flowering [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. In addition, that 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> expression is triggered by LD (16 h light) and downregulated in SD (8 h light), to almost complete repression [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surprisingly, we found expression of 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2,</span> even if at low levels, in NV plants under natural SD (sowings 1–4 in experiment 1). This finding opens the possibility that 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> may have an effect in autumn sowings, prior to its downregulation by 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span>. Although it was not expected, some recently published experiments agree with this result. Research in 
   <span class="italic">Brachypodium</span> found low expression of the 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> orthologue in short days, with level of expression dependent on day-length [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. In barley, expression of 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> under SD, caused by overexpression of 
   <span class="italic">HvCO2</span>, has also been reported [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. Sampling time was not optimum for 
   <span class="italic">HvCO2</span> in our experiments, since this gene is expressed mainly during the night [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Accordingly, the levels of 
   <span class="italic">HvCO2</span> expression detected in our study were low. This notwithstanding, we observed shifts in its expression, concurrent with changes in 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> expression, which confirm their connection as hypothesized by Mulki and von Korff [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> gene expression remained low until a surge around sowing event 5 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), coincident with an increase of natural daylight between 12 - 13 h (end of March), and a concurrent change of pattern of expression of 
   <span class="italic">HvCO2</span>, responding to photoperiod cues, in unvernalized conditions. We propose that these events indicate an important shift in gene expression patterns in winter barleys, which could have an effect in plant development. In this sense, Karsai et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>] also found a heading date QTL, co-locating with 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span>, but only when day-length exceeded 12 h, although it is possible that the vernalization period of 42 days provided in that experiment was not enough to fulfil the needs of all those plants. This is more evidence that the role of an active 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> allele has observable phenotypic consequences at around 12 h of day-length.
  </p>
  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The control of these two genes has been linked to 
   <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span>. Mulki and von Korff [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>] presented evidence of a feedback loop, between 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> and 
   <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span>, whereas the induction of 
   <span class="italic">HvCO2</span> by 
   <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span>, proposed in the past [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>], is currently questioned [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. A competition between VRN2 and CO2 proteins for binding to NF-Y proteins has been reported [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>], which is consistent with the feedback loop described by Mulki and von Korff [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>] for non-vernalized plants. 
   <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span> shows a broad expression peak around 12 h of light in LD [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Consequently, to reach maximum expression levels, days of 12 h or longer are required. The gradual increase of expression of 
   <span class="italic">HvCO2</span> and 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> with longer days observed in our study is consistent with their position downstream of 
   <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span>. The tipping point at 12 h 30 min actually agrees with the date when natural day-length surpasses the maximum expression threshold for 
   <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span>.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Earliness differences between two unvernalized winter genotypes are not due to 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> levels
  </div>
  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of the two unvernalized winter cultivars showed a faster early development of ‘Hispanic’, as revealed by differences in pace of apex development. In both experiments ‘Hispanic’ developed or flowered always earlier than ‘Barberousse’. Differences in 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> expression cannot be the only cause of earliness differences. This indicates the presence of additional factors affecting differentially apex development in ‘Hispanic’ and ‘Barberousse’, in the absence of vernalization.
  </p>
  <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two cultivars differ in an unknown, but surely large, number of genes. We cannot be sure which genes are causing the differences in earliness between them. However, these differences are manifested in plants without full vernalization, and seem related to vernalization responsiveness. Therefore, it is justified to look into other genes that may act in the vernalization pathway. Currently, there is enough evidence substantiating that expression of 
   <span class="italic">OS2</span> genes in winter cereals is suppressed by cold and could have a role in the process of vernalization. It has been proposed that 
   <span class="italic">Brachypodium BdODDSOC2</span> “plays a role in setting the length of the vernalization requirement in a rheostatic manner, i.e. higher 
   <span class="italic">ODDSOC2</span> transcript levels before cold result in a longer cold period needed to saturate the vernalization requirement” [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>], although its specific role in the vernalization response is not clear. Across our experiments, expression of 
   <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> was concurrent with the absence of 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span>, being lowest in plants that flowered. This coincidence was already observed in barley, wheat and 
   <span class="italic">Brachypodium</span> [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. In addition, in the two experiments (all samplings, except one point in experiment 1), ‘Barberousse’ consistently showed higher levels of 
   <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> transcripts than ‘Hispanic’, what agrees with the delayed development and later 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span> appearance observed in ‘Barberousse’. The predicted amino acid sequences from 
   <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> showed polymorphisms in the coding sequence between both varieties, entailing potential change in protein function, and many other polymorphisms in non-coding regions, which could explain the expression differences. This is the first report describing sequence variation in 
   <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, it was shown that the protein VRN1 binds to the promoters of 
   <span class="italic">VERNALIZATION2</span> and 
   <span class="italic">ODDSOC2</span> in barley [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. Therefore, we explored the possibility that the genotypes differed in VRN1 binding sites. We identified putative VRN1-regulatory sites in 
   <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>, and found that most of them were identical in both genotypes, leading us to exclude them as cause of dissimilar gene expression among genotypes. However, the variations in intron 1 and some VRN1-regulatory sites in 3’UTR might indicate regulatory differences among the cultivars, as found in 
   <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span>. Considerable natural variation in noncoding regions, affecting regulation of 
   <span class="italic">FLC</span> (homolog of 
   <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>) has been reported in 
   <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span> [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>]. Future research will be needed to ascertain the involvement of 
   <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> in the vernalization mechanism and the effect of the polymorphisms found in coding and non-coding sequences.

   <span class="italic">HvFT3</span> expression is not constitutive in winter cultivars, it needs induction by cold and plant development
  </div>
  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found differences in responsiveness to SD between the genotypes. ‘Hispanic’ developed faster than ‘Barberousse’ and flowered without vernalization. It also flowered earlier in the natural photoperiod experiment, when day-lengths increased from SD to LD (72 days in the first sowing event, without vernalization), than under SD conditions only (126 days at 12 h, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The two varieties differ (among others) in the presence/absence of 
   <span class="italic">HvFT3.</span> We hypothesized that this could be a key factor differentiating their response to insufficient vernalization. This gene bears particular agronomic relevance for Mediterranean environments, as it stands at the peak of flowering time QTL and grain yield QTL x Environment peaks in several populations [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. A supporting role for promotion to flowering in winter cultivars, receiving less than full vernalization under field conditions, was proposed for 
   <span class="italic">HvFT3</span> [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. Its expression is usually reported in SD, although it is also found in LD conditions [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. In our experiments, 
   <span class="italic">HvFT3</span> transcripts were only detected: (a) after full or partial vernalization, in early-medium development (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), and (b) in absence of vernalization, in rather late developmental stages, and only in plants sown under shortest day-lengths (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). We expected expression of 
   <span class="italic">HvFT3</span>, the “short photoperiod” gene, at least in the earliest sowings in the experiment with natural photoperiods. Instead, it was effectively repressed, either by the low but always present 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span>, or by other repressors. Under constant photoperiod of 12 h, 
   <span class="italic">HvFT3</span> was detected in ‘Hispanic’ only after four weeks VER (2 weeks were insufficient) and 5 weeks in growth chamber (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Thus, 
   <span class="italic">HvFT3</span> was expressed in a winter cultivar only after some cold exposure, and increasingly with plant age. It is particularly remarkable that the expression of 
   <span class="italic">HvFT3</span> was correlated with earlier flowering, although it was detected only after the transition from vegetative to reproductive apex had occurred (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). This late effect on development is consistent with findings in spring wheat varieties [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>], and in barley [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. This last study evidenced that genotypes with 
   <span class="italic">HvFT3</span> accelerated the initiation of spikelet primordia and the early reproductive development but required LD to flower.

  <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The induction of 
   <span class="italic">HvFT3</span> in sowing event 2 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), together with the progressive increase of the transcripts after 28-days VER, when

   <span class="italic">FT3</span> when 
   <span class="italic">FT1</span> was upregulated, as in our findings with 12 h day-length. Their concurrent expression could be related to the interactions between FT1 and other FT-like proteins, including FT3, with proteins FD-like and 14–3-3, all components of the florigen activation complex (FAC), in wheat and barley [
