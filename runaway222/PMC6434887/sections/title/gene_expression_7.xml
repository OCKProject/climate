 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to determine the day-length threshold that induces the expression of 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span>, experiment 1 involved sequential sowings in a greenhouse, one week apart. Natural day-length at sampling (for 21-day-old plants) increased from ~ 11 h 30 min at the first sowing to ~ 14 h at the 9th sowing event, and also for the VER control (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>).

    <p>Experiment planning. Each sowing and its sampling are represented. Yellow bars show the time that plants were kept under non-vernalized conditions. Blue bar shows the time spent in the vernalization chamber. X-axis represent dates of start of experiment and sampling date (three weeks after sowing). The second numbers inside the yellow bars are the day-length at sampling date (HH:MM). The first numbers in italics represent day-length at sowing day, and underlined numbers are day-length in the shift day (vernalized plants were transferred to glasshouse).

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surprisingly, expression of 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> was detected at all time points, in plants both 14 and 21 days old. It was low in the first sowings, which were grown under shorter photoperiods (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Between 12 and 13 h photoperiods, corresponding to the end of March in our latitude, the levels of 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> increased in both genotypes. At 21 days, there were significant differences in 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> expression between genotypes and sowings, without interaction between them (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S1), indicating similar pattern of responses across genotypes. A contrast between the four earliest sowings (1–4) vs the five latest (5–9) explained as much as 78% of the variation between sowings, rendering the remaining variance (genotypes by sampling point, within day-lengths groups), non-significant (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S2A). Therefore, the surge in expression between sowings 4 and 5 is the main factor affecting 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> expression for both genotypes. This same trend was also detected in 14-day-old plants, with slightly lower expression values overall (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S2).

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Expression of 
  <span class="italic">HvCO2</span> increased in both genotypes up to sowing 4. Then, it decreased to very low levels, not rising again until sowing 8 and 9. The main change in expression patterns occurred again between sowings 4 and 5, for both genotypes (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S2B).

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span> expression was detected only in VER plants (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), and 
  <span class="italic">HvFT1</span> was not detected in any sample at this stage (data not shown). Without vernalization, neither genotype showed expression of 
  <span class="italic">HvFT3</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). This was expected for ‘Barberousse’, as it has the null allele, but we did not anticipate this result for ‘Hispanic’. In this genotype, the expression levels were below the detection limit, except for VER plants.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, ‘Barberousse’ presented higher 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> expression levels than ‘Hispanic’ (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S1), except for the last samplings, when 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> expression was barely detectable in both genotypes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Expression of 
  <span class="italic">HvCO9</span> was low and variable, with no observable trends for any genotype. 
  <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span> expression showed fluctuations in expression apparently independent from genotypes.

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the end of the experiment (May 19th, with 15 h of light), the number of apices at reproductive stage per plant was recorded (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S3). ‘Hispanic’ plants were more developed than ‘Barberousse’s. Among NV plants, only the second sowing event of ‘Hispanic’ reached the stage Z49 (first awns visible) at the end of the experiment (83 days after sowing). No data were available for the first sowing at that moment, as plants were dissected earlier, again with only ‘Hispanic’ showing reproductive apices after 72 days. At termination, VER ‘Hispanic’ and ‘Barberousse’ plants also showed apices at reproductive stage, ‘Barberousse’ more delayed than ‘Hispanic’.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Expression levels on this same date were analysed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S3), across all sowings. For all NV plants, flowering promoters (
  <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span>, 
  <span class="italic">HvFT1</span> and 
  <span class="italic">HvFT3</span>) were induced only in ‘Hispanic’ oldest plants, at the first point available (sowing event 2), and were not expressed in ‘Barberousse’, in full accordance with apex development. Concurrently, in plants from sowing 2, repressors 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> and 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> were down-regulated in ‘Hispanic’, and induced in ‘Barberousse’.
