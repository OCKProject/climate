  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> levels
 </div>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of the two unvernalized winter cultivars showed a faster early development of ‘Hispanic’, as revealed by differences in pace of apex development. In both experiments ‘Hispanic’ developed or flowered always earlier than ‘Barberousse’. Differences in 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> expression cannot be the only cause of earliness differences. This indicates the presence of additional factors affecting differentially apex development in ‘Hispanic’ and ‘Barberousse’, in the absence of vernalization.
 </p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two cultivars differ in an unknown, but surely large, number of genes. We cannot be sure which genes are causing the differences in earliness between them. However, these differences are manifested in plants without full vernalization, and seem related to vernalization responsiveness. Therefore, it is justified to look into other genes that may act in the vernalization pathway. Currently, there is enough evidence substantiating that expression of 
  <span class="italic">OS2</span> genes in winter cereals is suppressed by cold and could have a role in the process of vernalization. It has been proposed that 
  <span class="italic">Brachypodium BdODDSOC2</span> “plays a role in setting the length of the vernalization requirement in a rheostatic manner, i.e. higher 
  <span class="italic">ODDSOC2</span> transcript levels before cold result in a longer cold period needed to saturate the vernalization requirement” [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>], although its specific role in the vernalization response is not clear. Across our experiments, expression of 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> was concurrent with the absence of 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span>, being lowest in plants that flowered. This coincidence was already observed in barley, wheat and 
  <span class="italic">Brachypodium</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. In addition, in the two experiments (all samplings, except one point in experiment 1), ‘Barberousse’ consistently showed higher levels of 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> transcripts than ‘Hispanic’, what agrees with the delayed development and later 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span> appearance observed in ‘Barberousse’. The predicted amino acid sequences from 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> showed polymorphisms in the coding sequence between both varieties, entailing potential change in protein function, and many other polymorphisms in non-coding regions, which could explain the expression differences. This is the first report describing sequence variation in 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, it was shown that the protein VRN1 binds to the promoters of 
  <span class="italic">VERNALIZATION2</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ODDSOC2</span> in barley [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. Therefore, we explored the possibility that the genotypes differed in VRN1 binding sites. We identified putative VRN1-regulatory sites in 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>, and found that most of them were identical in both genotypes, leading us to exclude them as cause of dissimilar gene expression among genotypes. However, the variations in intron 1 and some VRN1-regulatory sites in 3’UTR might indicate regulatory differences among the cultivars, as found in 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span>. Considerable natural variation in noncoding regions, affecting regulation of 
  <span class="italic">FLC</span> (homolog of 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>) has been reported in 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>]. Future research will be needed to ascertain the involvement of 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> in the vernalization mechanism and the effect of the polymorphisms found in coding and non-coding sequences.
