 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed the complete nucleotide sequences of ‘Barberousse’ and ‘Hispanic’ for the genes 
  <span class="italic">HvCO2</span>, 
  <span class="italic">HvCO9,</span> and partial sequences for 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2,</span> searching for polymorphisms that may affect protein function or regulation of expression. There were coding sequence polymorphisms between the two cultivars in all three genes (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>: Table S6, Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Table S7 and Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">4</a>: Table S8). The SNPs found in 
  <span class="italic">HvCO2</span> were synonymous (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>a) and, therefore, unlikely to be related to functional differences. Alignment of our sequences against ‘Morex’ (AF490470) and ‘Igri’ (AF490469) 
  <span class="italic">HvCO2</span> alleles in public databases revealed two non-synonymous SNPs (T74A, A239T), but were unlikely to alter protein function (SIFT scores of 1.00 and 0.47, respectively, Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S4A).

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three SNPs were found in the coding sequence of 
  <span class="italic">HvCO9</span> between ‘Barberousse’ and ‘Hispanic’
  <span class="italic">,</span> two of them non-synonymous (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>b). Both substitutions (S116A, S196G) could affect protein function (SIFT scores of 0.00 and 0.02, respectively). The peptide sequence of domain CCT was invariable in these two lines, also when compared to ‘Morex’ (AB592332) and ‘Steptoe’ (AB592331) (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S4B). According to the SNPs found, ‘Barberousse’ was like ‘Steptoe’ and ‘Hispanic’ as ‘Morex’ (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Table S7).

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sequence of 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> was split in two parts. The first one comprises part of the upstream region, exon 1 and the beginning of intron 1 (~ 800 bp out of 36.7 kb). The second part contains 35 bp at the end of intron 1, and coding and non-coding regions from remaining exons 2 to 5 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>c). Five SNPs were found within the coding sequence, with two causing amino acid substitutions (T66I and I150S). The second one, found in ‘Hispanic’ and ‘Igri’, another winter cultivar (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S4C), could affect protein function (SIFT scores of 1.00 and 0.00, respectively). The MADS-box domain was invariable. A high number of predicted VRN1 regulatory sites where identified throughout the gene sequence. The upstream region and intron 1 showed several polymorphisms, which could affect regulation of 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>, apart from VRN1 regulatory sites (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>c, Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">4</a>: Table S8).
