   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> expression between genotypes and sowings, without interaction between them (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S1), indicating similar pattern of responses across genotypes. A contrast between the four earliest sowings (1–4) vs the five latest (5–9) explained as much as 78% of the variation between sowings, rendering the remaining variance (genotypes by sampling point, within day-lengths groups), non-significant (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S2A). Therefore, the surge in expression between sowings 4 and 5 is the main factor affecting

No data were available for the first sowing at that moment, as plants were dissected earlier, again with only ‘Hispanic’ showing reproductive apices after 72 days.

  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experiment 1 made evident that gene expression was dependent on the plant’s developmental stage (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Therefore, for some genes, induction was dependent on plant age. A second experiment was conceived, to assess the relevance of other factors on gene expression, namely day-length, plant age and degree of vernalization. Thus, we set the day-length at 12 h, representative of day-length around the start of stem elongation in natural conditions in our region, and short enough not to elicit LD responses. This was combined with increasing yet insufficient vernalization.

NV ‘Hispanic’ plants reached awn tipping (DEV49) after 126 days, whereas ‘Barberousse’ did not reach that stage during the entire duration of the experiment (136 days). Plants from both VER treatments reached DEV49 before the NV plants did. Most of this shortening occurred in the period until first node appearance (DEV31), although some additional acceleration was observed between DEV31 and DEV49.
