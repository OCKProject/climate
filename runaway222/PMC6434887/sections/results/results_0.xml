 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In absence of vernalization and under increasing photoperiods, 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> expression increased with day-length, mainly between 12 and 13 h photoperiods in our latitudes. The flowering promoter gene in short days, 
  <span class="italic">HvFT3</span>, was only expressed after receiving induction of cold or plant age, which was associated with low transcript levels of 
  <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> and 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>. Under the sub-optimal conditions here described, great differences in development were found between the two winter barley varieties used in the study. Delayed development in ‘Barberousse’ was associated with increased expression levels of 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>. Novel variation for 
  <span class="italic">HvCO9</span> and 
  <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> is reported and might explain such differences.
