  <p id="Par1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In winter barley plants, vernalization and photoperiod cues have to be integrated to promote flowering. Plant development and expression of different flowering promoter (
   <span class="italic">HvVRN1</span>, 
   <span class="italic">HvCO2</span>, 
   <span class="italic">PPD-H1</span>,

   <span class="italic">HvFT3</span>) and repressor (
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span>, 
   <span class="italic">HvCO9</span> and 
   <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>) genes were evaluated in two winter barley varieties under: (1) natural increasing photoperiod, without vernalization, and (2) under short day conditions in three insufficient vernalization treatments. These challenging conditions were chosen to capture non-optimal and natural responses, representative of those experienced in the Mediterranean area.

  <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In absence of vernalization and under increasing photoperiods, 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> expression increased with day-length, mainly between 12 and 13 h photoperiods in our latitudes. The flowering promoter gene in short days, 
   <span class="italic">HvFT3</span>, was only expressed after receiving induction of cold or plant age, which was associated with low transcript levels of 
   <span class="italic">HvVRN2</span> and 
   <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>. Under the sub-optimal conditions here described, great differences in development were found between the two winter barley varieties used in the study. Delayed development in ‘Barberousse’ was associated with increased expression levels of 
   <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>. Novel variation for 
   <span class="italic">HvCO9</span> and 
   <span class="italic">HvOS2</span> is reported and might explain such differences.

  <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The balance between the expression of flowering promoters and repressor genes regulates the promotion towards flowering or the maintenance of the vegetative state. 
   <span class="italic">HvOS2</span>, an ortholog of 
   <span class="italic">FLC</span>, appears as a strong candidate to mediate in the vernalization response of barley. Natural variation found would help to exploit the plasticity in development to obtain better-adapted varieties for current and future climate conditions.
