 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we summarize our key finding and, in the following subsections, illustrate the dynamics of the model that buttress each result. Our analysis illustrates trade-offs and the existence of multiple regimes of land use. We find that rapid forager cycling is a highly effective regime of land use—raises carrying capacity—but also sets a system up for collapse into partitioned groups that potentially live in a “Malthusian Purgatory.” Specifically,</p>
 <div list-type="order" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>All else equal, above a critical threshold that sets the severity of seasonal changes in resources, rapid forager cycling has a higher maximum population density than habitat partitioning. Below this threshold, habitat partitioning results in a higher maximum population density.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Increases in the maximum population density at which foragers maintain a consistent level of calorie intake comes with tradeoffs. For example, in aseasonal environments, partitioning increases the maximum population density at which foragers can maintain a consistent intake of calories. However, partitioning in space requires giving-up information about opportunities to find other fitness enhancing resources and, importantly, makes foragers more vulnerable to lower frequency (decade-to-century scale) perturbations. The implication: Longer-term variation in resources favors cycling between habitats.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Forager-resource systems experience a general variance reduction, safe-operating space tradeoff. This means that forager cycling increases the carrying capacity of the environment, reducing variation in the intake of calories for individuals. However, as forager populations approach the carrying capacity of a given social-technological set of strategies, the ability of the ecosystem and social system to withstand perturbations declines. As a consequence, foragers become vulnerable to cascades of resource failure as they cycle between habitats. This dynamic should favor, in some environments, the adoption of territoriality, and partitioning should emerge from territoriality.</p>

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g004" href="#pone.0218440.g004">Fig 4</a> illustrates the benefits of cycling through habitats that boom and bust at different times. In this case, we force habitat partitioning. This means that we force the agent from group one to spend 100 % of her time in habitat one and the same for group two in habitat two. At a low population density (the blue line in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g004" href="#pone.0218440.g004">Fig 4</a>), resource harvest always meets a forager’s target of calories (
   <span class="italic">h</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">m</span>
   </sub>). It is only when scarcity emerges that the incentive to cycle on a seasonal time-scale becomes clear (shift from blue-to-yellow-to-red curves). At 
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 3.5 (the red curve), for example, during lean periods, foragers work at the max tolerable level (12 hours per day) while falling far short of their calorie target (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g004" href="#pone.0218440.g004">Fig 4b</a>). This situation is untenable. Foragers must shift between habitats to maintain a consistent intake of calories.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, in a low population density and aseasonal environment (solid magenta line, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g006" href="#pone.0218440.g006">Fig 6a</a>), a population of foragers that spends 50% of their time in each habitat recovers 3/4 of a year faster than a partitioned population. It would not take a very high frequency of such perturbations, perhaps one per decade, to increase fitness for foragers who cycle relative to those who partition. In sum, at small time-scales and low population densities, rapid forager cycling and partitioning seem equivalent, in terms of the consistency of calorie intake, but at larger scales forager cycling has a clear advantage. Even at low population densities and in unrealistically aseasonal environments, forager cycling increases the consistency and mean of harvests over time. In short, we should expect well mixed distributions of foragers in space and time, even in unrealistically aseasonal environments.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7</a> displays a powerful variance reduction, safe-operating space tradeoff associated with forager cycling. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7a–7c</a> display three phase plots. Phase plots display the relationship between variables that change over time. For example, in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g003" href="#pone.0218440.g003">Fig 3a</a> the biomass of habitats one and two vary over time and are 180 degrees our of phase (i.e., when one peaks, the other troughs). An alternative way to plot this relationship is in phase space, plotting the biomass of habitat one on the x-axis, and the biomass of habitat two on the y-axis. In this example, the graph would display a perfect negative correlation. Imagine a movie of a pencil drawing this relationship on the graph. The pencil would start in the lower right corner (habitat one high biomass, habitat two low biomass) and, over time, move along a perfect linear trajectory toward the upper left corner of the graph and then back to the bottom right corner. The pencil will just oscillate along this trajectory over time. Displaying how variables in a dynamical system relate to each other in a phase plot is a powerful tool for studying the coevolution of those variables over time and identifying emergent changes in the qualitative structure of a system under different parameter values.

On each plot we mark five regions. Regions 1 and 3 are analogous to each other. In these regions, both foragers spend near 100 % of their time in the same habitat (Region 1, everyone in habitat two, and Region 3, everyone in habitat one). Regions 2 and 4 are, again, analogous to each other. In these regions, the system displays partitioning. In Region 2 the group two forager spends near 100% of her time in habitat two, and the forager from group one near 100 % of her time in habitat one. Region 4 displays the opposite. Finally, Region 5 displays mixing in space and over time. At the very center of this region foragers spend, on average, 50 % of their time in each habitat.

In this case, the system starts with the foragers from groups one and two spending almost 100 % of their time in habitat two. The arrow pointing toward the middle of the graph indicates that, over time, the mean proportion of time each forager spends in each habitat converges to a constant in the middle of the graph, after which the system oscillates with constant mean around 0.5 (a perfectly mixed system with a forager spending 50 % of her time in both habitats).

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7a</a> illustrates that when population density is low, the system is globally robust to changes in the use of space, including highly aggregated populations (e.g., 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>1</sub> = 0.99, 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>2</sub> = 0.01) or highly partitioned populations (e.g.,

   <sub>1</sub> = 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>2</sub> = 0.99). In the parlance of sustainable human-resource systems, the system has a complete safe-operating space. The safe-operating space includes all of the starting values of (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7a</a> from which the system will evolve to a state where foragers consistently meet their calorie target.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Again, thinking intuitively about real foragers, consider the low population density case illustrated by 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7a</a>. Observing an important ceremony requires that forager populations temporarily concentrate in space (e.g., in Region 1 of 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7a</a>, foragers aggregate in habitat two). Due to this population concentration, foragers must work very hard to meet their energy target (i.e., effort is at 0.5 in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7d</a> at 
   <span class="italic">t</span> = 0–the start of the ceremony). When the ceremony ends, foragers quickly move away from the extreme values in Region 1 toward Region 5, and foraging effort in habitats one and two quickly drop below the maximum tolerable work level and remain there. The orange curve on 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7d</a> illustrates this dynamic for the forager from group one over time (the dynamic is analogous for the forager from group two). Initially, the orange curve is very high, then quickly drops and oscillates around a stable mean of 0.21 workdays/day, and the forager consistently meets her target harvest of calories (cyan line in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7d</a>) over time. In short, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7a</a> illustrates a system in which forager cycling minimizes variation in the calorie intake of foragers (at multiple scales as demonstrated above) 
   <span class="italic">and</span> has a complete safe-operating space.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7b</a> illustrates the consequences of increases in population density to near carrying capacity (here, 
   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>1</sub> = 
   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>2</sub> = 4.25 &amp; 
   <span class="italic">α</span> = 1). This increase has two consequences. First, in a perfectly mixed system (rapid forager cycling), foragers continue to meet their calorie target at equilibrium (cyan line is constant at 0.1 in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7e</a>), but at a lower rate of return. The orange curve in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7e</a> illustrates changes in foraging effort over time as the system converges to an equilibrium at 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>1</sub> = 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>2</sub> = 0.5. Note the higher mean of the orange curve in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7e</a> (≈ 0.35) than in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7d</a>. This means that the group one forager works harder to maintain a constant intake of calories.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, the increase in population density reduces the 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>1</sub>–
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>2</sub> space in which foragers can converge to meeting their calorie target. Another way to say this is that the constant cyan curve in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7e</a> only emerges when the system begins from a mixed state. If foragers too unevenly distribute on the landscape either due to aggregating (both foragers spend most of their time in one habitat, such as Regions 1 and 3) or partitioning (each forager spends most of their time in one habitat, such as Regions 2 and 4), the system will converge to one that is mixed, but foragers experience long-term variation in their mean intake of calories (a result analogous to 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7f</a> where the cyan curve oscillates). In this environment, the processes of aggregation or partitioning results in foragers not meeting their resource target. The safe-operating space of the system, the range of initial (
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>1</sub>, 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>2</sub>) values from which the strategy of cycling between habitats leads to a consistent supply of calories over the long-term, declines in size. If foragers become too aggregated or too partitioned, the consequence is oscillating resource shortfalls; a sequence of: Good year, shortfall year, good year, shortfall year, etc.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For instance, when the system starts with everyone aggregated in habitat two (Region 1), foragers must, again, start by working as hard as they can to harvest food. This depresses the productivity of habitat two. Because the cost to migrate is zero (
   <span class="italic">q</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">ij</span>
   </sub> = 1 for all 
   <span class="italic">ij</span>), foragers head for habitat one, which depresses the resources in this habitat and causes foragers, again, to work as hard as they can. Over time, foragers converge back to a mixed system, but it is too late, in a sense, because the resource base in both habitats never has sufficient time to recover. Thus, foragers end up in a long-run equilibrium in which they can meet their resource needs every other year, but also experience a 10-20 % shortfall every other year. In sum, although forager cycling reduces variation in the calorie intake of individuals and raises the carrying capacity of many environments, the very success of the cycling strategy (leading to population growth until near carrying capacity) reduces the ability of foragers to aggregate and disperse without causing resources to vary unexpectedly as a consequence of their movements. This is a variance reduction, safe-operating space tradeoff. The very strategy used to reduce variation in the intake of calories leads to a decline in the size of the safe operating-space of the system. This is not something foragers could necessarily recognize unless they experienced the negative consequences.

   <sub>1</sub> − 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>2</sub> space that cannot be reached from all initial conditions (i.e., generates habitat partitioning). In this setting, the long run mean proportion of time spent in a given habitat depends on initial conditions, creating a barrier between Regions 2 and 4 because the capacity of the internal dynamics of the system to reach well mixed states is limited, and only external forcing (e.g., climate variation beyond normal seasonality) can temporarily mix the system.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bottom line: foragers have overshot carrying capacity and entered a “Malthusian Purgatory.” No matter whether they cycle or not, they cannot meet their desired energy target. Thus, initial conditions determine the degree of partitioning. More technically, when foragers work as hard as tolerable, their choices about foraging in different habitats decouple from productivity across habitats. Under conditions of relative abundance (
   <span class="italic">e</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub>(
   <span class="italic">t</span>) &lt; 
   <span class="italic">e</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">x</span>
   </sub>) foragers adjust effort to create a match between their calorie uptake and desired calorie uptake (move

   </sub>(
   <span class="italic">t</span>) toward 
   <span class="italic">h</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">m</span>
   </sub>). This decision impacts biomass (
   <span class="italic">x</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub>) which, in turn, impacts foraging effort (
   <span class="italic">e</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub>(
   <span class="italic">t</span>)), which starts the cycle anew. Thus, foraging effort (
   <span class="italic">e</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub>(
   <span class="italic">t</span>)) depends on both the proportion of time in a given habitat (
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub>) and biomass (
   <span class="italic">x</span>
   <sub>

   </sub>), coupling their dynamics in such a way as the average over an annual cycle of 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>1</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>2</sub> become equal. However, when foraging effort equals the maximum tolerable effort (
   <span class="italic">e</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub>(
   <span class="italic">t</span>) = 
   <span class="italic">e</span>

   <span class="italic">e</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub>(
   <span class="italic">t</span>) no longer depends on the proportion of time in a habitat (
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub>) and biomass (
   <span class="italic">x</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub>), it is simply a constant. This weakens the coupling between the proportion of time in a habitat and the biomass of a habitat. Thus, a mixed distribution of foragers in space bifurcates into a potentially partitioned distribution, depending on initial conditions.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A qualitative insight with important consequences emerges from the comparison of 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7b and 7c</a>. In the environment illustrated by 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7b</a>, foragers are vulnerable to a cascade of oscillating resource failures. For example, if foragers respond to a drought in habitat one by aggregating in habitat two for a season, then in a system with free movement, this behavior generates a cascade of resource failures over the following years. But, the resource system still has enough stocked-up biomass that, if a bumper year hits in which productivity is above normal, the system could transition back into one in which individual foragers consistently meet their calorie target. Foragers can learn that their high cycling strategy is vulnerable and, thus, adjust their strategies to reduce the chances that they experience a sequence of resource shortfalls again.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the environment defined by 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7c</a>, foragers have crossed into a Malthusian Purgatory. Partitioning follows from overshooting the carrying capacity of the environment. The only way to deal with this is a massive migration or suffer prolonged negative fitness, until population is, again, well below carrying capacity and the resource base can recover. As Cowgill noted long ago, changes in strategy are unlikely in such a situation; rather depression and stagnation are likely because individuals lack adaptive capacity [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref043">43</a>]. Partitioning in real systems is not likely a simple consequence of changes in equilibirum resource abundance and competition among foragers in different habitats. Rather, partitioning results from a complex interaction of resource abundance, the perception of foragers and the dynamics of knowledge creation as foragers move on a landscape.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore this dynamic further, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g008" href="#pone.0218440.g008">Fig 8a–8c</a> replicates 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7a–7c</a> except in two crucial respects. First, foragers occupy a one quarter less seasonal environment, and, second, in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g008" href="#pone.0218440.g008">Fig 8c</a> we keep population density equal to 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7b</a> and assume that there is a cost to enter another group’s home-range due to territorial norms. In particular, we assume that searching for resources within one’s home-range is free, but searching for resources outside of one’s own home-range has a cost (either avoiding attack or securing a ritual gift). In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g008" href="#pone.0218440.g008">Fig 8a and 8b</a>, we observe, again, that increasing population density reduces the 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>1</sub>–
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>2</sub> space in which foragers can converge to meeting their resource target. In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g008" href="#pone.0218440.g008">Fig 8a</a>, again population density is low, and the safe-operating space of the system encompasses all potential values of (
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>1</sub>, 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>2</sub>). Increasing population density to the level in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g008" href="#pone.0218440.g008">Fig 8b</a>, decreases the safe-operating space of the system. The red curves on 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g008" href="#pone.0218440.g008">Fig 8b</a> illustrate the safe-operating space. If foragers aggregate too far, (e.g. beyond the red curves), they will experience cascades of resource short fall that oscillate over time.

This cost slows the flow of foragers between habitats in response to differences in harvest per unit effort. In turn, as foragers spend more time in their own habitat, they loose information on the other habitat and discount traveling there relative to harvesting resources from their own ‘home-range.’ This dynamic leads to the complete partitioning of groups in space and time. Such partitioning based on territorial ownership cannot happen when 
   <span class="italic">α</span> = 1 (very high seasonality) because partitioning creates too much concentrated harvest pressure on a given habitat. However, where 
   <span class="italic">α</span> = 0.75 ownership norms allow individuals to consistently meet their resource target, whether partitioned or highly aggregated. Foragers can partition because the resource base in each habitat can withstand more intense harvest and foragers can aggregate because territorial ownership prevents a massive swing of population from one habitat to another, slowing down the movement of foragers on a landscape. The adoption of territorial ownership, in an emergent way, stabilizes the harvests of individual foragers by reducing the risk of leaving a system’s safe-operating space.
