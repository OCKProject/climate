 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Texas Coastal Plain (TCP) contains some of the oldest and longest used hunter-gatherer mortuary sites in the Americas. Hunter-gatherer mortuary locations, rates of burial and rates of grave good deposition on the TCP all provide deep-time records with enormous potential to investigate how foraging populations distribute on a landscape [

  <a rid="pone.0218440.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref009">9</a>]. Researchers on the Texas Coastal Plain have long argued that the development of a hunter-gatherer mortuary complex between 7000 and 750 cal BP reflects specialization in the use of particular resource zones–habitat partitioning–and the development of territorial ownership–making entrance into a habitat more costly for some individuals [

  <a rid="pone.0218440.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref010">10</a>]. Why? What mechanisms led foragers to partition their use of space on the prehistoric TCP, and how might the process of partitioning relate to the adoption of territorial ownership?
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we build and analyze a spatially explicit model of coupled space use and resource dynamics to investigate this question. The model allows us to isolate the social-ecological conditions that may cause a population of foragers to partition in space and time, focusing on a narrower range of habitats. The model describes the distribution of foragers as individuals respond to seasonal changes in the availability of resources, as well as longer-term changes in climate and population. The model that we build is more complex than typical foraging models used by anthropologists (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0218440.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref011">11</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0218440.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref013">13</a>] because the model describes important feedback relationships between resources, individual foraging and land use; however, the model is also less complex than agent based models that describe more details of particular systems (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0218440.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref014">14</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0218440.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref016">16</a>]). The model makes operational a general dynamic theory of hunter-gatherer population distributions in space and illustrates a variance reduction, safe-operating space tradeoff. A variance reduction, safe-operating space tradeoff occurs when individual decisions to maximize the consistency of the supply of food in the short-run creates a social-ecological system vulnerable to disruption in the longer-run. Such trade-offs, we propose, provide one mechanism that causes hunter-gatherers to partition in space and adopt more labor intensive institutions and technologies.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g001" href="#pone.0218440.g001">Fig 1b</a> illustrates the scale of the hierarchy relevant to the emergence of habitat partitioning and territorial ownership. In general, at the habitat scale, some set of potential habitats exists on a landscape in which foragers may reside. Each forager must decide how many of that potential set of habitats to use, how much time to spend in any given habitat exploiting its patches and which habitats to move between. Our basic idea is that partitioning and ownership interrelate due to the feedback between these decision processes in a variable environment. To study the feedback between these decision processes, we construct a dynamic ecological model called the spatial foraging effort model (or the SPDm for short). The SPDm is a two habitat model. This allows us to hold the question of which habitats to move between constant and focus on the feedback between the number of potential habitats (one vs. two), and how much time to spend in a given habitat exploiting its resource patches. The logic of the SPDm extends two classic models form Foraging Theory, Ideal Distribution Models (IDMs) [

     <a rid="pone.0218440.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref020">20</a>]. The far left column represents patch choices. Patch choices occur daily or weekly as foragers radiate out from base camps to access the smallest patch blocks. Habitat choices occur monthly-to-annually as foragers choose between the moderate sized blocks, and, at the landscape scale, foragers make decisions about their home-ranges a few times over decades by choosing between blocks of landscape (e.g., pages 380–383 in [

Foragers must choose where to reside (habitat), how much time to spend in a given habitat (harvest) and which set of habitats to use (migrate). These decisions interact with each other by affecting resources and the decisions of other foragers. The set of blue habitats comprise a forager’s “realized territory.” We simplify our model by studying a two habitat landscape.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, to understand differences in the population distribution of foragers, IDMs link individual decisions about where to locate in space with a populations’ distribution on a landscape [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref017">17</a>]. Two common applications of IDMs to human populations include the Ideal Free and Ideal Despotic Distributions (e.g., [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref012">12</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref022">22</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref024">24</a>]). Both models assume that individuals locate in the habitat where they maximize their fitness, at any given moment in time, relative to other habitats. The main difference between the two models is that the Ideal Free Distribution assumes that foragers have complete freedom to move between habitats, while the Ideal Despotic Distribution assumes territorial ownership. Territorial ownership refers to rules and norms that restrict entry into a habitat, making entrance more costly due to the existence of social norms or attacks [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref025">25</a>]. In the Ideal Despotic Distribution, ownership crowds individuals out of higher ranked habitats, pushing population densities up in lower ranked habitats above what one would expect from the Ideal Free Distribution [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref017">17</a>]. While comparing the Ideal Free and Despotic models help us understand how territorial ownership might change the distribution of population density on a landscape, the models do not help us understand why partitioning and territorial ownership would emerge in the first place.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Specifically, IDMs have a single long-run average solution (equilibrium). The simplicity of a single long-run average solution gives such models a high degree of generality, but also glosses over an important process. If there are identifiable cultural groups on a landscape, then IDMs actually allow them to distribute in at least two indistinguishable ways: (1) Foragers may cycle and completely mix in space and time, or (2) foragers may partition in space so that the average density over the whole space and over time is an IDM. For example, the application of the Ideal Free Distribution to explain the distribution of foragers in modern fisheries illustrates that stable and equal return rates in alternative fishing habitats can either emerge from multiple boats (individuals) cycling through habitats (mixing in space and time), or the same boats constantly fishing the same habitat (partitioning in space) [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref026">26</a>]. In principle, the same observation applies to the Ideal Despotic Distribution. Individuals who enforce ownership might partition, or they might cycle between habitats, for instance, following seasonal changes in resources, simply crowding-out less territorial individuals in each habitat that they visit. This would resemble what Mancur Olsen famously called roving bandits [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref027">27</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A classic ethnographic example of high rates of forager cycling comes from the Kalahari, where groups of families associate with resources around particular water holes, but the composition of groups within a particular territory (n!ore) fluxes as individuals and nuclear families move in and out [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref028">28</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref029">29</a>]. Often this flux occurs through reciprocal visiting. “Visitors join residents in the exploitation of resources, and the days take is unobtrusively distributed within the camp at the days end…No matter where they are from, as long as people are living together in a single camp the n!ore’s food is theirs to share” (page 333 in [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref030">30</a>]). Conversely, among the Modoc of modern day California, territorial “boundaries were precisely defined and understood by the Modoc and transgression meant war” (page 201 in [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref031">31</a>]). Families were self-sufficient and tied to particular tracks of territory, with only the sick and elderly experiencing the freedom to move across boundaries with the ease of Kalahari foragers. Either pattern, rapid cycling (!Kung) or slow cycling (Modoc), could lead to an ideal distribution in which the mean fitness (or a proxy for fitness like return rate) of individuals is equal, in the long-run, among alternative habitats.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the end, IDMs merely describe how the density of mobile resource users partitions according to immobile resource densities. IDMs do not tell us which forager is where, because such models do not label the foragers. Thus, IDMs cannot resolve cycling (rapid vs. slow). Put in terms of ideal distributions, why might the form that ideal distributions take, either rapid forager cycling or habitat partitioning (slow cycling), change over time? To answer this question, we must understand the interrelationship between population distributions in aggregate, and habitat choices at the level of individual agents.</p>

   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref019">19</a>] describes habitat (or patch) choices. The MVT illustrates that a solitary forager should stop harvesting resources within a habitat when the net rate of food intake within the habitat drops to the average for the landscape overall (in our model, a landscape of two habitats). Importantly, this insight depends on the assumption that a forager does not revisit a habitat, and that the harvest behaviors of other foragers do not affect the availability of resources (pages 251-252 in [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref019">19</a>]). However, when foragers revisit habitats and their behaviors interact through depletion, information on the state of resources among alternative habitats becomes critical for making land use decisions [

   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref032">32</a>]. Furthermore, foragers may experience non-linear, threshold changes in the quality of particular habitats [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, any given habitat on a landscape may be modeled as a forager-resource system that settles into regimes that approximate stable equilibria. In such a model, Freeman and Anderies illustrate how either increasing population density or decreasing the growth rate of resources within a single habitat makes that modeled forager-resource system vulnerable to a flip from a productive equillibrium into a poverty trap equilibrium [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref032">32</a>]. This is important. On a landscape with habitats that vary in productivity due to migrating foragers, the emergence of habitats that are either potentially productive or a poverty trap for individual foragers can have a feedback on the decision making of individuals in ways that the MVT does not investigate. Freeman and Anderies argue that when it is necessary and difficult to compute which habitats might flip into a poverty trap, this should provide a proximate incentive to adopt more exclusive ownership rules [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In short, as in the MVT, the SPDm models foragers who adjust their time within a habitat based on expected average returns from all habitats on a landscape. In addition, the SPDm describes a more realistic situation than the MVT: Foragers constantly face a tension between the benefits of moving to a new habitat (a more consistent intake of resources and information on that habitat) and the costs of allowing other foragers to enter a ceded habitat (depletion of the resources and loss of information). The form that ideal distributions of foragers takes (rapid cycling vs. partitioning), we suspect, follows from this tension inherent in movement to create larger vs. smaller realized territories.</p>

In order to achieve this goal, a forager chooses how much time to spend harvesting resources from either habitat one or habitat two, which are both affected by harvest pressure and an external driver of productivity (e.g., rainfall). The harvest of resources from habitats one and two, in turn, affects how much time foragers spend in a given habitat (i.e., whether a forager cycles between the two habitats). Choices about harvest and whether to cycle between habitats results in an output of resources, which foragers then assess against their baseline target and, again, make choices about harvesting and partitioning. This system captures three fundamental processes.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g003" href="#pone.0218440.g003">Fig 3b</a> remains constant because, in this case, the partitioned forager maintains a constant level of harvest by adjusting her level of foraging effort up and down with the productivity of the habitat.

   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref042">42</a>]; however, this comes with the opportunity cost of leaving known resources behind. We capture this tension between known and unknown resources by the equations that govern the degree of partitioning or how rapidly foragers mix in space and time (Eqs

   <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec010" href="#sec010">Model and methods</a> section). A forager changes the proportion of her time budget in a given habitat by taking into consideration her current proportion of time in a given habitat and the normalized difference in harvest per unit effort between the two possible habitats. This process captures the following heuristic: ‘Does changing my proportion of time in a habitat affect my harvest?’ If yes, then a forager is more willing to change the proportion of time they spend in a given habitat. Willingness to change, however, also depends on how well a forager knows the other habitat. If a forager spends 90% of her time in habitat one, then she does not know much about habitat two. This uncertainty reduces the willingness to change the proportion of time in habitat one. When the proportion of time in habitat one is 50%, foragers know both habitats well, and are more willing to change their location. In short, information about alternative habitats and the difference in harvest per unit effort between alternative habitats interact. When foragers cycle between habitats and completely mix in space, information remains abundant and the opportunity costs of leaving known resources low. Thus differences in harvest per unit effort more strongly influence decisions.
