 <p>In all cases, 
  <span class="italic">Î±</span> = 1. graphs a-c are phase plots that illustrate changes in the proportion of time allocated to habitats one and two over time by groups one and two for different initial conditions. In graph (a) 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> for all i = 2.5; in graph (b) 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> for all i = 4.25; in graph (c) 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> for all i = 4.5. Graphs d-f illustrate total foraging effort (
  <span class="italic">e</span>
  <sub>11</sub> + 
  <span class="italic">e</span>
  <sub>12</sub>, orange curves) and the calorie harvest (
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <sub>1</sub>-blue curve) for the forager in group one as the system converges to a perfectly mixed equilibrium, on average, of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>
  <sub>1</sub> = 
  <span class="italic">p</span>
  <sub>2</sub> = 0.5. Graphs d-f illustrate the mean hours of work a forager from group one must put-in to gain food and the consistency of hitting the calorie target (
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">j</span>
  </sub> = 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">m</span>
  </sub>) over time when foragers from both groups perfectly mix in space. The dynamics are analogous for the forager from group two.
