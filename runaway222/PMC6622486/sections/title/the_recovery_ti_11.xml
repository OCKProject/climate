 <div class="title">The recovery time (y-axis) it takes a population of foragers to consistently meet their calorie target following a perturbation to habitat one (a drought) for different levels of initial cycling (x-axis).</div>
 <p>Graph (a) population density is 1/4 of the maximum population density recorded in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g005" href="#pone.0218440.g005">Fig 5</a> for a given level of resource oscillation (
  <span class="italic">Î±</span>). Graph (b) population density is 1/2 of the maximum recorded in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g005" href="#pone.0218440.g005">Fig 5</a>. In general, the graphics illustrate that full partitioning drastically increases recovery time from a perturbation.
