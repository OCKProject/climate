 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis of the SPDm allows us to explore the question posed in the introduction: What potential mechanisms drove habitat partitioning on the TCP? A powerful way to gain insight into the processes that may lead to rapid cycling vs. partitioned populations of foragers is to construct a dynamic ecological model of hunter-gatherer habitat use that we call the SPDm. With the SPDm, we can study the feedback between decisions about how much time to spend in a given habitat and how many habitats to use. Similarly, we modify the assumptions, typical of IDMs and the MVT, that foragers have complete information on the resources among alternative habitats on a landscape and that mean resource abundance is stable over time. These modifications move the SPDm closer to the reality that forgers face without attempting to replicate all of the decisions that real foragers face in particular environments. Thus, the SPDm, though more complex than IDMs and the MVT, retains some generality.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The key result of our analysis is the existence of a variance reduction, safe-operating space tradeoff. This tradeoff is a special type of tradeoff under the more general umbrella of robustness-fragility tradeoffs. This type of tradeoff emerges from individual decisions about the use of habitats and the responses of individuals to changes in resource density. Forager cycling between habitats stabilizes the intake of calories for individuals in the short-run, but the very success of this adaptation may lead to population growth and the emergence of vulnerability to climate change and internal social dynamics in the longer-run (a reduction in safe-operating space). Robustness-fragility tradeoffs commonly occur in social-ecological systems [

  <a rid="pone.0218440.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref049">49</a>], and, we argue, such tradeoffs are under-appreciated mechanisms that drive social change. Robustness-fragility tradeoffs do not determine the form of social change, but set the preconditions for shifts in strategies for interacting with the environment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, our analysis illustrates that the severity of seasonality and population density interact on smaller time-scales. When population density is low, foragers may partition or cycle between habitats. The two strategies are equivalent (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g004" href="#pone.0218440.g004">4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g005" href="#pone.0218440.g005">5</a>), if the goal is to maintain a stable supply of calories. Of course, in a low population density environment other incentives beyond a consistent supply of resources at a seasonal time-scale exist to cycle, like finding mates. Similarly, even in aseasonal environments, climate perturbations, like droughts that occur at decade frequencies, generate an incentive to cycle for individuals (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g006" href="#pone.0218440.g006">Fig 6</a>). The Texas Coastal Plain is a temperate environment with a moderate degree of seasonality. Thus, we would expect, at low densities, climate variation on seasonal and decade scales to favor high cycling (lots of visitation, shifting of group residence and so forth). However, if population density were to increase relative to resources at a landscape level (multiple habitats), forager cycling would insure a consistent diet, but would also cause the safe-operating space of the whole system to decline.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g009" href="#pone.0218440.g009">Fig 9</a> summarizes a proposed causal process for the TCP. Population (N) and Climate (C) affect the productivity of resources (P). Foragers apply knowledge to harvest resources and generate a harvest (H) of calories. Harvest feeds back to population, mediated by the strategy (S) used by foragers to monitor the flow of foragers on a landscape (open access, free to cycle vs. ownership, higher cost to cycle). In this loop, forager cycling leads to consistent harvests, in spite of climate shocks, which leads to population growth and, in turn, growth affects productivity and leads to the variance reduction, safe-operating space tradeoff. Two mechanisms might lead to partitioning. The first is descent into Malthusian Purgatory (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7c</a>). In this case, population would overshoot carrying capacity and the system of land use would bifurcate into one in which foragers work 12 hours per day wherever they happen to locate. No incentive exists to move. As noted earlier, there would also be very little incentive to adopt territoriality in this situation as it would mean a lot of effort just to maintain a potentially less negative level of fitness. Fitness would still be negative, however. Population migration and long-term depression should follow such a Malthusian overshoot.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, climate variation may generate a ‘signal’ to individual foragers [
  <a rid="pone.0218440.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref032">32</a>] that they should adapt to stabilize their flow of resources. One form of adaption is territorial ownership, which would lead to habitat partitioning. The role of information in moderating decisions about the proportion of time to spend in any given habitat underlies this mechanism. Recall, rapid cycling creates a more consistent intake of calories and raises the carrying capacity of human foragers on a landscape (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g003" href="#pone.0218440.g003">3</a> &amp; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g005" href="#pone.0218440.g005">5</a>), in part through the acquisition of information that makes accessing resources more efficient. Indeed, if foragers were to engage in the exchange of goods and form networks on top of local kin based relationships, this would generate even more return from cycling. Knowledge infrastructure would generate ever more efficient flows of information and, at least initially, as population density increased foraging would become more efficient [
  <a rid="pone.0218440.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref050">50</a>]. Thus, incentives en-train rapid cycling in foraging economies, even among populations living in aseasonal environments and undergoing increases in population density. The trick to understanding the emergence of partitioning is understanding that even though a rapid cycling strategy is resistant to increases in population density, the safe-operating space of the whole system declines.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A decline in safe-operating space proves a paradox. Reductions in the safe-operating space set foragers up for cascades of resource failure. However, such a process also provides a potential Boserupian escape from Malthusian overshoot. In terms of the TCP, one might imagine a spurt of sea-level rise along the coast that inundates estuaries with salt water. This would depress productivity for a few years as species adjust their ranges and so on, stimulating foragers to aggregate among inland habitats (e.g., Region 1 on 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">Fig 7</a>). At low population density, this strategy works. However, as the system approaches carrying capacity and the safe-operating space declines, this behavior would generate resource short-falls that oscillate over time generating a successful year, bad year, successful year, etc. sequence. This very pattern provides a signal that the knowledge infrastructure so integral to cycling between habitats is worthless. The incentive thus arises for foragers to shift their social norms of land use, generating partitioning in an emergent way on the landscape. Crucially, in this scenario the resource system still has enough biomass capital relative to population size that, if a bumper year of productivity hits, the system could transition back into one in which individual foragers consistently meet their calorie target. The capacity exists for foragers to learn and adjust their strategies to reduce the chances that they experience a sequence of resource shortfalls again.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above scenario suggests a set of potential predictions in archaeological contexts.</p>
 <div list-type="order" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>We should expect population regime changes on the TCP or in any environment in which hunter-gatherers shift to a partitioned land use system. The term regime change here has a specific meaning. It means that the parameters that control a human population (e.g., r and K in the logistic model), should display large, sudden changes in a time-series. One way to begin to evaluate this prediction is to analyze large radiocarbon data sets and evaluate the null hypothesis that the statistical distribution of radiocarbon is constant over time. If a demographic system experiences a regime change, the amount of radiocarbon should display multiple means. This would be consistent with the scenario above that partitioning emerges quickly as foragers adopt territoriality and more intensive subsistence practices as a package, leading to a punctuated increase in mean population density on the landscape.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Coincident with a regime shift in the radiocarbon record, we should observe a change from passive, pervasive exchange systems to spatially bounded reciprocal exchange between distinct cemetery populations. As noted in the introduction, the TCP has a 7,500 year burial record. We should observe early on in that record, a spatially unrestricted exchange as individuals cycle on a landscape and develop wide ranging connections. However, when partitioning emerges, the movements of foragers should be much more tightly bound in space to areas in which resources negatively correlate in time (when one resource is up, the other is down), and reciprocity should be intensive as territorial boundaries have become more rigidly enforced, and reciprocal gifting is a key way to gain entry across boundaries. To evaluate this idea, we would need a data set of grave goods associated with individuals and tight temporal control over those individuals. Similarly, if we were to track gene flow via aDNA, we might expect to see a drop in genetic diversity as regional exchange systems become more tightly bound in space (if mates and status/wealth items follow similar flows).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Coincident with the above patterns, we should see an increase in the 
    <span class="sup">13</span>C and 
    <span class="sup">15</span>N bone isotope diversity displayed among individuals. High cycling means more mixing of individuals in space, and thus across resource zones. This should lead to individuals that, over time, have more similar looking diet profiles in their isotopic signatures. Conversely, partitioning (low cycling) means that individuals more spatially restrict their use of resources. In the scenario above, individuals restrict to particular habitats that they maintain more exclusive control over and, thus, their diet should reflect more the isotopic signatures of the local ecology that they exploit more often. To evaluate this, we would need 
    <span class="sup">13</span>C and 
    <span class="sup">15</span>N bone isotope data on a large number of individuals over the full 7,500 year period of burials on the TCP. Coincident with a demographic regime shift noted above and more spatially defined grave goods exchange, we should see a spike in the diversity of isotopic signatures among individuals. Finally, strontium isotope studies (
    <span class="sup">87</span>Sr/
    <span class="sup">86</span>Sr) on human teeth have potential for evaluating expectations from the model, assuming regions with contrasting levels of bioavailable strontium isotopes are used. During periods of more rapid cycling, samples from a number of mortuary sites from different regions should show greater similarity among samples and should have greater internal variability as individuals move among regions. As partitioning emerges, then variability within a sample should decline and greater differences among samples should be detectable.
