 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we have proposed an ecological theory of mobile hunter-gatherer population distribution, and made this theory operational with a spatial population distribution model (SPDm) built to answer a specific question: What mechanisms might drive the evolution of habitat partitioning? The Marginal Value Theorem and Ideal Distribution Models serve as a starting points for our investigation. These models drawn form Foraging Theory investigate, separately, crucial processes that affect hunter-gatherer land use and degree of partitioning. The SPDm adds a layer of realism to these general models by investigating the relationship between habitat choice and time within a habitat as inseparable from the response of resources to external climate drivers and the harvest behavior of other individuals on a landscape. We argue that major changes in the distributions of hunter-gatherers relate to the efficacy of different strategies for maintaining a consistent supply of resources. Cycling among habitats and social groups is a form of cooperation dependent upon building diverse social networks and sharing information. A rapid forager cycling equilibrium is highly resistant to increases in population density, and should only change as foragers find the flow of information about the quality of habitats on a landscape to degrade and must rely more on their own and cooperative labor in more local contexts to maintain a consistent flow of resources.</p>

   <p>Rigorously distinguish between population overshoot and collapse vs. a system that experiences a disruption from crossing a safe-operating space boundary, but the individuals still have the capacity to adapt and find new strategies that fundamentally change the system. A true Malthusian system would not experience a regime shift to a higher carrying capacity system, rather the functional relationships between variables would not change. Conversely, our argument for territoriality would imply a fundamental regime shift in the relationship between population growth, carrying capacity and land use. Detecting regime shifts in empirical time-series is a growing area of research and a key to distinguishing between these two scenarios [

   <p>A second area of research concerns middle range research on the potential for multiple regimes among ethnographically recorded hunter-gatherers [
    <a rid="pone.0218440.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref052">52</a>]. We should observe fundamentally different relationships between land use and population among ethnographically documented hunter-gatherers due to partitioning generated by the adoption of territorial norms. The fundamental change in ownership norms should change the way that information moderates land use.

   <p>We have only begun to explore the potential of the SPDm as a general framework for understating the use of space by foraging populations over time. For example, we could investigate the effects of an increasingly patchy environment on the dynamics of the model. This is easily done with the current model by increasing the travel costs between patches. This is just one example of a rich number of dynamics that may be explored with the model.</p>
