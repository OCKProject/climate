 <p>Equations defined in the

The feedback loop iterates as individuals assess whether the goal is met. Foragers adjust their effort and spatial partitioning, which affects biophysical dynamics and produces an output (harvest). Foragers then measure (do I feel hungry) and compare the harvest with their goal in the next time period.
