  <a rid="pone.0218440.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref055">55</a>], which is specialty software for analyzing non-linear dynamic systems models, and report our results at two different time scales. The smaller-time scale illustrates the mechanisms that drive the behavior of the model and subtle tradeoffs associated with rapid cycling through multiple habitats vs. habitat partitioning. The larger time-scale illustrates the conditions under which rapid cycling and habitat partitioning should emerge from individual decisions about how to best maintain a consistent supply of food in a variable environment. Our analysis of the larger-time scale focuses on two different perturbations that affect foraging economies: (1) declines in the availability of resources due to, for instance, a dry period, and (2) the process of periodic aggregations of foragers for important ceremonies or due to a climate perturbation. We used XPPAUT to run simulations and generate the phase plots illustrated in Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g007" href="#pone.0218440.g007">7</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218440.g008" href="#pone.0218440.g008">8</a>. We used R to make simple graphs of the relationship between model parameters and simulated outcomes.
