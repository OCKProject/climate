  <div class="title">Illustration of how the proportion of time in a habitat moderates the effect of normalized differences in harvest per unit effort upon the change in proportion of time devoted by the group one forager to habitat one.</div>
  <p>In this case, harvest per unit effort is higher in habitat two than habitat one at two constant levels: 0.01 (orange dots) and 0.02 (blue triangles). Thus, the group one forager decreases the proportion of time spent in habitat one (y-axis), and this is moderated by the current balance of time spent in habitat one (x-axis). As the proportion of time spent in habitat one decreases, the forager discounts the potential value of resources in habitat two less and adjusts her balance of time away from habitat one more strongly.</p>
