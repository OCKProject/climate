  <p>(a) Hierarchy of foraging decisions in space [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref020">20</a>]. The far left column represents patch choices. Patch choices occur daily or weekly as foragers radiate out from base camps to access the smallest patch blocks. Habitat choices occur monthly-to-annually as foragers choose between the moderate sized blocks, and, at the landscape scale, foragers make decisions about their home-ranges a few times over decades by choosing between blocks of landscape (e.g., pages 380–383 in [
   <a rid="pone.0218440.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218440.ref021">21</a>]). (b) Habitats that foragers may use. Foragers must choose where to reside (habitat), how much time to spend in a given habitat (harvest) and which set of habitats to use (migrate). These decisions interact with each other by affecting resources and the decisions of other foragers. The set of blue habitats comprise a forager’s “realized territory.” We simplify our model by studying a two habitat landscape.
