 <p id="p0165" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study obtained a wide inventory of on-farm adaptation strategies peculiar to the savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana. These strategies reported by smallholder farmers can be exported and applied elsewhere by households in Ghana and SSA at large. It must however be noted that, these adaptation strategies are implemented at different times.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Planting late or early to avoid drought</div>
  <p id="p0170" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study revealed that an overwhelming majority of smallholder farmers alter their planting schedule in reaction to the late start of precipitation for the past three (3) decades. Approximately 93.3% and 69.3% of smallholder households in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively indicated they altered their sowing period as a strategy to manage the late arrival of the rains. A discussant at an FGD corroborated that, “
   <span class="italic">the planting season used to start in March/April four decades ago, but now farmers have to postpone planting until May/June since onset of the rainfall pattern is now late and has become highly variable</span>”. Another participant indicated that “
   <span class="italic">the rainy season has become short (starts late and stops early), as a result of the late start of the rainfall regime, we constantly alter our planting dates (sometimes we plant late, other times, we plant early) to avoid droughts</span>”. This is an indication that the onset of the rains, which decides or regulates the beginning of the farming season has changed. The growing season, which used to begin in March/April in the 1940s through to the 1970s has changed since 1980s/1990s to late May and early June and more recently (2014/2015) from late June to early July. Farmers, due to uncertainties, now plant their crops late to avoid droughts which wither crops and high temperature which kills seedlings.

  <p id="p0175" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Smallholder farmers have resorted to the use of drought tolerant or resistant crop varieties as one of the chief adaptation strategies to ameliorate the negative effects of climate and ecological change (particular droughts) on their livelihoods. The study revealed that 76% and 59.3% of smallholder farmers in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively use crop varieties that can resist droughts and also matures early. Examples of some of these crops in the study area include maize, groundnut, and cowpea. An interviewee asserted that “
   <span class="italic">these crops (maize, groundnut and cowpea) require a smaller number of moisture days (65–90) to mature, measured against indigenous crop varieties such as guinea corn, late millet which require between 125-145 moisture days to mature</span>”. The use of drought tolerant crops has been indicated as one of the main recommended adaptation strategies in food systems (
   <a rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib17">Campbell et al., 2011</a>). An official of MoFA explained that, “
   <span class="italic">the crops that mature early are also drought resistant because during their flowering which requires adequate moisture comes early enough such that by the time droughts set in, the crops would have matured fully</span>”. This is very significant in decreasing climate and ecological change risks. The crops that mature early are also vital in supporting or augmenting household food shortfalls especially during the stress periods. This corroborates (
   <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">Antwi-Agyei et al., 2014</a>) who suggest that households respond to climatic and non-climatic drivers through the adoption of crop varieties that matures early and requires less moisture.

  <p id="p0180" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study discovered that, smallholder farmers in the Sudan and Guinea Savanna ecological zone of Ghana are progressively employing or planting various crops at different times as an adaptation strategy to climate and ecological change in order to increase their yields and minimize the risk of total crop failure. The survey disclosed that, 89.3% and 90.6% of smallholder farmers in Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively testified to employing crop diversification as an adaptation strategy to reduce the negative effects of climate and ecological change on their livelihoods. Experts at the office of the District Department of Agriculture noted that, “
   <span class="italic">diverse crops have distinct biological dynamics and therefore their susceptibility to ecological change; erratic rainfall and high temperature vary considerably”</span>. A key informant explained that, “
   <span class="italic">as a way of distributing our risks in times of uncertainties, we (farmers) plant different crops at different times</span>”. An FGD participant noted “
   <span class="italic">we plant various crops at different times because, when one particular crop fails, we (farmer/household) will be compensated by the yield from the other crops hence helps us avoid total crop failure</span>”. Another FGD participant reiterated that, “
   <span class="italic">planting more than one crop on the same parcel of land grants some form of insurance for the household against crop failure”</span>. Discovery by 
   <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">Bryan et al. (2013)</a> which suggests that households are constantly employing crop diversification as an adaptation strategy to climate change, confirms this study.

  <p id="p0185" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the key adaptation strategies employed by smallholder farmers which have been passed on from the ancestors (old generation) and is now being modified was the use of appropriate indigenous agronomic practices and knowledge. About 78.7% and 56% of smallholder farmers in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities, respectively, adopted a range of appropriate indigenous agronomic practice which has been developed by local knowledge. The appropriate agronomic practices used by households include manuring, composting, organic manure application, crop residue management and the use of animal droppings. In managing post-harvest loss, smallholder farmers use plant extract (
   <span class="italic">dabokoka</span>) in the storage and preservation of grains, others use groundnut shell to control striger and other hygienic practices to prevent animal diseases. Again, some farmers use shea-butter residue (molded and dried) as fuel for cooking and also for plastering walls to prevent cracks and/or collapsing of buildings and reptiles from entering the premises of the house. Households also reported using pito residue for fishing and feeding animals such as pigs.

  <p id="p0190" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tree planting and agro-forestry is widely recognized as one of the adaptation strategies that can potentially mitigate climate change in the long-term. An official of the Forestry Commission indicated that, “
   <span class="italic">tree planting has the ability to help reduce high temperature, increase rainfall amounts, provide farmers with animal feed and improve microorganism on the farm</span>”. About 29% and 24% of smallholder farmers in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively indicated they have planted trees on their farms in the past and this assisted them to get fruits to eat, fuel wood and feed for their animals. These findings confirm previous studies by (

   <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">Antwi-Agyei, 2012</a>) that suggest tree planting provides opportunity for low-income farmers to enhance their livelihoods activities by selling the wood products as small timbers, medicines and food.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dry season gardening and irrigation</div>
  <p id="p0195" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rain water harvesting techniques (ponds and dugouts) and large-scale irrigation services are progressively being used by smallholder farmers in the Sudan and Guinea Savanna Ecological Zone as a long-term planned adaptation strategy to climate and ecological change risks. Many farmers are gradually engaged in dry season vegetable cultivation (particularly tomatoes) during the off-season. Approximately 42% and 6% of households in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively reported practicing dry season farming. The Gowrie Kunkua community is located close to the Vea irrigation dam, approximately, 72 % of smallholder farmers have been allocated land at the irrigation site for farming by ICOUR. Although it has been widely agreed that the use of irrigation facilities can significantly reduce food and livelihood insecurity caused by crop failure (due to droughts), an interviewee indicated that, “
   <span class="italic">the Vea irrigation facility has become obsolete or unused in recent times. The canals feeding water to the irrigated farms are currently damaged; hence water cannot pass through to the farms</span>”. FG discussant asserted that, “
   <span class="italic">the inability of ICOUR (government) to repair the Vea irrigation facility has hindered our ability to cultivate vegetables in the dry season hence our current vulnerability (food and livelihood insecurity) to climate and ecological change</span>”. As a result of this current challenge, farm households in the Gowrie Kunkua community with assistance from an NGO (e.g. Sustainable Family Agricultural and Education Support Program-SUFAEP), in the form of inputs (seeds, chemicals, fertilizer, water pump, donkey cart) and training (water harvesting techniques, nursing, planting, weeding, soil conservation, pest and disease control etc.), have helped farmers to cultivate vegetables in the dry season. According to an interviewee, “
   <span class="italic">using irrigation (Vea irrigation facility) as a way of managing with drought (food shortfalls) yielded significant benefits from the 1960s to early 2000 when the dam was effectively operational, in recent times, farming is limited to only one rainy season (June–October) since the irrigation facility is obsolete</span>”. The vital importance of dry season farming as a planned adaptation strategy was reiterated by a key informant that, “
   <span class="italic">cultivating vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, and other leafy vegetables in the dry season is very critical in enhancing my livelihood, the income I earn from the sale of produce (vegetables) is used to support my children's health and education, buy food and it also prevents any member of my household from migrating to the cities (Southern Ghana) for work</span>”. Dry season farming is a vital adaptation strategy to climate and ecological change. This assertion is supported by (
   <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">Antwi-Agyei, 2012</a>) that farm households rely greatly on irrigation to cope with climate change, especially during the dry season when there are no farming activities.
