 <p id="p0010" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate variability is now acclaimed as one of the most arduous and complicated problem confronting the globe (
  <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">IPCC, 2014</a>). The risk factors are very high and the impacts would raise considerably the developmental impediments of safeguarding livelihood security and poverty eradication in most Sub-Saharan African (SSA) nations in general (
  <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">IPCC, 2014</a>) and Northern Ghana in particular (
  <a rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib24">Dumenu and Obeng, 2016</a>). Climate and ecological change have intensified and consequently altered life and livelihood-sustaining natural systems, leading to socio-cultural, economic and environmental disruptions (
  <a rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib61">Thornton et al., 2014</a>). Current climate change projections by climate experts indicate progressively severe negative impacts on many countries across the world. However, the most severe impacts are affecting the world's poorest countries with the weakest capacity to adapt (
  <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">IPCC, 2014</a>).

 <p id="p0015" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The agriculture sector in Ghana employs about 57% of the population and it is the major source of income for the majority of low-income Ghanaian families' most especially rural households (
  <a rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib30">GSS, 2014</a>). Not all, the sector also contributes appreciably to the foreign exchange earnings of the country and enhance development by means of providing raw materials to local industries (
  <a rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib41">MOFA, 2007</a>). Although agriculture contributes significantly to the country's GDP, the sector is exposed to climate change due to its reliance on rain-fed cultivation and as such variations in the climate are notably projected to lower agricultural productivity in the less developed countries (
  <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">Antwi-Agyei, 2012</a>). Since the volume and pattern of rainfall determine, to a large extent, agricultural productivity (
  <a rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib31">Haile, 2005</a>), crop yields in Ghana are estimated to reduce by 7% by 2020 due to projected decline in rainfall and upsurge in temperature (
  <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">Antwi-Agyei et al., 2014</a>). Food and livelihood security will be severely affected (
  <a rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib25">EPA, 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib66">Yaro, 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">Antwi-Agyei et al., 2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="p0020" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the past 30 years, Ghana has encountered increasing prevalence of extreme events such as droughts, floods and bush fires which are linked to climate change (
  <a rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib66">Yaro, 2010</a>) and these events have often resulted in severe food and livelihood insecurity (
  <a rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib41">MOFA, 2007</a>). Ghana suffered droughts in 1968–73, 1982–84, 1990–1992, but the drought of 1983/84 is among the most severe droughts in the country's history as it triggered major hydrological imbalances that affected crop production throughout the country (
  <a rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib66">Yaro, 2010</a>). Particularly, 
  <a rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib46">Ofori-Sarpong (1986)</a> observed a great decline in cereal production as a result of the major drought in 1983 that led to extensive food and livelihood insecurity.

 <p id="p0025" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation to climate change is recognized as pressing and necessary (
  <a rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib44">Nyantakyi-Frimpong and Bezner-Kerr, 2015</a>). The strong imperative to ascertain a suitable adaptation pathway belies the difficulty of describing what adaptation is, who should carry out adaptations, who should benefit from the adaptation, and what that adaptation should be (
  <a rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib1">Adger et al., 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">Conway, 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib49">Pelling, 2011</a>). Livelihood adaptation to climate and ecological change operates in the context of numerous uncertainties and unknowns: we don't know precisely what the impact of ecological and climate change at the local level is or will be, or how stresses associated with it will overlap with other dynamic processes operating across multiple scales (
  <a rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib63">Watson et al., 2016</a>). In the midst of these complications and uncertainties, localized case studies have a lot to offer through their examination of “the lived experiences” of resource dependent smallholder farmers and communities in the less developed countries in coping and adapting to climate and ecological change (
  <a rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib10">Berrang-Ford et al., 2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="p0030" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study is not the first wave of interest in climate change adaptation in Ghana. Most of the studies conducted so far have tried to identify general patterns of coping rather than differentiating between agro-ecological zones, villages and types of households (
  <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Brockhaus et al., 2012</a>). For example, 
  <a rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib66">Yaro (2010)</a>, 
  <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">Antwi-Agyei (2012)</a>, 
  <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">Antwi-Agyei et al. (2014)</a> have identified diverse adaptation approaches which are very general and with larger spatial recommendation domain. Due to variations and diversities in the agro-ecological zones, adaptation strategies are peculiar to localities and ecological zones and usually centers on the specific climatic characteristics of the area. This paper, however, is different in that, households' adaptation measures are differentiated based on agro-ecology. The paper makes significant contribution to the body of literature on the possible role of adaptation by farmers in Ghana particularly the fragile savannah ecological zone (see 
  <a rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib54">Schipper and Burton, 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">Antwi-Agyei et al., 2014</a>;

  <a rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib5">Antwi-Agyei et al., 2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="p0035" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study explored smallholder farmers' responses to climate and ecological change effects on their livelihood activities that have emerged since the mid-1980s within the savanna agro ecological zone of Northern Ghana using an ethnographic approach.</p>
