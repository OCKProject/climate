 <p id="p0160" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Smallholder farmers' adaptation strategies used to manage ecological and climate changes (particularly meteorological droughts, socio-economic droughts, poor soil fertility and food shortfalls) in the savanna agro ecological zones of Ghana are categorized generally into 
  <span class="italic">on-farm</span> adaptation strategies and 
  <span class="italic">off-farm</span> adaptation strategies. On-farm adaptation strategies comprise a chain of practices or strategies carried out by agricultural dependent smallholder farmers on their farm intended to offset the negative effects of ecological and climate change/variability particularly droughts. 
  <span class="italic">Off-farm</span> adaptation strategies comprise strategies or actions that smallholder farmers carry out which are outside the farm, intended to moderate their vulnerability to negative effects of climate and ecological change/variability such as food/livelihood insecurity.
