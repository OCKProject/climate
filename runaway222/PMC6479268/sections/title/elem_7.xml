  <p id="p0125" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study revealed diverse strategies for coping and adapting to ecological and climate changes (declining soil fertility, degrading forests and droughts) peculiar to the savanna agro ecological zones of Ghana. Coping measures were employed by smallholder farmers when confronted with a climate or ecological threat. Smallholder farmers reported discarding these reactive measures when the threat is over. 
   <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> shows that smallholder farmers at the micro-level employ several coping, on-farm and off-adaptation strategies. Key coping measures identified include, but not limited to, relying on family and friends, receiving assistances from government, income from off-farm jobs, harvesting wild fruits and game, selling household assets and buying of food. The results also revealed vital on-farm adaptation strategies such as changing planting times, planting drought tolerant crops, crop diversification, use of indigenous knowledge in agronomic practices and dry season cultivation (irrigation). Other important adaptation strategies (off-farm) reported include: migration, reducing their food consumption and changing diets. These coping and adaptation strategies have been documented by other studies (e.g.

  <p id="p0130" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown in 
   <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>, smallholder farmers sold their assets (livestock and/or poultry) to cope with food shortfalls as indicated by 24.6% and 26.6% of respondents in Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively. Whenever households sell the livestock/poultry and other assets, they buy food from the market to supplement the food shortage. All respondents who indicated selling their livestock/poultry and other assets bought food (grains and cereals) to cope with the food shortfall. It was however realized that, 80% of smallholder farmers that sold their key productive assets failed to rebuild (restock) the assets after the catastrophe (drought, food shortfall) had halted. Continuous selling of productive assets such as livestock, poultry and land is a source of dwindling tangible assets and endangers households to chronic livelihood and food insecurity. An interviewee indicated that, “
   <span class="italic">the erratic rainfall regime which has resulted in food shortfalls exhausted (poor and vulnerable) smallholder farmers coping strategies making them fall back on the consumption of seed and sale of key assets (farm implements, land, livestock/poultry) for their survival</span>”. These events have significantly reduced the coping ability (or adaptive capacity) of smallholder farmers and endangered future food production and availability. For this reason, majority of smallholder farmers (92%), believe that severe food and livelihood insecurity will result from depletion of assets through continuous use of coping strategies.
  </p>
  <p id="p0135" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Employing appropriate agronomic practices such as depending on wells and dugouts for cultivating vegetables (and also for animals to drink), harvesting immature food crops and performing traditional cultural sacrifices (to reverse the calamity e.g. drought) were reported by 15.2% and 7.4% of smallholder farmers in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively during this study. The use of agronomic practices as coping measures was also documented by (
   <a rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib23">Dovie, 2010</a>), he observed that, farmers plant early, use drought tolerant crops and revive old traditions as the main coping strategies of rural farmers.
  </p>
  <p id="p0140" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">About 0.4% and 26.6% of smallholder farmers in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively, reported relying on forestry products, wild fruits and wildlife as coping measures to ecological and climate change. The great disparity between Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre reliance on wild/forestry products is due to the fact that, the Soe Kabre community is located very close to a forest, hence they have access to a whole range of forest products/wild fruits in contrast to the Gowrie Kunkua community which is located in between two urban towns without forest.</p>
  <p id="p0145" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approximately 21.9% and 5.4% of smallholder farmers in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively, reported diversifying their livelihoods into craftsmanship viz a viz weaving baskets/hats, smocks and paid non-farm jobs viz tailoring, masonry, etc. The results indicate that, over 60% of smallholder farmers in the savanna ecological zone undertake several non-arable farming livelihood activities in reaction to ecological/climate change (particularly droughts). An interviewee asserted that, “
   <span class="italic">livelihood diversification is practiced more at the moment than three (3) decades ago; it enables us to buy food for our families during the dry season</span>”. A further scrutiny of livelihood diversification revealed that, off-farm livelihood activities such as petty trade, shea nut picking and butter processing, pito brewing and malt processing and basket and hat weaving are mainly female livelihood activities. Male non-farm livelihood activities were selling livestock and poultry, stone quarrying, sand mining, fishing, masonry, carpentry, motor/bicycle fitting/repairs among others. Livelihood activities such as weaving, charcoal production and petty trade were practiced by both men and women. These findings are in tandem with (

  </p>
  <p id="p0150" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another 3.1% and 4.9% of households in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively reported depending on support from family and friends. In total, approximately, 8% of smallholder farmers in this study indicated they have sought assistance or depended on their family and/or friends for the past five (5) years (2011–2015) as a coping strategy to climate/ecological change and its negative effects on their livelihood activities. An interviewee asserted that, “
   <span class="italic">Smallholder farmers depend on social capital (alliances and networking) including Community Based Organizations, Susu/savings association, religious associations etc that offer support to its members in the form of labor on farms, food, credits and animals</span>”. More households (40%) in the Gowrie Kunkua belonged to social networks than the Soe Kabre community (36%).
  </p>
  <p id="p0155" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Smallholder farmers do not only receive assistance from family/friends but also government and Non-governmental organizations. Approximately, 10.2% of smallholder farmers in the Gowrie Kunkua community and 6.9% of households in the Soe Kabre community reported receiving remittance from both government and non-government social projects in the form of Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) such as the Ghana Social Opportunity Project (GSOP), the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty Program (LEAP) as well as other Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) or social intervention programs. In total, 34.7% of smallholder farmers in this study confirmed that they have received assistance from government and NGOs at least once in the last five (5) years (2010–2015).</p>

   <p id="p0170" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study revealed that an overwhelming majority of smallholder farmers alter their planting schedule in reaction to the late start of precipitation for the past three (3) decades. Approximately 93.3% and 69.3% of smallholder households in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively indicated they altered their sowing period as a strategy to manage the late arrival of the rains. A discussant at an FGD corroborated that, “
    <span class="italic">the planting season used to start in March/April four decades ago, but now farmers have to postpone planting until May/June since onset of the rainfall pattern is now late and has become highly variable</span>”. Another participant indicated that “
    <span class="italic">the rainy season has become short (starts late and stops early), as a result of the late start of the rainfall regime, we constantly alter our planting dates (sometimes we plant late, other times, we plant early) to avoid droughts</span>”. This is an indication that the onset of the rains, which decides or regulates the beginning of the farming season has changed. The growing season, which used to begin in March/April in the 1940s through to the 1970s has changed since 1980s/1990s to late May and early June and more recently (2014/2015) from late June to early July. Farmers, due to uncertainties, now plant their crops late to avoid droughts which wither crops and high temperature which kills seedlings.

   <p id="p0175" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Smallholder farmers have resorted to the use of drought tolerant or resistant crop varieties as one of the chief adaptation strategies to ameliorate the negative effects of climate and ecological change (particular droughts) on their livelihoods. The study revealed that 76% and 59.3% of smallholder farmers in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively use crop varieties that can resist droughts and also matures early. Examples of some of these crops in the study area include maize, groundnut, and cowpea. An interviewee asserted that “
    <span class="italic">these crops (maize, groundnut and cowpea) require a smaller number of moisture days (65–90) to mature, measured against indigenous crop varieties such as guinea corn, late millet which require between 125-145 moisture days to mature</span>”. The use of drought tolerant crops has been indicated as one of the main recommended adaptation strategies in food systems (
    <a rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib17">Campbell et al., 2011</a>). An official of MoFA explained that, “
    <span class="italic">the crops that mature early are also drought resistant because during their flowering which requires adequate moisture comes early enough such that by the time droughts set in, the crops would have matured fully</span>”. This is very significant in decreasing climate and ecological change risks. The crops that mature early are also vital in supporting or augmenting household food shortfalls especially during the stress periods. This corroborates (
    <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">Antwi-Agyei et al., 2014</a>) who suggest that households respond to climatic and non-climatic drivers through the adoption of crop varieties that matures early and requires less moisture.

   <p id="p0180" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study discovered that, smallholder farmers in the Sudan and Guinea Savanna ecological zone of Ghana are progressively employing or planting various crops at different times as an adaptation strategy to climate and ecological change in order to increase their yields and minimize the risk of total crop failure. The survey disclosed that, 89.3% and 90.6% of smallholder farmers in Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively testified to employing crop diversification as an adaptation strategy to reduce the negative effects of climate and ecological change on their livelihoods. Experts at the office of the District Department of Agriculture noted that, “
    <span class="italic">diverse crops have distinct biological dynamics and therefore their susceptibility to ecological change; erratic rainfall and high temperature vary considerably”</span>. A key informant explained that, “
    <span class="italic">as a way of distributing our risks in times of uncertainties, we (farmers) plant different crops at different times</span>”. An FGD participant noted “
    <span class="italic">we plant various crops at different times because, when one particular crop fails, we (farmer/household) will be compensated by the yield from the other crops hence helps us avoid total crop failure</span>”. Another FGD participant reiterated that, “
    <span class="italic">planting more than one crop on the same parcel of land grants some form of insurance for the household against crop failure”</span>. Discovery by 
    <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">Bryan et al. (2013)</a> which suggests that households are constantly employing crop diversification as an adaptation strategy to climate change, confirms this study.

   <p id="p0185" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the key adaptation strategies employed by smallholder farmers which have been passed on from the ancestors (old generation) and is now being modified was the use of appropriate indigenous agronomic practices and knowledge. About 78.7% and 56% of smallholder farmers in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities, respectively, adopted a range of appropriate indigenous agronomic practice which has been developed by local knowledge. The appropriate agronomic practices used by households include manuring, composting, organic manure application, crop residue management and the use of animal droppings. In managing post-harvest loss, smallholder farmers use plant extract (
    <span class="italic">dabokoka</span>) in the storage and preservation of grains, others use groundnut shell to control striger and other hygienic practices to prevent animal diseases. Again, some farmers use shea-butter residue (molded and dried) as fuel for cooking and also for plastering walls to prevent cracks and/or collapsing of buildings and reptiles from entering the premises of the house. Households also reported using pito residue for fishing and feeding animals such as pigs.

   <p id="p0190" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tree planting and agro-forestry is widely recognized as one of the adaptation strategies that can potentially mitigate climate change in the long-term. An official of the Forestry Commission indicated that, “
    <span class="italic">tree planting has the ability to help reduce high temperature, increase rainfall amounts, provide farmers with animal feed and improve microorganism on the farm</span>”. About 29% and 24% of smallholder farmers in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively indicated they have planted trees on their farms in the past and this assisted them to get fruits to eat, fuel wood and feed for their animals. These findings confirm previous studies by (

   <p id="p0195" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rain water harvesting techniques (ponds and dugouts) and large-scale irrigation services are progressively being used by smallholder farmers in the Sudan and Guinea Savanna Ecological Zone as a long-term planned adaptation strategy to climate and ecological change risks. Many farmers are gradually engaged in dry season vegetable cultivation (particularly tomatoes) during the off-season. Approximately 42% and 6% of households in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively reported practicing dry season farming. The Gowrie Kunkua community is located close to the Vea irrigation dam, approximately, 72 % of smallholder farmers have been allocated land at the irrigation site for farming by ICOUR. Although it has been widely agreed that the use of irrigation facilities can significantly reduce food and livelihood insecurity caused by crop failure (due to droughts), an interviewee indicated that, “
    <span class="italic">the Vea irrigation facility has become obsolete or unused in recent times. The canals feeding water to the irrigated farms are currently damaged; hence water cannot pass through to the farms</span>”. FG discussant asserted that, “
    <span class="italic">the inability of ICOUR (government) to repair the Vea irrigation facility has hindered our ability to cultivate vegetables in the dry season hence our current vulnerability (food and livelihood insecurity) to climate and ecological change</span>”. As a result of this current challenge, farm households in the Gowrie Kunkua community with assistance from an NGO (e.g. Sustainable Family Agricultural and Education Support Program-SUFAEP), in the form of inputs (seeds, chemicals, fertilizer, water pump, donkey cart) and training (water harvesting techniques, nursing, planting, weeding, soil conservation, pest and disease control etc.), have helped farmers to cultivate vegetables in the dry season. According to an interviewee, “
    <span class="italic">using irrigation (Vea irrigation facility) as a way of managing with drought (food shortfalls) yielded significant benefits from the 1960s to early 2000 when the dam was effectively operational, in recent times, farming is limited to only one rainy season (June–October) since the irrigation facility is obsolete</span>”. The vital importance of dry season farming as a planned adaptation strategy was reiterated by a key informant that, “
    <span class="italic">cultivating vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, and other leafy vegetables in the dry season is very critical in enhancing my livelihood, the income I earn from the sale of produce (vegetables) is used to support my children's health and education, buy food and it also prevents any member of my household from migrating to the cities (Southern Ghana) for work</span>”. Dry season farming is a vital adaptation strategy to climate and ecological change. This assertion is supported by (
    <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">Antwi-Agyei, 2012</a>) that farm households rely greatly on irrigation to cope with climate change, especially during the dry season when there are no farming activities.

   <p id="p0200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approximately 50.7% and 40% of households in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively indicated that they migrated at least once in the last five (5) years as a strategy to reduce the effects of climate and ecological change on their livelihoods. A discussant at a FGD asserted that, “
    <span class="italic">during the dry season, people migrate temporarily to Southern Ghana to work in the cocoa growing areas, chop bars and drinking spots and head portage in order to meet their basic needs and remit back home</span>”. This study through an interview with a key informant revealed that, in recent times, people in the savanna ecological zone migrate to Southern Ghana to work on farms to earn income and accumulate food. This study further revealed that, some of the migrants in addition to working on people's farms, harvest vertiver grass straw for weaving baskets since the vertiver grass species are depleting in the savanna ecological zone. Findings of 
    <a rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib7">Awumbila and Ardayfio-Schandorf (2008)</a> confirm this study. It is important to add that these activities that migrant farmers engage in are low income paid jobs and others pay with food produce not in cash. Smallholder farmers indicated that, the major trigger of their migration is the recurrent droughts coupled with inherent poor soil fertility in the savanna ecological zone, which have contributed significantly to reductions in agricultural productivity over the years. This finding is in tandem with (

    <a rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib62">Van der Geest, 2011</a>). For instance, data from MoFA suggest that average yields for millet and sorghum were 1.4 mt/ha and 1.2 mt/ha respectively, for 2010, compared with 0.8 mt/ha and 1.0 mt/ha for the same crops in 2012 and a further decline of 0.6 mt/ha and 0.9 mt/ha for 2014. Soils in the savanna ecological zone are deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur (

    <span class="italic">the soil quality for crop production is very poor</span>”. Studies by (

    <a rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib28">Gemenne, 2011</a>) also confirm that people migrate in response to harsh climate conditions as a coping mechanism. Discussant at an FGD said “
    <span class="italic">We migrate to southern Ghana so that we can work and earn money to enable us buy food, pay our school fees and health insurance since we have a long dry season in which we sit and do nothing”.</span> These assertions all indicate that households migrate in anticipation of droughts and poor soil quality to secure a sustainable livelihood for themselves and their families. Migration (inter and intra village migration, rural-rural, rural-urban and regional migration) is a critical coping strategy employed by smallholder farmers in the study communities. A focus group discussant remarked that “
    <span class="italic">the rainfall problem in this community has become so bad that our harvest is always not enough to feed our families, so most people migrate to Tamale, Kumasi and Kintampo to work on people's farms to earn money or sometimes food. The youth also migrate to the big cities (Accra and Kumasi) to work as “Kayaye” (head potters), roasting kebabs, working in chop bars and restaurants to take care of their family needs”.</span> Damaging coping strategies such as out-migration of the entire households were practiced especially when elementary coping strategies are exhausted. From the interviews and group discussions, it is obvious that, smallholder farmers migrate due to ecological and climate change effects such as erratic rainfall, droughts, poor soil fertility and food shortfalls (

    <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">Antwi-Agyei, 2012</a>). An interviewee commented that “
    <span class="italic">there are other factors aside the poor rainfall problem that makes people to migrate… lack of jobs and low infrastructure development are the other factors that compounds our already fragile environmental problems”</span>.

   <p id="p0205" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decreasing food consumption and altering diets is now a crucial coping strategy of smallholder farmers in the savanna ecological zone of Ghana. The results show that 67% and 64% of smallholder households/farmers in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively reduced/decreased their food intake or altered their diets as a coping strategy to climate and ecological change (livelihood and food insecurity). Vulnerable households indicated they usually depend on food provided by churches and social intervention programs of NGOs. A female remarked during a household interview: 
    <span class="italic">“When my family's food is running low (food shortfall), the elderly people usually eat once a day so that the children can eat twice a day. We also sometimes eat food that is not our preference”.</span>
   </p>
   <p id="p0210" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Connected to altering diet is the reduction in food consumption by the members of the households. Since the 1990s, when rainfall pattern became more erratic, households in the savanna ecological zone have been decreasing food consumption as a key coping strategy to ecological and climate change (droughts, food shortfall) and during the dry season (
    <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">Antwi-Agyei, 2012</a>). Decreasing food consumption and altering diets as a coping strategy requires crucial assessment since this strategy poses dangerous consequence on the health and well-being of affected households. This situation makes the affected more vulnerable to negative effects of climate and ecological change by predisposing such households to many diseases that will make them more susceptible to climate and ecological stress (
