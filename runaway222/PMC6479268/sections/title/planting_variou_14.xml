 <p id="p0180" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study discovered that, smallholder farmers in the Sudan and Guinea Savanna ecological zone of Ghana are progressively employing or planting various crops at different times as an adaptation strategy to climate and ecological change in order to increase their yields and minimize the risk of total crop failure. The survey disclosed that, 89.3% and 90.6% of smallholder farmers in Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively testified to employing crop diversification as an adaptation strategy to reduce the negative effects of climate and ecological change on their livelihoods. Experts at the office of the District Department of Agriculture noted that, “
  <span class="italic">diverse crops have distinct biological dynamics and therefore their susceptibility to ecological change; erratic rainfall and high temperature vary considerably”</span>. A key informant explained that, “
  <span class="italic">as a way of distributing our risks in times of uncertainties, we (farmers) plant different crops at different times</span>”. An FGD participant noted “
  <span class="italic">we plant various crops at different times because, when one particular crop fails, we (farmer/household) will be compensated by the yield from the other crops hence helps us avoid total crop failure</span>”. Another FGD participant reiterated that, “
  <span class="italic">planting more than one crop on the same parcel of land grants some form of insurance for the household against crop failure”</span>. Discovery by 
  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">Bryan et al. (2013)</a> which suggests that households are constantly employing crop diversification as an adaptation strategy to climate change, confirms this study.
