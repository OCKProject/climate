 <p id="p0195" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rain water harvesting techniques (ponds and dugouts) and large-scale irrigation services are progressively being used by smallholder farmers in the Sudan and Guinea Savanna Ecological Zone as a long-term planned adaptation strategy to climate and ecological change risks. Many farmers are gradually engaged in dry season vegetable cultivation (particularly tomatoes) during the off-season. Approximately 42% and 6% of households in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively reported practicing dry season farming. The Gowrie Kunkua community is located close to the Vea irrigation dam, approximately, 72 % of smallholder farmers have been allocated land at the irrigation site for farming by ICOUR. Although it has been widely agreed that the use of irrigation facilities can significantly reduce food and livelihood insecurity caused by crop failure (due to droughts), an interviewee indicated that, “
  <span class="italic">the Vea irrigation facility has become obsolete or unused in recent times. The canals feeding water to the irrigated farms are currently damaged; hence water cannot pass through to the farms</span>”. FG discussant asserted that, “
  <span class="italic">the inability of ICOUR (government) to repair the Vea irrigation facility has hindered our ability to cultivate vegetables in the dry season hence our current vulnerability (food and livelihood insecurity) to climate and ecological change</span>”. As a result of this current challenge, farm households in the Gowrie Kunkua community with assistance from an NGO (e.g. Sustainable Family Agricultural and Education Support Program-SUFAEP), in the form of inputs (seeds, chemicals, fertilizer, water pump, donkey cart) and training (water harvesting techniques, nursing, planting, weeding, soil conservation, pest and disease control etc.), have helped farmers to cultivate vegetables in the dry season. According to an interviewee, “
  <span class="italic">using irrigation (Vea irrigation facility) as a way of managing with drought (food shortfalls) yielded significant benefits from the 1960s to early 2000 when the dam was effectively operational, in recent times, farming is limited to only one rainy season (June–October) since the irrigation facility is obsolete</span>”. The vital importance of dry season farming as a planned adaptation strategy was reiterated by a key informant that, “
  <span class="italic">cultivating vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, and other leafy vegetables in the dry season is very critical in enhancing my livelihood, the income I earn from the sale of produce (vegetables) is used to support my children's health and education, buy food and it also prevents any member of my household from migrating to the cities (Southern Ghana) for work</span>”. Dry season farming is a vital adaptation strategy to climate and ecological change. This assertion is supported by (
  <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">Antwi-Agyei, 2012</a>) that farm households rely greatly on irrigation to cope with climate change, especially during the dry season when there are no farming activities.
