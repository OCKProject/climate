 <p id="p0040" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation is described by the IPCC as a “process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities” (
  <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">IPCC, 2014</a>, p. 118). Adaptation usually comprises medium to long-term adjustments in social ecological systems (
  <a rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib56">Smit and Pilifosova, 2003</a>). Coping measures on the other hand refers to short-term strategies employed by households to lessen the negative repercussions of climate and ecological change on their well-being and livelihood over short period of time normally less than one calendar year (
  <a rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib26">Engle, 2011</a>). In general, adaptation entails modifications in processes, practices and structures to lessen likely damages or to profit from occasions related to ecological change. 
  <a rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib15">Burton et al. (2002)</a> refers to adaptation as the capacity of environmental and social systems to adjust to variation in order to endure the repercussions of such alteration. Adaptation equally relates to the decision-making process and the set of actions undertaken to maintain the capacity to deal with current or future predicted change (
  <a rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib43">Nelson et al., 2007</a>). 
  <a rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib27">Eriksen et al. (2011)</a> are of the view that adaptation refers to the process or adjustment by which households lessen the adverse impacts of ecological change on their livelihood and well-being and also take opportunity to profit from the ecological change.

 <p id="p0045" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several convergencies from the myriad of definitions offered by several authors. The emerging convergencies underlines the inherent linkage of the adaptation concept to the theory of diffusion of innovations (
  <a rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib51">Rogers, 1995</a>), which underpins this study. Although a variety of analytical approaches to adaptation exist, this study finds the adoption of innovations relevant for this study. The theory of diffusion of innovations (
  <a rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib51">Rogers, 1995</a>) allows this study to gain insights into decision making process by which smallholder households or farmers adaptations strategies are implemented and diffused among farming villages and communities. Underpinned by the theory of innovation adoption, this study has recognized that adaptation is a multi-faceted decision-making process. It is a function of individual and situational (climate and ecological change risks) circumstances of the decision maker and the characteristics of the innovation under consideration which occurs within a context of changing economic, social, political and biophysical conditions (
  <a rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib51">Rogers, 1995</a>; 
  <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">Smith and Skinner, 2002</a>). The innovation of diffusion theory has elucidated understanding of the varied processes and mechanisms by which adaptation measures are implemented and their probability of adoption.

 <p id="p0050" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The theory of diffusion of innovations (
  <a rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib51">Rogers, 1995</a>) identifies four critical fundamentals that significantly influences the diffusion of innovation. These critical foundations are: the innovation itself, communication channels, time and the nature of the social system. The adoption or rejection of an innovation (an idea, a practice or an object) will depend on the opinion of possible adopters and the attributes of the innovation itself. Rogers theory of diffusion of innovation suggests five (5) crucial attributes of an innovation that will determine its adoption or rejection. These attributes include the relative benefit of the innovation, its compatibility, complexity, trialability and observability. Regarding the second critical element (channels of communication), Rogers suggest that mass media channels like radio, Televisions and the print media are very effective and efficient in spreading information rapidly to its audience. Personal communication (one on one interaction) among farmers is nevertheless an important way of communication and spreads innovation faster among farming communities. Time as the third element influences innovation adoption. Individuals predisposed to an idea are more likely to adopt such an idea (innovation) faster than those less predisposed. Roger, on the element of time, categorized individuals as innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and the laggards. Lastly, the social system comprises individuals, social networks, communal groups, associations among others. The opinions, values and roles of members of the social systems also influence, to a great extent, the rate at which innovations are adopted.

 <p id="p0055" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In like manner, adaptation to climate and ecological change passes through similar thought processes by smallholder households. Farmers need to realize first of all that there is the need to implement adaptation measures to reduce the risk of climate and ecological change impacts on their livelihoods. Second, farmers will then scrutinize the available options, with the goal to identify what and why (adaptation measures) to adopt or implement. It must however be noted that many factors such as age, farming experiences, information, economic resources, education and institutions determines the adaptive capacity of households (
  <a rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib8">Bawakyillenuo et al., 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib47">Osumanu et al., 2017</a>). The choice or decision to implement adaptation measures (adopt innovations) more often depends of the accessibility of adequate information, education, institutional support and asset base of vulnerable households (
