  <p id="p0060" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana consists of the Upper East, Upper West, North East, Savannah and Northern regions located in the northern-most extent of Ghana. The Savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana is known to be highly vulnerable to climate and ecological changes due to their semi-arid climate and physical characteristics (
   <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">Boafo et al., 2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="p0065" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The savanna agro ecological zone is dominated by grassland and trees with low density, it is warmer than the rain forest, and has a unimodal rainfall season with 600–1500 mm/year alternated with pronounced dry seasons. Agriculture focuses on grain crops and livestock production. The limited availability of water and nutrients makes the zone highly fragile and prone to poverty (
   <a rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib16">Callo-Concha et al., 2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="p0070" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Much of the landscape of the savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana has been shaped by human activities; areas with natural flora have been converted into other land uses and the fauna has been depleted by intensive hunting. However, few small forest patches remain as sacred groves where part of the original biodiversity is conserved (
   <a rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib2">Aniah &amp; Yelfaanibe, 2016</a>, 
   <a rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib3">2017</a>). Triggered by demographic changes, the farming systems of the savanna zone of Ghana have evolved from the interaction of indigenous migratory systems to sedentary systems based on exotic crop species in diverse arrangements, in accordance with the environmental and socio-economic circumstances of the farmers (
   <a rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib16">Callo-Concha et al., 2012</a>). In the savanna zone of Ghana, the predominant cropping system is the ‘cereal-root crop mixed’ cropping systems based on a combination of cereals, leguminous and root crop species (
   <a rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib16">Callo-Concha et al., 2012</a>). The key challenges to agriculture production include insufficient moisture due to the high rainfall variability and frequent droughts (
   <a rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib18">Challinor et al., 2007</a>) and poor soil fertility (
   <a rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib53">Sanchez, 2002</a>). These challenges have been identified as the main ecological constraints to smallholder farmers' adaptive capacity (
   <a rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib16">Callo-Concha et al., 2012</a>). The area is highly rural and inhabited by smallholder farmers (
   <a rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib29">GSS, 2013</a>) whose poverty levels range between 68% and 88% (
   <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">Boafo et al., 2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="p0075" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study selected two rural communities, Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre as case study sites for in-depth survey (
   <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). The selected communities are located within the Bongo district, which spans a total land area of 488 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> representing approximately 5.52% of the total landmass of the Upper East Region. The selected communities have about 400 households each. The average household size in the selected communities/Bongo district is 6 persons per household. The Bongo district has a total population of 84, 545 people which represents 0.34% of the Ghanaian population. Approximately 48.8% of the total population is males and 72% live in rural areas (
   <a rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib29">GSS, 2013</a>). About 80% of the economically active population engages in rain-fed agriculture. The main produce is millet, guinea-corn, maize, groundnut, beans, sorghum and tomatoes and onions which are usually cultivated in the dry season. Livestock and poultry production are also important sources of livelihood for the people (
   <a rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib29">GSS, 2013</a>). The population density as of 2009 was projected to be 217 persons per km
   <span class="sup">2</span> over a land size of 459.5 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>. This compounded by the rocky landscape of the area, which covers about 40% of the land surface of the district, undermines agricultural activity (

  <p id="p0080" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Bongo district shares borders with Burkina Faso to the North, Bolgatanga Municipal to the South West, Nabdam District to the South East and Kassena-Nankana West District to the West (
   <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). It lies between longitudes 0.45°W and latitude 10.50°N to 11.09°N. According to the 
   <a rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib33">Institute of Local Government Studies (2010)</a>, a district in Ghana represents a second-level administrative sub-division below the level of region.
  </p>
  <p id="p0085" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Bongo District was selected based on a scrutiny of rainfall and crop yield (production) data. The scrutiny identified the Bongo district as the most vulnerable district to climate and ecological change in the Savanna agro ecological zones of Ghana. Expert and stakeholder interviews were used to select study communities (
   <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">Bryman and Bell, 2007</a>) based on the following criteria: (i) the community should have been or is being exposed to some sort of climate anomaly (particularly drought); (ii) it should have characteristics that could be researched in line with the study's aim; and (iii) the community must be prepared to partake in the study during its entire period.

  <p id="p0090" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The empirical data from this study spans six months of ethnographic fieldwork. A study of this kind, which seeks to examine the lived experiences of farmers affected by climate variability and ecological changes cannot properly be carried out with only quantitative methodology or analysis. Immersed ethnography is one of the best methodological approaches to use in exploring smallholder farmers lived experiences (responses to climate and ecological change effects on their livelihoods) (
   <a rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib44">Nyantakyi-Frimpong and Bezner-Kerr, 2015</a>). It is particularly vital in assisting us understand many dimensions of social relations (e.g., peer-to-peer learning, diffusion and adoption of innovation) that could not have been easily understood when the approach adopted was basically closed ended questionnaire surveys (
   <a rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib55">Schroeder, 1999</a>). Again, the ethnographic approach has the virtue of solidity (
   <a rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib60">St. Martin and Pavlovskaya, 2009</a>) and is precisely valuable when the researcher seeks to completely understand smallholder farmers' lived experiences in all its entirety and complexities (
   <a rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib55">Schroeder, 1999</a>; 
   <a rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib64">Watts, 2013</a>;

   <a rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib52">Roncoli et al. (2009)</a> and 
   <a rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib44">Nyantakyi-Frimpong and Bezner-Kerr (2015)</a> have especially stressed the utility of an ethnographic methodology and the need for participatory methods of data collection in obtaining farmer beliefs about climate change and their livelihood adaptation.
  </p>
  <p id="p0095" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Generally, the sampling technique employed in this study was purposeful and aimed to select information rich cases for in-depth scrutiny. Information rich cases offered the researchers an opportunity to learn a great deal about important issues which yielded greater insights and in-depth understanding (
   <a rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib48">Patton, 2002</a>; 
   <a rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib21">Creswell, 2013</a>). The study employed a combination or mixture of purposeful sampling strategies. This was necessary because triangulating or combining sampling strategies is flexible and enables the research findings to capture multiple perspectives, interest and needs (
   <a rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib48">Patton, 2002</a>; 
   <a rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib21">Creswell, 2013</a>). First of all, the study employed criterion sampling to review and select all cases and/or districts that met a predetermined criterion (exposed to climate anomaly-drought). Inclusion criterion for this study are districts in Ghana that have been predisposed to climate and ecological change risks and abnormalities (erratic rainfall pattern, drought, high temperature). The Bongo district (study district) was tinted as the most vulnerable district in Ghana to climate change hence its selection. Due to limited resources and time, the study employed purposeful random sampling to select 75 households in each of the two (2) (Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities) rural villages/communities in the Bongo district.
  </p>
  <p id="p0100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From June to December 2015, we conducted village-level fieldwork by living and working with smallholder farmers in their farms and engaging in daily farming practices with the farmers. Daily farming practices such as land preparation, planting, sowing, weeding, soil and water conservation, contour construction, stone bonding, animal grazing/feeding, termites hunting, crop harvesting and crop residue management. Data collection integrated a sequential, multi-method triangulation technique (
   <a rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib22">Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011</a>). The fieldwork started with oral historical interviews with the community elders (clan heads, chief/earth priest, sectional/divisional heads/sub-chiefs) in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities, and then continued with a survey of 75 households in each of the two communities. Households are defined “as constituting of a group of people who own the same productive resources, live together and feed from the same pot” (
   <a rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib65">Yaro, 2006</a>). Through transect walks and community institutional and resource mapping (CIRM), we randomly surveyed every fourth household until we obtained the required sample size. The 75 households represented approximately 48% and 42% of all households the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively.
  </p>
  <p id="p0105" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on initial analysis of the survey data, we used qualitative techniques including in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and participant observations to help position and offer profundity to the quantitative findings (
   <a rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib22">Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011</a>). The qualitative data gathering and analysis process was iterative. The kinds of additional information or informants required were usually decided as the data gathering and analysis evolved concurrently (
   <a rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib48">Patton, 2002</a>; 
   <a rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib40">Miles and Huberman, 1994</a>). We conducted at least two focus group discussions in each community comprising about 5–10 farmers of different socio-economic backgrounds, to ensure triangulation of the key issues emerging from the household questionnaire. Following analyses and synthesis of these data sets, a total of 15 key informants (7 in each community) were chosen for in-depth interview into the issues raised at focus group discussions. Focus group discussants and Key Informants were purposefully selected based on their farming knowledge and experience of ecological/climate change as presented during the household questionnaire survey.
  </p>
  <p id="p0110" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interview time varied significantly from 3 hours 30 minutes to 5 hours 30 minutes. They were conducted on/near farms or homes of the respondents and in the local language (Gurune) which we understand and speak. We earlier on employed the services of the Gurune language department of the University of Education (Winneba) to assist in interpreting key English language terminologies and concepts such as vulnerability, adaptation and resilience which do not have exact translation or meaning in the Gurune language. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Ethical clearance committee of the University for Development Studies.</p>

  <p id="p0115" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantitative data from the household questionnaire were first inspected, cleaned, coded and then entered in a Microsoft Excel (Version 2010) and Predictive Analytic Software (formerly SPSS). Appropriate statistical analysis was then conducted using descriptive statistics and compared means, where possible.</p>
  <p id="p0120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Qualitative data from interviews and focus groups were coded and indexed through intensive content analysis in order to identify major themes (
   <a rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib37">Krippendorff, 2004</a>). Structuring themes permitted the categorization of the responses and identification of those that diverged from the common themes. Key informant interviews and focus group discussions were used to triangulate any contradictions observed in the data. As a way of ensuring that threats to qualitative data validity and reliability are eliminated (
   <a rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib48">Patton, 2002</a>), themes and sub-themes from earliest analyses were confirmed and validated by the research participants in the two study communities through the organization of 3 feedback community meetings in each of the communities. The feedback provided during these meetings enabled us to further refine the results.
