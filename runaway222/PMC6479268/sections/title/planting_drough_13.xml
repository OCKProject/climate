 <p id="p0175" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Smallholder farmers have resorted to the use of drought tolerant or resistant crop varieties as one of the chief adaptation strategies to ameliorate the negative effects of climate and ecological change (particular droughts) on their livelihoods. The study revealed that 76% and 59.3% of smallholder farmers in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively use crop varieties that can resist droughts and also matures early. Examples of some of these crops in the study area include maize, groundnut, and cowpea. An interviewee asserted that “
  <span class="italic">these crops (maize, groundnut and cowpea) require a smaller number of moisture days (65–90) to mature, measured against indigenous crop varieties such as guinea corn, late millet which require between 125-145 moisture days to mature</span>”. The use of drought tolerant crops has been indicated as one of the main recommended adaptation strategies in food systems (

  <span class="italic">the crops that mature early are also drought resistant because during their flowering which requires adequate moisture comes early enough such that by the time droughts set in, the crops would have matured fully</span>”. This is very significant in decreasing climate and ecological change risks. The crops that mature early are also vital in supporting or augmenting household food shortfalls especially during the stress periods. This corroborates (
  <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">Antwi-Agyei et al., 2014</a>) who suggest that households respond to climatic and non-climatic drivers through the adoption of crop varieties that matures early and requires less moisture.
