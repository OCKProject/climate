 <p id="p0060" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana consists of the Upper East, Upper West, North East, Savannah and Northern regions located in the northern-most extent of Ghana. The Savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana is known to be highly vulnerable to climate and ecological changes due to their semi-arid climate and physical characteristics (
  <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">Boafo et al., 2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="p0065" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The savanna agro ecological zone is dominated by grassland and trees with low density, it is warmer than the rain forest, and has a unimodal rainfall season with 600–1500 mm/year alternated with pronounced dry seasons. Agriculture focuses on grain crops and livestock production. The limited availability of water and nutrients makes the zone highly fragile and prone to poverty (
  <a rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib16">Callo-Concha et al., 2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="p0070" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Much of the landscape of the savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana has been shaped by human activities; areas with natural flora have been converted into other land uses and the fauna has been depleted by intensive hunting. However, few small forest patches remain as sacred groves where part of the original biodiversity is conserved (

  <a rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib3">2017</a>). Triggered by demographic changes, the farming systems of the savanna zone of Ghana have evolved from the interaction of indigenous migratory systems to sedentary systems based on exotic crop species in diverse arrangements, in accordance with the environmental and socio-economic circumstances of the farmers (
  <a rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib16">Callo-Concha et al., 2012</a>). In the savanna zone of Ghana, the predominant cropping system is the ‘cereal-root crop mixed’ cropping systems based on a combination of cereals, leguminous and root crop species (
  <a rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib16">Callo-Concha et al., 2012</a>). The key challenges to agriculture production include insufficient moisture due to the high rainfall variability and frequent droughts (
  <a rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib18">Challinor et al., 2007</a>) and poor soil fertility (
  <a rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib53">Sanchez, 2002</a>). These challenges have been identified as the main ecological constraints to smallholder farmers' adaptive capacity (
  <a rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib16">Callo-Concha et al., 2012</a>). The area is highly rural and inhabited by smallholder farmers (
  <a rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib29">GSS, 2013</a>) whose poverty levels range between 68% and 88% (
  <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">Boafo et al., 2016</a>).

 <p id="p0075" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study selected two rural communities, Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre as case study sites for in-depth survey (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). The selected communities are located within the Bongo district, which spans a total land area of 488 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> representing approximately 5.52% of the total landmass of the Upper East Region. The selected communities have about 400 households each. The average household size in the selected communities/Bongo district is 6 persons per household. The Bongo district has a total population of 84, 545 people which represents 0.34% of the Ghanaian population. Approximately 48.8% of the total population is males and 72% live in rural areas (
  <a rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib29">GSS, 2013</a>). About 80% of the economically active population engages in rain-fed agriculture. The main produce is millet, guinea-corn, maize, groundnut, beans, sorghum and tomatoes and onions which are usually cultivated in the dry season. Livestock and poultry production are also important sources of livelihood for the people (
  <a rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib29">GSS, 2013</a>). The population density as of 2009 was projected to be 217 persons per km
  <span class="sup">2</span> over a land size of 459.5 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. This compounded by the rocky landscape of the area, which covers about 40% of the land surface of the district, undermines agricultural activity (

  <a rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib33">Institute of Local Government Studies (2010)</a>, a district in Ghana represents a second-level administrative sub-division below the level of region.

 <p id="p0085" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Bongo District was selected based on a scrutiny of rainfall and crop yield (production) data. The scrutiny identified the Bongo district as the most vulnerable district to climate and ecological change in the Savanna agro ecological zones of Ghana. Expert and stakeholder interviews were used to select study communities (
  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">Bryman and Bell, 2007</a>) based on the following criteria: (i) the community should have been or is being exposed to some sort of climate anomaly (particularly drought); (ii) it should have characteristics that could be researched in line with the study's aim; and (iii) the community must be prepared to partake in the study during its entire period.
