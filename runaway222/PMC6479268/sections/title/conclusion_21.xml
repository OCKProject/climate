 <p id="p0215" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study highlights that local communities in the savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana are coping and adapting to climate variability and ecological changes. Due to the impacts of recurrent shocks (droughts, soil infertility, displacement, etc.), the ambiguity of the limited access to financial and technical resources and the lack of support to indigenous knowledge systems, local communities have often turn to short term coping strategies rather than long term sustainable adaptation strategies. Key coping strategies such as continuous selling of productive assets for example livestock, poultry and land is a source of dwindling tangible assets and endangers households to chronic livelihood and food insecurity. Out migration of the entire households identified as a key coping strategy can be damaging and therefore needs to be conceptually reconsidered in the savanna context. Decreasing food consumption and altering diets as a coping strategy also pose consequence on the health and well-being of households. To enable smallholder farmers shift from coping (reactive) to planned adaptation strategies, there is the need for exchange of knowledge (innovation adoption) on adaptation between local farmers and the formal institutions notably the NGOs and government agencies such as MoFA. Policy options need to be targeted at climate adaptation programmes and policies that are long term and sustainable and directly linked to livelihood diversification. For example, suitable livelihood enhancement programmes that foster asset building (craftmanship, training) should be mainstreamed into broader climate change adaptation programmes. There is also the need for smallholder households to be supported to establish communication channels for knowledge and information sharing. Community farmer groups and social networks could be initiated through farmers fora and workshops spearheaded by the extension officers of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. The formation of these associations and farmer networks will enable smallholder households have access to social capital for effective sharing and adoption of innovations. This study contributes to scientific debates on the role of adaptation by farmers by elucidating our understanding of how smallholder households/farmers are adapting to the risks posed by climate and ecological change.</p>
