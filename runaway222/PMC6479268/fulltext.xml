The risk factors are very high and the impacts will raise the developmental impediments of safeguarding livelihood security and poverty eradication in Sub-Saharan Africa. Adaptation to climate and ecological variation, though recognized as pressing and necessary, operates in the context of numerous uncertainties and unknowns. Previous studies on climate adaptation tried to identify universal patterns of coping rather than differentiating between agro ecological zones, villages and types of households. This paper uses case studies from two rural communities in the Savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana to explore smallholder farmers' responses to climate and ecological variation effects on their livelihood activities that have emerged since the mid-1980s. Results suggest that smallholder farmers use various coping, on-farm and off-farm adaptation strategies to ameliorate the negative impacts of climate and ecological changes on their livelihood. Coping measures such as selling household assets, migration of the entire households and decreasing food consumption/changing diets can be damaging. On &#x02013;farm adaptation strategies such as varying planting dates, use of drought tolerant crop varieties, soil conservation strategies are based on farmers indigenous knowledge passed down from generations. To ensure sustainability of local adaptation strategies, there is the need for exchange of knowledge between and among smallholder farmers and formal institutions through the recognition and empowerment of local residents and collective actions.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Environmental science</kwd><kwd>Ecology</kwd><kwd>Geography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Climate variability is now acclaimed as one of the most arduous and complicated problem confronting the globe (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2014</xref>).

Climate and ecological change have intensified and consequently altered life and livelihood-sustaining natural systems, leading to socio-cultural, economic and environmental disruptions (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Thornton et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Current climate change projections by climate experts indicate progressively severe negative impacts on many countries across the world. However, the most severe impacts are affecting the world's poorest countries with the weakest capacity to adapt (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">The agriculture sector in Ghana employs about 57% of the population and it is the major source of income for the majority of low-income Ghanaian families' most especially rural households (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">GSS, 2014</xref>). Not all, the sector also contributes appreciably to the foreign exchange earnings of the country and enhance development by means of providing raw materials to local industries (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">MOFA, 2007</xref>). Although agriculture contributes significantly to the country's GDP, the sector is exposed to climate change due to its reliance on rain-fed cultivation and as such variations in the climate are notably projected to lower agricultural productivity in the less developed countries (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Antwi-Agyei, 2012</xref>). Since the volume and pattern of rainfall determine, to a large extent, agricultural productivity (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Haile, 2005</xref>), crop yields in Ghana are estimated to reduce by 7% by 2020 due to projected decline in rainfall and upsurge in temperature (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Antwi-Agyei et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).

Ghana suffered droughts in 1968&#x02013;73, 1982&#x02013;84, 1990&#x02013;1992, but the drought of 1983/84 is among the most severe droughts in the country's history as it triggered major hydrological imbalances that affected crop production throughout the country (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Yaro, 2010</xref>).

The strong imperative to ascertain a suitable adaptation pathway belies the difficulty of describing what adaptation is, who should carry out adaptations, who should benefit from the adaptation, and what that adaptation should be (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adger et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Conway, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pelling, 2011</xref>). Livelihood adaptation to climate and ecological change operates in the context of numerous uncertainties and unknowns: we don't know precisely what the impact of ecological and climate change at the local level is or will be, or how stresses associated with it will overlap with other dynamic processes operating across multiple scales (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Watson et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). In the midst of these complications and uncertainties, localized case studies have a lot to offer through their examination of &#x0201c;the lived experiences&#x0201d; of resource dependent smallholder farmers and communities in the less developed countries in coping and adapting to climate and ecological change (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Berrang-Ford et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">This study is not the first wave of interest in climate change adaptation in Ghana. Most of the studies conducted so far have tried to identify general patterns of coping rather than differentiating between agro-ecological zones, villages and types of households (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Brockhaus et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). For example, <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Yaro (2010)</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Antwi-Agyei (2012)</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Antwi-Agyei et&#x000a0;al.

Due to variations and diversities in the agro-ecological zones, adaptation strategies are peculiar to localities and ecological zones and usually centers on the specific climatic characteristics of the area. This paper, however, is different in that, households' adaptation measures are differentiated based on agro-ecology. The paper makes significant contribution to the body of literature on the possible role of adaptation by farmers in Ghana particularly the fragile savannah ecological zone (see <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Schipper and Burton, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Antwi-Agyei et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bawakyillenuo et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Antwi-Agyei et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">The study explored smallholder farmers' responses to climate and ecological change effects on their livelihood activities that have emerged since the mid-1980s within the savanna agro ecological zone of Northern Ghana using an ethnographic approach.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Theory</title><p id="p0040">Adaptation is described by the IPCC as a &#x0201c;process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2014</xref>, p. 118). Adaptation usually comprises medium to long-term adjustments in social ecological systems (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Smit and Pilifosova, 2003</xref>). Coping measures on the other hand refers to short-term strategies employed by households to lessen the negative repercussions of climate and ecological change on their well-being and livelihood over short period of time normally less than one calendar year (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Engle, 2011</xref>). In general, adaptation entails modifications in processes, practices and structures to lessen likely damages or to profit from occasions related to ecological change. <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Burton et&#x000a0;al. (2002)</xref> refers to adaptation as the capacity of environmental and social systems to adjust to variation in order to endure the repercussions of such alteration. Adaptation equally relates to the decision-making process and the set of actions undertaken to maintain the capacity to deal with current or future predicted change (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Eriksen et&#x000a0;al.

The emerging convergencies underlines the inherent linkage of the adaptation concept to the theory of diffusion of innovations (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Rogers, 1995</xref>), which underpins this study. Although a variety of analytical approaches to adaptation exist, this study finds the adoption of innovations relevant for this study. The theory of diffusion of innovations (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Rogers, 1995</xref>) allows this study to gain insights into decision making process by which smallholder households or farmers adaptations strategies are implemented and diffused among farming villages and communities. Underpinned by the theory of innovation adoption, this study has recognized that adaptation is a multi-faceted decision-making process. It is a function of individual and situational (climate and ecological change risks) circumstances of the decision maker and the characteristics of the innovation under consideration which occurs within a context of changing economic, social, political and biophysical conditions (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Rogers, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Skinner, 2002</xref>). The innovation of diffusion theory has elucidated understanding of the varied processes and mechanisms by which adaptation measures are implemented and their probability of adoption.</p><p id="p0050">The theory of diffusion of innovations (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Rogers, 1995</xref>) identifies four critical fundamentals that significantly influences the diffusion of innovation. These critical foundations are: the innovation itself, communication channels, time and the nature of the social system. The adoption or rejection of an innovation (an idea, a practice or an object) will depend on the opinion of possible adopters and the attributes of the innovation itself. Rogers theory of diffusion of innovation suggests five (5) crucial attributes of an innovation that will determine its adoption or rejection. These attributes include the relative benefit of the innovation, its compatibility, complexity, trialability and observability. Regarding the second critical element (channels of communication), Rogers suggest that mass media channels like radio, Televisions and the print media are very effective and efficient in spreading information rapidly to its audience. Personal communication (one on one interaction) among farmers is nevertheless an important way of communication and spreads innovation faster among farming communities. Time as the third element influences innovation adoption. Individuals predisposed to an idea are more likely to adopt such an idea (innovation) faster than those less predisposed. Roger, on the element of time, categorized individuals as innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and the laggards. Lastly, the social system comprises individuals, social networks, communal groups, associations among others. The opinions, values and roles of members of the social systems also influence, to a great extent, the rate at which innovations are adopted.</p><p id="p0055">In like manner, adaptation to climate and ecological change passes through similar thought processes by smallholder households. Farmers need to realize first of all that there is the need to implement adaptation measures to reduce the risk of climate and ecological change impacts on their livelihoods. Second, farmers will then scrutinize the available options, with the goal to identify what and why (adaptation measures) to adopt or implement. It must however be noted that many factors such as age, farming experiences, information, economic resources, education and institutions determines the adaptive capacity of households (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bawakyillenuo et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Osumanu et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). The choice or decision to implement adaptation measures (adopt innovations) more often depends of the accessibility of adequate information, education, institutional support and asset base of vulnerable households (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bawakyillenuo et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>General characteristics of the study area</title><p id="p0060">The savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana consists of the Upper East, Upper West, North East, Savannah and Northern regions located in the northern-most extent of Ghana.

Agriculture focuses on grain crops and livestock production. The limited availability of water and nutrients makes the zone highly fragile and prone to poverty (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Callo-Concha et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="p0070">Much of the landscape of the savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana has been shaped by human activities; areas with natural flora have been converted into other land uses and the fauna has been depleted by intensive hunting. However, few small forest patches remain as sacred groves where part of the original biodiversity is conserved (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aniah &#x00026; Yelfaanibe, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).

In the savanna zone of Ghana, the predominant cropping system is the &#x02018;cereal-root crop mixed&#x02019; cropping systems based on a combination of cereals, leguminous and root crop species (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Callo-Concha et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). The key challenges to agriculture production include insufficient moisture due to the high rainfall variability and frequent droughts (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Challinor et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>) and poor soil fertility (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez, 2002</xref>). These challenges have been identified as the main ecological constraints to smallholder farmers' adaptive capacity (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Callo-Concha et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>).

Coping measures were employed by smallholder farmers when confronted with a climate or ecological threat. Smallholder farmers reported discarding these reactive measures when the threat is over. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that smallholder farmers at the micro-level employ several coping, on-farm and off-adaptation strategies. Key coping measures identified include, but not limited to, relying on family and friends, receiving assistances from government, income from off-farm jobs, harvesting wild fruits and game, selling household assets and buying of food. The results also revealed vital on-farm adaptation strategies such as changing planting times, planting drought tolerant crops, crop diversification, use of indigenous knowledge in agronomic practices and dry season cultivation (irrigation). Other important adaptation strategies (off-farm) reported include: migration, reducing their food consumption and changing diets.

Whenever households sell the livestock/poultry and other assets, they buy food from the market to supplement the food shortage. All respondents who indicated selling their livestock/poultry and other assets bought food (grains and cereals) to cope with the food shortfall. It was however realized that, 80% of smallholder farmers that sold their key productive assets failed to rebuild (restock) the assets after the catastrophe (drought, food shortfall) had halted. Continuous selling of productive assets such as livestock, poultry and land is a source of dwindling tangible assets and endangers households to chronic livelihood and food insecurity.

This is an indication that the onset of the rains, which decides or regulates the beginning of the farming season has changed. The growing season, which used to begin in March/April in the 1940s through to the 1970s has changed since 1980s/1990s to late May and early June and more recently (2014/2015) from late June to early July.

The study revealed that 76% and 59.3% of smallholder farmers in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively use crop varieties that can resist droughts and also matures early. Examples of some of these crops in the study area include maize, groundnut, and cowpea. An interviewee asserted that &#x0201c;<italic>these crops (maize, groundnut and cowpea) require a smaller number of moisture days (65&#x02013;90) to mature, measured against indigenous crop varieties such as guinea corn, late millet which require between 125-145 moisture days to mature</italic>&#x0201d;. The use of drought tolerant crops has been indicated as one of the main recommended adaptation strategies in food systems (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).

The appropriate agronomic practices used by households include manuring, composting, organic manure application, crop residue management and the use of animal droppings. In managing post-harvest loss, smallholder farmers use plant extract (<italic>dabokoka</italic>) in the storage and preservation of grains, others use groundnut shell to control striger and other hygienic practices to prevent animal diseases. Again, some farmers use shea-butter residue (molded and dried) as fuel for cooking and also for plastering walls to prevent cracks and/or collapsing of buildings and reptiles from entering the premises of the house.

Many farmers are gradually engaged in dry season vegetable cultivation (particularly tomatoes) during the off-season. Approximately 42% and 6% of households in the Gowrie Kunkua and Soe Kabre communities respectively reported practicing dry season farming. The Gowrie Kunkua community is located close to the Vea irrigation dam, approximately, 72 % of smallholder farmers have been allocated land at the irrigation site for farming by ICOUR. Although it has been widely agreed that the use of irrigation facilities can significantly reduce food and livelihood insecurity caused by crop failure (due to droughts), an interviewee indicated that, &#x0201c;<italic>the Vea irrigation facility has become obsolete or unused in recent times. The canals feeding water to the irrigated farms are currently damaged; hence water cannot pass through to the farms</italic>&#x0201d;. FG discussant asserted that, &#x0201c;<italic>the inability of ICOUR (government) to repair the Vea irrigation facility has hindered our ability to cultivate vegetables in the dry season hence our current vulnerability (food and livelihood insecurity) to climate and ecological change</italic>&#x0201d;. As a result of this current challenge, farm households in the Gowrie Kunkua community with assistance from an NGO (e.g. Sustainable Family Agricultural and Education Support Program-SUFAEP), in the form of inputs (seeds, chemicals, fertilizer, water pump, donkey cart) and training (water harvesting techniques, nursing, planting, weeding, soil conservation, pest and disease control etc.), have helped farmers to cultivate vegetables in the dry season.

This study through an interview with a key informant revealed that, in recent times, people in the savanna ecological zone migrate to Southern Ghana to work on farms to earn income and accumulate food. This study further revealed that, some of the migrants in addition to working on people's farms, harvest vertiver grass straw for weaving baskets since the vertiver grass species are depleting in the savanna ecological zone. Findings of <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Awumbila and Ardayfio-Schandorf (2008)</xref> confirm this study. It is important to add that these activities that migrant farmers engage in are low income paid jobs and others pay with food produce not in cash. Smallholder farmers indicated that, the major trigger of their migration is the recurrent droughts coupled with inherent poor soil fertility in the savanna ecological zone, which have contributed significantly to reductions in agricultural productivity over the years.

Migration (inter and intra village migration, rural-rural, rural-urban and regional migration) is a critical coping strategy employed by smallholder farmers in the study communities. A focus group discussant remarked that &#x0201c;<italic>the rainfall problem in this community has become so bad that our harvest is always not enough to feed our families, so most people migrate to Tamale, Kumasi and Kintampo to work on people's farms to earn money or sometimes food.

Due to the impacts of recurrent shocks (droughts, soil infertility, displacement, etc.), the ambiguity of the limited access to financial and technical resources and the lack of support to indigenous knowledge systems, local communities have often turn to short term coping strategies rather than long term sustainable adaptation strategies. Key coping strategies such as continuous selling of productive assets for example livestock, poultry and land is a source of dwindling tangible assets and endangers households to chronic livelihood and food insecurity. Out migration of the entire households identified as a key coping strategy can be damaging and therefore needs to be conceptually reconsidered in the savanna context. Decreasing food consumption and altering diets as a coping strategy also pose consequence on the health and well-being of households. To enable smallholder farmers shift from coping (reactive) to planned adaptation strategies, there is the need for exchange of knowledge (innovation adoption) on adaptation between local farmers and the formal institutions notably the NGOs and government agencies such as MoFA. Policy options need to be targeted at climate adaptation programmes and policies that are long term and sustainable and directly linked to livelihood diversification. For example, suitable livelihood enhancement programmes that foster asset building (craftmanship, training) should be mainstreamed into broader climate change adaptation programmes. There is also the need for smallholder households to be supported to establish communication channels for knowledge and information sharing. Community farmer groups and social networks could be initiated through farmers fora and workshops spearheaded by the extension officers of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. The formation of these associations and farmer networks will enable smallholder households have access to social capital for effective sharing and adoption of innovations. This study contributes to scientific debates on the role of adaptation by farmers by elucidating our understanding of how smallholder households/farmers are adapting to the risks posed by climate and ecological change.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0220">P.
