 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Development of forest management strategies aimed at increasing or preserving wildlife species in a changing climate requires modeling efforts that include the coupled response of vegetation 
  <span class="italic">and</span> wildlife to climate change. We suggested woodpeckers as indicator species of forest resiliency and biodiversity in an integrated forest–wildlife modeling framework, because they are ecologically constrained by forest structure, composition, and processes, which also affect a diversity of other organisms. Based on our comparison of predicted and observed woodpecker responses to climate change, we propose a framework for integration of climate, woodpecker, and forest modeling (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34876-fig-0003">3</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Models used to project future abundances and distributions of North American woodpecker species have largely been developed independently of process‐based models of forest vegetation responses to climate change (Table 
  <a rid="ece34876-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34876-tbl-0001">1</a>; Figure 
  <a rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34876-fig-0003">3</a>). The available bioclimatic niche models that predominate the predictions about woodpeckers (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34876-fig-0003">3</a>b) provide potential broad‐scale range distribution trends (Pearson &amp; Dawson, 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0083">2003</a>); however, they lack the finer scale habitat details (e.g., forest structure, composition, and habitat characteristics) that affect localized woodpecker population responses and may strongly interact with climate change. Habitat use and population persistence in a changing climate are difficult to ascertain without vegetation responses. For example, the inclusion of vegetation indices in distribution forecasts of boreal and mixed conifer forests avifauna is important for improving modeling results (Cumming et al., 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0020">2014</a>). The complexities of climate, vegetation, and disturbance interactions that modulate woodpecker habitat use underscore the need for coupled modeling that accounts for these ecological details (La Sorte &amp; Jetz, 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0053">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the inclusion of vegetation (dynamic global vegetation model: DGVM [Figure 
  <a rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34876-fig-0003">3</a>a]; for a review of the spectrum of climate–forest models, see: Scheller &amp; Mladenoff, 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0097">2007</a>) has improved avian distribution models (Conlisk, Syphard, Franklin, &amp; Regan, 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0014">2015</a>; Matthews et al., 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0068">2011</a>), plant functional types (outputs of DGVMs) still do not adequately account for future habitat distributions of woodpeckers (i.e., the type of climate–forest model (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34876-fig-0003">3</a>a) is important). This is because plant functional groupings may be of a scale too course to model woodpecker responses to forest characteristics. For example, Bancroft, Lawler, and Schumaker (
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0007">2016</a>) found no impact of climate change on Red‐cockaded Woodpecker habitat loss. They modeled climate as direct (i.e., precipitation effects on reproduction) and indirect (i.e., plant functional group responses to temperature and precipitation) effect. However, the resilience of the Red‐cockaded Woodpecker population is related to the structural components of a stand (tree density and size class distributions) and ground cover composition (James, Hess, Kicklighter, &amp; Thum, 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0049">2011</a>), which are indistinguishable at the scale of plant functional groups. Therefore, even with the persistence of the needle‐leaved evergreen biome or long‐leaf pine successional stages within this region (Costanza, Terando, McKerrow, &amp; Collazo, 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0017">2015</a>), finer scale niche attributes are important (Schiegg et al., 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0098">2002</a>) and should be included in model integration.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dynamic community process‐based forest landscape models (Scheller &amp; Mladenoff, 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0097">2007</a>) such as the LANDIS models (LANDIS‐II and LANDIS PRO; Figure 
  <a rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34876-fig-0003">3</a>a) that incorporate finer scale climate–vegetation–disturbance interactions compared to bioclimatic DGVMs are ideally suited for this integration (Di Febbraro et al., 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0022">2015</a>; Iverson, Prasad, Matthews, &amp; Peters, 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0046">2011</a>; LeBrun et al., 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0061">2016</a>; Tremblay, Boulanger, Cyr, Taylor, &amp; Price, 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0112" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0112">2018</a>). These models could improve woodpecker distribution modeling, especially within the context of multi‐objective management scenarios (
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0065">Martin, Hurteau, Hungate, Koch</a>, &amp; North, 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0065">2014</a>). Many of the key habitat characteristics and processes (e.g., forest composition and structure, disturbance type, intensity, and temporal trends) that modulate woodpecker population responses are already output variables of forest landscape models, allowing for points of integration between the two modeling disciplines (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34876-fig-0003">3</a>a,c). In addition, these models can be modulated by climate data, which is the crucial integration element in the climate–woodpecker–forest framework (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34876-fig-0003">3</a>d). Integration examples support this proposed framework. LANDIS‐II model projections by Martin et al. (
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0065">2014</a>) found that managing long‐leaf pine habitat for carbon storage decreases biodiversity and Red‐cockaded Woodpecker habitat at the expense of increased carbon sequestration. Similarly, the Black‐backed Woodpecker in boreal forest of Canada are predicted to decline under climate change or business as usual harvest practices (Tremblay et al., 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0112" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0112">2018</a>). The LANDIS models (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34876-fig-0003">3</a>a) allow for climate data integration, simulate ecosystem processes that produce emergent vegetation dynamics that constrain woodpecker distributions, and output variables that can inform woodpecker–forest models (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34876-fig-0003">3</a>c).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, after evaluating the predicted and observed woodpecker trends associated with climate change, we found there are inconsistencies between climate–woodpecker predictions and observed woodpecker responses, highlighting the uncertainty of future woodpecker distribution and population predicted responses. We conclude that implementation of climate smart management strategies aimed at increasing or preserving wildlife species will require modeling efforts to include the coupled response of climate–wildlife–forest (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34876-fig-0003">3</a>). The use of an indicator species of climate effects on forest biodiversity and resiliency is an improvement to ecosystem modeling. The general principle of coupled modeling frameworks is not a new proposal with regard to climate change (Root &amp; Schneider, 
  <a rid="ece34876-bib-0090" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34876-bib-0090">1993</a>). However, to date, we are aware of no model (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34876-fig-0003">3</a>d) that has managed to fully combine wildlife niche modeling into a climate–forest model; meaning modeling activities have utilized multiple models in tandem with data handoffs rather than have the models interact with feedbacks to processes. Our review suggests that fully integrating climate–woodpecker–forest models will address the limitations of climate–woodpecker models, while providing a biodiversity measure for climate–forest modeling efforts. Selection of the proper models within the framework will improve the resolution of fine‐scale woodpecker population responses to climate change and support multi‐objective management through integration of a habitat evaluation metric.
