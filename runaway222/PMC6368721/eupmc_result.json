    "BACKGROUND:Gaining insight into factors influencing the adoption of evidence-based interventions (EBI) is essential to ensuring their sustainability in the mental healthcare setting. This article describes 1) differences between professional staff roles in attitudes towards EBI and 2) individual and organizational predictors of attitudes towards adopting EBI. METHODS:The participants were psychologists and psychiatric nurses (N = 792). Student t-tests were used to investigate group differences of global attitude scores on the Evidence-based Practice Attitude Scale-36 (EBPAS-36). A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the EBPAS-36 measurement model, and a principal component analysis (PCA) of the factor scores were used to obtain attitudinal components for the subsequent hierarchical regression analyses. RESULTS:Three second-order attitudinal components were retained and named: professional concern, attitudes related to work conditions and requirements, and attitudes related to fit and preferences. Nurses' global attitudinal scores were more positive than those of psychologists, while clinicians had less positive global attitudinal scores than non-clinicians. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that provider demographic, social and psychological factors in the workplace and staff role predicted attitudes towards adopting EBI, e.g. male gender, older age and working in private practice predicted more negative global attitudes, while working in academia, experiencing social support from colleagues and empowering leadership predicted more positive global attitudes to adopt EBI. The prediction outcomes for the specific attitudinal components are presented, as well. CONCLUSION:The findings suggest that implementation efforts may benefit from being tailored to the different needs and values of the affected professionals, including the role of the context they operate within. Implications with a special emphasis on training efforts and organizational development are discussed."
