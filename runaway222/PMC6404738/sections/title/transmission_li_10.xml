 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limited studies indicate that rising temperatures will reduce the transmission capacity of overhead lines: this risk is expected to be low in the UK (Cradden and Harrison 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2013</a>), but may be significant in the USA at times of peak summer demand with reductions of up to 5.8% (Bartos et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2016</a>). Increasingly, frequent storms are projected to present mostly low risks to powerlines in the UK (McColl et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2012</a>), but may increase reliability indices by up to 30% in parts of Russia (Tyusov et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">2017</a>).

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Certain impacts are less well covered in the literature. Although many papers refer to increasing damage to bioenergy crops and energy infrastructure due to storms (extreme winds, floods, landslides), very few studies were found to quantify these (one for bioenergy, three for infrastructure). No quantitative studies were found on changing maintenance requirements for solar technologies or the availability and costs of fossil fuel resource extraction as sea ice and permafrost melt. As shown in Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>, the most studied impacts are for hydro and wind power in Europe, followed by North America. Four non-regional studies were identified examining thermodynamic behaviour of nuclear power stations, and the rating and structural failures of overhead lines. Impacts in Australasia, Asia (other than China) and Africa are under-represented. Approximately two thirds of the studies included in this review cover a sub-country, country or multi-country region, while the others are global or plant level.

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potential for adaptation to climate change is covered inconsistently. For example, several authors comment that negative impacts on wind and solar generation and infrastructure will be insignificant because rapid development and relatively short lifetimes of these technologies allow adaptation through technological upgrades and siting (e.g. Ebinger and Vergara 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2011</a>). Careful siting of new thermal power stations may also be possible to mitigate risk of water shortages. However, most power plants are currently situated where decreasing mean annual streamflow and strongly increasing water temperatures are projected (van Vliet et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2016</a>) and water competition may be exacerbated in the future by increased deployment of carbon capture and storage and biomass crops (e.g. Chandel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2011</a>; Byers et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2016</a>). For siting to be considered a feasible adaptation solution at the local level for any technology, high-resolution national impact studies and communication with industry partners are required. For hydropower, design changes and dam management may also provide adaptation options (Vicuña et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2011</a>). van Vliet et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2016</a>) note that an increase in plant efficiency of approximately 10% would offset the mean annual negative impacts for most regions (greater improvements would be required to offset monthly impacts) but no financial cost is given for this type and level of adaptation. No quantitative studies were found to examine other adaptation options, such as changing water dispatch patterns or regulations on cooling water discharge temperatures, or strengthening generation or transmission infrastructure.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As impact studies generally examine one or two elements of the energy system in isolation and there are gaps in the regional coverage of the literature, it is unclear whether the degree to which different impacts have been studied is representative of the impacts’ perceived importance, or rather the current state of modelling ability. Relative importance can be assessed most simply by considering the percentage share of generation technologies in different regions, as done for hydropower by Turner et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">2017</a>). As supply technologies play different roles in the system (e.g. base or peak load generation) and may interact through water use, understanding of the relative importance of impacts and their combined effects may be improved by the use of combined modelling approaches (e.g. Rübbelke and Vögele 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2013</a>; van Vliet et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2016</a>) and by the integration of several climate change impacts in models of the wider electricity and energy systems.
