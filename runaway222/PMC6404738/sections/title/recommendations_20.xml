 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To facilitate further integration of climate change feedback in sectoral models and IAMs, the following key areas should be prioritised in future research.</p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, further impact studies should focus on the energy system elements in developing countries. As vulnerability of infrastructure and operational systems vary significantly between regions, these are needed for both effective system planning locally and effective representation in large-scale IAMs.</p>
 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, further studies are needed on the technical and cost impacts of altered variability of renewable resources, and the impacts of extreme weather events on all elements of the energy system. As the impacts on individual system elements become better understood, research should turn to the combined effects of simultaneous or successive impacts, such as water shortages at times of high cooling demand, or storms hitting already weakened infrastructure. These could entail probabilistic modelling approaches.</p>
 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, IAMs should be developed to incorporate multiple climate change impacts on the demand and supply side at the same time. Technological and behavioural adaptation options and water competition should be represented to improve the comprehensive examination of the costs, feasibility and optimal timing of energy system decarbonisation pathways. As the variation between GCMs is a key uncertainty, methods should be developed to better reflect the range of climate projections, beyond the use of a climate model ensemble mean.</p>
