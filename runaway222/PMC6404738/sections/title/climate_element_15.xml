 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Impacts of extreme weather events under climate change scenarios have been less extensively studied than gradual changes. This is probably due to the larger uncertainty in this area of climate science, where the IPCC AR5 gave a low confidence assessment on the future trends of droughts and floods (Stocker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2013</a>). Furthermore, though studies can examine the impact of past events using historic data, the application of these findings to projections of future extreme events may be difficult due to the high number of variables involved. As demonstrated by US and European outage events, power station shutdowns caused by droughts and heatwaves can have dire consequences (Lagadec 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2004</a>). Significant work should be undertaken to understand their frequency, so that contingency plans and warning systems may be implemented. Impacts of combined or consecutive events and the cascading effect of extreme weather events through the transport, telecoms and water sectors are important but still understudied (Ciscar and Dowling 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2014</a>). Studies examining the impact of changes to the variability of climatic conditions are also limited, though this may be very important for renewable integration (Hueging et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2013</a>; Santos et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">2015</a>).

 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Energy-water interactions are important for many parts of the energy system: hydro, bioenergy and fossil fuel resources, thermal power plant efficiency and availability, CCS. Energy-water nexus modelling for these elements on a large geographic scale has been limited as it presents particular challenges related to the importance of local hydrological systems and due to the high variation in the precipitation results from different GCMs (Stocker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2013</a>).
