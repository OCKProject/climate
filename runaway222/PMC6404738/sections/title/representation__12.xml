 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change impacts have been represented in IAMs most commonly as economic damage functions, for use in mitigation-adaptation cost benefit analysis. Comparing climate damage functions in several top-down IAMs, Warren et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2006</a>) and Ortiz and Markandya (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2009</a>) both note their uncertainties are high. This is because they tend to be based on a small number of empirical studies and because empirical studies are often regional or sector specific whereas IAMs are often global, so relationships must be extrapolated across regions with varied physical and economic structures and constraints.
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Including physical technology-level impacts has been identified as a research gap by the IPCC Working Group III (Clarke et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2014</a>). This is required for cost-effectiveness analysis of climate stabilisation paths because, as described above, climate change can affect the availability of low-carbon supply options, necessitate reinforcement of the supply system and impact GHG emissions (Fisher-Vanden et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2013</a>). Modelling physical impacts can also allow examination of their relative importance compared to socio-economic drivers (e.g. Isaac and van Vuuren 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2009</a>) and exploration of adaptation options to reduce impacts on the whole system rather than an individual element. For example, by allowing and restricting various combinations of other generation technologies (e.g. natural gas), Parkinson and Djilali (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2015</a>) demonstrate that wind energy with storage and/or interregional transmission could be combined in a strategy of co-beneficial mitigation and adaptation.

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> summarises IAMs which have incorporated supply-side climate impacts. Changes to hydropower resource have been incorporated most; the high interest in this technology is likely due to the dominance of hydropower in some countries as a baseload electricity generator, its long project lifetime and the clear weather-dependence of the resource. Note, other studies have incorporated demand impacts alone, mostly using heating and cooling degree days (Isaac and van Vuuren 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2009</a>; Labriet et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2015b</a>; McFarland et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2015</a>). A few have included multiple demand and supply-side impacts together, allowing examination of their relative importance and how their combined effect might increase or mitigate pressure on the system.

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In most of these studies, impacts were simulated exogenously from the energy system model. More thorough representation has previously been limited by challenges in finding suitable climate data, translating climate data into a form that is relevant for the energy system, and lack of detail in energy system models (Dowling 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2013</a>). Incorporating physical impacts endogenously could enable the researchers to more easily examine the full feedback mechanisms. For example, by iteratively exchanging data between an energy system model and climate emulator, Labriet et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2015a</a>) model how changes to demand patterns and hydropower potential induce changes to the GHGs emitted by the energy system, which in turn modifies the climate change pathway.
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Representing climate impacts in wider energy system models requires careful consideration of temporal and spatial resolution and extent. For example, for energy system optimisation modelling, a time horizon of a few decades may be chosen to limit the impact of growing technology and cost uncertainties. However, a longer time horizon may be desirable to examine the larger impacts of climate change or the importance of technology lock-in (Parkinson and Djilali 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2015</a>). Some impact models require high-resolution input data, such as local topographic features in process-based hydrological models. Due to computational expense, these are often run at regional scales, making it more difficult to combine them with global-scale energy system models (Parkinson and Djilali 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2015</a>). Global models may use simpler simulations and cover a much larger extent but include less detail on land characteristics and processes (e.g. Labriet et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2015a</a>). Finally, global IAMs generally represent the world as approximately 10–30 regions only, so climate impact data must be aggregated to this scale. The variations in impacts within these regions can present problems for this aggregation.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As for impact studies, several IAM authors (e.g. de Lucena et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2010</a>) note their results are highly dependent on the climate model used as the driver. To reduce the impact of the selection of a single climate projection, some studies use an ensemble mean (e.g. Seljom et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2011</a>; Parkinson and Djilali 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2015</a>). However, little discussion is included evaluating the strengths or weaknesses of these approaches. Mima and Criqui (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2015</a>) examined this uncertainty by running the POLES model with 10 climate model projections for a single emissions scenario, noting the high variation prohibits decision-making in some cases.
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using full climate models in conjunction with energy system models is computationally expensive (Labriet et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2015b</a>), so some use a climate simulator model. Endogenous representation of climate change impacts in IAMs could be limited by this representation of climate change. In a comparison of how well seven well-developed IAMs simulate climate change, van Vuuren et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">2011</a>) note large variations in the steps by which IAMs link GHG emissions to temperature change: the equilibrium and transient climate change calculations, radiative forcing response to changes in CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration and the behaviour of the carbon cycle. However, the comparison found that the climate change results of most IAMs are within the range of the outcomes of the more complex models, indicating that climate change simulation should not prevent further work on incorporating impacts into IAMs.
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To address the extensive uncertainties involved in climate change impact modelling, and the difficulties involved in quantifying them, multi-model comparisons can be used. For example, McFarland et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2015</a>) incorporated demand-side climate change impacts in three US power sector models aiming to increase the robustness of the results. This study identified that the main source of difference between the models was the underlying data used for calibration, though the authors did not narrow the range of results based on this conclusion. Going forward, multi-model comparisons would be useful to explore the differences between parametric and model structure uncertainty.
