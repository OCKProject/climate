 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global studies differ in their projections of impacts on hydropower generation due to rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns: Hamududu and Killingtveit (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2012</a>) and Turner et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">2017</a>) project that climate change will have little effect on total global resource potential, even in high emissions scenarios, whereas van Vliet et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2016</a>) project a decrease of global hydropower capacity of up to 6.1% under RCP8.5 in the 2080s. Hamududu and Killingtveit (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2012</a>) also project small changes at local level (~ ± 1%), whereas van Vliet et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2016</a>), Turner et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">2017</a>) and various regional studies (see OR1) project potentials will increase by 5–20% for most areas at high latitudes (Canada, Russia, northern Europe, northeast China) and decrease by 5–20% in regions such as southern Europe, southern USA, southeast China and southern South America.
