  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are relatively few studies on wave power and none on tidal power, likely due to their low market share, and solar power, likely due to the rapid growth of the industry and assumed flexibility of siting options. Quantitative modelling of impacts on transmission and coastal infrastructure is also limited and a large-scale analysis of impacts on second-generation bioenergy resources is lacking.</p>

  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Impacts of extreme weather events under climate change scenarios have been less extensively studied than gradual changes. This is probably due to the larger uncertainty in this area of climate science, where the IPCC AR5 gave a low confidence assessment on the future trends of droughts and floods (Stocker et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2013</a>). Furthermore, though studies can examine the impact of past events using historic data, the application of these findings to projections of future extreme events may be difficult due to the high number of variables involved. As demonstrated by US and European outage events, power station shutdowns caused by droughts and heatwaves can have dire consequences (Lagadec 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2004</a>). Significant work should be undertaken to understand their frequency, so that contingency plans and warning systems may be implemented. Impacts of combined or consecutive events and the cascading effect of extreme weather events through the transport, telecoms and water sectors are important but still understudied (Ciscar and Dowling 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2014</a>). Studies examining the impact of changes to the variability of climatic conditions are also limited, though this may be very important for renewable integration (Hueging et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2013</a>; Santos et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Energy-water interactions are important for many parts of the energy system: hydro, bioenergy and fossil fuel resources, thermal power plant efficiency and availability, CCS. Energy-water nexus modelling for these elements on a large geographic scale has been limited as it presents particular challenges related to the importance of local hydrological systems and due to the high variation in the precipitation results from different GCMs (Stocker et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2013</a>).

  <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As described in Section 
   <a rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec3">3</a> and consistent with the summary in IPCC WGII (Field et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2014</a>), regional studies are still scarce for developing countries, indicating that data availability and research funding are likely significant factors in the choice of study area. In general, comments on the extent to which studies are applicable to the wider industry and geography are limited but would be useful to aid the prioritisation of further research. Furthermore, few climate change impact studies are performed at the global scale, as regional studies have the advantage of being able to use higher resolution data. Further global studies and regional studies for developing countries are needed to facilitate the inclusion of the impacts in global IAMs.

  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More detailed examination of the effects of climate, policy and impact uncertainties on modelling outcomes is needed (Chandramowli and Felder 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2014</a>). The use of a climate model ensemble mean can reduce the uncertainty due to differences between climate models; however, it does not address the uncertainty analytically or allow the modeller to quantify it. It may also hide the effect of extreme but uncommon events. Further sensitivity assessments using the full range of GCMs (such as Carvajal et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2017</a>) and intermodel comparisons, in the style of the ISI-MIP project (Warszawski et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">2014</a>), are needed in order to address these uncertainties more explicitly.

  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Few systematic comparisons of the relative importance of the impacts were found; regional assessments of this kind are important in order for energy system planners or operators to prioritise investment, for example in strengthening the infrastructure or reducing energy service demands. It could be that these assessments are carried out in government or industry reports rather than peer-reviewed literature. Inclusion of climate change impacts in IAMs can be a way of identifying their relative importance in the system context.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inclusion in IAMs</div>
  <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only a few studies have integrated technical supply-side climate change impacts in a bottom-up IAM, likely due to the technical and data challenges described in Section 
   <a rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec12">5</a>. Those which did indicated that the impacts are significant when considered in combination (e.g. Dowling 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2013</a>; Pereira-Cardenal et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2014</a>). Therefore, it seems clear that models examining long-term energy system pathways should incorporate climate change impacts on as many elements as are relevant for the regions covered, in order to capture any ways in which they balance or combine with each other.
