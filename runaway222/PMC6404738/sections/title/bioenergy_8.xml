 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both average yields and the areas suitable for growing bioenergy crops are affected by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. Broadly, yields are expected to increase at high latitudes and decrease at low latitudes, for example by as much as − 16% and + 28% in the 2050s (Haberl et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2011</a>), though studies note particularly large uncertainties regarding the importance of technological development and CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilisation (Haberl et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2011</a>; Cosentino et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2012</a>). This is expected to shift the suitable land northward for several crops (e.g. various flex food-energy crops in Europe (Tuck et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">2006</a>), switchgrass in the USA (Barney and DiTomaso 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2010</a>) and miscanthus globally (Hager et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2014</a>)).
