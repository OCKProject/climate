 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only a few studies have integrated technical supply-side climate change impacts in a bottom-up IAM, likely due to the technical and data challenges described in Section 
  <a rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec12">5</a>. Those which did indicated that the impacts are significant when considered in combination (e.g. Dowling 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2013</a>; Pereira-Cardenal et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2014</a>). Therefore, it seems clear that models examining long-term energy system pathways should incorporate climate change impacts on as many elements as are relevant for the regions covered, in order to capture any ways in which they balance or combine with each other.
