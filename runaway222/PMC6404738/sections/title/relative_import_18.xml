 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Few systematic comparisons of the relative importance of the impacts were found; regional assessments of this kind are important in order for energy system planners or operators to prioritise investment, for example in strengthening the infrastructure or reducing energy service demands. It could be that these assessments are carried out in government or industry reports rather than peer-reviewed literature. Inclusion of climate change impacts in IAMs can be a way of identifying their relative importance in the system context.</p>
