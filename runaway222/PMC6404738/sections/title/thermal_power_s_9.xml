 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rising temperatures are expected to reduce power plant output by approximately 0.4–0.7% per degree due to reduced thermal efficiencies (Chuang and Sue

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2014</a>). Reduced water resources for cooling are expected to cause power stations to reduce load or shutdown. For example, an annual mean temperature rise of 3 °C could cause daily reductions of generation capacity of up to 36% in Germany (Koch et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2014</a>). While some regions are expected to experience increased capacity under climate change (India and Russia), global annual thermal power plant capacity is likely to be reduced by 7–12% in the mid-century (van Vliet et al.
