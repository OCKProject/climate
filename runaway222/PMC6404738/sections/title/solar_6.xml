 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change projections tend to agree that cloud cover will decrease in low- to mid-latitude regions (Patt et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2013</a>); however, increases in solar resource will often be counterbalanced by decreasing efficiency due to rising temperatures. As such, regional studies tend to project changes in solar generation of less than ± 10% by the end of the century (Crook et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2011</a>; Gaetani et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2014</a>; Panagea et al.
