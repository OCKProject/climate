 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences between impact studies appear to be due primarily to two factors: the climate projections used as inputs to the impact models and impact model assumptions.</p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many studies depend heavily on the modellersâ€™ choice of GCM(s), especially those for which precipitation is a main driver. For example, various studies note that projections for hydropower and bioenergy resources remain highly uncertain in some regions due to disagreement between GCMs (Hamududu and Killingtveit 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2012</a>; De Laporte et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2014</a>; Labriet et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2015a</a>). As shown in the IPCC AR5 WGI (Stocker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2013</a>), the variation in GCM precipitation results is high over large parts of North and South America, Africa, southern Europe, southern Asia and Australia, especially under the lower emissions scenario. Modelling uncertainty is also important for wind and solar studies. Examining an ensemble of 10 GCMs, Karnauskas et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2017</a>) conclude that results for some regions (tropics and southern sub-tropics) are only robust for the later part of the century under the higher emissions scenario. Fant et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2016</a>) note the high uncertainty in cloud cover projections may account for the low number of solar impact studies. As well as preventing robust impact predictions, climate modelling uncertainty can preclude meaningful evaluation of adaptation options (Donatelli et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2015</a>). Where there is a high variation between GCMs, impact models can be driven with projections representing the full range of GCM results to represent the uncertainty, as was done for hydropower in Ecuador by Carvajal et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2017</a>).

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Uncertainty due to modelling assumptions is especially clear for bioenergy impact studies. These results vary due to their treatment of factors such as technological development, levels of agricultural input such as pesticides and fertilisers, irrigation, climate change impacts on water resources and CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilisation (e.g. Brown et al. 2000; Haberl 2011). Asseng (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2013</a>) and Rosenzweig et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2014</a>) each performed standardised model comparisons to explore these differences. Asseng (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2013</a>) concluded that a greater proportion of the uncertainty in impact projections was due to differences between crop models than between the climate models. Rosenzweig et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2014</a>) found crop model variation is highest in the middle latitudes and agreed that uncertainties related to the representation of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and high temperature effects are key. Both note that reducing these uncertainties is vital in order to facilitate adaptation responses.
