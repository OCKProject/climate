  <p>Global patterns of cumulative human impacts. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Annual change in CHI estimated using a linear regression model from 2003 to 2013 for each raster cell (white cells did not have a statistically significant trend, i.e., p &gt; 0.05), Scale values reflect min and max raster values (−0.3 and 0.52) and 99.999
   <span class="sup">th</span> quantile values (−0.21 and 0.32). (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Static map of 2013 CHI. (C) Coastal areas displayed for both pace of change and 2013 CHI for regions (indicated by dots on global CHI map) with dominant patterns of: high CHI, fast increasing pace of change (Southwestern Australia); high CHI, decreasing (North Sea); and low CHI, decreasing (Yukon Delta region of Alaska). There were no clear examples of low CHI, fast increasing.
