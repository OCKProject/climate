 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We include stressors from 4 primary categories:
  <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par26">Fishing: commercial demersal destructive, commercial demersal nondestructive high bycatch, commercial demersal nondestructive low bycatch, pelagic high bycatch, pelagic low bycatch, artisanal</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par27">Climate change: sea surface temperature, ocean acidification, sea level rise</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par28">Ocean: shipping</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par29">Land-based: nutrient pollution, organic chemical pollution, direct human, light</p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stressors included in our analyses are listed in Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a> and described in detail within the Supplementary Information.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given our focus of describing 
  <span class="italic">trends</span> in human impact on marine ecosystems, global datasets reporting results at regular intervals were critical. Given this constraint, we were unable to include some stressors from previous impact analyses
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span> because they did not include enough information for us to estimate annual change from 2003 to 2013. These excluded stressors include invasive species, ocean pollution, UV intensity, and benthic structures.
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other anthropogenic drivers we considered, but could not be included due to incomplete spatial or temporal coverage, were: hypoxic zones, coastal engineering (piers, rock walls, etc.), non-cargo shipping (ferries, cruise ships, etc), aquaculture, disease, changes in sedimentation and freshwater input, and tourism.</p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given discrepancies in how different data layers define the global coastline, we resolved differences by extending all stressor rasters to a common coastline. In some cases the gaps occurred because the monitoring that produced the stressor data missed some regions; however, it was most often due to converting a coarser resolution raster to a finer resolution raster, resulting in zig-zags of missing data along the coast. This made gapfilling necessary. Details for how spatial gapfilling was done for each stressor are provided in the Supplementary Information.</p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stressors are rescaled to have values between 0–1. Rescaling allows for direct comparison among drivers with dramatically different units of measurement. With the exception of ocean acidification, we rescaled the data by dividing by the 99.99th quantile across all global raster cells and years (values are capped to a maximum value of 1). We used all years of data to rescale the data to ensure comparability across time periods. The 99.99th quantile was used to minimize the influence of outliers. This approach assumes a linear relationship between the magnitude of the stressor and the impact on the ecosystem. This assumption ignores thresholds that likely exist but are known for very few stressors. For ocean acidification we used known information about biological thresholds to rescale the data.</p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For many stressors, the distribution of values was highly skewed such that rescaling relative to the highest values resulted in intermediate values of the stressor that were underestimated. In these cases, we log transformed stressor values prior to rescaling. We indicate when data were transformed in descriptions of each stressor in the Supplementary Information.</p>
