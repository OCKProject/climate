 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local adaptation to changing environmental conditions, such as directional climate change, becomes of high importance for organisms with limited dispersal abilities, or when physical barriers preventing dispersal are present.</p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In such scenarios, organisms can adapt by genetic changes and / or phenotypic plasticity. For genetic changes to occur, mutations are the ultimate source of novel variation, and it is generally assumed that a mutation is a rare event [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Consequently, individual-based models of explicit genetics typically assume small and constant (i.e., non-evolving) mutation rates [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. According to evidence, only few mutations are adaptive; many deleterious; and some are neutral [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. There is however genetic variation in DNA repair and replication processes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>], affecting the probability of a mutation to occur. Genetic loci affecting the origin of new variation (i.e., the mutation rate) have been termed “mutator” loci. They may be subject to selection, and selective forces may depend on the environmental context or scenario.
 </p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous work investigating the evolution of the mutation rate has found that the fate of mutator alleles may differ for sexual and asexual organisms [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. In asexual organisms mutator alleles are associated with the mutations they caused, thus mutator alleles leading to an increase of the mutation rate can increase in frequency by hitchhiking with beneficial mutations at other loci [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. In contrast, in sexual organisms given that recombination breaks linkage disequilibrium, the mutator allele will be separated soon from a beneficial mutation it has caused and will not hitchhike to high frequency [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Consequently, the evolution of mutation rate for a sexual organism is rather unlikely, and the mutation rate is then expected to stay close to a minimum achievable, limited either, by the costs of replication fidelity or by the drift limit [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to previous authors, a recent simulation study suggests that the mutation rate can evolve to relatively high values also in sexual species and this can advance invasion speed and promote adaptation to novel environmental conditions along an environmental gradient [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. The proposed mechanism is induced linkage disequilibrium between the dispersal locus and the mutator locus (both were evolving traits) that arise from spatial sorting and iterated founder event [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. The same authors also found that these results still held under assumptions of 90% of the mutations being lethal.
 </p>
 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present work uses an individual-based modeling approach focused on local adaptation to test the evolution of the mutation rate in a population of a sexual species experiencing directional climate change, under different scenarios of linkage disequilibrium (unlinked to complete linkage). The aim was to investigate, following the findings of Cobben et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>], whether directional climate change scenarios can also lead to the evolution of an elevated mutation rate in a sexual species. This work employs an alternative method for the simulation of beneficial mutations, i.e., implementing a distribution of mutation effects inspired by the concept of slightly deleterious mutations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. Furthermore, different scenarios of environmental stochasticity or noise color were investigated to test whether the mutation rate could vary among organisms experiencing different habitats.
