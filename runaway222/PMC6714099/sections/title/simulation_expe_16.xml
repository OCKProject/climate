 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To study the evolution of the mutation rate, different scenarios of rate of environmental change, stochastic noise color, probability of recombination, and percentage of beneficial mutations were implemented (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The scenarios of beneficial mutations were implemented only for the environmental conditions 
  <span class="italic">η &gt; 0</span> (directional climate change). For the stable environment (
  <span class="italic">η = 0</span>), the effect of mutations was drawn from a gaussian distribution centered in zero as it is commonly done in IBMs of explicit genetics [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>] and acted as a control. Note that under directional environmental change, this is exactly our scenario of 50% beneficial mutations. Simulation experiments consisted of 200 replicates, lasting for 300 generations each: 100 generations of stable environment followed by 200 generations of treatment of directional climate change. Simulations were run under white stochastic environmental noise unless otherwise specified. The sequence of operations in the model were: update of the environmental optimum, degree of local adaptation, reproduction, mortality of adults, and update of phenotype of the new generation before repeating the loop. If extinctions occurred, the data was not used for the analysis.
