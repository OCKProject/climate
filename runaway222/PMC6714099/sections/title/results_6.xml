 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our simulations, the mutation rate followed different evolutionary trajectories, relative to the percentage of beneficial mutation 
  <span class="italic">bm</span> and the probability of recombination 
  <span class="italic">pR</span>: Overall, the evolved mutation rate reached higher values when increasing the percentage of beneficial mutations 
  <span class="italic">bm</span>, and this was independent of scenarios of probability of recombination 
  <span class="italic">pR</span> and rate of environmental change (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S2). The mutation rate evolved to relatively high values mainly under scenarios of complete linkage (
  <span class="italic">pR = 1</span>), relatively rapid directional climate change, and 25% or higher percentage of beneficial mutations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Under the unlinked recombination scenario (
  <span class="italic">pR = 0</span>), the mutation rate evolved to relatively high values only if the rate of environmental change was fast (
  <span class="italic">η = 0.04</span>) and the percentage of beneficial mutations was high (50%; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). An intermediate recombination rate (
  <span class="italic">pR = 0.5</span>) yielded intermediate results (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S1).

 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general terms, for a population of a sexual species, it seems unlikely for the mutation rate to evolve to higher values under directional climate change scenarios, unless the rate of change is very rapid (
  <span class="italic">η = 0.04</span>) and the percentage of beneficial mutations is high (50%). This result is robust under different scenarios of environmental stochasticity or noise color (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>).
