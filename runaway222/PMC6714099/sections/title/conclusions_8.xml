 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, considering that 50% beneficial mutations may be an unrealistic assumption, and that recombination is ubiquitous in a sexual species, results in this study suggest that, it is unlikely for the mutation rate to evolve to elevated values in a sexual species experiencing directional climate change scenarios. Instead, mutation rate will be under stabilizing selection at the minimal value allowed by limitations by costs of replication fidelity or limitations imposed by the drift limit, as already proposed in the literature [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. Furthermore and in line with Drakeâ€™s observation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>], our results indicate that the mutation rate can be expected to be relatively similar among organisms experiencing different habitats. Though the frequency of beneficial mutations remains an elusive quantity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>], empirical estimations of beneficial mutations in 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span> seem to be far below the lowest scenario investigated in this model [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. If this observation applies to sexual species as well, the evolution of the mutation rate towards elevated values under sexual recombination will become even less likely. It is important to consider that conclusions derived from this study apply under the assumption of a mutator locus affecting replication fidelity. The presence and action of other mechanisms affecting the mutation rate (e.g., epigenetics mechanisms) may affect the results as reported in this study [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Therefore, when the percentage of beneficial mutations is small, and populations are not large enough, sexual species (especially multicellular ones) producing few offspring may be expected to buffer their ability for local adaptation mainly through standing genetic variation and plasticity, provided that movement opportunities are constrained. Future work should focus on understanding the potential role of standing genetic variation, polygenic selection, epigenetics and phenotypic plasticity in the ability for local adaptation of sexual species under scenarios of directional climate change and when the probability of beneficial mutations is low.
