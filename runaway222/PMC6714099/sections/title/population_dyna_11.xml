 <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ndividuals in the population were characterized by the following traits: sex, stage (whether adult or juvenile), phenotype 
  <span class="italic">zi</span>, determined by the alleles at the adaptation locus, and a mutator locus whose alleles determine the genetic mutation rate. The phenotype and the mutator locus were considered evolving traits for the model. At the beginning of each simulation run, the population composed of 1000 individuals, at carrying capacity 
  <span class="italic">K</span>, was assumed to be locally adapted. Therefore the alleles coding for the phenotype were initialized randomly from a normal distribution centered in 
  <span class="italic">θ</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">0</span>
  </sub> and variance 
  <span class="italic">V = VG / 2 L</span>, where 
  <span class="italic">VG</span> is the initial genetic variance present in the population, and 
  <span class="italic">L</span> the number of loci which was set to 1 for all runs in this study. The phenotype 
  <span class="italic">z</span> of individual 
  <span class="italic">i</span> was determined by additive effects of alleles at the adaptation locus. As in Cobben et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>] the mutation rate was given by 
  <span class="italic">μ = 10</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">-exp</span>
  </span>, where 
  <span class="italic">exp = (l</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">m,1</span>
  </sub> 
  <span class="italic">+ l</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">m,2</span>
  </sub>
  <span class="italic">) / 2</span>. The alleles at the mutator locus 
  <span class="italic">l</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">m,1</span>
  </sub> and 
  <span class="italic">l</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">m,2</span>
  </sub> were initialized randomly according to a discrete uniform distribution in range 
  <span class="italic">[2; 4]</span>. Therefore, the model’s initial conditions already incorporated intraspecific variation in the mutation rate between individuals in the population (initial mean mutation rate of 
  <span class="italic">10</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">− 3</span>
  </span>). Assuming initial intraspecific variation in the mutation rate facilitates its evolutionary dynamic and reduces an otherwise relatively high extinction risk during early simulation time.
