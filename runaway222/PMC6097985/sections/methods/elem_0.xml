  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nine 100-year, repeating annual cycle simulations were conducted in CAM5 coupled to the mixed-layer ocean: one control simulation, and eight regionally perturbed simulations. The control simulation is a year 2000 climate with non-biomass burning anthropogenic black carbon, organic carbon, sulfur dioxide (SO
   <sub>2</sub>), and sulfate (SO
   <sub>4</sub>) emissions fields set to 1850 values. In each of the eight regionally perturbed simulations, the relevant region is populated with that region’s year 2000 values, scaled at every regional grid point and time step to achieve additional total annual emissions equivalent to China’s total year 2000 values: 22.4 Tg sulfate precursor, 1.61 Tg of black carbon emissions, and 4.03 Tg of organic carbon emissions. The 1850 and 2000 baseline emissions fields on which these are based are CAM5’s standard historical emissions fields
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
   </span>, and the resulting emissions fields used to drive simulations are publicly accessible to allow for replication in other model suites (see Data availability).

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The eight regions were defined according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s regional definitions, and are shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>. These eight geopolitical regions were selected to sample major past, present, or projected future emitting economies located in a range of climate regimes. Western Europe and the United States, major emitting regions over the historical period, were chosen to sample the response to aerosols emitted in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude climate regions with different longitudinal locations and associated storm track regimes. India and China, current major emitting regions, were chosen to capture the response to two different monsoonal paradigms. The projected potential future emitting regions
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
   </span>, Indonesia, Brazil, East Africa, and South Africa, were chosen to assess the impact of aerosols emitted in the following respective climate regimes: the deep convective western Pacific warm pool region, the Pacific and Atlantic basin branches of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes. The regional signals cited throughout the manuscript are calculated as the difference between the corresponding regionally perturbed simulation and the control simulation over the final 60 years of each simulation.

  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although black carbon, sulfate, and organic carbon aerosol have somewhat opposing optical properties and global-mean top-of-atmosphere radiative effects, which can complicate analysis when they are co-emitted, we choose to include all of these species in each simulation. The species are co-emitted by many industrial processes, and their mitigation and growth often occur in tandem—a characteristic seen in their Representative Concentration Pathway and Shared Socioeconomic Pathway trajectories
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
   </span>. Analyzing the climate effects of their simultaneous mitigation or growth, therefore, is likely to provide a better proxy for the climate effects of economy-wide transitions in aerosol emissions, as has been the historical norm and as is projected across the current suite of emissions scenarios used by the climate modeling and policy communities. Simulations that include only one aerosol species may not be additive, particularly in regional responses
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
   </span>, reducing their utility in assessing the climate response to changes in multiple aerosol species simultaneously, as has been the dominant mode of aerosol emission change in reality. Future work will aim to illuminate the degree of additivity in the multi-species response through comparison with a planned suite of complementary single species simulations.

  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effective radiative forcing (ERF) values are calculated using a suite of 9 CAM5 simulations formulated in the same way as the mixed-layer ocean simulations described above, but with the mixed-layer ocean and sea ice module replaced with a repeating annual cycle of observed year 2000 sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice coverage. These simulations are run for 60 years, the model equilibrates within the first 20 years, and the final 40 years of the simulation are used in the ERF calculation. The ERF is calculated as the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance between the control and regional fixed-SST simulation, i.e., after atmospheric and land surface temperatures have been allowed to adjust to the regional emissions. This follows the Fixed SST radiative forcing definition described in Myhre et al.

Use of radiative kernels generated within the same climate model as the simulations to which they are applied, as is the case here, is generally considered to be best practice for reducing errors associated with differences in radiative transfer codes between climate models

  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The radiative kernel for a given feedback process consists of gridded monthly values of the radiative perturbation induced by a prescribed change in a given feedback process, such as surface albedo or atmospheric water vapor. These gridded kernels are then multiplied by the monthly change in the relevant feedback process for each of the regional emissions signals (see Simulations and analysis), normalized by the prescribed change used to derive the kernel. This process is used to calculate the feedbacks due to all process other than the cloud radiative feedback. The cloud radiative feedback is calculated using the adjusted cloud radiative effect method
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
   </span>. In this method, a cloud radiative effect is calculated as the difference between the all-sky and clear-sky (i.e., non-cloud-permitting) top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance. This cloud radiative effect is then adjusted for potential contamination by non-cloud factors through subtraction of the kernel-calculated cloudy-sky (i.e., all-sky kernel minus clear-sky kernel) values of the other feedbacks. This method has been shown to provide a reliable estimate for cloud feedbacks relative to other, more computationally prohibitive, methods
