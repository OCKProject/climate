            Community Atmosphere Model 5 (NCAR CAM5), the atmospheric component of the Community
            Earth System Model 1
            <span><a>52</a></span>, coupled to a mixed-layer ocean. Mixed-layer coupling provides benefits in decreased
            computational intensity compared to full-ocean coupling, and has been found to lead
            to similar responses to full ocean coupling in the CESM model suite using an earlier
            version of the CESM atmospheric model
            <span><a>53</a></span>. This similarity is expected to hold with use of CAM5
            <span><a>54</a></span>. Simulations using CAM5 coupled to a slab ocean have been widely used in the peer-reviewed
            literature
            <span><a>54</a>–
               <a>56</a></span>, including to assess the climate response to aerosols
            <span><a>57</a>,
               <a>58</a></span>. NCAR CAM5 contains a fully interactive aerosol scheme, which transports and removes
            the emitted aerosols according to the model’s meteorology. We use the CAM5 model with
            its three mode modal aerosol module (MAM3)
            <span><a>59</a></span>, containing internal mixing of black carbon, sulfate, and organic carbon with other
            aerosol species using the volume mixing rule. Refractive indices for sulfate and organic
            carbon are taken from Hess et al.
            <span><a>60</a></span> and for black carbon is taken from Bond et al.
            <span><a>61</a></span>. CAM5 also includes aerosol indirect effects on clouds and the radiative effects
            of black carbon deposition on ice.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nine 100-year, repeating annual cycle simulations were conducted in CAM5 coupled to
            the mixed-layer ocean: one control simulation, and eight regionally perturbed simulations.
            The control simulation is a year 2000 climate with non-biomass burning anthropogenic
            black carbon, organic carbon, sulfur dioxide (SO
            <sub>2</sub>), and sulfate (SO
            <sub>4</sub>) emissions fields set to 1850 values. In each of the eight regionally perturbed simulations,
            the relevant region is populated with that region’s year 2000 values, scaled at every
            regional grid point and time step to achieve additional total annual emissions equivalent
            to China’s total year 2000 values: 22.4 Tg sulfate precursor, 1.61 Tg of black carbon
            emissions, and 4.03 Tg of organic carbon emissions. The 1850 and 2000 baseline emissions
            fields on which these are based are CAM5’s standard historical emissions fields
            <span><a>1</a></span>, and the resulting emissions fields used to drive simulations are publicly accessible
            to allow for replication in other model suites (see Data availability).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The eight regions were defined according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
            Change’s regional definitions, and are shown in Fig. 
            <a>1a</a>. These eight geopolitical regions were selected to sample major past, present, or
            projected future emitting economies located in a range of climate regimes. Western
            Europe and the United States, major emitting regions over the historical period, were
            chosen to sample the response to aerosols emitted in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude
            climate regions with different longitudinal locations and associated storm track regimes.
            India and China, current major emitting regions, were chosen to capture the response
            to two different monsoonal paradigms. The projected potential future emitting regions
            <span><a>62</a></span>, Indonesia, Brazil, East Africa, and South Africa, were chosen to assess the impact
            of aerosols emitted in the following respective climate regimes: the deep convective
            western Pacific warm pool region, the Pacific and Atlantic basin branches of the Intertropical
            Convergence Zone, and the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes. The regional signals cited
            throughout the manuscript are calculated as the difference between the corresponding
            regionally perturbed simulation and the control simulation over the final 60 years
            of each simulation.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although black carbon, sulfate, and organic carbon aerosol have somewhat opposing
            optical properties and global-mean top-of-atmosphere radiative effects, which can
            complicate analysis when they are co-emitted, we choose to include all of these species
            in each simulation. The species are co-emitted by many industrial processes, and their
            mitigation and growth often occur in tandem—a characteristic seen in their Representative
            Concentration Pathway and Shared Socioeconomic Pathway trajectories
            <span><a>28</a>,
               <a>29</a></span>. Analyzing the climate effects of their simultaneous mitigation or growth, therefore,
            is likely to provide a better proxy for the climate effects of economy-wide transitions
            in aerosol emissions, as has been the historical norm and as is projected across the
            current suite of emissions scenarios used by the climate modeling and policy communities.
            Simulations that include only one aerosol species may not be additive, particularly
            in regional responses
            <span><a>63</a></span>, reducing their utility in assessing the climate response to changes in multiple
            aerosol species simultaneously, as has been the dominant mode of aerosol emission
            change in reality. Future work will aim to illuminate the degree of additivity in
            the multi-species response through comparison with a planned suite of complementary
            single species simulations.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effective radiative forcing (ERF) values are calculated using a suite of 9 CAM5 simulations
            formulated in the same way as the mixed-layer ocean simulations described above, but
            with the mixed-layer ocean and sea ice module replaced with a repeating annual cycle
            of observed year 2000 sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice coverage. These
            simulations are run for 60 years, the model equilibrates within the first 20 years,
            and the final 40 years of the simulation are used in the ERF calculation. The ERF
            is calculated as the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance between the control and
            regional fixed-SST simulation, i.e., after atmospheric and land surface temperatures
            have been allowed to adjust to the regional emissions. This follows the Fixed SST
            radiative forcing definition described in Myhre et al.

            to which they are applied, as is the case here, is generally considered to be best

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The radiative kernel for a given feedback process consists of gridded monthly values
            of the radiative perturbation induced by a prescribed change in a given feedback process,
            such as surface albedo or atmospheric water vapor. These gridded kernels are then
            multiplied by the monthly change in the relevant feedback process for each of the
            regional emissions signals (see Simulations and analysis), normalized by the prescribed
            change used to derive the kernel. This process is used to calculate the feedbacks
            due to all process other than the cloud radiative feedback. The cloud radiative feedback
            is calculated using the adjusted cloud radiative effect method
            <span><a>64</a></span>. In this method, a cloud radiative effect is calculated as the difference between
            the all-sky and clear-sky (i.e., non-cloud-permitting) top-of-atmosphere radiative
            imbalance. This cloud radiative effect is then adjusted for potential contamination
            by non-cloud factors through subtraction of the kernel-calculated cloudy-sky (i.e.,
            all-sky kernel minus clear-sky kernel) values of the other feedbacks. This method
            has been shown to provide a reliable estimate for cloud feedbacks relative to other,
            more computationally prohibitive, methods
