 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results demonstrate that geographic location substantially influences the cooling potential of a given aerosol emission. Crucially, countries that historically have or presently do account for the majority of anthropogenic aerosol emissions—Europe, the U.S., and China—are the regions whose emissions have the largest cooling potential. Meanwhile, regions with rapid current emissions growth and/or that are projected to be the dominant sources of anthropogenic emissions going forward—such as India and East Africa—have the smallest cooling potential. This suggests that the historical spatial distribution of anthropogenic emissions may have had a larger cooling potential than will the emissions distribution of the future. Aerosol emissions are projected to decline over the 21st century, as countries increasingly value the air quality benefits of aerosol mitigation

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. However, these findings suggest that the rate at which anthropogenic aerosol emissions offset global-mean greenhouse gas-driven warming may decline more rapidly than changes in global total emissions alone would indicate, due to the additional effects of the simultaneous spatial redistribution of emissions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While fully coupled climate models will capture the effects of these changes in overall rate of offsetting, the reduced form integrated assessment models (IAMs) and earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) used in many impact assessment settings would fail to capture this signal. The widely used dynamic integrated climate-economy (DICE) integrated assessment model, for example, assumes a time-constant translation of aerosol emissions into temperature effects in calculating future global-mean climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. It would therefore overestimate the future offsetting effect of anthropogenic aerosol emissions, if their global distribution evolves toward lower potency regions as our results suggest.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These findings have additional implications for estimates of climate sensitivity from historical observations. Estimates of the transient climate response (TCR) and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to a doubling of CO
  <sub>2</sub> have been attempted from global-mean historical temperature and forcing estimates
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Recent studies have argued that the different efficacies of individual forcings operating over the historical period must be factored into these observationally-based estimates of TCR and ECS, but do so using time-invariant estimates of efficacy
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. The TCR and ECS are estimated via a statistical fit through the distribution of temperature change versus forcing over historical observations, using the same efficacy across the time series. Results from this study suggest that the efficacy of global aerosol forcing may have evolved substantially over the historical period as different regional emissions dominated the global total emissions. This would suggest the need for a time-evolving value for overall aerosol forcing efficacy over the observational record, potentially resulting in different estimates of TCR and ECS from these methods.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the inequality in the climate impacts of aerosols from different emitting regions has substantial ramifications for climate accounting and aerosol mitigation policy. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing differences in relative climate influence at the scale of regional aerosol emissions, as aerosols are increasingly factored into international climate policy discussions. Studies to date on the climate influence of aerosols’ heterogeneity have primarily focused on the total global distribution or on atmospheric concentrations or radiative forcings within certain latitude bands
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. The decisions influencing aerosols’ climate effects, however, manifest at the emissions level along political boundaries; increases are generally driven by national or multi-national economic policies that encourage emissions-intensive economic activity, while decreases have been largely driven by regional air quality concerns
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. A mismatch, therefore, has existed until now between the regional scale and surface emissions framing of aerosol-relevant decision-making and the hemispheric scales and atmospheric focus of previous scientific analysis.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although aerosol emissions mitigation (or its opposite) has historically occurred outside the purview of climate policy, efforts are emerging to factor the climate damage from warming revealed by aerosol mitigation into cost-benefit analyses that have historically considered only air quality benefits. Our findings highlight that calculation of these climate damages must be regionally-specific, both in determining global-mean penalties from different emitting regions and in evaluating the regional distribution of those penalties. The pronounced divergence in forcing efficacies seen here for national-scale emissions changes—the scale at which climate accounting schemes and mitigation cost-benefit analyses will be undertaken—highlights the danger associated with using global-mean radiative forcing and metrics based on it, such as global warming potentials, as a universal conversion factor for aerosols’ global-mean climate impacts across different emitting regions. These results also suggest that for certain regions, such as India, climate impacts may be dramatically stronger in the mitigating region than outside it, while for others it may not. Such inter-regional differences will influence the rate at which the localized climate penalty from revealed warming counteracts the localized air quality benefits of the aerosol mitigation.</p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These factors demonstrate that evaluation of the social cost of climate impacts from aerosol mitigation will need to be more regionalized than for long-lived greenhouse gases. The particulars of the magnitude and spatial distribution of each regional emission’s temperature effects may differ depending on the climate model used, given the substantial spread that exists in model treatment of aerosol processes

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. However, our results demonstrate that major inter-regional differences do emerge, with substantial scientific and policy implications, providing an important first step in motivating future multi-model assessment using the regional emissions framework laid out here.
