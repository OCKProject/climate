      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simulations for this study were conducted in the National Center for Atmospheric Research
         Community Atmosphere Model 5 (NCAR CAM5), the atmospheric component of the Community
         Earth System Model 1
         <span><a>52</a></span>, coupled to a mixed-layer ocean. Mixed-layer coupling provides benefits in decreased
         computational intensity compared to full-ocean coupling, and has been found to lead
         to similar responses to full ocean coupling in the CESM model suite using an earlier
         version of the CESM atmospheric model
         <span><a>53</a></span>. This similarity is expected to hold with use of CAM5
         <span><a>54</a></span>. Simulations using CAM5 coupled to a slab ocean have been widely used in the peer-reviewed
         literature
         <span><a>54</a>–
            <a>56</a></span>, including to assess the climate response to aerosols
         <span><a>57</a>,
            <a>58</a></span>. NCAR CAM5 contains a fully interactive aerosol scheme, which transports and removes
         the emitted aerosols according to the model’s meteorology. We use the CAM5 model with
         its three mode modal aerosol module (MAM3)
         <span><a>59</a></span>, containing internal mixing of black carbon, sulfate, and organic carbon with other
         aerosol species using the volume mixing rule. Refractive indices for sulfate and organic
         carbon are taken from Hess et al.
         <span><a>60</a></span> and for black carbon is taken from Bond et al.
         <span><a>61</a></span>. CAM5 also includes aerosol indirect effects on clouds and the radiative effects
         of black carbon deposition on ice.
