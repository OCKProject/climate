         methods
         <span><a>64</a>â€“
            <a>66</a></span>, using radiative kernels generated in the NCAR CESM-CAM5 model
         <span><a>67</a></span> and associated kernel calculation code provided by Pendergrass (
         <span>https://github.com/apendergrass/cam5-kernels</span>). Use of radiative kernels generated within the same climate model as the simulations
         to which they are applied, as is the case here, is generally considered to be best
         practice for reducing errors associated with differences in radiative transfer codes
         between climate models

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The radiative kernel for a given feedback process consists of gridded monthly values
         of the radiative perturbation induced by a prescribed change in a given feedback process,
         such as surface albedo or atmospheric water vapor. These gridded kernels are then
         multiplied by the monthly change in the relevant feedback process for each of the
         regional emissions signals (see Simulations and analysis), normalized by the prescribed
         change used to derive the kernel. This process is used to calculate the feedbacks
         due to all process other than the cloud radiative feedback. The cloud radiative feedback
         is calculated using the adjusted cloud radiative effect method
         <span><a>64</a></span>. In this method, a cloud radiative effect is calculated as the difference between
         the all-sky and clear-sky (i.e., non-cloud-permitting) top-of-atmosphere radiative
         imbalance. This cloud radiative effect is then adjusted for potential contamination
         by non-cloud factors through subtraction of the kernel-calculated cloudy-sky (i.e.,
         all-sky kernel minus clear-sky kernel) values of the other feedbacks. This method
         has been shown to provide a reliable estimate for cloud feedbacks relative to other,
         more computationally prohibitive, methods
