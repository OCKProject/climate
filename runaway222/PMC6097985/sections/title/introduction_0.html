      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global distribution of anthropogenic aerosol emissions has evolved substantially
         over the industrial era. In the mid-20th century, North America and Western Europe
         were the primary anthropogenic aerosol source regions, whereas today South and East
         Asian sources dominate anthropogenic aerosol emissions
         <span><a>1</a></span>. Aerosol particles have direct negative impacts on air quality, human health, and
         agricultural productivity in the regions in which they are concentrated
         <span><a>2</a>–
            <a>4</a></span>, but also change regional and global climate through their interactions with solar
         radiation and clouds. In the global total, anthropogenic aerosols are estimated to
         have offset approximately a third of the global-mean greenhouse gas driven warming
         since the 1950s
         <span><a>5</a></span>. However, because of aerosols’ relatively short atmospheric lifetime, their atmospheric
         distribution and temperature effects are heterogeneous and dependent on the distribution
         of emissions
         <span><a>6</a></span>. With this geographic redistribution of aerosol emissions, therefore, comes the potential
         for redistribution of their climate effects—a characteristic not present with long-lived
         greenhouse gases.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aerosols’ heterogeneous spatial distribution is recognized to influence their overall
         climate impact relative to more homogeneous climate forcers, like carbon dioxide
         <span><a>7</a>,
            <a>8</a></span>. Although carbon dioxide radiative forcing has some spatial structure associated
         with the climatological radiative environment
         <span><a>9</a></span>, the historical spatial distribution of aerosol forcing has been shown to generate
         a larger transient and equilibrium global-mean climate response than equivalent amounts
         of long-lived greenhouse gas forcing, as a result of historical aerosol forcing’s
         greater spatial coincidence with Northern Hemisphere land and polar regions
         <span><a>10</a>–
            <a>12</a></span>. This difference in the rate at which aerosols’ top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing
         produces global-mean temperature effects relative to greenhouse gases’ is characterized
         by the efficacy of its radiative forcing
         <span><a>7</a></span> (i.e., global-mean temperature response divided by global-mean top-of-atmosphere
         radiative forcing), and is a major factor in determining the degree to which anthropogenic
         aerosols have offset greenhouse-gas driven warming over the historical period
         <span><a>10</a>,
            <a>11</a>,
            <a>13</a></span>. Localized aerosol concentrations also strongly influence regional temperature, rainfall,
         and circulation in emitting regions
         <span><a>14</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yet, despite the acknowledged sensitivity of aerosols’ total climate impacts and the
         spatial distribution thereof to the spatial distribution of the aerosol emissions
         themselves, many scientific and policy discussions treat the climate effect of aerosol
         emissions from all regions as equal. Policy analysis continues to use single global-mean
         metric values, such as Global Warming Potential, to trade off the impacts of aerosol
         emissions from any region against greenhouse gas emissions
         <span><a>15</a></span>, despite studies demonstrating that, for certain aerosol species, this value may
         differ substantially depending on the emitting region
         <span><a>16</a>,
            <a>17</a></span>. The reduced-form integrated assessment models used to analyze costs and benefits
         of climate policy similarly treat aerosol emissions from all regions as having the
         same capacity to affect global climate
         <span><a>18</a></span>. Global-mean aerosol radiative forcing and its offsetting effects on greenhouse gas-driven
         warming, meanwhile, have not been widely recognized to be dependent on the evolution
         of global aerosol emissions’ spatial distribution
         <span><a>11</a>,
            <a>13</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scientific community has made great progress to date in building a theoretical
         framework for understanding the importance of the spatial heterogeneity in anthropogenic
         aerosol forcing. However, limitations remain in leveraging the existing literature
         to address key scientific and decision-making issues surrounding the differential
         role of aerosols emitted from different regions. Many studies assessing the temperature
         response to regionally distinct aerosol perturbations use radiative forcing or atmospheric
         aerosol concentrations as their unit of regional perturbation
         <span><a>19</a>–
            <a>21</a></span>. However, these units are not easily attributable to individual regions, as radiative
         forcing or atmospheric concentrations occurring in a given region may be attributable
         to aerosol emissions from well outside that region’s boundaries. This framing is additionally
         difficult to apply in decision-making contexts, as mitigation targets are generally
         set in terms of emissions rather than concentrations or radiative forcing. Several
         studies have looked at the effects of all aerosols within a given latitude band
         <span><a>19</a>–
            <a>23</a></span>, but this is not a geographic delineation along which mitigation decisions, emissions
         accounting, or conjunct trends in aerosol emissions occur. Other studies have assessed
         the relative effects of historical emissions or scalings thereon in different countries
         <span><a>17</a>,
            <a>23</a>–
            <a>26</a></span>. However, these emissions are unequal and therefore cannot be used straightforwardly
         to create a quantitative framework for assessing the relative importance of aerosol
         emissions from different regions in the context of the climate metrics used in many
         scientific and policy frameworks.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we address a fundamental outstanding question underpinning both the consideration
         of aerosol emissions in climate policy and the analysis of their evolving role in
         global and regional climate change and climate sensitivity: can the temperature effects
         of a unit of aerosols emitted from any major emitting economy be considered equivalent?
         We analyze the relative climate effects of identical combined sulfate, black carbon,
         and organic carbon aerosol emissions—equivalent to China’s total annual year 2000
         anthropogenic emissions
         <span><a>1</a></span>—sourced from eight major past, present, or projected future emitting regions (Fig. 
         <a>1a</a>) in a global atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a mixed-layer ocean
         model (see Methods). These three aerosol species drive the vast majority of anthropogenic
         aerosol forcing over the historical period
         <span><a>27</a></span>. They have historically varied in tandem at the national-scale, as economy-wide transitions
         have driven aerosol emissions changes over the historical period
         <span><a>1</a></span>, and are projected to continue to do so in future
         <span><a>28</a>,
            <a>29</a></span>. This novel design provides a crucial advancement by allowing for a unique one-to-one
         comparison (cleanly interpretable in scientific and decision-making contexts) between
         aerosol emissions (the perturbation unit that most directly corresponds to mitigation
         decision-making) in several past, present, or projected future major emitting geopolitical
         regions (approaching the geographic delineations along which mitigation decisions
         and emissions accounting are conducted). Our results demonstrate substantial inequalities
         in both the magnitude and spatial distribution of temperature effects of aerosol emissions
         located in different major emitting economies. These divergent temperature effects
         are fundamentally driven by differences in the degree to which each region’s emissions
         and the resulting distribution of radiative effects generate remote feedback processes,
         and reveal new challenges for understanding and addressing the global and regional
         climate influence of aerosols.
