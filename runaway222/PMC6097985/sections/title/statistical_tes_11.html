      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Error ranges for the values in Figs. 
         <a>1</a>, 
         <a>3</a>, and 
         <a>4</a>, Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>4</a> and 
         <a>6</a>, and Supplementary Table 
         <a>1</a> are calculated as the standard error of the mean, using the final 60 years of each
         simulation’s data, with the exception of the ERF values in Supplementary Table 
         <a>1</a>, which use the final 40 years of the Fixed SST simulations’ data. In each case an
         effective sample size is calculated, accounting for any autocorrelation in the time
         series
         <span><a>69</a></span>. The statistical significance masking in Fig. 
         <a>2</a> and Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>1</a>, 
         <a>2</a>, 
         <a>3</a>, 
         <a>7</a>, and 
         <a>8</a> is calculated using a one-sample 
         <span>t</span>-test, again using the final 60 years of model data with an effective sample size
         adjusted for autocorrelation
         <span><a>69</a></span>. Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>5</a> is calculated using the final 40 years of the Fixed SST simulation data. Regions
         with gridlines in these figures indicate signals that are not significant at the 95%
         confidence level. Error ranges provided for 
         <span>R</span> values are calculated using jackknife resampling
         <span><a>70</a></span>, in which the 
         <span>R</span> value is recalculated seven times, dropping one of the regions each time.
