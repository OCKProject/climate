      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our simulations reveal substantial inequality in the global-mean temperature response
         to identical total annual aerosol emissions in each region (Fig. 
         <a>1b</a>, 
         <span>y</span>-axis). The largest global mean temperature change (−0.29 ± 0.01 °C, induced in our
         simulations by emissions from Western Europe) is approximately 14 times larger than
         the smallest global mean temperature changes (−0.02 ± 0.01 °C induced by emissions
         from India). Global-mean temperature effects correlate roughly with latitude, with
         higher latitude emitting regions typically generating stronger temperature effects
         than lower latitude regions, a behavior also seen in previous studies of the response
         to aerosol forcing in different latitude bands
         <span><a>19</a></span>. However, substantial differentiation occurs within latitude bands. For example,
         emissions sourced from East Africa generate approximately four times more cooling
         (−0.06 ± 0.01 °C) than emissions from India (−0.02 ± 0.02 °C) at similar latitudes—demonstrating
         the importance of our region-by-region focus.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are also important regional distinctions in the degree to which the temperature
         changes due to aerosol emissions are likely to be concentrated in the emitting region
         versus being felt globally (Fig. 
         <a>1b</a>, placement relative to diagonals). Because aerosols generally remain concentrated
         near their source and most strongly influence surface temperature by attenuating incoming
         solar radiation to the regions they overlie, they cool the emitting region more strongly
         than the global mean in all cases (Figs. 
         <a>1b</a>, 
         <a>2</a>). However, although Indian emissions produce the smallest global-mean cooling effects,
         their impacts are much more strongly concentrated within the emitting region than
         for other regions. India experiences cooling from its own emissions at a level ~21
         times greater than the global mean (−0.42 ± 0.03 K versus −0.02 ± 0.01 K), while Western
         European, and Indonesian emissions generate localized cooling (−0.50 ± 0.06, and −0.14 ± 0.05 K,
         respectively) that is less than two times as great as the respective global-mean cooling
         (−0.29 ± 0.01, and −0.07 ± 0.01 K, respectively). As a result, even though Western
         European emissions produce ~14 times the global mean cooling effect of Indian emissions,
         India and Western Europe experience comparable regional-mean cooling from their own
         emissions. In other words, regions like Western Europe, Indonesia, and (to a slightly
         lesser extent) the United States strongly export the climate impacts of their emissions,
         while regions like India more strongly experience the cooling effects of their own
         emissions.
