      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drastic inequalities in forcing efficacy</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the rate of global-mean cancellation between the absorbing and scattering
         aerosol burdens is somewhat correlated with the top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing
         generated by each emitting region, the relative top-of-atmosphere effective radiative
         forcings are not well correlated with the relative global mean temperature change
         (Fig. 
         <a>3b</a>), indicating a substantial divergence in forcing efficacy depending on emitting region.
         The forcing efficacy of each regional emission—i.e., the global-mean temperature change
         per unit top-of-atmosphere effective radiative forcing (captured in Fig. 
         <a>4a</a> and by placement relative to the diagonal lines in Fig. 
         <a>3b</a>)—range from 0.24 ± 0.14 K(Wm
         <span>−2</span>)
         <span>−1</span> to 1.3 ± 0.06 K(Wm
         <span>−2</span>)
         <span>−1</span>. This constitutes a factor of five range in forcing efficacy between emitting regions,
         roughly twice the relative range in estimated forcing efficacy between global historical
         aerosols and greenhouse gases
         <span><a>7</a>,
            <a>34</a></span>. Emissions from the U.S. and Western Europe have the largest forcing efficacies (1.32 ± 0.06
         and 1.09 ± 0.07 K(Wm
         <span>−2</span>)
         <span>−1</span>, respectively), producing outsized temperature responses for the effective radiative
         forcing they generate. Emissions from regions like Brazil, meanwhile, produce a comparable
         effective radiative forcing to emissions from Western Europe or the U.S., but generate
         much smaller global-mean temperature change (Fig. 
         <a>3b</a>). These efficacy differences highlight the shortcomings of using global-mean radiative
         forcing to estimate the climate effects of highly regionalized forcings.

               <p>Radiative feedbacks versus forcing efficacy. Differences in forcing efficacy (
                  <span>a</span>) are largely explained by variance in the global-mean radiative gain from surface
                  albedo and cloud feedbacks (
                  <span>b</span>)—i.e., the additional top-of-atmosphere flux change from the feedback due to a unit
                  of effective radiative forcing—across emissions regions. Error bars capture the standard
                  error
