      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differing forcing efficacy is fundamentally driven by differences in how the particular
         spatiotemporal distribution of global- and annual-mean top-of-atmosphere radiative
         forcing excites feedback processes that contribute to eventual temperature change.
         This forcing-feedback framework can be represented mathematically as:

         determine the extent to which the temperature must change to achieve re-equilibration.
         The differing spatial distributions of the radiative forcing (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>5</a>) versus the surface temperature responses (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>) demonstrates a role for these remote feedback processes in setting the temperature

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that the differences in forcing efficacy across emitting region can be largely
         explained by differences in the degree to which the top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing
         from each regional emission excites top-of-atmosphere surface albedo radiative feedbacks
         and cloud radiative feedbacks. For each feedback process, we characterize its relative
         rate of excitement by a given region’s emissions as the radiative gain: the ratio
         of radiative perturbation from the feedback (

         </div>) to the initial radiative forcing generated by the emission (d
         <span>F</span>). Water vapor feedbacks show relatively small and uncorrelated differences in radiative
         gain across emitting region (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>6</a>). However, surface albedo feedbacks—driven primarily by sea ice changes—and cloud
         feedbacks vary in correspondence with the differences in efficacy (Fig. 
         <a>4</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>6</a>). The regional differences in the combined radiative gain from the cloud and surface
         albedo feedbacks (Fig. 
         <a>4b</a>) explains 84% (
         <span>R</span> = 0.84, 0.71–0.91) of the variance in efficacy across regional emissions (Fig. 
         <a>4a</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differences in radiative gain from surface albedo feedbacks and the associated
         forcing efficacies sort roughly by latitude of emissions. The surface albedo feedback
         is dominantly driven by sea ice changes (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>5</a>) in both the Arctic and Antarctic, and manifests in increased spatial extent and
         temporal duration of the sea ice. Forcing from Western European and Chinese emissions
         strongly increases sea ice in both the Arctic and Antarctic, inducing a strong surface
         albedo feedback radiative gain, while forcing induced by Indian and Brazilian emissions
         has relatively little effect. The sea ice responses are not strongly spatially collocated
         with the respective radiative forcings (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>5</a>) or atmospheric aerosol burdens (Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>1</a>, 
         <a>2</a>, and 
         <a>3</a>), indicating that the polar effects primarily result from changes in atmospheric
         circulations that control the energy balance of and/or sea ice dynamics in the polar
         regions, rather than in situ forcing or aerosol deposition onto the ice. This aligns
         well with previous studies that show strong dependence of sea-ice albedo feedbacks
         on the meridional placement of forcings
         <span><a>34</a>,
            <a>35</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inter-regional differences in radiative gain associated with cloud feedbacks also
         help to explain the inter-regional differences in forcing efficacy, and are partially
         driven by the climatological cloud environment with which each region’s aerosol emissions
         interact. Aerosols emitted in India, Indonesia, and Brazil produce large localized
         cloud changes (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>7</a>), associated with the dynamical and thermodynamical effects of the localized aerosol
         forcing acting on the strongly convective cloud environment in these regions
         <span><a>36</a>–
            <a>39</a></span>. The cloud changes in response to all regional emissions are primarily dynamical
         or thermodynamical—rather than microphysical—in nature, as aerosol indirect effects
         (captured by the change in cloud droplet number concentration, Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>7</a>) are locally confined and relatively uncorrelated with the maxima in cloud change.
         India’s strong cloud feedback gain and weak surface albedo feedback gain counteract
         each other in setting the relative overall efficacy of the radiative forcing from
         Indian emissions.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our simulations, the cloud feedbacks generated in several regions largely manifest
         through a north–south shift in tropical cloud cover (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>7</a>) associated with the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). This meridional ITCZ
         shift results from the large-scale atmospheric circulation adjusting to compensate
         for the hemispheric radiative imbalance induced by the localized aerosol forcing and
         its climate effects
         <span><a>40</a>–
            <a>43</a></span>. This is likely amplified by the surface albedo feedback to each regional emission,
         which will generate its own hemispheric energy imbalance
         <span><a>44</a></span>. Even in the presence of Southern Hemispheric emissions, Arctic sea ice increases
         more strongly than Antarctic sea ice in all cases (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>8</a>). This is likely attributable to the stronger overall regional climate sensitivity
         of the Arctic relative to the Antarctic
         <span><a>45</a>–
            <a>47</a></span>. This common hemispheric imbalance in sea ice response contributes to the comparable
         ITCZ shifts seen in response to many of the regional aerosol emissions.
