         <p>Relationships between aerosol burden, radiative forcing, and temperature change. The
            ratio of aerosol optical depth produced by the atmospheric burden of sulfate, black
            carbon, and organic carbon to its absorbing component (AOD/AAOD) (
            <span>a</span>, 
            <span>y</span>-axis) explains 60% of variance in effective radiative forcing (

            <span>b</span>,
