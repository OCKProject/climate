  <p>Radiative feedbacks versus forcing efficacy. Differences in forcing efficacy (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) are largely explained by variance in the global-mean radiative gain from surface albedo and cloud feedbacks (
   <span class="bold">b</span>)—i.e., the additional top-of-atmosphere flux change from the feedback due to a unit of effective radiative forcing—across emissions regions. Error bars capture the standard error
