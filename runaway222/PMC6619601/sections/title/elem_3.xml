 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surveys were conducted in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, NE India (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217549.g001" href="#pone.0217549.g001">Fig 1A</a>) from 2013–2015. The coordinates for all survey points fell between 27.006 and 28.622 degrees North, and between 91.985 and 96.545 degrees East. Surveys were carried out during the monsoon (May-July), which is the breeding season for the majority of the regional avifauna. 201 survey points were selected at elevations ranging from 118–4354 meters in altitude; areas both along and away from roads were included, as were points from both protected and non-protected areas. Efforts were made to randomize across vegetation types at particular altitudes. At each survey point, two observers compiled comprehensive lists of all species seen/heard at ten minute intervals. Most sites were visited multiple times in order to assess detectability; sites were visited for an average of 9 intervals (range 1–30). In all, surveys totaled 328 hours of effort. Point localities for some species, generally those of conservation concern, were also collected opportunistically. We were able to record 375 species, 215 of which were recorded at a minimum of five survey points (see
