 <div class="title">Relationship between morphological difference and elevational overlaps for sympatric congeneric sister species pairs.</div>
 <p>(a) Spatial co-occurrence; t = 2.59, df = 32, p = 0.014, r
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.17. (b) Range-size corrected elevational overlap; t = 2.42, p = 0.021,r
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.15. In both cases, morphologically dissimilar species are expected to have greater overlaps in range. Open circles represent individual sympatric congeneric sister species pairs; dashed line indicates linear regression fit.
