 <div class="title">Relationship between Moran’s I for PC1 and Moran’s I for central elevation.</div>
 <p>Negative values of Moran’s I indicate overdispersed traits, though all results are not significantly different from a null expectation. Open circles represent individual genera; dashed line indicates best fit linear regression (t = 3.95, df = 22, p&lt;0.001, r
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.41).
