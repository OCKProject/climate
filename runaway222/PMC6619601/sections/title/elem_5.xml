 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each species at each point, the data consisted of a series of successes (1) or failures (0) to detect the species at each interval at each survey point (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217549.s002" href="#pone.0217549.s002">S2 Table</a> in the Supporting Information for the full dataset of species detections). We modelled the elevational range using a generalized additive model (GAM) with a logit link function on this binomial data; we constrained the fit to a cubic smoothing spline with three knots, as elevational ranges are generally unimodal. The GAM output was then normalized to have a maximum value of 1. Pairwise elevational overlaps were taken to be ratio of the intersection to the union for the output curves (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217549.g002" href="#pone.0217549.g002">Fig 2</a>); these were calculated using numerical integration. For each species, we also determined the central elevation as the 50
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile value of the GAM curve.

   <p>Solid lines represent generalized additive model (GAM) predictions based on survey data; open circles represent the proportion of surveys at a given location in which each species was detected. Notably, Blue-throated and Golden-throated Barbet are similarly sized and segregate altitudinally; Great Barbet, which is much larger, overlaps broadly with both.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A common critique of studies using coexistence to make ecological inferences is the lack of a suitable null model [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref034">34</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref037">37</a>]. Through chance alone, species occupying wide ranges of elevation will overlap more than species occupying narrow ranges of elevation. We therefore generated a null expectation for the elevational overlap for a given pair of species based on the size of their altitudinal preferences. It is known that bird diversity in the Eastern Himalayas relates to elevation [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref022">22</a>]. We used a smoothing spline to estimate this relationship based on the average number of species observed per ten minute interval at each site. For both species being compared, we used this relationship as the basis of a Monte Carlo draw to provide a randomized central elevation. We then shifted the actual altitudinal preferences of both species upslope or downslope to align it with the randomized central elevation and calculated the resulting altitudinal overlap. This was performed 100 times for each species pair, with the calculated altitudinal overlaps then averaged to create a null expectation. We then subtracted this value from the observed elevational overlap. A value of zero indicates a species pair that was observed to overlap in altitude as much as would be expected from chance alone given the size of the altitudinal bands they occupy; values below and above zero indicate less overlap than expected from chance and more overlap than expected from chance respectively. We refer to this as the range-size corrected elevational overlap (RSCEO).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, elevational overlap alone is not necessarily indicative of sympatric coexistence. It is possible for a given species pair to overlap broadly in altitude, yet seldom coexist at a smaller spatial scale, which would be evidence of competition not captured by altitudinal overlap alone (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217549.g003" href="#pone.0217549.g003">Fig 3</a>). We therefore developed a simulation model to determine the expected number of points at which a given pair of species would be found together assuming no competition, based on the GAM models above. The non-normalized GAM output is probability that a species would be detected at a given elevation during a single time interval during our surveys. We used this probability as the basis to simulate survey data at each survey point using a Monte Carlo approach; the length of the series at each point was based on the number of intervals that site was visited. We collapsed this series of detections into a single presence/absence value, with a species being considered present if there was at least one simulated detection at a site. This was done independently for both species being compared. The simulated presence-absence data for both species was then compared site by site in order to generate a predicted number of co-occurrences, and then compared to the actual number of points the species was found together at during our surveys. From each set of simulated survey data, we calculated a competition coefficient:

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study area, Arunachal Pradesh, has several major rivers and ridges. It is known that some of these features present geographical dispersal barriers. For example, the Sela Massif forms a border between the sister species Rufous Sibia

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217549.g001" href="#pone.0217549.g001">Fig 1B</a>) based on a set of rivers and high-altitude ridges. From west to east, the dividing lines were taken to be the Sela Massif, the Kameng River, the Subansiri River, the Siang River, the Dibang River, and the Lohit River. We determined whether each species was present or absent in each subregion based on a combination of field guide maps along with our own surveys. In subregions where a species was not present, the survey data was taken to be NA rather than a 0 for GAM fitting; we also omitted pairwise comparisons of congeners not found sympatrically in at least one subregion.
