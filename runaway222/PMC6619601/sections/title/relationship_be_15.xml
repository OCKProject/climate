 <div class="title">Relationship between divergence time between species, and the strength of the correlation between morphological difference and altitudinal overlaps for those species.</div>
 <p>Y-axis represents the r value for this correlation for all species pairs with a more recent MRCA than the X-axis value. As the X-axis increases, representing the inclusion of more distantly-related species pairs, the Y-axis value approaches zero. In other words, when including distantly-related species pairs, there is no correlation between morphological difference and altitudinal overlap. This implies that competition is only a factor between closely related species.</p>
