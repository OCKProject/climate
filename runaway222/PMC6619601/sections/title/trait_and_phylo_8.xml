 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We had two main sources of trait data. Measures of head length, body length and overall length for all species were obtained from Rasmussen and Anderton 2005; measures of bill length/width/depth, tarsal thickness and wing chord for most passerine species were obtained from the supplemental material of Price et al 2014. These traits are known to correspond to functional aspects of a birdâ€™s ecology and foraging behaviour [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For phylogenetic data, we relied on global bird phylogeny created by Jetz et al [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref025">25</a>]. This phylogeny was generated by assigning species to a set of crown clades and generating trees for these clades, then combining them onto a set of backbone clades [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref025">25</a>]. We downloaded a sample of 1000 trees from a pseudo-posterior distribution, including all species found during our surveys as tips [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref025">25</a>] (trees available in Supporting Information, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217549.s005" href="#pone.0217549.s005">S1 Tree</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217549.s006" href="#pone.0217549.s006">S2 Tree</a>). From these, we calculated the pairwise patristic distance between all species. These distances were used to select a set of congeneric sister species (CSS) found during our surveys, as it is generally thought that the competition is strongest between closely related taxa; species belonging to a genus with only two representatives in our surveys were considered a part of the CSS set. It is worth noting that the sister taxon for the majority of Eastern Himalayan passerine species is extralimital [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref022">22</a>]. Among the 210 species detected at 5 or more points, we were able to form 35 CSS pairs. From these, we excluded the aerial insectivores 
  <span class="italic">Delichon nipalense</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Delichon dasypus</span>, as their habit of foraging at high altitudes makes it difficult to interpret survey occurrences as being representative of their breeding ranges. The full list of 34 CSS pairs is available in the Supporting Information,

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We based the taxonomy for this study on the IOC World List v. 7.1; all datasets describe above were reconciled to this taxonomy. One species pair, 
  <span class="italic">Psittiparus ruficeps</span> &amp; 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">bakeri</span>, was not found in the phylogenetic data and was therefore excluded from those analyses; the two taxa were considered conspecific unt recently and are currently thought to exist only in allopatry.
