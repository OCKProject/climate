 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The available morphological variables were highly collinear, making direct interpretation complex. To overcome this, the morphological variables were log-transformed and a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217549.g004" href="#pone.0217549.g004">Fig 4</a>). The first component, corresponding to overall size, explained over 78% of the variation in the data; the first three explained over 93% of the variation. Missing passerine data was predicted using the PCA fit from the passerine species in the Price et al dataset, based on values in the Rasmussen and Anderton dataset. We tested the relationship between morphological dissimilarity and range overlaps by regressing measures of range overlaps against the Euclidean distance between species in PC space.

   <p>PC1 explains the vast majority of the data, 78.9%; the first three principal components explain 93.6% of the data. PC1 broadly corresponds to overall body size; PC2 corresponds to large-billedness, and PC3 corresponds to long-tailedness.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, we wanted to test the oft-asserted notion that the strength of competition is stronger among closely related species. We did this by applying varying time cutoffs to the phylogeny. For each individual cutoff, we selected species pairs with a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) more recent than the cutoff. We then calculated the correlation between range overlaps and morphological similarity for those species pairs. Finally, we looked at the relationship between the cutoff chosen and the correlation between range overlap and morphological similarity.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined the effects of phylogenetics on traits using several methods. Moran’s I is a measure of spatial autocorrelation, which gives the relationship between a matrix of pairwise differences of some quantity and a matrix of pairwise spatial distances between them [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref051">51</a>]. However, it can be extended to use in a phylogenetic context by replacing spatial distances with phylogenetic distances [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref052">52</a>]. Positive values of Moran’s I indicate that closely related species are closer in trait space than would be expected; we generated the null expectation for Moran’s I by using Brownian Motion (BM) simulations on the consensus phylogeny. Abouheif’s C
  <sub>mean</sub> is a similar test that uses a distance matrix where the major diagonal can take on nonzero values [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref053">53</a>]. We calculated Moran’s I and Abouheif’s C
  <sub>mean</sub> for morphology by assigning the values of PC1-PC4 as continuous traits. We calculated these measures for the altitude occupied by treating the central altitude as a quantitative trait, and creating a pairwise distance matrix accordingly. To test whether phylogenetic uncertainty could affect these results, we calculated Moran’s I and Abouheif’s C
  <sub>mean</sub> for 100 randomly selected trees individual phylogenetic trees, as well as for our consensus tree.
