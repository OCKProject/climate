 <div class="title">Simulated vs. actual co-occurrence in three species of 
  <span class="italic">Psilopogon</span> barbet.
 </div>
 <p>(a) Golden-throated (yellow) and Blue-throated Barbet (blue). (b) Golden-throated (yellow) and Great Barbet (red). Left figures show relationship between habitat suitability and elevation for each species; open circles represent presence/absence at each survey point. Right figures show box-and-whisker plots of simulated co-occurrences across 5000 simulations; red dashed line represents the actual number of co-occurrences during surveys. Golden-throated and Blue-throated Barbets are similar sized; Great Barbet is much larger.</p>
