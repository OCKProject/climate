 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strength of interspecific competition is an oft-debated topic in community ecology, particularly as it pertains to high-diversity ecosystems. Interspecific competition has long been thought to reduce diversity through competitive exclusion [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref004">4</a>]. The principle of competitive exclusion generally states that stable coexistence between two species cannot occur if those species share the same niche, in the absence of other mechanisms such as dispersal limitations [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref005">5</a>]. High-diversity areas pose a challenge to this idea, as they possess seemingly far fewer niches than species [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref006">6</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref008">8</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Niche differentiation is a process in which new niches can be created for species in a community by partitioning existing niches. This in turn can result in disruptive selection, causing character displacement [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref009">9</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref010">10</a>]. Through the creation of new niches in a community, resulting in greater access to exclusive resources, high diversity can exist stably in the presence of strong competitive interactions. An alternative paradigm, the unified neutral theory of biodiversity, has also been proposed as an explanation for species coexistence in high-diversity ecosystems. This alternative postulates that all individuals of all species in the same trophic level in an ecosystem are ecologically equivalent and therefore competitively neutral, with coexistence maintained by dispersal and stochastic local extinction and colonization events [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref012">12</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Neutral theory has generated a significant amount of controversy, and some tests of its predictions have been negative (see e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref013">13</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref015">15</a>]). There is little empirical evidence to support the notion of competitive neutrality between individuals of all species in a community [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref016">16</a>]. Nevertheless, it appears that neutral theory can provide a reasonable approximation of the patterns seen in certain systems (see e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref017">17</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref019">19</a>]), although this does not preclude other explanations. Moreover, a weaker extension of neutral theory, which postulates that species in a community have equivalent average fitness, is well supported in stable communities [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref016">16</a>]. Additionally, nearly neutral communities, where single species violate neutrality, may also give rise to similar patterns [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref020">20</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Eastern Himalayas are a global biodiversity hotspot [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref021">21</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref022">22</a>]. In particular, they have the highest passerine bird density on the planet [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref022">22</a>]. Invasions from Southeast and Central Asia, followed by vicariance, are thought to have built up the avian biodiversity in this region, with most terminal splits dating pre-Pleistocene [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref023">23</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref024">24</a>]. This implies that the avian community in the Eastern Himalayas has likely been static in composition for a long period of time. Birds are a tractable study system as they are numerous and conspicuous, they can be readily identified to the species level in the field, and their taxonomy has been well established [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref025">25</a>]. Therefore, the Eastern Himalayan avifauna offers an excellent system to test the degree to which competitive dynamics might affect structure a diverse community on both short-term and evolutionary timescales. There is some 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> reason for expecting competition to be a strong force in this system. Studies on individual clades have indicated that competition is important [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref026">26</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref028">28</a>]. Moreover, a recent study by Srinivasan et al 2018 assigned a strong role to competition in determining altitudinal range limits [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref029">29</a>]. On the other hand, another recent study, Elsen et al 2017, suggested that abiotic variables play the primary role in setting altitudinal range limits, with the effects of biotic interactions such as competition being comparatively small [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref030">30</a>]. This may suggest that neutral dynamics predominate in the system. However, the latter study did not rule out the possibility that narrow ranges of thermal tolerance may themselves have evolved as a consequence of niche differentiation over evolutionary timescales.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we adopt a coexistence-based approach to analyzing the strength of competitive species interactions in Eastern Himalayan avifauna. Patterns of species coexistence have been used as a proxy for testing competition for many years since the classic studies by Diamond [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref031">31</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref032">32</a>]. With the increasing availability of phylogenetic data, an equivalent method is the age-range correlation, where the range overlaps of species are correlated with their phylogenetic relatedness–a negative relationship is assumed to indicate the presence of competitive interactions between them that have mediated secondary contact post-speciation [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref033">33</a>]. However, neither of these approaches can be applied naïvely. Null models are required to properly interpret co-occurrence data [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref034">34</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref035">35</a>], with pairwise analyses being suggested as a preferable alternative [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref036">36</a>]. On the other hand, age-range correlation analyses can be affected by signals from allopatric speciation alone, in the absence of any secondary contact, though this is mitigated by the fact that most Eastern Himalayan species are most closely related to species outside the Eastern Himalayas [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref022">22</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref037">37</a>]. A careful approach accounting for both evolutionary dynamics and phylogenetic confounding variables is required to correctly understand the implications of community-wide co-occurrence data.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If, as posited by Srinivasan et al, competition is a critical driver of range limits in this system, then following post-speciation secondary contact, coexistence could be maintained by altitudinal stratification, with little spatial overlap between closely related species. Alternatively, species pairs could diverge along functional trait axes, resulting in character displacement and allowing for spatial overlap. In this study, we therefore hypothesize that competition would result in a significant positive correlation between pairwise spatial overlap and morphological differentiation, with more morphologically distinct species pairs co-occurring more frequently. Moreover, it is often stated that competition is stronger between closely related species, but this is seldom explicitly examined. We therefore hypothesize that the strength of the correlation between morphology and spatial overlap will decrease when examining distantly-related species pairs. We also anticipate that measures of phylogenetic dispersion for both traits and occupied altitudes will show positive phylogenetic autocorrelation (i.e. underdispersion of traits) when examining the phylogeny of the entire breeding bird community, as closely related species converge on fitness peaks suitable for a given life history. Finally, we anticipate that examining the same measures of phylogenetic autocorrelation at the scale of individual genera should show the opposite pattern, due to competition forcing species away from optimized traits to allow for coexistence between closely related species.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A better understanding of the preponderance of niche versus neutral dynamics in a community can lead to a better understanding of species’ range limits. The mechanistic limitations of a species’ range arise from a complex set of evolutionary and ecological factors [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref038">38</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref040">40</a>]. Species are subject to physiological limitations that in turn may have arisen from purifying selection due to competition [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref041">41</a>]. By contrast, interspecies competition can help set the range limits of species even in the absence of physiological limitations [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref029">29</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref030">30</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref042">42</a>]. Similarly, dispersal may affect local adaptation at the edges of a species’ range in the absence of any biotic factors [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref043">43</a>]. The presence of parasites and pathogens can also impose selective pressures reinforcing range limits [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref044">44</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the mechanisms behind the maintenance of range limits is critical in understanding how spatial ranges may change in response to changing environments. This is especially pressing in the context of climate change, a potential major driver of such novel assemblages [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref045">45</a>]. Climate change has already caused shifts in species’ ranges, and this is expected to accelerate over the next century [
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref045">45</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217549.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217549.ref047">47</a>]. As species move around on a continental scale, species currently found in allopatry or parapatry may become increasingly sympatric. It is critical to understand whether these species may then exclude each other due to competition, or whether they will be able to stably coexist. Species whose ranges limits are partially determined by competitive interactions may suffer increased losses if climate changes forces the abiotic components of their niche into greater geographical overlap. Alternatively, species may benefit from the displacement of a competitor. Moreover, species whose range limits are determined by biotic rather than physiological constraints may be better able to adapt rapidly to climate change. Alternatively, species subject to hard physiological limits due to selection for a narrow range of climate tolerances may be unable to adjust to changes in climate, and therefore experience range shifts. The ability to better predict this response has immediate and important consequences for the protection of biodiversity in the region.
