  <p>Solid lines represent generalized additive model (GAM) predictions based on survey data; open circles represent the proportion of surveys at a given location in which each species was detected. Notably, Blue-throated and Golden-throated Barbet are similarly sized and segregate altitudinally; Great Barbet, which is much larger, overlaps broadly with both.</p>
