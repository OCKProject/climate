   <span class="bold">Simulated and actual Moran’s I, all species, for (a) morphology and (b) elevation.</span> For morphology, the value for each species was taken to be its distance from centroid in principle component space after morphological variables. For elevation, the value for each species was taken to be the central elevation occupied by that species. Bars represent number of simulations out of a thousand resulting in a given value of Moran’s I; vertical line topped by diamond represents the observed value of Moran’s I. Positive values of Moran’s I indicate that species are more similar to their relatives than the null expectation.
