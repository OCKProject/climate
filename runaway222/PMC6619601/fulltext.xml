An approach to answering this question is to examine spatial patterns of coexistence among putatively competing species. The degree to which interspecies competition predominates in a community can have important effects on our ability predict the response of that community to perturbations, most notably climate change, when shifting species&#x02019; ranges may result in novel species assemblages. We present a study on the avifauna of the Eastern Himalayas. We hypothesize that in a community where competitive interactions predominate, there will be a relationship between pairwise altitudinal overlaps and morphological differences between species. Moreover, we hypothesize that both morphological traits and altitudinal traits depart from a Brownian motion evolution model, resulting in species trait covariances having a phylogenetic component. We find a significant relationship between morphological dissimilarity and altitudinal overlaps of species pairs. We also find that closely related species are significantly more altitudinally stratified than a null model would predict. However, as more distantly related species pairs are included in the analysis, this pattern disappears, indicating that competitive interactions predominate only in closely related species. This is further suggested by the fact that altitudinal ranges themselves are phylogenetically overdispersed at the genus level, as are morphological traits. This effect disappears when the entire phylogeny is examined, with morphology and altitude being phylogenetically underdispersed. Model fitting suggests that individual clades have evolved towards local clade-specific fitness peaks, while within-clade results show evidence of niche partitioning. We interpret these results as a tension between competition on shorter time scales and selection on longer time scales, where competition forces closely-related species away from fitness peaks in order to allow for niche separation and hence coexistence, suggesting that this effect is partially responsible for the recent diversification of Eastern Himalayan avifauna.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004630</institution-id><institution>Mohammed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>140510101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9833-517X</contrib-id><name><surname>Surya</surname><given-names>Gautam S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001429</institution-id><institution>Indo-US Science and Technology Forum</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9833-517X</contrib-id><name><surname>Surya</surname><given-names>Gautam S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by Indo-US Science and Technology Forum - Research Internships in Science and Engineering fellowship (no grant number available) - awarded to GSS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.iusstf.org/program/research-internships-in-science--engineering">https://www.iusstf.org/program/research-internships-in-science--engineering</ext-link>; University of Texas, Department of Integrative Biology startup grant (no grant number available) - awarded to GSS; and Mohamed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund (Project 140510101) - awarded to GSS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.speciesconservation.org/">https://www.speciesconservation.org/</ext-link>.

Interspecific competition has long been thought to reduce diversity through competitive exclusion [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The principle of competitive exclusion generally states that stable coexistence between two species cannot occur if those species share the same niche, in the absence of other mechanisms such as dispersal limitations [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. High-diversity areas pose a challenge to this idea, as they possess seemingly far fewer niches than species [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Niche differentiation is a process in which new niches can be created for species in a community by partitioning existing niches. This in turn can result in disruptive selection, causing character displacement [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Through the creation of new niches in a community, resulting in greater access to exclusive resources, high diversity can exist stably in the presence of strong competitive interactions. An alternative paradigm, the unified neutral theory of biodiversity, has also been proposed as an explanation for species coexistence in high-diversity ecosystems. This alternative postulates that all individuals of all species in the same trophic level in an ecosystem are ecologically equivalent and therefore competitively neutral, with coexistence maintained by dispersal and stochastic local extinction and colonization events [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Neutral theory has generated a significant amount of controversy, and some tests of its predictions have been negative (see e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). There is little empirical evidence to support the notion of competitive neutrality between individuals of all species in a community [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, it appears that neutral theory can provide a reasonable approximation of the patterns seen in certain systems (see e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]), although this does not preclude other explanations. Moreover, a weaker extension of neutral theory, which postulates that species in a community have equivalent average fitness, is well supported in stable communities [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, nearly neutral communities, where single species violate neutrality, may also give rise to similar patterns [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The Eastern Himalayas are a global biodiversity hotspot [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In particular, they have the highest passerine bird density on the planet [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Invasions from Southeast and Central Asia, followed by vicariance, are thought to have built up the avian biodiversity in this region, with most terminal splits dating pre-Pleistocene [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This implies that the avian community in the Eastern Himalayas has likely been static in composition for a long period of time. Birds are a tractable study system as they are numerous and conspicuous, they can be readily identified to the species level in the field, and their taxonomy has been well established [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, the Eastern Himalayan avifauna offers an excellent system to test the degree to which competitive dynamics might affect structure a diverse community on both short-term and evolutionary timescales. There is some <italic>a priori</italic> reason for expecting competition to be a strong force in this system. Studies on individual clades have indicated that competition is important [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, a recent study by Srinivasan et al 2018 assigned a strong role to competition in determining altitudinal range limits [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. On the other hand, another recent study, Elsen et al 2017, suggested that abiotic variables play the primary role in setting altitudinal range limits, with the effects of biotic interactions such as competition being comparatively small [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This may suggest that neutral dynamics predominate in the system. However, the latter study did not rule out the possibility that narrow ranges of thermal tolerance may themselves have evolved as a consequence of niche differentiation over evolutionary timescales.</p><p>In this study, we adopt a coexistence-based approach to analyzing the strength of competitive species interactions in Eastern Himalayan avifauna. Patterns of species coexistence have been used as a proxy for testing competition for many years since the classic studies by Diamond [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. With the increasing availability of phylogenetic data, an equivalent method is the age-range correlation, where the range overlaps of species are correlated with their phylogenetic relatedness&#x02013;a negative relationship is assumed to indicate the presence of competitive interactions between them that have mediated secondary contact post-speciation [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, neither of these approaches can be applied na&#x000ef;vely. Null models are required to properly interpret co-occurrence data [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], with pairwise analyses being suggested as a preferable alternative [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. On the other hand, age-range correlation analyses can be affected by signals from allopatric speciation alone, in the absence of any secondary contact, though this is mitigated by the fact that most Eastern Himalayan species are most closely related to species outside the Eastern Himalayas [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A careful approach accounting for both evolutionary dynamics and phylogenetic confounding variables is required to correctly understand the implications of community-wide co-occurrence data.</p><p>If, as posited by Srinivasan et al, competition is a critical driver of range limits in this system, then following post-speciation secondary contact, coexistence could be maintained by altitudinal stratification, with little spatial overlap between closely related species. Alternatively, species pairs could diverge along functional trait axes, resulting in character displacement and allowing for spatial overlap. In this study, we therefore hypothesize that competition would result in a significant positive correlation between pairwise spatial overlap and morphological differentiation, with more morphologically distinct species pairs co-occurring more frequently. Moreover, it is often stated that competition is stronger between closely related species, but this is seldom explicitly examined. We therefore hypothesize that the strength of the correlation between morphology and spatial overlap will decrease when examining distantly-related species pairs. We also anticipate that measures of phylogenetic dispersion for both traits and occupied altitudes will show positive phylogenetic autocorrelation (i.e. underdispersion of traits) when examining the phylogeny of the entire breeding bird community, as closely related species converge on fitness peaks suitable for a given life history. Finally, we anticipate that examining the same measures of phylogenetic autocorrelation at the scale of individual genera should show the opposite pattern, due to competition forcing species away from optimized traits to allow for coexistence between closely related species.</p><p>A better understanding of the preponderance of niche versus neutral dynamics in a community can lead to a better understanding of species&#x02019; range limits. The mechanistic limitations of a species&#x02019; range arise from a complex set of evolutionary and ecological factors [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Species are subject to physiological limitations that in turn may have arisen from purifying selection due to competition [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. By contrast, interspecies competition can help set the range limits of species even in the absence of physiological limitations [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similarly, dispersal may affect local adaptation at the edges of a species&#x02019; range in the absence of any biotic factors [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The presence of parasites and pathogens can also impose selective pressures reinforcing range limits [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Understanding the mechanisms behind the maintenance of range limits is critical in understanding how spatial ranges may change in response to changing environments. This is especially pressing in the context of climate change, a potential major driver of such novel assemblages [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Climate change has already caused shifts in species&#x02019; ranges, and this is expected to accelerate over the next century [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. As species move around on a continental scale, species currently found in allopatry or parapatry may become increasingly sympatric. It is critical to understand whether these species may then exclude each other due to competition, or whether they will be able to stably coexist. Species whose ranges limits are partially determined by competitive interactions may suffer increased losses if climate changes forces the abiotic components of their niche into greater geographical overlap. Alternatively, species may benefit from the displacement of a competitor. Moreover, species whose range limits are determined by biotic rather than physiological constraints may be better able to adapt rapidly to climate change. Alternatively, species subject to hard physiological limits due to selection for a narrow range of climate tolerances may be unable to adjust to changes in climate, and therefore experience range shifts. The ability to better predict this response has immediate and important consequences for the protection of biodiversity in the region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Surveys</title><p>Surveys were conducted in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, NE India (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217549.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) from 2013&#x02013;2015. The coordinates for all survey points fell between 27.006 and 28.622 degrees North, and between 91.985 and 96.545 degrees East. Surveys were carried out during the monsoon (May-July), which is the breeding season for the majority of the regional avifauna. 201 survey points were selected at elevations ranging from 118&#x02013;4354 meters in altitude; areas both along and away from roads were included, as were points from both protected and non-protected areas. Efforts were made to randomize across vegetation types at particular altitudes. At each survey point, two observers compiled comprehensive lists of all species seen/heard at ten minute intervals. Most sites were visited multiple times in order to assess detectability; sites were visited for an average of 9 intervals (range 1&#x02013;30). In all, surveys totaled 328 hours of effort. Point localities for some species, generally those of conservation concern, were also collected opportunistically. We were able to record 375 species, 215 of which were recorded at a minimum of five survey points (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217549.s001">S1 Table</xref> in the Supporting Information).</p><fig id="pone.0217549.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0217549.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Maps of the study area.</title><p>(a) ASTER digital elevation model (DEM) of Arunachal Pradesh draped over a hillshade map, courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech.

Pairwise elevational overlaps were taken to be ratio of the intersection to the union for the output curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217549.g002">Fig 2</xref>); these were calculated using numerical integration. For each species, we also determined the central elevation as the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile value of the GAM curve.</p><fig id="pone.0217549.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0217549.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Predicted habitat suitability relative to altitude for three species of <italic>Psilopogon</italic> barbet.</title><p>Solid lines represent generalized additive model (GAM) predictions based on survey data; open circles represent the proportion of surveys at a given location in which each species was detected.

Through chance alone, species occupying wide ranges of elevation will overlap more than species occupying narrow ranges of elevation. We therefore generated a null expectation for the elevational overlap for a given pair of species based on the size of their altitudinal preferences. It is known that bird diversity in the Eastern Himalayas relates to elevation [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We used a smoothing spline to estimate this relationship based on the average number of species observed per ten minute interval at each site. For both species being compared, we used this relationship as the basis of a Monte Carlo draw to provide a randomized central elevation. We then shifted the actual altitudinal preferences of both species upslope or downslope to align it with the randomized central elevation and calculated the resulting altitudinal overlap. This was performed 100 times for each species pair, with the calculated altitudinal overlaps then averaged to create a null expectation. We then subtracted this value from the observed elevational overlap. A value of zero indicates a species pair that was observed to overlap in altitude as much as would be expected from chance alone given the size of the altitudinal bands they occupy; values below and above zero indicate less overlap than expected from chance and more overlap than expected from chance respectively. We refer to this as the range-size corrected elevational overlap (RSCEO).</p><p>Moreover, elevational overlap alone is not necessarily indicative of sympatric coexistence. It is possible for a given species pair to overlap broadly in altitude, yet seldom coexist at a smaller spatial scale, which would be evidence of competition not captured by altitudinal overlap alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217549.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We therefore developed a simulation model to determine the expected number of points at which a given pair of species would be found together assuming no competition, based on the GAM models above. The non-normalized GAM output is probability that a species would be detected at a given elevation during a single time interval during our surveys. We used this probability as the basis to simulate survey data at each survey point using a Monte Carlo approach; the length of the series at each point was based on the number of intervals that site was visited. We collapsed this series of detections into a single presence/absence value, with a species being considered present if there was at least one simulated detection at a site. This was done independently for both species being compared. The simulated presence-absence data for both species was then compared site by site in order to generate a predicted number of co-occurrences, and then compared to the actual number of points the species was found together at during our surveys. From each set of simulated survey data, we calculated a competition coefficient:

We did this by applying varying time cutoffs to the phylogeny. For each individual cutoff, we selected species pairs with a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) more recent than the cutoff. We then calculated the correlation between range overlaps and morphological similarity for those species pairs. Finally, we looked at the relationship between the cutoff chosen and the correlation between range overlap and morphological similarity.</p><p>We examined the effects of phylogenetics on traits using several methods. Moran&#x02019;s I is a measure of spatial autocorrelation, which gives the relationship between a matrix of pairwise differences of some quantity and a matrix of pairwise spatial distances between them [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

Positive values of Moran&#x02019;s I indicate that closely related species are closer in trait space than would be expected; we generated the null expectation for Moran&#x02019;s I by using Brownian Motion (BM) simulations on the consensus phylogeny. Abouheif&#x02019;s C<sub>mean</sub> is a similar test that uses a distance matrix where the major diagonal can take on nonzero values [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. We calculated Moran&#x02019;s I and Abouheif&#x02019;s C<sub>mean</sub> for morphology by assigning the values of PC1-PC4 as continuous traits.

This is in part due to the fact that species with little range overlap also have low calculated competition coefficients, since they are not expected to co-occur. Additionally, species that share a large portion of the elevational range may not co-occur at the scale of individual sites if they specialize on different microhabitat features (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217549.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217549.g003">3</xref>).</p><p>However, when we examined range overlaps relative to our null expectations, we found a significant correlation with morphological differentiation.

It is worth noting that many species show greater than expected altitudinal overlap, i.e. a value of RSCEO greater than zero. This is likely due to the relationship between elevation and overall diversity, which peaks at mid-elevations and is thought to be driven by arthropod abundances [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

For the consensus tree, observed values of Moran&#x02019;s I and Abouheif&#x02019;s C<sub>mean</sub>, were significantly underdispersed when compared to 1000 randomizations for both morphology and central altitude; both measures always deviated in the same direction.

This pattern indicates that clades of species have evolved specialized morphologies corresponding to their ecological niches, foraging modes, etc. The observed underdispersion of the central elevation occupied by species is likely to be driven by the previously mentioned bias of species towards mid-elevations [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], resulting in species having more similar elevational ranges than would be expected by chance alone.</p><fig id="pone.0217549.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0217549.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><p><bold>Simulated and actual Moran&#x02019;s I, all species, for (a) morphology and (b) elevation.</bold> For morphology, the value for each species was taken to be its distance from centroid in principle component space after morphological variables.

Our conclusions are derived from several lines of evidence, including phylogenetic relationships, trait data and spatial occurrence data. We interpret these results as occurring on multiple timescales. On a short timescale, there is a significant effect of morphological dissimilarity on the extent of spatial co-occurrences exhibited by a species. Moreover, closely related species pairs are more spatially segregated than would be expected under a null model. Among morphologically similar species pairs, the reduced co-occurrence is generated by two seemingly different mechanisms. Some species pairs have distinctly different elevational ranges and therefore co-occur rarely, with competition presumably playing a minor proximate role. Other species pairs appear to overlap broadly in elevational space, but exclude each other at smaller spatiotemporal scales and so are rarely found together, more indicative of direct competition. Further research is required to understand what explains these different strategies. We found that phylogenetic relatedness alone cannot explain it, as the age of a species pair&#x02019;s most recent common ancestor does not predict the amount of co-occurrence relative to elevational overlap.</p><p>Our results also suggest that competition has played a role on longer timescales. Speciation driven by adaptive divergence can produce results that look facially similar to competition in a coexistence analysis [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We do not believe that speciation itself is responsible for the pattern we observe, as Eastern Himalayan avifauna has been built up through cycles of allopatric speciation and secondary contact, with the closest relatives of most Eastern Himalayan species located outside the region [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, our results indicate that competition following secondary contact is a major driver of community assembly. We believe that species pairs that segregate to a large degree in elevational space, as discussed above, have evolved their ranges in response to competition occurring over a longer timescale. Our interpretation is bolstered by our findings that species&#x02019; morphological traits and elevational ranges do not seem to have evolved at random. When considering the phylogeny as a whole, morphological traits and elevational ranges are underdispersed, indicating conservatism around favored elevations and clade-specific morphologies. However, traits are divergent (overdispersed) across clades, indicating historical niche displacement along both morphological and thermal tolerance axes.</p><p>Older studies on passerine diversification in this region have emphasized the importance of interspecies competition and niche differentiation, particularly among individual clades [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, a recent community-wide analysis by Srinivasan et al showed competition to be a strong force in setting altitudinal ranges in the region [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, another recent study by Elsen et al has called the importance of competition into question in favor of abiotic considerations such as temperature [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our results align strongly with the Srinivasan et al study, showing that competition plays an important, if not exclusive, role in determining altitudinal range limits and structuring the community. Additionally, we suggest that this view can be reconciled with the Elsen et al study, as we find that differences in abiotic preferences are likely to be the result of past competition leading to niche displacement. Our work further indicates that there is an evolutionary tradeoff between selection for optimal morphologies corresponding to a clade-specific fitness peak, and selection for divergent morphologies within a clade that push species away from that peak. This can be seen in the fact that morphological trait values are more similar than would be expected from phylogenetic relatedness alone across the entire phylogeny, which may be explained by a convergence on a morphology suitable for general insectivory, the most common foraging mode for birds in the region [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Conversely, species in the same genus are more different in their functional morphological traits than would be expected from relatedness alone. The same applies to elevational ranges, which are a proxy for thermal tolerance. We observe a general preference for middle elevations, which have more abundant resources, but species are appear to have been forced away from these more favorable conditions by competitive interactions.</p><p>In cases where species pairs show similar morphologies and elevational preferences, yet do not co-occur on smaller scales, further work may elucidate what mechanisms are responsible. For example, studies on Andean birds have shown that aggressive responses to heterospecific songs are important in setting elevational range limits[<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Additionally, there is some evidence that certain Sino-Himalayan species may display territorial responses to heterospecific song playback [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], although strength of response to different but closely related species is quite variable. Songs may also reinforce range limits of species pairs whose elevational ranges barely overlap, and in fact song traits may experience selection for this purpose [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. However, it is worth mentioned that other Sino-Himalayan species show little response to heterospecific playback, and that field observations indicate that responses to playback are often highly species-specific [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Other mechanisms may include fine-scale niche partitioning within an altitudinal band as a response to structural habitat features, differential susceptibility to parasites and/or diseases, and differences in the time of daily foraging or other activity that allow for increased elevational overlap despite morphological similarity.</p><p>It is also worth mentioning that while our results indicate that competition plays a strong role in influencing species&#x02019; range limits in this system, it does not exclude additional contributory factors. Species&#x02019; range limits are known to be controlled by a variety of factors (see e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]). Some of these factors may mediate the way in which competitive species interactions play out across the landscape. For example, the species in this study have similar breeding phenologies linked to the onset of the monsoon season [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This synchrony in phenology likely exacerbates the effects of competition. Additionally, the altitudinal migrations undertaken by many species may affect the strength of competitive species interactions outside the breeding season. Further research is required to elucidate the strengths of these other mechanisms in contributing to the determination of elevational range limits.</p><p>In the coming century, anthropogenic climate change is expected to cause extensive perturbations to ecosystems and communities [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Several attempts have been made to predict the responses of avian communities to this challenge [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. One of the major challenges of these efforts is predicting the plasticity of species in their abiotic tolerances. However, there is some evidence that birds in montane environments tend to track their preferred climate space over time [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Additionally, several species in the Eastern Himalayan avian community track their preferred climate space during seasonal migration [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our results further indicate that thermal limits of many species are a product of continuing selection and are reinforced by interspecies competition. This suggests that many species may be challenged by climate change, as spatial range shifts may be countered by the presence of parapatric closely-related species. This may prevent species from shifting their ranges, thus subjecting them to rapid changes in their abiotic environment. Continuing selection on their abiotic preferences may hamper their ability to adapt to these changes.</p><p>Considerable effort has gone into the application of species distribution modelling (SDM) to estimate the change in species&#x02019; spatial ranges in the face of climate change [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. However, these attempts are generally limited to consideration of changes in abiotic conditions alone [<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217549.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Our results suggest that to accurately understand the effects of climate change on Himalayan avifauna, it is necessary to incorporate interspecies competition. If these competitive species interactions are omitted, predictions regarding the response of species to climate change are likely to be inaccurate. By correctly accounting for the effects of biotic interactions, we may more accurately predict the response of this remarkable system to the next century of rapid change, thus enhancing our ability to make critically required conservation decisions and helping to preserve it for future generations of researchers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec010"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0217549.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>List of species found during surveys.</title><p>Full list of all 375 species detected during surveys, along with the number of survey points each species was detected at and the number of intervals it was detected during. 215 species were found at a minimum of 5 survey points.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0217549.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0217549.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Complete time series of species detections during surveys.</title><p>The sheet &#x02018;Detection time series&#x02019; gives the species recorded for each survey interval.
