 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was conducted in Olomoro, Igbide and Uzere communities in Isoko South Local Government Area (ISLGA) of the Delta State (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F0001" href="#F0001">Figure 1</a>). These communities, which are predominantly agrarian, are homogenous in nature arguably because of proximity to one another. Firstly, they are all oil-producing communities. The three communities, en masse, play host to 37 oil wells where oil exploration activities were carried out by Shell Petroleum (a multinational oil company) for over four decades before selling the right of production to Integrated Data Services Limited (IDSL) in 2014 (Ebhuoma &amp; Simatele 
  <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">2017a</a>). Secondly, they speak the same local dialect (
  <span class="italic">Isoko</span>) and rely on indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) to predict future weather conditions. It is noteworthy to mention that the farmers in all three communities produce the same major crops – cassava and groundnut – annually, with the women being the primary drivers of food production. The men, on the other hand, usually engage in fishing, although some assist their wives on the field.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The choice of these communities as the study areas, which are classified as coastal communities (Fabiyi &amp; Oloukoi 
  <a rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0015">2013</a>), was hinged on the observation made by Omohode (
  <a rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0040">2012</a>) immediately after the 2012 flood. Omohode (
  <a rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0040">2012</a>) argued that majority of the coastal communities in ISLGA were completely submerged without a visible trace of any building. This made the region to appear like an emergency ocean when surveyed from a distance. Thus, the aforementioned communities will be crucial to effectively understand the challenges faced by farmers as they attempt to employ their asset portfolios in order to attain household food security in the face of both climatic (flooding) and non-climatic stressors (e.g. oil exploration activities). This is arguably because of stiff contestations that have occurred in the past between indigenes of these communities and Shell Petroleum, owing to grievances about the adverse impacts of oil exploration and exploitation activities on indigenes health and livelihood activities (Adusei 
  <a rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0001">2015</a>; Ikelegbe 
  <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The farmlands in Igbide and Uzere are generally low-lying, while Olomoro comprises both low- and high-lying farmlands. The mean annual rainfall from March to October in the Delta State ranges from 2500 to 3000 mm (Niger Delta Environmental Survey [NDES] 
  <a rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0037">2000</a>). The low-lying farmlands in each of the study areas are usually inundated from mid-June, at the earliest, to the last week in October every year. In extreme conditions, the low-lying farmlands remain inundated until the third week in November (Ebhuoma &amp; Simatele 
  <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">2017a</a>). Thus, while other crops – groundnut, pepper, yam, cocoyam and plantain – which mature within 4 months are cultivated anytime between the last week in February and March, cassava, which requires a minimum of 6 months to attain maturity, is usually planted in December and harvested between June and August each year on the low-lying farmlands through a strategy indigenously referred to as 
  <span class="italic">elelame</span> (follow-water-go).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Elelame</span> is embarked upon anywhere between the first and second weeks in December, immediately after the seasonal floodwater starts retreating the farmlands disproportionately. Immediately, some portions of the soil become visible and moist, the farmers start cultivating. As the floodwater continues to recede in other portions of the farmlands, the farmers employ similar cultivation strategy.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the commencement of the rainy season in the following year (normally in June), the floodwater starts inundating the low-lying farmlands disproportionately from mid-June, although some participants argued that it starts occurring in July in other farmlands. Just before the floodwater begins to inundate the low-lying farmlands, the farmers start harvesting the produce in proximity to the point where the farmlands are expected to be first inundated, to about 5 m – 20 m away (depending on the terrain of the farmland) from the anticipated starting point. The fundamental reason for employing this strategy is that in the eventuality of not being opportune to return to the farmland within the next 4–5 days, the floodwaters will not get to the point where they temporarily stopped harvesting. If, however, the floodwaters get to the point where they stopped harvesting, the cassavas submerged in the floodwaters can still be harvested without having gone rotten (Ebhuoma &amp; Simatele 
  <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">2017a</a>). Insufficient household workforce is also a crucial determinant of the extent to which farmers temporarily stop harvesting. This is because some farmers may have about five plots of farmlands in different locations within the community where they planted cassava on.
