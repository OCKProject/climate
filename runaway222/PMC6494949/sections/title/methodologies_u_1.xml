 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As highlighted earlier, various participatory methodologies have been employed by researchers over the past two decades in order to meticulously unpack the factors that compromise the poor’s ability to produce their food efficiently (Chambers 
  <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">1994</a>; Ibarraran et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">2010</a>; Preston et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0044">2011</a>). While the various methodologies have proved useful in illuminating issues undermining effective food production, the search for more nuanced methodologies to effectively address the increasing poverty and inequalities besieging countries in SSA may implicitly reflect practitioners’ dissatisfaction with pre-existing methodologies (Richards 
  <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">1995</a>; Stadler 
  <a rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0052">1995</a>). In this regard, Moser and Stein (
  <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">2011</a>) contend that the use of AVAF will enable development practitioners to identify the factors that impede the poor’s ability to maximise their fundamental assets when relentlessly striving to obtain their livelihood. The advocacy for the use of AVAF is underpinned by the fact that the poor have to devise strategies to navigate the adverse impacts of climate change during food production, while simultaneously being faced with economic, social and political constraints (Moser &amp; Satterthwaite 
  <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">2008</a>). This view is substantiated by Moser and Stein (
  <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">2011</a>) who argued that the poor’s inability to effectively engage in their livelihood practices is because of exposure to multidimensional risk that stems from environmental, social, political and economic factors. Thus, the utilisation of the AVAF will enable development practitioners to effectively capture the ways in which social, economic, political and environmental factors erode the asset portfolio of the poor and undermine their ability to engage more effectively in food production (
  <a rid="T0001" ref-type="table" href="#T0001">Table 1</a>). Consequently, this will arguably set in motion the process for development practitioners to carve out strategies aimed at protecting and strengthening the fundamental assets that are volatile to both climatic and non-climatic stressors (Moser &amp; Stein 
  <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">2011</a>). This is crucial because by looking at poor’s asset portfolios, one can comprehensively deduce those that will be able to quickly bounce back into food production after being confronted by either climatic and non-climatic stressors (Prowse &amp; Scott 
  <a rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0045">2008</a>). It is therefore not surprising to note that Ebhuoma and Simatele (
  <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">2017a</a>) have argued that until pro-poor policy interventions are geared towards strengthening the fundamental assets that play a pivotal role in the livelihood activities of the poor, the battle to outwit climatic impacts will remain a utopian fiction.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nonetheless, the use of the AVAF alone, we argue, may not comprehensively underline the interconnectedness and the complex ways in which the factors limiting the poor from maximising their asset portfolios undermine effective food production. As in the Indian folklore, about six blind men who touched an elephant and reached contrasting conclusions about the meaning of the entire object according to the part they felt (Nguyen et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0035">2011</a>), factors responsible for depleting the asset portfolios of rural households may be interpreted differently by various development practitioners. Avoiding or significantly minimising the attribution of different meanings to factors that contribute to asset portfolios depletion will depend on development practitioners being equipped with a holistic understanding of the factors that could trigger the erosion of the poor’s asset portfolios in the communities they are responsible for. Against this background, we argue that ST can effectively complement the AVAF by providing a holistic understanding of the causal factors undermining the poor’s ability to maximise their asset portfolios during food production. As documented by Maani and Cavana (
  <a rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0027">2007</a>), ST offers a holistic way of appreciating all dimensions of a complex problem and enables the formation of effective long-term management strategies. Thus, the application of ST is crucial to identify leverage points where policy interventions can be injected in order to foster breakthrough outcomes, necessary to avert the inability for the poor to maximise their asset portfolios during food production.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In light of the above, the application of the integrated methodological framework – AVAF and ST – will enable development practitioners to effectively address issues that trigger both the erosion of the poor’s asset portfolios and the factors impeding effective food production practices at its root cause (see, e.g., Bradbury 
  <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">2003</a>; Koester, Eflin &amp; Vann 
  <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">2006</a>). By tackling issues at its root cause, Bradbury (
  <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">2003</a>) and Koester et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">2006</a>) contend that development practitioners will be able to avoid formulating policies that could potentially result in maladaptation in the future.
