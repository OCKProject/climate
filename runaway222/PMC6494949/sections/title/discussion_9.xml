 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of participatory methodologies such as CCVR, PRA, CVCA, PVA, PIA and VM to conduct vulnerability assessments has undoubtedly revolutionised the ways social scientists conduct their research. Nonetheless, they have not explicitly highlighted how the multidimensional aspects of socio-economic factors facilitate the vulnerability of assets in the portfolio of the poor. While it is crucial to understand how the aforementioned factors facilitate asset vulnerability, development practitioners stand the risk of failing to get a comprehensive view of the ways this might lead to the increased difficulties of rural households to produce food efficiently in the future. Thus, as revealed in the results, ST serves to compensate for the deficit. Through the utilisation of the AVAF and ST as a twin methodology, findings from this study can be categorised into three major points.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Firstly, physical and emotional abuses impede rural women’s ability to produce food efficiently. Issues pertaining to physical and emotional abuse of rural women have been documented (Jewkes et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0021">2001</a>; United Nations [UN] 
  <a rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0056">2012</a>). The severity of physical and emotional abuse lies in its powers to deplete human capital, which is essential for efficient food production. In spite of these setbacks, they are often not given due consideration in deliberations regarding the ways to upscale food production in the rural Delta State. Instead, development practitioners place ‘huge emphases’ on how to ensure farmers have easy access to arable farmlands, farm loans and climate services (Ebhuoma &amp; Simatele 
  <a rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0013">2017b</a>). Thus, without the utilisation of the AVAF and ST as a twin methodology, development practitioners may not get a holistic view about the severity of this seemingly trivialised but arguably serious bottleneck which compromises effective food production. We argue that the continual neglect of this delicate issue might suffocate the attainment of the second SDG, which aim is to attain zero hunger by 2030, among households in Igbide, Uzere and Olomoro because women are the primary drivers of food production.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Secondly, IKSs play a fundamental role in enabling farmers in the aforementioned communities to decide when and the quantity of food to produce in any farming season, even though IKSs have not being as accurate as it used to be in previous decades. This observation mirrors the findings of Roncoli, Ingram and Kirshen (
  <a rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0048">2002</a>), which suggest that IKS continues to play a fundamental role in dictating the affairs of rural food production despite its increased unreliability. While studies from Mexico (Eakin 
  <a rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0011">1999</a>), Burkina-Faso (Roncoli et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0048">2002</a>) and Malawi (Nkomwa et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0038">2014</a>) suggest that climate variability is the primary causal factor responsible for the increased inaccuracy of IKS, 18% of the participants in the current study argued that crude oil exploration activities are the culprit responsible for the increased unreliability of their IKS. Their views might be underpinned by the fact that there is evidence to suggest that the degradation of the natural asset in ISLGA, which has adversely affected the quality of food produced by the farmers, is largely because of oil exploration and exploitation activities (see Elum, Mopipi &amp; Henri-Ukoha 
  <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">2016</a>; Ite et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0020">2013</a>). This has compounded participants’ inability to produce food efficiently because of loss of soil nutrients, although the inability to engage in bush fallowing was also acknowledged to contribute to the decline in quality of farm produce.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is noteworthy to mention that the inability for most participants to mention bush fallowing as a factor contributing to a decline in quality of food produce may be hinged on the fact that they are bewildered and traumatised over the lack of development and rural infrastructures in their respective communities. This is, perhaps, because of the significant contributions of their communities – via crude oil exploration and exploitation activities for over four decades –to the nation’s foreign reserve (Ikelegbe 
  <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">2005</a>). The lack of development, rural infrastructure and environmental degradation through oil exploitation activities might be the resultant effect of a lack of social capital (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F0003" href="#F0003">Figure 3</a>), that is, because they lack indigenes from their communities that have held strategic positions, such as being high-ranking military officers or members of the National Assembly, in Nigeria.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lack of development and rural infrastructure in the Niger Delta, as documented by Watts (
  <a rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0059">2004</a>), can be attributed to the institutionalisation of governance in Nigeria. For example, prior to the transition to democratic rule, in 1999, Nigeria was under military rule. The 1999 Constitution, which was formulated by ‘self-serving military officers’ many of whom were Northern ethnicity, led to the creation of more states in the North Western and North Eastern geopolitical zones of Nigeria than they deserve (PM News 
  <a rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0043">2016</a>). By creating more states and local government areas in the aforementioned regions, this favoured the military officers’ ethnicity in terms of distributing national revenue and left other geopolitical zones like the South-South, which the Niger Delta falls under, heavily disadvantaged (PM News 
  <a rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0043">2016</a>). This is possible because Nigerian law stipulates that any natural resources, including crude oil, belong to the federal government regardless of whose land the resources were discovered. This model of politicking in the Niger Delta paved the way for the systematic looting and sustained impoverishment of the Niger Delta through oil exploration and exploitation activities (Watts 
  <a rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0059">2004</a>), albeit the challenge of the Niger Delta was further amplified by mismanagement of revenue allocated to the region (PM News 
  <a rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0043">2016</a>). By utilising both the AVAF and ST frameworks, however, one can deduce that the lack of social capital might be the reason why environmental injustices, perpetuated by oil companies, have flourished because the government prioritises ‘economic development’ at the expense of natural capital conservation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thirdly, political instability has, in part, had a ripple effect on the farmers as the officials responsible for disbursing farm loans to farmers are government workers, who often go for months without being paid their salaries. Thus, despite the government availing farm loans for subsistence farmers in Nigeria for over two decades (Anyanwu 
  <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">2004</a>; Olaitan 
  <a rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0039">2006</a>; Philip et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0042">2009</a>), most farmers without social capital are hardly beneficiaries of government-approved farm loans as the information is usually ‘hoarded’ from them. It can be argued that this is because officials responsible for disbursing farm loans have become masters of the art of distributing the loans to close relatives and friends with impunity. However, for the fortunate farmers without social capital who become aware of the government-approved loans, officials responsible for disbursing the loans create unauthorised schemes not limited to coercing farmers to purchase items like seedlings and fertilisers, and thereafter, deducting the cumulative cost from the amount designated to each farmer as prerequisites for releasing the farm loans.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As farm loans can be crucial to enabling rural subsistence farmers in Nigeria engage efficiently in food production (Ebhuoma &amp; Simatele 
  <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">2017a</a>), their inability to access government-regulated farm loans inadvertently means that rural subsistence farmers are left with no alternative but to secure loans from unregulated sources like money lenders. While obtaining loans from money lenders leads to increase in food production (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F0003" href="#F0003">Figure 3</a>, R_5), the drawback is that by the time the participants must have sold some of their farm produce to pay the loans, they are virtually left with nothing significant. This is because money lenders in Igbide, Uzere and Olomoro communities place as much as 40% interest rate on their loans for a 6-month period (Ebhuoma &amp; Simatele 
  <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">2017a</a>). Thus, this model of food production will not enable rural households to evade living below the global poverty index of less than US$2.00 a day.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to point out that issues relating to farmers’ inability to access government-approved loans and political instability are not peculiar to Nigeria alone. Parallel issues have been identified as a major bottleneck impeding the trickling down of resources that can significantly improve the welfare of farmers in other SSA countries (see, e.g. Bird &amp; Shepherd 
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2003</a>; Frost et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0017">2007</a>). However, various vulnerability studies that have employed participatory frameworks such as CCVR, PRA, CVCA and VM have, in some instances, not explicitly identified the dynamics in which these sorts of issues occur. For instance, in an attempt to address issues relating to farmers’ inability to secure government-approved farm loans, development practitioners might swiftly call for the retrenchment or replacement of corrupt officials with new transparent officers. While this interventional strategy may be apt, it fails to tackle the root cause of the problem, which stems from political instability. As documented by Nguyen et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0035">2011</a>), tackling societal issues without having a holistic view of how the entire system functions, including the underpinning factors responsible for the current state of affairs, will not yield the result as envisaged by the practitioners. Thus, the utilisation of the AVAF and ST, as an integrated methodological framework, will enable development practitioners, in collaboration with government officials, to come up with strategies that may provide lasting solutions to the problem.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In light of the above discussions and deliberations, it can be argued that the utilisation of AVAF and ST as an integrated methodological framework is pivotal to carry out contemporary vulnerability studies. However, it is important for researchers not to allow the euphoria of this integrated methodology overwhelm them to the point where they ignore DeWalt’s (
  <a rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0009">1985</a>) assertion. He contends that every new-found methodology initially undergoes a euphoric appeal among social scientists, to the stage of critical evaluation and debate about its usefulness in illuminating issues of vulnerability before it finally ends up in the buzz word ‘refuse dump’. Avoiding this dilemma will largely depend on highlighting its weaknesses. The integrated methodological framework, unfortunately, ignores the historical perspective of the ways in which legislations that govern the natural resources, for example, have contributed to the inability of rural households to currently obtain their livelihoods without certain difficulties.
