 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Globally, climate change has been observed to escalate to unprecedented levels especially in the last two decades (Moser 
  <a rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0032">2014</a>; Perez et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0041">2015</a>). Effectively and efficiently tackling issues of climate change, as Lazarus (
  <a rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0025">2009</a>) puts forward, is one of the most complex problems that the world will have to contend with. This is arguably the case in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where low adaptive capacity, weak institutions and high levels of poverty, among others, 
  <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> increasing climate change have combined to undermine effective food production (Conway &amp; Schipper 
  <a rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0008">2011</a>; Perez et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0041">2015</a>). Consequently, studies have been conducted using various participatory methodologies to ascertain how vulnerable the agricultural practices of the rural poor in SSA are to both climatic (rising temperatures and erratic rainfall patterns) and non-climatic (e.g. ill-health and over-exploitation of natural resources in farming communities) stressors (Mavhura 
  <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">2017</a>; Mupakati &amp; Tanyanyiwa 
  <a rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0033">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participatory methodologies, as observed by Chambers (
  <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">1994</a>), have been effective in illuminating both the climatic and non-climatic stressors confronting vulnerable people. This is because it provides a fertile platform for individuals to explicitly share their experiences regarding the ways in which their livelihood practices have been adversely affected by both climatic and non-climatic stressors. Literature suggests that the most utilised participatory methodologies employed by researchers and development practitioners at grassroots level within the context of SSA include participatory impact assessments (PIAs), vulnerability mapping (VM), participatory vulnerability assessment (PVA), community-wide vulnerability and capacity assessment (CVCA), climate change vulnerability resilience (CCVR) and participatory rural appraisal (PRA) (Chambers 
  <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">1994</a>; Ibarraran, Malone &amp; Brenkert 
  <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">2010</a>; Kuban &amp; MacKenzie-Carey

  <a rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0049">2008</a>). Despite the aforementioned methodologies being utilised to a great degree of success, Moser (
  <a rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0030">2011</a>) contends that they have either neglected or only implicitly illustrated how vulnerable the poor are from an asset-based perspective (see

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The focus on assets, as Moser and Stein (
  <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">2011</a>:4) argue, is crucial because of the widespread recognition that poverty encompasses a multiplicity of ‘deprivation that includes lack of capabilities, assets and entitlements’. Assets ‘are not simply resources people use to obtain a livelihood; they also give people the capability to be and to act’ (Bebbington 
  <a rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0004">1999</a>:2022). Therefore, the more assets an individual has or has easy access to, the less vulnerable the individual is likely going to be and vice versa (Moser &amp; Satterthwaite 
  <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">2008</a>). Thus, the utilisation of the asset vulnerability analytical framework (AVAF) as a methodological approach to conduct weather-related vulnerability assessments will explicitly highlight the factors that impede the maximisation of the poor’s asset portfolios or fundamental assets (see 
  <a rid="T0002" ref-type="table" href="#T0002">Table 2</a>) (Moser &amp; Satterthwaite 
  <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">2008</a>; Moser &amp; Stein 
  <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">2011</a>; Simatele &amp; Simatele 
  <a rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0051">2015</a>). This is partly because the AVAF is a diagnostic tool for understanding the factors responsible for the erosion of the assets of an individual.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Notwithstanding, having a comprehensive picture of the complexities and interconnectedness of factors that undermine the poor’s ability to maximise their bundle of assets during food production is equally essential. This is against the backdrop of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) – leaving no one behind – which emphasises, among other issues, the urgent need to meet the nutritional requirements of the poor. Thus, this will enable practitioners to identify the appropriate leverage points to inject decisive policy interventions aimed at significantly minimising the adverse effects of both climatic and non-climatic stressors, which can prevent the poor from maximising their asset portfolios during food production. In this regard, systems thinking (ST) can provide development practitioners with a useful lens to effectively identify the factors that impede the rural poor’s ability to maximise their asset portfolios during food production (Bradbury 
  <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">2003</a>; Kunsch, Theys &amp; Brans

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Against this background, we make a case for the AVAF and ST as an integrated methodological framework. We argue that the utilisation of this integrated methodological framework is pivotal to highlight the factors that compromise the poor’s ability to efficiently maximise their asset portfolios in pursuant of their livelihoods.</p>
