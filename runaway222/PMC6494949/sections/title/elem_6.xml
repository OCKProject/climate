  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The degradation of natural capital as well as the erosion of financial, human and physical capitals have made food production an uphill task in the study areas. In the context of natural capital, participants (92%) argue that because of the seasonal inundation of their low-lying farmlands, they are constrained to cultivate for approximately 8 months annually. For instance, a participant explained:</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>‘The problem with our farming system is the seasonal planting that we are constrained to undertake annually. We must harvest all our produce before our farmland becomes inundated. This usually exacerbates food insecurity when a household gets a poor harvest in a particular season … This is the advantage farmers in neighbouring communities, who cultivate on high ground, have over us. “They do not lack 
    <span class="italic">garri</span> (processed cassava) at any point in time throughout the year”.’ (Male farmer from Uzere community, in his eighties)
   </p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As if the aforementioned is not already making it challenging for the participants to successfully transcend living below the global poverty index of less than $2.00 a day, they argued that the quality of food produced over the last two decades has declined abruptly because of ‘oil exploration-led exploitation’. In fact, most participants (89%) vehemently argued that oil exploration is responsible for the reduced quality of food produced in their respective communities. In this regard, a participant commented:</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>‘Prior to oil exploration activities in Olomoro, in the 1960’s, the 
    <span class="italic">garri</span> we produced was known in the Delta State for its high starch content. However, community members began to observe a reduction of the starch content of the 
    <span class="italic">garri</span> they produce from the 1980’s. Today, the 
    <span class="italic">garri</span> produced in Olomoro has virtually no significant starch content.’ (Female farmer from Olomoro community, in her sixties)
   </p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The resultant effect of this, as argued by the farmers, is that consumers now prefer to purchase 
   <span class="italic">garri</span> from neighbouring communities that are void of oil exploration activities because of its ‘higher starch content’. Along this continuum, a participant lamented:
  </p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>‘There has been a significant reduction in the nutritional value of the 
    <span class="italic">garri</span> we produce due to the oil exploration activities that have been on-going for over four decades…Before Shell started drilling oil from our community, we were promised that they would carry out remedial actions regularly to ensure that the soil does not lose its nutrients. Up till today, no remedial action has been carried in this community.’ (Female farmer from Igbide community, in her fifties)
   </p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, not all participants were in total agreement with this line of thought. While acknowledging the deleterious effects that oil exploration activities have had on food production, a few participants (7%) emphasised that farmers’ inability to practise bush fallowing is also another major factor that has compromised the quality of food produced. For example, a participant explained:</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>‘Between the 1960s and 1980s, farmers could afford to leave their farmlands to go fallow for three to seven years before going back there to cultivate on it. Within the last two decades, however, the demand for arable farmlands has witnessed an abrupt increase. This is due to the sporadic increase in birth rate whereby it has become usual for a 15-year-old boy to have a partner and child. Consequently, the father of the 15-year-old boy has no choice but to give a piece of land to his son to enable him and his partner grow their food. This has made it almost impossible for some farmers to practice bush fallowing.’ (Male farmer from Olomoro community, in his fifties)</p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The overwhelming proliferation in population in each community, coupled with indigenes in diaspora’s quest to build themselves houses in their respective communities of origin, has also triggered the conversion of farmlands to secure shelter, thereby making arable farmlands a relatively scarce commodity. This has also compromised farmers’ ability in the study areas to practise bush fallowing.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the context of financial capital, the participants lamented that irregularities and inconsistencies surrounded the disbursement of farm loans. All but one farmer, for example, claimed that they have never been beneficiaries of any agricultural loans. In this regard, a participant commented:</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>‘We only hear of farm loans and other incentives meant for farmers in this community after it has been disbursed. The only beneficiaries of farm loans are relatives of those working in the office responsible for disbursing farm loans. The painful part is that these relatives usually hoard the information to themselves during the loan distribution processes.’ (Female farmer from Uzere community, in her forties)</p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a human capital perspective, physical and emotional abuse in Olomoro, in particular, was underlined as a factor that impedes women’s ability to engage effectively in food production, as it reduces their labour force drastically. A few explained that this has become a regular occurrence for some women in the community with their husbands as the chief perpetrators. When probed about the role of the police in attempting to cushion the plight of the women, a participant explained:</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>‘Do we have a police station in this community? When the men are arrested, with a bribe of ₦1000,00 [Nigerian naira] (approximately $3,00 US) they are released. I don’t know what we have in this community but it is certainly not a police station.’ (Female farmer from Olomoro, in her thirties)</p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With regard to physical capital, the farmers complained that despite the enormous contributions that their communities have made to the nation’s foreign revenue for over four decades, their communities have remained inconceivably underdeveloped. The lack of good road networks within each community, for example, usually erodes the financial capital of the farmers, albeit insidiously. To illustrate, during the rainy seasons, it can be excruciating for motorists to weave their way through the aforementioned communities. This is because of the numerous potholes that are usually engulfed with floodwaters, which makes it difficult particularly for those not familiar with the road to swiftly navigate their way through it. This makes access to markets, where they have to sell some of their farm produce, extremely difficult and expensive.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is noteworthy to mention that both the government and Shell Petroleum have not been oblivious to the plight of the people. The challenge, however, is that whenever the government wants to fix the roads or Shell Petroleum wants to carry out some of its corporate social responsibility, for example, some affluent people in the Delta State will ensure that the contracts are awarded to their affiliates. After being awarded the contracts, most contractors often use substandard materials to carry out the required projects like road repairs, for example, which will not last longer as expected. The ability for most contractors to carry out substandard jobs with impunity was perceived by the participants as ineptitude on the part of government. This, among other issues, has amplified their grievances towards the government.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was also highlighted that for those privileged to have access to large areas of farmlands enough to engage in commercial farming, their inability to access farm machineries have continued to dampen their fight to transcend the boundaries of a subsistence farmer. A male participant in Uzere, for example, explained that while the Delta State government usually provides farm equipment for farmers, ‘it never gets to them’. The participant also complained that this equipment is ‘always hijacked’ by dignitaries and close associates of key politicians in the Delta State for their selfish interest. Also, 8% of the elderly participants (50 years and above) acknowledged that in the 1960s they used to produce rice. This is because of the swampy nature of their farmlands during the rainy season, and because the government provided rice milling machines to enable farmers process the produce. However, since the 1970s till date, no provision has been made to provide rice milling machines for farmers. Thus, rice cultivation has been abandoned. In view of the above, it was not surprising to observe that the participants felt neglected by the government in the aftermath of the 2012 flood (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 2012 flood, classified as the most devastating in the history of Nigeria, agonisingly impacted Igbide, Uzere and Olomoro communities, which severely compromised households’ food and nutrition security for the next planting season (Ebhuoma &amp; Simatele 
   <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">2017a</a>). While the participants acknowledged that the Delta State government made provision for items including stems to be distributed to the farmers, they lamented that most of the affected victims did not get anything. Instead, it was fadama
   <a ref-type="fn" rid="FN0001" href="#FN0001">
    <span class="sup">1</span>
   </a> development project, an initiative of the World Bank whose aim is to improve the general welfare of users of rural lands and water resources from 01 July 2008 to 31 December2019 (World Bank 
   <a rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0060">2018</a>), which provided seedlings and fertilisers for the affected farmers. Also, indigenes in the diaspora, individuals and relatives in neighbouring communities that were unaffected by the flood provided cassava stems for the affected farmers.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is noteworthy to mention that in spite of the myriad challenges that the farmers have to contend with on an annual basis, they still manage to produce food annually. Because food production is interwoven in a complex web of political, social, environmental, economic and cultural factors (Banson, Nguyen &amp; Bosch 
   <a rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0003">2016</a>), the AVAF alone, we argue, will not suffice in presenting a holistic description and the long-term implications of the farmers’ inability to maximise their asset portfolios during food production. In this regard, ST approach is pivotal to enable development practitioners to get a comprehensive picture of the various factors that hamper the rural poor from maximising their asset portfolios during food production (Banson et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0003">2016</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Causal loop modelling was used to produce an ST model to highlight the interconnections and interdependencies among the various components within Igbide, Uzere and Olomoro communities (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F0003" href="#F0003">Figure 3</a>). Each variable can either progress in parallel or opposite directions. If an increase in one variable leads to a decrease in another variable, it is denoted by ‘-’ close to the arrow head. Conversely, if an increase in one variable results in an increase in another variable, it is denoted by ‘+’ close to the arrow head. The ST model, as argued by Kunsch et al. (
   <a rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0024">2007</a>) and Flood (
   <a rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0016">2010</a>), is analysed through feedback loops. Feedback loops are either balancing or reinforcing. Balancing loops seek to stabilise a system or return it back to normal. Reinforcing loops, on the other hand, usually represent increasing or decreasing actions (Nguyen &amp; Bosch 
   <a rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0034">2013</a>). 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F0003" href="#F0003">Figure 3</a> identified eight reinforcing (R) loops and three balancing (B) loops. For reasons of brevity, we have deliberated on issues that could eventually result in making food production overwhelmingly difficult within the shortest timeframe if decisive measures are not taken by development practitioners.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F0003" href="#F0003">Figure 3</a>, a glaring issue that is impacting negatively food production is the abuse of the drug 
   <span class="italic">tramadol</span>. It was argued that this has constituted a menace in these communities including the depletion of household workforce, thereby compromising the ability of affected households to produce more food. Some participants explained that while the sale of drug is illegal, some pharmaceuticals still make this drug readily available for those in need of the substance. It was alleged that one reason the drug is highly sought-after is that it ‘enhances stamina during sexual intercourse’. The adverse implications associated with a 
   <span class="italic">tramadol</span> overdose by husbands or partners, which often results in some of them collapsing, are twofold: firstly, wives or partners are left with no alternative but to seek medical assistance for their husbands or partners. Even after their husbands or partners have been stabilised by a medical practitioner, the women still have to cater to their needs for some days as they need to be closely monitored at home. This ultimately results in disruption of food production and shortage of household labour in circumstances where the men assist their wives to produce food. This can have severe implications for households’ food security in circumstances where the households have not harvested all their cassava tubers on the low-lying farmlands before the seasonal inundation occurs (
   <span class="italic">elelame</span>), and are unable to return within the next 2 days to harvest the inundated tubers in order to prevent them from rotting away. Secondly, and overdose of 
   <span class="italic">tramadol</span> by husbands or partners may cause emotional abuse in women (B_3) through shaming and mockery by community members because the affected women will likely be perceived as sexually insatiable by their husbands’ or partners’ natural energy levels. This has the potential to impede the affected women from producing food efficiently because emotional well-being is crucial for maximum productivity (Donald et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0010">2005</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F0003" href="#F0003">Figure 3</a> also reveals that the participants have, for decades, relied and continue to rely on IKS not limited to the observation of the flowering of specific trees, croaking of frogs and cloud observation (see Ebhuoma &amp; Simatele 
   <a rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0013">2017b</a>). For example, a participant explained:
  </p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>‘The use of IKS [indigenous knowledge systems] by farmers in this community to determine when to start growing our food is hinged on tradition. Although it has not been 100% accurate at all times, it has, for decades, proved extremely beneficial to those who respect tradition. When farmers obey instructions from nature, they get rewarded bountifully.’ (Male farmer from Olomoro, in his sixties)</p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The participants, however, pointed out that IKS has not been reliable as it used to be in previous decades. While 3% of the participants suggested that only God can determine the cause regarding the inconsistences of their IKS, 18% argued that this is the resultant effect of oil exploration activities. In narrating how oil exploration activities have affected IKS, it was argued that gas flaring has negatively impacted the rubber trees and cassava leaves, which they rely upon to predict the weather. This is because, occasionally, the rubber trees and cassava leaves do not flower at the time ‘they are naturally supposed to’. When this happens, the tendency for their predictions to be inaccurate becomes relatively high. Thus, oil exploration activities, from the participants’ perspective, have undermined their traditional way of life.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a political perspective, political instability has, in part, emanated from the federal governments’ introduction of a policy in 2016 that allowed the currency to trade freely in a move to control the currency crisis. This resulted in a significant devaluation of the naira, with the naira exchanging in December 2016 at 305 naira (₦305.00) to 1 US dollar, as against 155 naira in November 2014 (₦155.00) (Nigerian Bulletin 
   <a rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0036">2016</a>; Tijani 
   <a rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0055">2015</a>). This adversely reduced the purchasing power of most end-users (B_1), which, in turn, reduces farmers’ financial capital. This is because Nigeria depends largely on foreign products (Vanguard 
   <a rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0057">2015</a>). Thus, the soaring of the US dollars heightened the prices of most goods in the country, thereby creating a ripple effect by affecting other sectors of the country. Also, the government’s inability to pay workers’ salaries regularly at the end of each month – in some instances, workers are owed over 6 months salaries (Vanguard 
   <a rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0058">2018</a>) – has significantly reduced the purchasing power for most consumers, with severe implications for the financial capital of the farmers (R_8). The lack of financial capital impedes farmers’ ability to purchase seedlings, fertilisers and other basic items necessary to produce food efficiently.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the context of population growth, it was argued that it has facilitated the conversion of farmlands into housing units. Further, the increase in population, which also triggered deforestation, catalysed the inability for farmers to leave their farmlands to undergo bush fallowing as they usually did between the 1960s and the 1980s in order to produce ‘enough’ food to meet their livelihood objectives. Thus, the increase in population has made yearly food production in the limited available farmlands the norm. This has also contributed to the low quality of food produced because of a significant reduction in the soil quality (R_3). In the context of soil quality, the participants (89%) echoed that oil exploration activities remain the causal factor for the reduced soil quality (R_2); an elderly participant from Uzere, in his 80s, provided a mind-boggling insight. Not refuting the claim that oil exploration activities have compromised the soil quality, he argued that the annual seasonal flooding which occurs on the low-lying farmlands brings along with it alluvial soil. This, as he further pointed out, helps to replenish the soils’ lost nutrients. He, however, concluded that oil exploration activities have expedited the loss of soil nutrients at a pace faster than the rate at which alluvial soil replenishes the lost nutrients.</p>
