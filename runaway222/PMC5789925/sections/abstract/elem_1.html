      <p>Complex networked systems ranging from ecosystems and the climate to economic, social,
         and infrastructure systems can exhibit a tipping point (a “point of no return”) at
         which a total collapse of the system occurs. To understand the dynamical mechanism
         of a tipping point and to predict its occurrence as a system parameter varies are
         of uttermost importance, tasks that are hindered by the often extremely high dimensionality
         of the underlying system. Using complex mutualistic networks in ecology as a prototype
         class of systems, we carry out a dimension reduction process to arrive at an effective
         2D system with the two dynamical variables corresponding to the average pollinator
         and plant abundances. We show, using 59 empirical mutualistic networks extracted from
         real data, that our 2D model can accurately predict the occurrence of a tipping point,
         even in the presence of stochastic disturbances. We also find that, because of the
         lack of sufficient randomness in the structure of the real networks, weighted averaging
         is necessary in the dimension reduction process. Our reduced model can serve as a
         paradigm for understanding and predicting the tipping point dynamics in real world
         mutualistic networks for safeguarding pollinators, and the general principle can be
         extended to a broad range of disciplines to address the issues of resilience and sustainability.
