      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first examine the case where the system does not exhibit any tipping point. For
         each value of

            </div>
         </div>, there are many possible network structures, rendering necessary a description based
         on statistical ensemble averaging. (Representative individual resilience functions
         are shown in 
         <a><span>SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S1
            </a>.) 
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>A</span></a> shows, for network 
         
         <div>
            <div><span>A</span></div>
         </div>, four types of pollinator abundances vs. 
         
         <div>
            <div>
               <div><span>f</span><span>n</span></div>
            </div>
         </div> (each with 100 statistical realizations): one from the original network (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>A</span></a>, red) and three from the reduced model with different averaging methods (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>A</span></a>, blue, black, and cyan corresponding to averaging methods 
         <span>i–iii</span>, respectively). We see that averaging method 
         <span>i</span> leads to abundance variations that are in good agreement with those from the original
         network, while systematic deviations exist for the results from averaging methods
         
         <span>ii</span> and 
         <span>iii</span>, although they agree with each other. 
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>B</span></a> shows, for network 
         
         <div>
            <div><span>A</span></div>
         </div>, the corresponding plant abundance vs.

               <div><span>f</span><span>l</span></div>
            </div>
         </div>, where the results from the original network are displayed in 
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>B</span></a>, green. The averaging process 
         <span>i</span> leads again to average abundance variations in agreement with those from the original
         network. The results for network 
         
         <div>
            <div><span>B</span></div>
         </div> are shown in 
         <a>Fig. 3 
            <span>C</span> and 
            <span>D</span></a>. We see that, for both networks in the parameter setting studied, the remaining pollinators
         and plants never come close to extinction, even when the fraction of removed pollinators
         approaches one. The reason is precisely mutualistic interactions: even if there is
         only one remaining pollinator, at least one plant will be connected with this pollinator.
         Because of the mutualistic interactions, both the pollinator and plant will survive,
         and the network system does not exhibit a tipping point. In this parameter regime,
         the small migration rate has no effect on system dynamical features, such as the absence
         of a tipping point. The main message of this example is that the reduced model is
         capable of capturing the abundance variation patterns of both pollinators and plants
         in the original networked systems.
