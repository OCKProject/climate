      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We now consider parameter regimes where the mutualistic network system exhibits a
         tipping point. An examination of the individual resilience functions (
         <a><span>SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S2
            </a>) for networks

         </div> and 
         
         <div>

         </div> reveals that, as

            </div>

            </div>
         </div> for plants) is increased toward unity, there exists a critical point past which the
         species abundances collapse to almost zero, signifying a tipping point. The corresponding
         ensemble-averaged resilience functions are shown in 
         <a>Fig. 4</a>. For both networks, the 2D model tends to generate abundance values that deviate
         from the corresponding true values from the original system. In particular, for the
         reduced model derived through averaging method 
         <span>i</span>, the abundance values are somewhat smaller than those from the original system, while
         the opposite behavior occurs for the reduced model with averaging method 
         <span>ii</span> or 
         <span>iii</span>. These deviations are expected, considering the drastic approximations used in deriving
         the reduced model. While all three types of average in the reduced model generate
         results indicating the occurrence of a tipping point, a key issue is the accuracy
         of the predicted parameter value where a tipping point is reached. In particular,
         if a reduced model does indeed possesses predictive power for the tipping point, it
         should predict its occurrence at the correct critical point in the original network.
         In this regard, we see that the reduced model with averaging method 
         <span>i</span> fails to predict the location of the tipping point, whereas the 2D model with averaging
         method 
         <span>ii</span> or 
         <span>iii</span> yields the true critical point. Since methods 
         <span>ii</span> and 
         <span>iii</span> are based on some sort of weighted averaging process (i.e., with respect to nodal
         degrees and eigenvectors), the results in 
         <a>Fig. 4</a> point at the importance of imposing weighted averaging process in the dimension reduction
         process. This conclusion holds not only for the two networks in 
         <a>Fig. 4</a> but also, for other networks studied.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While structural change in the network, such as gradual removal of nodes (pollinators),
         can trigger a tipping point, there are alternative scenarios, such as parameter changes.
         Here, we consider the situation where the mutualistic network structure remains intact,
         but the death rate of the pollinator increases because of environmental deterioration.
         Specifically, we increase the pollinator decay rate
