      <p>Complex systems in many fields, because of their intrinsic nonlinear dynamics, can
         exhibit a tipping point (point of no return) at which a total collapse of the system
         occurs. In ecosystems, environmental deterioration can lead to evolution toward a
         tipping point. To predict tipping point is an outstanding and extremely challenging
         problem. Using complex bipartite mutualistic networks, we articulate a dimension reduction
         strategy and establish its general applicability to predicting tipping points using
         a large number of empirical networks. Not only can our reduced model serve as a paradigm
         for understanding the tipping point dynamics in real world ecosystems for safeguarding
         pollinators, the principle can also be extended to other disciplines to address critical
         issues, such as resilience and sustainability.
