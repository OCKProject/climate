      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So far, we have neglected interspecific competitions, as they are generally much weaker
         than intraspecific competition. Mathematically, interspecific interactions can be
         modeled through nonzero off-diagonal elements in the competition matrices

            <span>1</span></a>, which change the structures of these matrices. It is thus useful to investigate
         the effects of interspecific competition. Our computations reveal that the 2D reduced
         model captures all essential features of the mutualistic networked systems, even in
         the presence of interspecific competition, as shown in 
         <a>Figs. 9</a> and 
         <a>10</a>, for the cases where tipping points are absent and present, respectively.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a>Fig. 9</a> is obtained under the same setting as that of 
         <a>Fig. 3</a>, except that interspecific competition is now included. Comparing 
         <a>Fig. 9</a> with 
         <a>Fig. 3</a>, we see that the competition results in somewhat lower pollinator and plant abundance,
         which is intuitive. For small values of

            </div>
         </div>, the number of pollinators is large, and therefore, the interspecific competition
         among the pollinators is relatively strong. In this case, the species abundances are
         markedly lower than the corresponding values in the absence of interspecific competition.

         competition and consequently, smaller reductions in the abundances. As the strength

            </div>
         </div> of the interspecific competitive interaction is increased, simulations of both the
         original networked and the 2D reduced systems give lower species abundances. The remarkable
         feature is that, when interspecific competition is taken into account, the 2D reduced
         system can still reliably predict the species abundances, with the unweighted averaging
         scheme giving the best result, while the degree- and eigenvector-weighted schemes
         predict correctly the trend of the abundance variations.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a>Fig. 10</a> shows the effects of interspecific competition in the parameter regime where there
         is a tipping point. Comparing 
         <a>Fig. 10</a> with 
         <a>Fig. 4</a>, we see that, with the inclusion of interspecific competition, the 2D reduced model
         derived from the degree- or eigenvector-weighting scheme predicts the tipping point
         accurately, which is similar to the case where such competition is absent. The mere
         effect of a reasonable amount of interspecific competition is simply reduced abundances.
         (For sufficiently large values of the interspecific interaction strength, both the
         original and the reduced 2D models agreeably give the result of species extinction.)
