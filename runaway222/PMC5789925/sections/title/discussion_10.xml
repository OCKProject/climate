 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Complex dynamical systems exhibiting a tipping point are widespread, and it is of interest to understand the dynamical mechanism of the tipping point and to develop predictive tools. To accomplish these goals, a viable solution is dimension reduction. We focus in this paper on bipartite mutualistic networks, not only as a concrete example to show the use of dimension reduction but also, because of the fundamental values of safeguarding pollinators to human survivability (
  <a rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" href="#r28">28</a>). In a mutualistic network system, a tipping point typically exists. As the environment continues to deteriorate, the system can drift toward the tipping point, where the catastrophic phenomenon of pollinator collapse will occur. The backbone that supports the functioning of such a network is mutualistic interactions between the pollinators and plants. To understand the role of the interactions with respect to the emergence of a tipping point, both species of the bipartite network must be retained in a reduced model. That is, the minimum dimension of the reduced system should be two [a 1D reduced model (
  <a rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" href="#r18">18</a>) is inadequate to describe mutualistic interactions]. With this in mind, we carry out a dimension reduction process by resorting to different types of averaging methods for species abundances. In particular, given an empirical mutualistic network, we carry out averaging processes to arrive at a 2D model with two collective dynamical variables: one for the pollinators and another for the plants. The average can be either unweighted or weighted. We show that our 2D reduced model captures the essential features of all 59 available real world mutualistic networks, not only in terms of the average abundances but more importantly, in terms of the occurrence of the tipping point, even in the presence of stochastic disturbances. We also find that, because of the lack of sufficient randomness in real mutualistic networks, a weighted average (e.g., based on degrees or eigenvectors) is necessary for the reduced model to exhibit a tipping point at the same critical parameter value as with the original network. Our 2D model can thus serve as a generic paradigm for understanding the tipping point dynamics in real world mutualistic networks. For example, the 2D model can be exploited to investigate a variety of nonlinear dynamical phenomena in mutualistically interacting networked systems, such as bifurcations (
