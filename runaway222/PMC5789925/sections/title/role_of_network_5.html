      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Role of Network Randomness in the Reduced Model.</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our extensive computations of the large number of empirical mutualistic networks indicate
         that a 2D reduced system obtained through degree- or eigenvector-weighted average
         can correctly predict the tipping point, while the reduced system with unweighted
         averaging fails to do so. One plausible reason is the lack of sufficient randomness
         in the network structure. In fact, despite the large variations in their size and
         structure, the real networks are not quite as random. For a purely random network,
         either unweighted or weighted averaging has the same effect on the reduced model.
         To test this proposition and to further show the importance of weighted averaging
         in the dimension reduction process for real networks, we study artificial random mutualistic
         networks. Concretely, we construct an ensemble of model networks of 
         
         <div>
            <div><span>80</span></div>
         </div> pollinators and 
         
         <div>
            <div><span>40</span></div>
         </div> plants with 
         
         <div>
            <div><span>960</span></div>
         </div> mutualistic links randomly distributed between the pollinators and the plants and
         obtain a 2D system through the three averaging processes. As shown in 
         <a>Fig. 6</a>, not only are the three averaging processes able to predict accurately the tipping
         point, but the differences between the effective abundances that they produced and
         the actual abundance are small.

               <span>B</span>) and three from the reduced model. In particular, the blue, black, and cyan traces
               in both panels are the effective abundances from the reduced model with unweighted,
               degree-weighted, and eigenvector-weighted averaging, respectively. The circles and
               asterisks curves in both panels indicate the cases where the initial species abundance
               is high (10) or low (0.01), respectively. The yellow curves represent the individual

               three types of reduced model can predict correctly the tipping point, regardless of
               the specific averaging process used in deriving the model. The key message is that
               the failure of the reduced model through unweighted averaging can be attributed to
               the lack of sufficient randomness in the real mutualistic networks.
