 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A series of model validation tests were conducted identify and eliminate errors in the model and increase the validity of the results. Model testing is conducted throughout the entire model building process. This process exposes limitations or errors in the model and allows for continuous improvements. Using a wide variety of model validation tests, rather than a single validity test, helps to ensure the validity of the model’s output. The current study primarily utilized three separate types of validation tests: boundary adequacy tests, structure tests, and stock-and-flow assessment tests. Some validation tests are based on judgment of the modeler (e.g. boundary of the model), while others are based on software output (e.g. match between simulation data and real data; unit errors).</p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, boundary adequacy tests were performed to make decisions about inclusion/exclusion of many risk factors. Only variables that were directly relevant to youth smoking were considered. Variables were generally included if they were hypothesized to 1) causally affect other variables in the model, 2) be endogenous to the model (i.e. are affected by other variables contained within feedback loops in the model) and 2) contribute dynamically to the model. These inclusion criteria, for example, excluded variables such as demographic characteristics because 1) they may represent associations rather than causal relationships, 2) they cannot be affected by other variables in the model, and 3) despite being associated with an individual’s risk for smoking, they do not produce 
  <span class="italic">dynamic</span> effects over time at the population level.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, a series of structure tests were performed. Equations in the model were motivated by, and compared with, logic and findings from scientific literature. For example, monthly smoking quantity was defined as smoking frequency (number of days smoked in 1 month) times cigarettes per day. Parameters were also assessed using sensitivity testing, which is especially important for qualitative or “soft” variables. This was done by re-running many simulations, each time with a different value of a given parameter; thus, the full range of plausible parameter values are tested, and the overall sensitivity of the model (i.e. outcomes of youth smoking rates) to changes in specific parameters was evaluated. All models will display some numeric sensitivity (i.e. at least a small change in the overall 
  <span class="italic">level</span> of the outcome) but a more serious issue is sensitivity of the behavior mode itself (i.e. the 
  <span class="italic">shape</span> of the outcome’s behavior over time) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. Therefore, this test determines whether the model can produce a consistent mode of behavior, regardless of the stochastic variability which results from variation in parameters.
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the stock-and-flow model was assessed with respect to whether it could replicate trends in actual data drawn from national and state survey data, namely the prevalence of past-month smoking from 1992 to 2015 according to the Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. In SD, a good match between simulated and observed data is evidence for the appropriateness of the model; for this purpose, replicating the overall dynamics (i.e. the shape of the curve of smoking prevalence over time) is more important than achieving an exact numeric match. Our explanatory model was able to replicate the observed data well, as indicated by the consistency in periods of increase, periods of decrease, and timing the peak of past-month smoking prevalence (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The key feedback loops contributing to this behavior are explained in
