 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The explanatory simulation model (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) contains the essential feedback loops presented in the CLD and described above, along with additional detail such as modules for tobacco marketing (which affects social pressure and price) and other tobacco products (whose effects are limited in this model to nicotine dependence). By and large, the feedback loops produce the behavior observed in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> as explained in the CLD results section; and the stock-and-flow simulation model offers additional insight into how this system produces the observed behavior. That is, modules in the explanatory simulation model were turned “on” and “off” as part of the process of calibrating the simulated data with the real data. Specifically, the negative feedback loops due to heightened perception of health risks of smoking and due to the marketing restrictions from the Master Settlement Agreement were necessary for the model to better match the observed decline in smoking prevalence after the year 2000. Additionally, the model behavior was affected to a large degree by price effects, i.e. how cigarette prices affect smoking rates; adjusting cigarette price to the average income in North Dakota for each year of the simulation resulted in a closer match of the simulated data to the observed data. This highlights the importance of price effects to the system as a whole.

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The full simulation model was subjected to the validity tests described in Methods. Sensitivity tests showed that the model was most sensitive to changes in the effect of social pressure on the initiation rate (producing at most a 25% change in the overall 
  <span class="italic">level</span> of the youth smoking rate), and less sensitive to the exact value for other parameters. However, the 
  <span class="italic">shape</span> of the behavior over simulated time did not change in any case, indicating that the model is fairly robust to changes in uncertain parameters.
