 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using variables and feedback relationships from the CLD, a stock-and-flow simulation was then developed to model the initiation and progression of smoking behavior among youth. The crux of the model is an “aging chain” representing different categories of smokers as “stocks” and transitions between these categories as “flows.” Different age groups representing middle school or younger (ages 11–14) and high school (ages 15–18) were modeled in parallel through the use of array variables, to reflect this common age distinction in national surveys such as Monitoring the Future [

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model was built and run using Stella (Systems Thinking, Experimental Learning Laboratory with Animation) Architect, version 1.3.1. Stella Architect is produced by Isee Systems, one of the leading developers of system dynamics software. This software is frequently used in educational settings [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>] as well as research settings [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. Stella reaches its results through numeric approximation of a series of differential equations. Specifically, values of stocks are calculated as a function of their initial value (a parameter set by the user) and the integration of net inflows and net outflows, which are in turn determined by their user-specified equations and other variable inputs. Stella uses numeric approximation at each time step (a user-determined fraction of the underlying time unit) and calculates throughout the chosen range of time.
