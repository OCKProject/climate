 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A detailed stock-and-flow diagram was constructed based on the CLD, and equations and parameters were entered for all variables. The stock-and-flow diagram thus represents the system of hypothesized causal relationships in the system (i.e. the causal factors that determine smoking behavior). System Dynamics models are broken up into a series of “stocks” (a terminology used in system dynamics that refers to some quantity that can accumulate, e.g. people in different stages of addiction, such as experimental smokers) and “flows” (transition rates between stocks, e.g. smoking initiation rates that describe transitioning from a never-smoker to an experimenter), and is especially appropriate for systems that contain positive or negative feedback relationships and show dynamic (i.e. changing over time) behavior (e.g. declining rates of cigarette use over time) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. The stocks represent mutually-exclusive categories of smokers: never-smokers, experimenters, former experimenters, current smokers, and ex-smokers. The distinction between experimenters and smokers was the commonly used criterion of 100 cigarettes/lifetime [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>] for characterizing lifetime smoking status; thus, once an individual becomes a smoker, he/she cannot again become an experimenter. The distinction between current and former smoking behavior (for both experimenters and current smokers) was any smoking in the past 30 days.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These stocks were changed through their corresponding inflows and outflows: smoking initiation, smoking progression, cessation, and relapse. The modeling task, therefore, was to hypothesize how the risk factors influence these flows that in turn, change the levels of the stocks. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows a simplified version of the stock-and-flow model; the full model with all structure and equations is available online [
