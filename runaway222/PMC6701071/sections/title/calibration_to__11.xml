 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The time horizon of the model was set to 1992–2032 (a 40-year range), so that the explanatory power of the model (simulation vs. real data) could be evaluated over the first approximately 20-year period, and projections could be made 20 years into the future.</p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model parameters were selected to replicate actual trends in youth smoking behavior in North Dakota, USA over the observed period. North Dakota was selected as a case study because it has one of the lowest tax rates on cigarettes in the US at $0.44. At the time of this research, legislation was being considered to increase the excise tax by $1.00 or by $1.76 (North Dakota Tobacco Tax Increase, Initiated Statutory Measure 4). Parameters were selected using several methods, including using publicly available population-level statistics, using coefficient estimates from regression models in scientific literature, and (in cases where quantitative data were not available) estimating based on qualitative information, according to standard procedures for incorporating “soft variables” in system dynamics [
