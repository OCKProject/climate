  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> shows the results of the policy simulations if they had been implemented in 2015, and projects the current (past-30 day) smoking rate until year 2032 (nearly 20 years after implementation). Though even the base case (no policy changes) shows a decline in the fraction of adolescents who currently smoke cigarettes, each policy further decreases current smoking prevalence. Increasing the excise tax from $0.44 (base case) to $1.44 and $2.20 decreased the simulated prevalence of past-month smoking by 22.3 and 32.6%, respectively, in 2032, relative to the 2032 base case projections (no policy). In contrast, increasing funding for comprehensive tobacco control programs from $9.8 per capita (base case) to $20 per capita decreased the simulated smoking prevalence by 7.0% of the 2032 base case prevalence, and increasing retailer compliance with sales restrictions to 95% (from the base case of 78% for middle school students and 73% for high school students) decreased the simulated smoking prevalence by 3.2% of the base case prevalence in 2032. Finally, all three policies implemented together (with the higher $2.20/pack excise tax) decreased the simulated smoking prevalence by 42.7% in 2032, consistent with an additive effect of each policy.
