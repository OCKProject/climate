 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A causal loop diagram (CLD) is a conceptual model that represents the formalized hypothesized causal relationships in a system, with an emphasis on relationships that form complete feedback loops. A CLD was constructed to represent well-known risk factors and causes of smoking among youth, namely, parental and peer smoking, secondhand smoke exposure, nicotine dependence, risk perception, and exposure to secondhand smoke. Though there are a multitude of risk factors for smoking, not all of them produce 
  <span class="italic">dynamic</span> (as opposed to static or constant) effects; consistent with principles of system dynamics [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. In other words, a CLD is intended to display the minimal essential set of feedback relationships in the more complex quantitative stock-and-flow simulation model.

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows the CLD that was developed. Five major feedback loops were identified that affect smoking behavior, with 3 being reinforcing/positive feedback loops (in which any change becomes amplified and self-perpetuating) and 2 being balancing/negative feedback loops (in which any change is counteracted and self-limited). Specifically, R1 shows the reinforcing effect of social pressure (from both peers and parents) on youth smoking: the more common smoking is among adolescents, the more susceptible never-smokers become to initiate smoking due to social norms [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], peer pressure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>], behavioral modeling of smoking [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>], perceived availability of cigarettes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>], etc.; and the loop is closed when these new smokers are added to the pool of peers who smoke and (eventually) parents who smoke. Similarly, R2 shows the effect of secondhand smoke on nicotine dependence among non-smoking youth, which makes them more likely to initiate smoking [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]; the loop again is closed when these youth contribute to further secondhand smoke in the environment. Finally, R3 shows the positive loop introduced by nicotine dependence: smoking increases nicotine dependence [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>], and nicotine dependence perpetuates smoking [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>].

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Balancing loops also exist that attenuate the reinforcing effects in the system (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Risk perception counteracts increases in youth smoking (loop B1): such an increase in smoking would result in higher prevalence of tobacco-related death and disease, which increases risk perception and lowers the likelihood that future generations of smokers will initiate. Risk perception also motivates the development and implementation of anti-smoking policies (B2) such as tax increases, which reduces susceptibility of initiation among non-smoking youth.
