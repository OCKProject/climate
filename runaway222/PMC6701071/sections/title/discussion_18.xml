 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current study used system dynamics simulation modeling to examine the possible impacts of three different anti-smoking policies on the rate of current smoking among youth in North Dakota. While all three policies were effective in reducing smoking rates nearly 20 years later according to this model, increasing excise taxes on cigarettes produced the greatest reduction in rates of current youth smoking.</p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These findings are consistent with previous findings from conventional policy analysis. In particular, there is strong evidence that increasing excise taxes is one of the most effective ways to reduce the youth smoking rate [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. In comparison, our findings suggest that comprehensive tobacco control programs—which include media campaigns, interventions, and cessation resources—also lower the youth smoking rate, but to a much lesser degree. This aligns with previous research showing that anti-tobacco media has a comparatively weaker effect on reducing smoking [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]; an effect which has not consistently been found in all settings [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. The current finding that policies have additive effects also corroborate previous findings that comprehensive tobacco control is more effective when implemented along with tax increases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. Finally, our findings that increasing retailer compliance produced a minimal decrease in smoking rates is consistent with previous research that increasing compliance has an uncertain effect on actual youth smoking 
  <span class="italic">behavior</span>, despite being successful at decreasing 
  <span class="italic">sales</span> to youth [

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current study advances these policy findings in important ways, namely through the use of system dynamics modeling. In particular, these findings indicate that the anti-smoking policies considered—increasing the excise tax, increasing funding for comprehensive tobacco prevention programs, and increasing retailer compliance with sales laws—can have plausible 
  <span class="italic">causal</span> effects on reducing the youth smoking rate. These findings are consistent with previous system dynamics and other simulation studies in that tax policy and other comprehensive tobacco policies are successful at lowering the smoking rate among the general population [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. Here, we extend these findings to adolescents in particular, among whom tax policy is particularly effective at lowering smoking rates.

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">System dynamics methodology offers a number of advantages over existing research. True tests of causality are possible in simulations, and conclusions can only be drawn about reality to the extent that the model is an appropriate simplification of the real-world system. Continual model testing during the building process of the model helps build confidence in the model’s ability to simulate the essential components of a real-world system. In this way, simulation studies offer an important complement to conventional statistical analyses that are limited by observational data, making causality difficult or impossible to establish. Moreover, though the current model was calibrated to the case study of North Dakota, a system dynamics model can be tailored to other situations merely by changing the relevant parameters in the model. Thus, a single model, once constructed, can be easily adapted and re-used to study a wide variety of other hypothetical and actual situations, increasing its utility and impact. Additionally, simulation provides results much more quickly and inexpensively than in real life. Not only can this increase the pace of research, but this also could facilitate learning in a rapid, interactive context. For example, legislators could interact with the model in ways that allow them to learn the short-term and long-term effects of a given anti-smoking policy within the system; such simulation-based instructional tools have been very effective in other applications such as management [

 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations of this study must be acknowledged. The major limitation of system dynamics modeling is that the generalization of findings depends on the model appropriately capturing the real-world system. Since all models are by definition a simplification of the real world, it is difficult to evaluate the ways and extent to which the model must reflect reality (e.g. with respect to the variables included, or the desired match between real and simulated data). However, this model was subject to a variety of validation tests that are standard in system dynamics [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>], and was found to be fairly robust. Thus, though some small deviations between simulated and real data are to be expected, the overall shape and policy conclusions are likely to be accurate. Related to this main limitation, the model exhibited some sensitivity to certain parameters for which finding precise objective data was difficult (e.g. the effect of social pressure on smoking initiation altered the overall smoking rates by up to 25%). Though the overall behavior of the model was not sensitive to these parameters, future versions of this model would be improved if more precise estimates for these parameters could be obtained. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of each policy is also a critical consideration given the different costs that would be required for implementation, but that is outside the scope of this study. Finally, it is unclear how well the current model’s findings would generalize to other environments; testing these policies in a different situation or setting would require re-calibrating the parameters of the model appropriately.
