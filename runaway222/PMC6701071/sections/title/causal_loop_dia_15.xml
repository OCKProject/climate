 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CLD presented in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> contains three major positive feedback loops (in which a change in smoking prevalence perpetuates itself via social pressure to smoke, exposure to secondhand smoke, and nicotine dependence) and two major negative feedback loops (in which a change smoking prevalence limits or counteracts itself through awareness of health risks and through enactment of anti-tobacco policies). In isolation, each of the positive feedback loops would produce exponential growth in smoking prevalence, and each of the negative feedback loops would produce exponential decay or goal-seeking behavior. In the full model, these positive and negative feedback loops interact in important ways to produce the simulated behavior that replicates the actual historical data (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The initial rise in smoking prevalence from 1992 to approximately 1995 is produced by the positive feedback in the system – namely the increase in parental and peer smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, and their reinforcing effects on adolescent smoking rates via increased susceptibility to smoking and smoking initiation rates. However, negative feedback relationships dominate the system starting in the mid-1990’s, as smoking rates start to decelerate, then peak, then decline until the present. Specifically, the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement in 1998 which banned cigarette advertisement to minors, alleviated the social pressure loop, which resulted in lower initiation rates and reduced susceptibility to smoking.
