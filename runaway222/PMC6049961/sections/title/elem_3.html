         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use the bias corrected International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP)
            cloud fraction data (Norris &amp; Evan, 
            <a>2015</a>; Rossow &amp; Schiffer, 
            <a>1999</a>). Artifacts removed include those associated with changes in viewing geometry, satellite
            transitions, and other factors. The process for removing spurious variability also
            removes any real variability occurring in the 60°S–60°N but has little impact on investigations
            of regional changes examined in this study. Here the sum of low and midlevel cloud
            fraction is used to better represent the true total low cloud fraction (Yuan et al.,
            
            <a>2016</a>). Aqua MODIS level‐3 monthly products are also used to derive low cloud fraction
            (Platnick et al., 
            <a>2016</a>). MODIS onboard Aqua is well calibrated. Specifically, we divide the total number
            of pixels whose cloud top pressure is higher than 680 hPa by the total number of pixels
            in a grid. We compare the climatology of MODIS and ISCCP LCC using these definitions,
            and their spatial patterns are broadly similar with each other, with noticeable differences
            in places such as tropical Eastern Pacific (see Figure 
            <a>S1</a> in the 
            <a>supporting information</a>).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use CRUTEM4 (Smith et al., 
            <a>2008</a>) for surface air temperature and Extended Reconstructed SST from the NOAA Climatic
            Data Center (Dee et al., 
            <a>2011</a>) for SST data. Meteorological variables from European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather
            Forecasts Re‐analysis (ERA) Interim (ERA‐Interim) are used to derive the estimated
            inversion strength (EIS; Wood &amp; Bretherton, 
            <a>2006</a>).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We apply maximum covariance analysis (MCA; Bretherton et al., 
            <a>1992</a>) and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to objectively obtain patterns
            naturally emerging from observations and their time series. MCA performs a singular
            value decomposition of the covariance matrix between two different variables. The
            spatial patterns of each variable are the singular vectors, and the temporal variability
            is obtained by projecting the spatial patterns back onto the original data fields.
            The leading modes of MCA maximize the covariance between the two variables. The method
            identifies modes (with spatial patterns and temporal variability) that both dominate
            the variability in the two variables and are potentially strongly correlated with
            one another. The correlation coefficients between expansion coefficients, that is,
            the temporal variability of corresponding spatial patterns, indicate how tightly the
            two are related. EOF performed on individual data sets finds dominant patterns that
            explain the most variance and their time series by projecting each pattern back onto
            the original data. Here we present spatial patterns of each mode by regressing its
            time series, after normalization, onto the original data set. Each grid value in the
            pattern quantifies the amount of change in this variable associated with one standard
            deviation of change in the time series.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We address the challenge of interpreting decadal changes of LCC by examining two independent
            global satellite data records and analyzing characteristic patterns instead of local
            or regional trends, that is, the bias‐corrected monthly mean gridded ISCCP LCC between
            1984 and 2009 and the Aqua MODIS LCC between 2003 and 2015. Seasonal cycle of LCC
            is removed. Concurrent EIS and SST are also brought into the fold to illustrate their
            accompanying changes.
