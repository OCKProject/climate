      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use the bias corrected International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP)
         cloud fraction data (Norris &amp; Evan, 
         <a>2015</a>; Rossow &amp; Schiffer, 
         <a>1999</a>). Artifacts removed include those associated with changes in viewing geometry, satellite
         transitions, and other factors. The process for removing spurious variability also
         removes any real variability occurring in the 60°S–60°N but has little impact on investigations
         of regional changes examined in this study. Here the sum of low and midlevel cloud
         fraction is used to better represent the true total low cloud fraction (Yuan et al.,
         
         <a>2016</a>). Aqua MODIS level‐3 monthly products are also used to derive low cloud fraction
         (Platnick et al., 
         <a>2016</a>). MODIS onboard Aqua is well calibrated. Specifically, we divide the total number
         of pixels whose cloud top pressure is higher than 680 hPa by the total number of pixels
         in a grid. We compare the climatology of MODIS and ISCCP LCC using these definitions,
         and their spatial patterns are broadly similar with each other, with noticeable differences
         in places such as tropical Eastern Pacific (see Figure 
         <a>S1</a> in the 
         <a>supporting information</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use CRUTEM4 (Smith et al., 
         <a>2008</a>) for surface air temperature and Extended Reconstructed SST from the NOAA Climatic
         Data Center (Dee et al., 
         <a>2011</a>) for SST data. Meteorological variables from European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather
         Forecasts Re‐analysis (ERA) Interim (ERA‐Interim) are used to derive the estimated
         inversion strength (EIS; Wood &amp; Bretherton, 
         <a>2006</a>).
