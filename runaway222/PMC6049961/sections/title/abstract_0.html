      <p>Modeling studies have shown that cloud feedbacks are sensitive to the spatial pattern
         of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, while cloud feedbacks themselves strongly
         influence the magnitude of SST anomalies. Observational counterparts to such patterned
         interactions are still needed. Here we show that distinct large‐scale patterns of
         SST and low‐cloud cover (LCC) emerge naturally from objective analyses of observations
         and demonstrate their close coupling in a positive local SST‐LCC feedback loop that
         may be important for both internal variability and climate change. The two patterns
         that explain the maximum amount of covariance between SST and LCC correspond to the
         Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, leading
         modes of multidecadal internal variability. Spatial patterns and time series of SST
         and LCC anomalies associated with both modes point to a strong positive local SST‐LCC
         feedback. In many current climate models, our analyses suggest that SST‐LCC feedback
         strength is too weak compared to observations. Modeled local SST‐LCC feedback strength
         affects simulated internal variability so that stronger feedback produces more intense
         and more realistic patterns of internal variability. To the extent that the physics
         of the local positive SST‐LCC feedback inferred from observed climate variability
         applies to future greenhouse warming, we anticipate significant amount of delayed
         warming because of SST‐LCC feedback when anthropogenic SST warming eventually overwhelm
         the effects of internal variability that may mute anthropogenic warming over parts
         of the ocean. We postulate that many climate models may be underestimating both future
         warming and the magnitude of modeled internal variability because of their weak SST‐LCC
         feedback.
