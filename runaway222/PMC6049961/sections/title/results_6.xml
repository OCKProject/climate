 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The leading MCA mode corresponds to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO; Power et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0032">1999</a>), and its SST and LCC patterns consistently suggest a positive LCC‐SST feedback across different oceans. In the leading SST pattern (Figure 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0002">2</a>a), the largest SST anomalies are found in the tropical East Pacific cold tongue region, and they are flanked by two middle latitude anomalies of opposite sign in both hemispheres to the west. SST anomalies along west coasts of the Americas have the same sign as the tropical peak. This pattern can also be roughly discerned in Figures 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0001">1</a>b and 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0001">1</a>c. The corresponding pattern of LCC nearly mirrors that of the SST mode, only with reversed sign (Figure 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0002">2</a>b): Areas with negative SST anomalies are associated with positive LCC anomalies, which suggests a positive SST‐LCC feedback: The effect of reduced LCC has a warming effect and reinforces positive SST anomalies. For example, LCC in the Eastern Tropical Pacific strongly increases when a La Niña‐like, cool SST anomaly dominates. Concurrent negative SST anomalies in the Californian and Peruvian stratocumulus regions, to the north and south of tropical anomalies, are accompanied by LCC increase. Meanwhile, LCC decreases in areas where warm SST anomalies prevail in the southern and northern flanks of the tropical cold anomalies. This MCA mode explains 50% of the interannual covariance between SST and ISCCP LCC.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second MCA mode corresponds to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO; Enfield &amp; Nuñez, 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0016">2001</a>), the dominant multidecadal variability in the Atlantic Basin, and its SST and LCC patterns also suggest a positive LCC feedback. The SST pattern of the second MCA mode (Figure 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0002">2</a>d) has strong anomalies in both the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. In the North Atlantic, the anomalies form a horseshoe pattern with two arms, one in the middle latitudes and another in the tropical Atlantic (Figure 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0002">2</a>d), which is a characteristic of the AMO. Large positive SST anomalies are found in the Eastern Pacific and in the North Pacific. The Eastern Pacific anomalies are much more spatially confined than those of a typical ENSO signal, while the North Pacific anomalies are quite similar to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (Deser et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0015">2004</a>). The overall Pacific pattern is strikingly similar to the modeled pattern that represents the impact of AMO on the Pacific (Li et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0026">2016</a>; Zhang &amp; Delworth, 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0044">2007</a>). The corresponding LCC pattern (Figure 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0002">2</a>e) is nearly identical to the pattern produced by regressing LCC onto the AMO index in the Atlantic (Yuan et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0042">2016</a>). Positive LCC anomalies are again found over regions with negative SST anomalies. In the Pacific, the same negative coupling (i.e., positive feedback) between SST and LCC anomalies exists. For example, positive LCC anomalies are found over cold tropical Eastern Pacific SST anomalies; similar negative coupling is observed for LCC and SST anomalies in the North Pacific, which again suggests a positive LCC‐SST feedback. This MCA mode explains 19% of the covariance. It should be emphasized that both patterns emerge naturally from the objective analysis method, and they resemble known modes (IPO and AMO) of coupled internal variability. The emergence of such congruent and physically meaningful SST and LCC patterns from observations suggests a physical underpinning.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our new observational evidence of the systematic large‐scale patterns of positive SST‐LCC feedback is consistent with both theoretical (e.g., summarized in Bretherton, 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0007">2015</a> and previous empirical evidence; Brient &amp; Schneider, 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0009">2016</a>; Qu et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0033">2015</a>, 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0034">2014</a>). Physically, an increase in SST tends to decrease the inversion strength, promote mixing of dry and warm free‐troposphere air into the cloudy layer, and therefore reduce cloud fraction. Regression analyses show that SST often exerts the primary control on LCC in current climate (Brient &amp; Schneider, 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0009">2016</a>; Qu et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0034">2014</a>). The patterns of cloud change and its connection with SST are also physically consistent with variations in EIS as shown in Figure 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0002">2</a>f. The leading pattern of EIS has excellent agreement with those from SST and LCC in both data sets, which suggests an SST‐driven local stability response in which warm SST anomalies reduce EIS.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additional analysis further confirms the presence of a positive SST‐LCC feedback that spans the decadal time scale and has coherent spatial structures. For example, expansion coefficients of both patterns of LCC and SST are significantly correlated with each other (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.92 for the first mode and 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.7 for the second). They are also highly correlated with indices of IPO (Power et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0032">1999</a>; 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.98 and 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.89 for the first mode of SST and LCC, respectively) and AMO (Enfield &amp; Nuñez, 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0016">2001</a>; 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.83 and 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.59 for the second mode of SST and LCC, respectively). These results reaffirm the similarity in spatial patterns and demonstrate the link between SST and LCC patterns in the time dimension (Figure 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0003">3</a>). Analysis of Aqua MODIS LCC data during 2003–2015 gives independent support to SST‐LCC feedback. MODIS data coverage is shorter, and its patterns may have stronger signals of higher frequency variability. Nevertheless, when applying the same procedure, patterns of leading modes of SST and MODIS LCC are also found to be negatively correlated, and their spatial patterns and temporal variability are closely related to IPO (mode 1), 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.78, and AMO, 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.62, (mode 3) indices, broadly similar to ISCCP LCC (Figure 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0002">2</a>c) with notable differences at a few areas. This is significant because sampling, sensor characteristics, and algorithms used for MODIS and ISCCP are all different, and they cover different periods. The consistent and emergent results from independent data suggest a robust patterned SST‐LCC coupling. Similar patterns also emerge from EOF analysis performed on individual fields, which reveal that their principal components are strongly correlated with each other. The fact that EOF analysis corroborates the MCA analysis suggests that these patterns and their relationships are robust.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We evaluate how skillful models are in simulating LCC response to SST by applying similar analyses to cloud data from 10 models that have run Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) experiments, where each model is driven by observed boundary conditions such as SST and sea ice concentration accompanied by best‐estimate concentrations of forcing agents (Taylor et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0039">2012</a>). An ISCCP simulator (Klein &amp; Jakob, 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0025">1999</a>; Webb et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0040">2001</a>) was applied to model cloud data to facilitate a more meaningful observation‐model comparison. To simplify the analysis, we regress both observed and modeled cloud data against IPO and AMO monthly indices, which can be taken as less strict test for the models since it does not require the model to correctly model the covariance structure between SST and modeled LCC. Models are rather skillful at capturing the overall pattern of SST‐LCC coupling as pattern correlation coefficients between modeled and observed regression patterns are above 0.44 (see Table 
  <a rid="grl57348-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl57348-supitem-0001">S1</a> in the 
  <a rid="grl57348-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl57348-supinf-0001">supporting information</a>) for IPO. However, the strength of SST‐LCC coupling, measured by percent change in LCC per degree of SST change, exhibits large variations across different models with the majority being too weak in the critical subtropical low cloud regions (see Figures 
  <a rid="grl57348-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl57348-supitem-0001">S5</a> and

  <a rid="grl57348-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl57348-supitem-0001">S2</a>). HadGem2‐ES is one of the best performing models with pattern correlation coefficients among the highest for both modes of variability and regression values between SST and LCC for both Pacific and Atlantic basins (Figures

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our observational analysis shows that large‐scale SST anomaly patterns introduced by coupled atmosphere‐ocean internal variability are amplified by a robust SST‐LCC feedback. Simulated SST‐LCC feedback strength, in turn, has been shown to affect the amplitude of SST internal variability in models (Bellomo, Clement, Mauritsen, et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0005">2014</a>; Brown et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0012">2016</a>; Myers et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0029">2017</a>). We test the effect of feedback strength on modeled internal SST amplitude by contrasting models with strong and weak SST‐LCC feedback magnitude. First, we select two regions that are dominated by low level clouds, one off Californian coast and the other in the tropical North Atlantic as indicated by the red boxes in Figure 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0004">4</a> {Klein:1993vk}. The latitudinal and longitudinal boundaries for the two boxes are 10°N to 30°N and 100°W to 120°W, and 5°N to 25°N and 25°W to 45°W. We then regress detrended AMIP LCC anomalies against detrended observed SST anomalies and pick three models with the highest regression slopes and three with the lowest. This AMIP‐based calculation selects models that have strong and weak LCC responses to SST. For both groups of models, we calculate detrended SST anomalies at each oceanic grid point and regress it against box mean SST anomalies in respective regions, which is used a measure of the internal variability (Bellomo, Clement, &amp; Norris, 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0006">2014</a>; Myers et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0029">2017</a>). We then use Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 historical simulations of coupled version of each selected model to highlight the potential effect of SST‐LCC on coupled simulations. Since we normalize the box mean SST anomaly time series, regression slopes for each grid point are SST anomaly amplitude associated with one standard deviation of box‐mean SST anomalies. These amplitudes represent amplitude of internal SST variability linearly associated with the variability in the boxed region, which has been used as a proxy for amplitude of internal SST variability (Myers et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0029">2017</a>). We plot the three‐model mean in Figure 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0004">4</a>. Global maps of these quantities can be seen in Figure 
  <a rid="grl57348-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl57348-supitem-0001">S4</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amplitudes of internal SST variability at interannual time scales in models with high SST‐LCC feedback magnitude are nearly twice as large as those of low SST‐LCC sensitivity in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 coupled historical simulations in both the Pacific and Atlantic (Figures 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0004">4</a>c to 
  <a rid="grl57348-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl57348-fig-0004">4</a>f and 
  <a rid="grl57348-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl57348-supitem-0001">S3</a> and 
  <a rid="grl57348-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl57348-supitem-0001">S4</a>). Their SST regression patterns (Figure 
  <a rid="grl57348-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl57348-supitem-0001">S4</a>) are also more realistic when compared to observed patterns (Figure 
  <a rid="grl57348-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl57348-supitem-0001">S3</a>). The critical role of low cloud feedback in modulating the amplitude and persistence of internal variability is supported by recent studies (Bellomo, Clement, Mauritsen, et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0005">2014</a>; Brown et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0011">2014</a>; Myers et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0029">2017</a>; Zhang et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0045">2010</a>). Improving the overall SST‐LCC coupling, which includes both the direct SST influence and co‐varying meteorological influences, is therefore important in order for models to simulate internal variability better.
