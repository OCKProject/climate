         <a>2010</a>; Morice et al., 
         <a>2012</a>). The warming rate is also spatially heterogeneous with characteristic large‐scale
         patterns (Figures 
         <a>1</a>b and 
         <a>1</a>c). Both internal variability and changing

         </div> and warming patterns change with time (Figures 
         <a>1</a>b and 
         <a>1</a>c). Model analyses suggest that time‐varying patterns of sea surface temperature (SST)
         can actively change 
         
         <div><span>α</span>(
            <span>t</span>)

         </div>, by convolving with individual feedback processes (Andrews et al., 
         <a>2015</a>; Armour et al., 
         <a>2013</a>; Held et al., 
         <a>2010</a>). The low cloud feedback plays a critical role in this process (Andrews et al., 
         <a>2015</a>, 
         <a>2012</a>; Gregory &amp; Andrews, 
         <a>2016</a>; Rose et al., 
         <a>2014</a>; Zhou et al., 
         <a>2016</a>). It is perhaps best illustrated in an idealized model experiment where simply changing
         the SST pattern, without altering the global mean 
         
         <div><span>T</span></div>, produces a nonzero 
         
         <div><span>N</span>(
            <span>t</span>)
            
         </div> due to cloud anomalies (Andrews et al., 
         <a>2015</a>; Zhou et al., 
         <a>2016</a>). Recent modeling studies also show that observed time‐varying patterns of SST in
         recent decades have significantly changed 
         
         <div><span>α</span>(
            <span>t</span>)
            
         </div> (Gregory &amp; Andrews, 
         <a>2016</a>; Marvel et al., 
         <a>2018</a>; Zhou et al., 
         <a>2016</a>). Low cloud feedback can in turn affect modeled SST internal variability (Bellomo,
         Clement, &amp; Norris, 
         <a>2014</a>; Brown et al., 
         <a>2014</a>; Myers et al., 
         <a>2017</a>; Zhang et al., 
         <a>2010</a>). However, direct observational evidence of patterned coupling between SST and low
         clouds are needed.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we examine large‐scale patterns of low‐cloud cover (LCC) and SST and their coupling
         at near‐global scales (60°S–60°N) using satellite data and compare them with patterns
         produced by global climate models. LCC feedback is a major component of the overall
         cloud feedback (Clement et al., 
         <a>2009</a>; Qu et al., 
         <a>2014</a>; Zelinka et al., 
         <a>2016</a>). Previous regression analyses have shown that SST exerts a prime control on local
         and regional mean LCC variations, with inversion strength, a proxy for lower troposphere
         stability, being the next most important factor (Brient &amp; Schneider, 
         <a>2016</a>; Qu et al., 
         <a>2014</a>). Patterns of large‐scale LCC variability at interannual and longer time scales and
         their coupling with SST have received less attention, however. Here we focus on large‐scale
         spatial patterns and associated temporal variations. The LCC‐SST feedback analyzed
         here is assumed to encompass both the direct influence of SST on LCC as well as the
         indirect meteorological influences (e.g., stability) that vary in concert with SST.
         Our analysis does not separate out the remote impact of SST anomaly on LCC through
         modifying troposphere stability in remote areas (Qu et al., 
         <a>2014</a>; Zhou et al., 
         <a>2017</a>).
