 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use the bias corrected International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) cloud fraction data (Norris &amp; Evan,

  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0037">1999</a>). Artifacts removed include those associated with changes in viewing geometry, satellite transitions, and other factors. The process for removing spurious variability also removes any real variability occurring in the 60°S–60°N but has little impact on investigations of regional changes examined in this study. Here the sum of low and midlevel cloud fraction is used to better represent the true total low cloud fraction (Yuan et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0042">2016</a>). Aqua MODIS level‐3 monthly products are also used to derive low cloud fraction (Platnick et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0031">2016</a>). MODIS onboard Aqua is well calibrated. Specifically, we divide the total number of pixels whose cloud top pressure is higher than 680 hPa by the total number of pixels in a grid. We compare the climatology of MODIS and ISCCP LCC using these definitions, and their spatial patterns are broadly similar with each other, with noticeable differences in places such as tropical Eastern Pacific (see Figure

  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0038">2008</a>) for surface air temperature and Extended Reconstructed SST from the NOAA Climatic Data Center (Dee et al., 
  <a rid="grl57348-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#grl57348-bib-0014">2011</a>) for SST data. Meteorological variables from European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts Re‐analysis (ERA) Interim (ERA‐Interim) are used to derive the estimated inversion strength (EIS; Wood &amp; Bretherton,
