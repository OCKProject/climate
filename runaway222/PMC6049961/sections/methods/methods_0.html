      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We apply maximum covariance analysis (MCA; Bretherton et al., 
         <a>1992</a>) and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to objectively obtain patterns
         naturally emerging from observations and their time series. MCA performs a singular
         value decomposition of the covariance matrix between two different variables. The
         spatial patterns of each variable are the singular vectors, and the temporal variability
         is obtained by projecting the spatial patterns back onto the original data fields.
         The leading modes of MCA maximize the covariance between the two variables. The method
         identifies modes (with spatial patterns and temporal variability) that both dominate
         the variability in the two variables and are potentially strongly correlated with
         one another. The correlation coefficients between expansion coefficients, that is,
         the temporal variability of corresponding spatial patterns, indicate how tightly the
         two are related. EOF performed on individual data sets finds dominant patterns that
         explain the most variance and their time series by projecting each pattern back onto
         the original data. Here we present spatial patterns of each mode by regressing its
         time series, after normalization, onto the original data set. Each grid value in the
         pattern quantifies the amount of change in this variable associated with one standard
         deviation of change in the time series.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We address the challenge of interpreting decadal changes of LCC by examining two independent
         global satellite data records and analyzing characteristic patterns instead of local
         or regional trends, that is, the bias‚Äêcorrected monthly mean gridded ISCCP LCC between
         1984 and 2009 and the Aqua MODIS LCC between 2003 and 2015. Seasonal cycle of LCC
         is removed. Concurrent EIS and SST are also brought into the fold to illustrate their
         accompanying changes.
