 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Land Parameter Retrieval Model is mainly based on the relationship between polarization ratios, vegetation optical depth, and the soil dielectric constant and the derived surface soil moisture represents the uppermost 1–1.5 cm, as the AMSR‐E detects microwave brightness temperatures at X (8–12 GHz) and C band (4–8 GHz). We use the AMSR estimated at 1:30 a.m. local time, which is the descending overpass time of AMSR‐E. The soil moisture from GLEAM is derived as evaporative stress representing the whole root zone depth using remotely sensed radiation, precipitation, air temperature, soil moisture, vegetation optical depth, and snow water equivalent as input. The GLEAM data used in this study (see also Hsu et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0019">1997</a>, 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0016">2015</a>) assimilate AMSR soil moisture available for 2002–2011 period and were driven by the three different precipitation data sets used in this study. Since a soil moisture estimate at a specific timing of day (9 a.m.) is required for calculating the SMP feedback metrics, the original GLEAM formulation that provides estimates of daily averages (0–24 UTC) was modified such that the input variables are aggregated at a local daily cycle, which starts and ends at 9 a.m. local time and the estimated soil moisture hence corresponds to instantaneous values at 9 a.m. Further details of this specific version of GLEAM can be found in Guillod et al.
