 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite substantial research over the past few decades, soil moisture‐precipitation (hereafter SMP) feedbacks remain among the most uncertain processes in the field of land‐atmospheric interactions (Santanello et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0032">2017</a>; Seneviratne et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0033">2010</a>). Soil moisture influence on precipitation at seasonal to interannual scales has been investigated with the concept of moisture recycling (Dirmeyer et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0006">2006</a>; Eltahir &amp; Bras, 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0010">1996</a>; van der Ent et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0040">2010</a>), here referred to as direct SMP feedback. There has also been an increasing attention toward understanding indirect SMP feedback at subdaily to daily scales, which is also the focus of our study. Indirect SMP feedback can be narrowed down to the influence of soil moisture condition on boundary layer characteristics and convective initiation. Several studies have investigated such local effects of soil moisture using two main types of approaches. Some focused on the temporal effect of soil moisture on rainfall based on one‐dimensional frameworks, which can yield both positive and negative effects (Alfieri et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0001">2008</a>; Duerinck et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0009">2016</a>; Findell &amp; Eltahir, 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0012">2003</a>; Gentine et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0014">2013</a>; Guillod et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0015">2014</a>). A positive temporal feedback appears when the increase of moisture is more critical for the cloud formation and precipitation, often under low stability in the free troposphere. A negative temporal feedback usually appears under a strong stability barrier at the top of planetary boundary layer, which requires larger sensible heat to allow sufficient turbulent mixing (Hohenegger et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0017">2009</a>). Another line of research considers spatial soil moisture gradients (C. M. Taylor &amp; Lebel, 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0036">1998</a>) whereby locally drier soils induce a mesoscale atmospheric circulation such that increased convergence over the drier region, which leads to convection (C. M. Taylor et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0037">2011</a>). Conceptually, temporal and spatial feedbacks may interact: Rainfall may produce spatial heterogeneities in soil moisture that subsequently lead to further rainfall events over the drier regions, thereby increasing precipitation occurrence over a wider area (Guillod et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0016">2015</a>; H. Hsu et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0020">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C. M. Taylor, de Jeu, et al. (
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0035">2012</a>) have demonstrated that observations display a negative spatial SMP feedback, contrary to global climate models (GCMs), which display a positive feedback. This misrepresentation of SMP feedback in GCMs suggests issues in the dynamics of rainfall and soil moisture and could introduce systematic errors in the climate simulated by these models. Many studies have assessed the feedback in GCMs using different approaches, including modeling experiments. Koster et al. (
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0023">2006</a>) investigated the relative strength of the SMP feedback across GCMs in terms of precipitation variability explained by soil moisture and highlighted regions with stronger coupling such as the Sahel and central North America. Several regional studies analyzed the development of convective rainfall in model simulations with different soil moisture perturbations, in, for example, South Africa (Cook et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0004">2006</a>), the Indian and African monsoon region (Douville et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0008">2001</a>; Meehl, 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0025">1994</a>), the Alpine region (Hohenegger et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0017">2009</a>), and the Sahel (C. M. Taylor et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0034">2013</a>). These studies commonly concluded that simulations with parameterized convection, as applied in most of the GCMs, are not able to simulate negative feedbacks. In addition, although the previous studies have proven the substantial contribution of parameterized convection to SMP feedback in models, the role of the land surface schemes should not be overlooked as surface variability induced from land surface processes is likely to influence the development of convection and thus the SMP feedback itself.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies mainly point to the spatial resolution of models and thereby parameterization of convection as the main issue that may prevent GCMs from correctly simulating SMP feedbacks. Nonetheless, there is a lack of understanding in how such feedbacks are represented in current GCMs, especially with respect to their spatial and temporal components. In this study, for the first time we evaluate both spatial and temporal SMP feedbacks in a large ensemble of fully coupled climate models using the diagnostics introduced by C. M. Taylor, de Jeu, et al. (
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0035">2012</a>) and Guillod et al. (
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0016">2015</a>). Section 
  <a rid="grl58562-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" href="#grl58562-sec-0002">2</a> describes the observational data and models used in the analysis. Section 
  <a rid="grl58562-sec-0007" ref-type="sec" href="#grl58562-sec-0007">3</a> describes the coupling diagnostics and their application to both observations and models. The analysis of SMP feedbacks in observations and models is presented in section 
  <a rid="grl58562-sec-0009" ref-type="sec" href="#grl58562-sec-0009">4.1</a>. In section 
  <a rid="grl58562-sec-0010" ref-type="sec" href="#grl58562-sec-0010">4.2</a>, the possible collective effects of spatial and temporal SMP feedbacks in observations and models are discussed. Conclusions are drawn in section
