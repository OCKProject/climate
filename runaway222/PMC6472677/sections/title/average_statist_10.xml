Spatial SMP feedback (Ys) in the models is dominantly positive as opposed to generally nonsignificant or negative Ys in observations. The highest fraction of models simulating positive Ys is found in South America, South Africa, and northern Australia. C. M. Taylor, de Jeu, et al. (
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0035">2012</a>) also found dominantly positive Ys in model simulations of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project that are forced with prescribed sea surface temperature. Some models still capture negative Ys in the western part of Sahel, which appears as one of the regions with the strongest negative Ys in the observations. In North America and North Asia, most of the models simulate nonsignificant Ys.

   <p>The three soil moisture‐precipitation feedback metrics (from top to bottom: spatial, temporal, and heterogeneity metrics) in observations (left column) and CMIP5 models (right column). Colors are determined by the fraction of observation data set combinations or models in the following three categories: negative, nonsignificant, and positive with a 10% significance level. The 5° boxes with less than five valid observational or model soil moisture‐precipitation feedback estimates were excluded.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temporal feedback (Yt) in the models shows better agreement with observations than the other two feedback metrics. Positive Yt in Australia, South Africa, North Asia, and India and negative Yt in western South America and western Sahel are reasonably well captured by the models. Yet in North America the models show very different behavior compared to observations, with strong negative Yt in the eastern part. Larger variability across the models is found in central North America, western and southern parts of Brazil, and central Africa (indicated by light purple). Note also that large‐scale factors such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or sea surface temperature variability could substantially affect precipitation persistence, which in turn may lead to a spurious correlation between soil moisture and subsequent precipitation (Guillod et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0015">2014</a>; Salvucci et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0031">2002</a>). For instance, precipitation persistence at the time scale of the order of weeks induced by oceanic or atmospheric processes could lead to a positive temporal metric even in the absence of SMP feedback mechanism (Orlowsky &amp; Seneviratne, 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0028">2010</a>; Tuttle &amp; Salvucci, 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0039">2017</a>). Although we cannot exclude such artifacts, the temporal feedback metric allows for a comparison between observations and models while providing an indication on the temporal feedback (Guillod et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0016">2015</a>). We note that the temporal metric also exhibits a negative sign in some regions, for example, parts of the Sahel and Southern Great Plains, indicating that the metric does not systematically identify positive coupling mechanisms.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the heterogeneity feedback (Yh) is dominantly positive or nonsignificant in observations, around 50% of the models capture positive Yh correctly but show negative Yh in most of the regions where observations indicate nonsignificant Yh. In observations, Yt and Yh generally have a positive sign, if statistically significant. In the models, similarity between Yt and Yh is much stronger than in observations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The feedback metrics for individual observations and models are shown in Figures 
  <a rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supitem-0001">S2</a> and 
  <a rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supitem-0001">S3</a> (
  <a rid="grl58562-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supinf-0001">supporting information</a>), respectively. Interproduct variability is relatively large, and clusters of model families can be identified (see also Text 
  <a rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supitem-0001">S1</a>). In addition, we note that observations and models also show substantially different spatial coverage of the feedback metrics, reflecting that a lower number of events are detected in several models (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supitem-0001">S3</a>, 
  <a rid="grl58562-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supinf-0001">supporting information</a>), since the same threshold for the minimum number of events is applied for both models and observation to ensure the statistical significance of estimated SMP feedback metrics. These differences in the number of analyzed precipitation events can be due to differences in spatial resolution (leading to more events in observations compared to models) and in the length of the time series (more events in models). In addition, a part of the difference may be due to the known drizzle issue, that is, an overestimated frequency of light intensity precipitation, in GCMs (Dai, 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0005">2006</a>; Rosa &amp; Collins, 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0030">2013</a>). Hence, masking out the days with morning precipitation could be more critical for SMP diagnostics in the models.
