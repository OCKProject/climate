 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, three precipitation data sets and four soil moisture data sets are used, which resulted in 12 combinations of observational estimates of the SMP feedback metrics. Using multiple observational data sets allows to consider observational uncertainty in identifying the SMP feedback (Ford et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0013">2018</a>; Guillod et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0016">2015</a>). All observational data are sets commonly available over the period 2002–2011 at 0.25° × 0.25° resolutions.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use three different 3‐hourly precipitation data sets that are commonly based on multiple satellite measurements: version 1.0 of the CMORPH (Climate Prediction Center morphing method, Joyce et al., 
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0022">2004</a>) precipitation product, PERSIANN (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks, K.‐L. Hsu et al., 
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0019">1997</a>), and version 7 of TRMM3B42 (from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, hereafter referred as TRMM, Huffman et al., 
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0021">2007</a>). CMORPH precipitation is derived by propagating infrared data from geostationary satellites to precipitation estimates obtained from passive microwave sensor aboard polar‐orbiting satellites, which complement each other with their different advantages on detection accuracy and spatiotemporal coverage. The PERSIANN algorithm also uses combined infrared and passive microwave information from multiple geostationary and low Earth orbit satellites with an artificial neural network model of which parameters are updated with ground‐based data. TRMM precipitation is a combined precipitation estimates from multiple satellite systems, which is adjusted with rain gauge observations. We adjusted the 3‐hourly precipitation data sets to local time based on longitude before the analysis.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil Moisture Data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use Land Parameter Retrieval Model (Owe et al., 
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0029">2008</a>) version of AMSR‐E (The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System) soil moisture (hereafter referred to as AMSR), and three different soil moisture estimates from GLEAM (Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model, Miralles et al. (
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0026">2011</a>)), the latter resulting from the use of three precipitation data sets described in the former section as an input to GLEAM.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Land Parameter Retrieval Model is mainly based on the relationship between polarization ratios, vegetation optical depth, and the soil dielectric constant and the derived surface soil moisture represents the uppermost 1–1.5 cm, as the AMSR‐E detects microwave brightness temperatures at X (8–12 GHz) and C band (4–8 GHz). We use the AMSR estimated at 1:30 a.m. local time, which is the descending overpass time of AMSR‐E. The soil moisture from GLEAM is derived as evaporative stress representing the whole root zone depth using remotely sensed radiation, precipitation, air temperature, soil moisture, vegetation optical depth, and snow water equivalent as input. The GLEAM data used in this study (see also Hsu et al., 
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0019">1997</a>, 
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0016">2015</a>) assimilate AMSR soil moisture available for 2002–2011 period and were driven by the three different precipitation data sets used in this study. Since a soil moisture estimate at a specific timing of day (9 a.m.) is required for calculating the SMP feedback metrics, the original GLEAM formulation that provides estimates of daily averages (0–24 UTC) was modified such that the input variables are aggregated at a local daily cycle, which starts and ends at 9 a.m. local time and the estimated soil moisture hence corresponds to instantaneous values at 9 a.m. Further details of this specific version of GLEAM can be found in Guillod et al. (
