Spatial SMP feedback (Ys) in the models is dominantly positive as opposed to generally nonsignificant or negative Ys in observations. The highest fraction of models simulating positive Ys is found in South America, South Africa, and northern Australia. C. M. Taylor, de Jeu, et al. (
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0035">2012</a>) also found dominantly positive Ys in model simulations of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project that are forced with prescribed sea surface temperature. Some models still capture negative Ys in the western part of Sahel, which appears as one of the regions with the strongest negative Ys in the observations. In North America and North Asia, most of the models simulate nonsignificant Ys.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temporal feedback (Yt) in the models shows better agreement with observations than the other two feedback metrics. Positive Yt in Australia, South Africa, North Asia, and India and negative Yt in western South America and western Sahel are reasonably well captured by the models. Yet in North America the models show very different behavior compared to observations, with strong negative Yt in the eastern part. Larger variability across the models is found in central North America, western and southern parts of Brazil, and central Africa (indicated by light purple). Note also that large‐scale factors such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or sea surface temperature variability could substantially affect precipitation persistence, which in turn may lead to a spurious correlation between soil moisture and subsequent precipitation (Guillod et al., 
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0015">2014</a>; Salvucci et al., 
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0031">2002</a>). For instance, precipitation persistence at the time scale of the order of weeks induced by oceanic or atmospheric processes could lead to a positive temporal metric even in the absence of SMP feedback mechanism (Orlowsky &amp; Seneviratne, 
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0028">2010</a>; Tuttle &amp; Salvucci, 
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0039">2017</a>). Although we cannot exclude such artifacts, the temporal feedback metric allows for a comparison between observations and models while providing an indication on the temporal feedback (Guillod et al., 
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0016">2015</a>). We note that the temporal metric also exhibits a negative sign in some regions, for example, parts of the Sahel and Southern Great Plains, indicating that the metric does not systematically identify positive coupling mechanisms.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the heterogeneity feedback (Yh) is dominantly positive or nonsignificant in observations, around 50% of the models capture positive Yh correctly but show negative Yh in most of the regions where observations indicate nonsignificant Yh. In observations, Yt and Yh generally have a positive sign, if statistically significant. In the models, similarity between Yt and Yh is much stronger than in observations.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The feedback metrics for individual observations and models are shown in Figures 
   <a rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supitem-0001">S2</a> and 
   <a rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supitem-0001">S3</a> (
   <a rid="grl58562-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supinf-0001">supporting information</a>), respectively. Interproduct variability is relatively large, and clusters of model families can be identified (see also Text 
   <a rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supitem-0001">S1</a>). In addition, we note that observations and models also show substantially different spatial coverage of the feedback metrics, reflecting that a lower number of events are detected in several models (Figure 
   <a rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supitem-0001">S3</a>, 
   <a rid="grl58562-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supinf-0001">supporting information</a>), since the same threshold for the minimum number of events is applied for both models and observation to ensure the statistical significance of estimated SMP feedback metrics. These differences in the number of analyzed precipitation events can be due to differences in spatial resolution (leading to more events in observations compared to models) and in the length of the time series (more events in models). In addition, a part of the difference may be due to the known drizzle issue, that is, an overestimated frequency of light intensity precipitation, in GCMs (Dai, 
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0005">2006</a>; Rosa &amp; Collins, 
   <a rid="grl58562-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0030">2013</a>). Hence, masking out the days with morning precipitation could be more critical for SMP diagnostics in the models.

Results of the same analysis using different significant levels are presented in the

Only 5° × 5° boxes of which more than a third are land areas were classified as land are considered, and the ratio of land area is calculated with area‐weighted composition. Analyzing Ys and Yt in a combined way allows for a more comprehensive comparison of the prerainfall morning soil moisture conditions between observations and models. Additionally, with the consideration of Yh, we discuss possible mechanisms behind the commonly found combinations of SMP feedback metrics in both observations and models and how they potentially contribute to the spatial and temporal structure of precipitation persistence.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combination of negative (hereafter, N) Ys and positive (hereafter, P) Yt occurs predominantly in the observations. While each observational estimate shows a similar fraction of land area, the regions where the combination appears vary across different observational data sets (Figure 
   <a rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supitem-0001">S2</a>, 
   <a rid="grl58562-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supinf-0001">supporting information</a>). An important implication of this combination (NYs‐PYt) is that the majority of the afternoon rainfall events occur when the whole event domain is anomalously wet, since the location of maximum afternoon precipitation occurs over a grid cell with positive soil moisture anomaly in the morning (PYt), while the surrounding grid cells have even higher soil moisture anomaly (NYs). Therefore, the dominant positive heterogeneity metric across all observed estimations (Figure 
   <a rid="grl58562-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58562-fig-0002">2</a>, lower left) indicates high heterogeneity among positive soil moisture anomalies, which should be distinguished from high heterogeneity due to mixture of dry and wet soil moisture anomalies. The other dominant combination in observations is NYs‐NYt. This combination still reflects significantly more frequent afternoon rainfall occurrence over regions drier than their surroundings but also less precipitation persistence due to NYt. In addition, this combination does not reveal the large‐scale soil moisture condition in the entire event domain, unlike the former, and thus, there is larger uncertainty in how the positive Yh is driven. It should be noted that in Figure 
   <a rid="grl58562-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58562-fig-0002">2</a>, the combination of positive spatial and positive temporal metrics (PYs‐PYt) also seems to appear relatively often. However, looking at the maps of the metrics (Figure 
   <a rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supitem-0001">S2</a>) reveals that this cooccurrence in fact stems from various, randomly distributed grid cells and does not cluster into consistent regions. Therefore, this signal appears not robust and should be interpreted with caution.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In models, the combination of positive Ys and Yt (PYs‐PYt) appears as the most common and is, unlike in observations, also confirmed by the maps in Figure 
   <a rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58562-supitem-0001">S3</a>. This combination indicates localized (grid scale) dry or wet persistence as it means that afternoon rainfall occurs more frequently over the temporally and spatially wetter regions. This is opposed to the observational estimates. PYs‐NYt is the second most common combination in the models. PYs‐NYt indicates that afternoon rainfall is more likely under dry soil condition and occurs over wetter regions in a given area. Thus, under this combination of feedbacks increase in precipitation likelihood might be only possible when there are sufficient drying down periods between the precipitation events, indicating a system with low precipitation persistence or high evaporative demands. The fraction of areas with different signs of Yh varies substantially across different models, but for each given model, the fractions of NYh and PYh are comparable. CNRM‐CM5 appears as the only model where fraction of land areas with negative Ys and significant Yt is larger than 10%. IPSL‐CM5A‐MR simulates dominantly positive signals in all three metrics.
