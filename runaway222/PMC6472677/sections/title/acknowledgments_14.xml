 <p>We would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments. We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups for producing and making available their model output which are available at

For CMIP the U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison provides coordinating support and led development of software infrastructure in partnership with the Global Organization for Earth System Science Portals. We thank Urs Beyerle for the retrieval and preparation of CMIP5 model data. We also acknowledge the providers of observation data of the following products: CMORPH (
