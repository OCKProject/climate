  <p>The three soil moisture‐precipitation feedback metrics (from top to bottom: spatial, temporal, and heterogeneity metrics) in observations (left column) and CMIP5 models (right column). Colors are determined by the fraction of observation data set combinations or models in the following three categories: negative, nonsignificant, and positive with a 10% significance level. The 5° boxes with less than five valid observational or model soil moisture‐precipitation feedback estimates were excluded.</p>
