 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is interesting that the Younger Dryas chronozone (YD) is the only stadial fully represented in speleothem EC-16-5-F (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Although the rate of calcite deposition during this interval did slow somewhat, deposition was maintained during this stadial, and implies that permafrost and glaciation were largely absent. It is also interesting that isotope values follow the same trend as from the lake core collected on Baker Island

  <span class="sup">13</span>C values during progressively colder time intervals. Growth of speleothem EC-16-5-F during the YD stadial may imply that cooling associated with the stadial may have been relatively subdued compared to other stadials described in the INTIMATE event stratigraphy
