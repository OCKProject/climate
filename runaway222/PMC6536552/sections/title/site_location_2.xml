 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Speleothem EC-16-5-F was collected from El Capitan Cave (56°9.72′N, 133°19.14′W) on Prince of Wales Island, Southeastern Alaska (Fig.

  </span>. El Capitan Cave is the largest known cave in Alaska, with a total surveyed passage length of 3.85 km and a mapped vertical extent of 131 m, consisting of three main levels. Speleothem EC-16-5-F was found 90 m inside the middle level, which is horizontal from the main cave entrance. The stalagmite is 14 cm tall and its upper (youngest) part was missing. This passage is ventilated only when a sump deeper in the cave is low enough to allow air flow, which typically occurs in summer. The interior of the cave where the stalagmite was collected is ~80 m above sea level (a.s.l), with the catchment above the cave reaching an elevation of ~700 m a.s.l.
