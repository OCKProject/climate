 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The episodic growth of speleothem EC-16-5-F prevents a continuous paleoclimate reconstruction; however, certain interpretations can still be made. During MIS 3, average δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values are relatively stable, ranging from −6.5‰ to −4.2‰ and −9.2‰ to −8.9‰, respectively. Since growth periods are attributed to relatively mild conditions when permafrost is absent, large isotopic transitions leading into and out of stadials are mostly missing in the EC-16-5-F record.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The largest change in both δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O occurs at the end of GI
  <span class="italic">-</span>10, at 40,972 ± 831 yr BP, when δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values decrease by 5.2‰ and 1.6‰, respectively (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). This transition offers a glimpse of isotopic changes during a D-O cycle from an interstadial into a stadial. These isotopic shifts are difficult to interpret because no modern speleothem records exist for this region that would allow a calibration of the speleothem isotopic response to modern temperature/precipitation and vegetation changes. However, as moisture sources are not expected to have changed fundamentally during these periods, the large drop in δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O most likely reflects cooler temperatures and/or an increase in the ratio of winter to summer precipitation. It is less clear why δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C values decrease at this time. Cooling reflected in low δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values sometimes results in less soil productivity and higher δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C values, but this is not the case in this record, which shows lower δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values corresponding to lower δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C values (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). A change in the vegetation, such as a change from gymnosperms to angiosperms
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>, instead of just soil productivity, could be responsible for this pattern. Gymnosperms are known to have enriched δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>leaf</sub> values compared to co-occurring angiosperms
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C of bulk sediment from a lake core collected on Baker Island, 100 km south of El Capitan Cave, when compared to pollen from the same horizon, shows a clear trend toward lower δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C values corresponding to increased angiosperm presence (
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span>) and occurs during the coldest part of the record during the Younger Dryas interval. Higher δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C values correspond to increased gymnosperm presence (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Pinus, Tsuga mertensiana</span>) and occur during the warmer parts of the record
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. Therefore, the area may have been covered by angiosperm herbs and shrubs during cold intervals, while gymnosperm woodlands expanded during warmer intervals. These changes in δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C may be related to shifts and/or strength of the Aleutian Low, with an enhanced Aleutian Low providing warmer/wetter conditions needed for speleothem growth at these northern latitudes.
