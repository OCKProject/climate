 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The episodic growth pattern of stalagmite EC-16-5-F from Southeastern Alaska represents a sensitive response to climate and new insight into the impacts of D-O events in the North Pacific realm. The independent chronology, when compared with a the Greenland ice core and North Pacific marine core records, provides strong evidence of teleconnections between the North Atlantic and North Pacific realms during MIS 3. Small differences in the timing of speleothem growth phases in climate-sensitive cave sites compared with the North Pacific, such as at GI 16.1a and 17.2, highlight the need for a network of studies using high-precision archives to map out the regional impact of D-O events.</p>
