  <p>The climate change induced shifts in the 
   <span class="italic">Fucus</span> mean growth and biomass (left) and the probability of occurrence of 
   <span class="italic">Idotea</span> (right) in three regions of the Baltic Sea. E denotes experiment, S survey and S + E combined models, respectively. The panels show the relative difference under climate change compared to current conditions (that is: (future-current)/current). In each mark, lines show the posterior expected difference and the 95% credible interval and the shape of the mark indicates the shape of the posterior distribution.
