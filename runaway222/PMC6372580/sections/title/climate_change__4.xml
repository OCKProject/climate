 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The probability of occurrence and biomass of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> as well as the probability of occurrence of 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> had a tipping point at salinities 3–10 psu. The tipping was more radical and happened at lower salinities in cold temperature than warm temperature regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Hence, the projections indicate that both 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> will have a lower probability of survival and probability of occurrence under future climate conditions compared to current environmental conditions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). In addition, 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> will have a lower growth rate (experiment) and biomass (distribution data) under these conditions. The predicted effects of climate change with experimental and distribution data SDMs had similar direction of change but were quantitatively different. In the case of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span>, the predicted relative changes in biomass were larger in the distribution data SDM and in the SDM combining distribution and experimental data compared to relative changes in growth in the experimental data SDM. The former two models had also larger uncertainty related to the projections. The climate induced relative effects on 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> were stronger in the distribution data SDM and in the SDM combining distribution and experimental data compared to the SDM including experimental data only. See Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a> for changes in absolute scale. Regardless of models, large areas of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> habitats would be lost in the central and marginal regions of the Baltic Sea. The projections indicate that the entrance populations of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> handle well the future conditions as we did not find differences among current and future climate conditions in any of the responses (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). In addition, the models showed that a considerable reduction in the biomass of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> predicted under future climate conditions would result in a much severer decline of the probability of occurrence of 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> in marginal and central areas than if reduction in 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> biomass was not taken into account (i.e. projections including experimental data only) (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>).

    <p>The climate change induced shifts in the 
     <span class="italic">Fucus</span> mean growth and biomass (left) and the probability of occurrence of 
     <span class="italic">Idotea</span> (right) in three regions of the Baltic Sea. E denotes experiment, S survey and S + E combined models, respectively. The panels show the relative difference under climate change compared to current conditions (that is: (future-current)/current). In each mark, lines show the posterior expected difference and the 95% credible interval and the shape of the mark indicates the shape of the posterior distribution.
