 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we built an hierarchical Bayesian approach to combine 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> ecological information on expected responses along salinity and temperature gradients with experimental and distribution data. These combined (distribution and experimental data) models performed equally well as the distribution data models when predicting the current distribution ranges of the species and when extrapolating outside the salinity and temperature range in the training data. The models using experimental data only had poorer performance than the models using survey data when predicting the current distribution range but similar performance as the models using survey data when predicting outside current distribution range. The explanatory power, as measured by R
  <span class="sup">2</span> (biomass) and Tjur- R
  <span class="sup">2</span> (occurrence) values (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) was practically similar for all 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> models, whereas in the case of 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> the experimental data model had clearly the worst, and the model combining experimental and distribution data, the best explanatory power.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results indicate that the experimental and field data contain largely the same information about salinity and temperature tolerance levels at the current environmental conditions. Our field data were very large and therefore the added information from the experiments was small. However, when the size of field data is smaller or when the responses in field and experimental data are different, the experimental data will have larger effect on performance of the combined model.</p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experimental data model had worse interpolation performance than the two other models since the current probabilities of occurrence of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> are relatively low in marginal and central areas and therefore the prevalence of these species across the study region is smaller on average than predicted by experiments where these species were always originally present. In addition, the distribution of these species is not regulated only by salinity and temperature, which were the environmental variables used in the experiments. In the models with distribution data the spatial random effect allowed adjustment for distribution patterns that could not be explained by temperature and salinity alone and, hence, improved the projections by implicitly modeling the effect of environmental factors not included in the model. These differences between experimental and distribution data partly explain large differences in the Tjur-R
  <span class="sup">2</span> value between 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> experimental data model and the two other 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> models. In the experiments, the survival of 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> was relatively large within all salinity-temperature combinations leading to predictive probabilities near 50%, and hence small Tjur-R
  <span class="sup">2</span>, whereas in the distribution data the range in the probability of occurrence of 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> was larger leading to larger Tjur-R
  <span class="sup">2</span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution data was more evenly spread along the Finnish and Estonian coast as compared to the south-eastern Baltic sea or Swedish coast. Hence, in these sparsely sampled areas we are extrapolating spatially for locations that are far from any sampling station. However, we are not extrapolating as significantly with respect to salinity and temperature, the main factors explaining species distribution in our model, since the distribution data covers well their current gradient (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a> in the supplement). Due to spatial random effect, our projections are more accurate in locations that are near sampling sites. However, the difference between projected current and future distribution ranges behaves equally well in all regions since in our study these differences are driven by salinity and temperature changes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study clearly demonstrated that climate induced changes are expected to considerably reduce the distribution range of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> in the Baltic Sea and their range shrinkage is expected to be similar due to covariation of their distribution. Shifts in salinity displayed a systematically stronger effect than water temperature for both 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span>. Low-salinity regions below 3–5 psu were characterized by reduced occurrence probability, survival, biomass and/or growth. In this study we did not analyse the effect of salinity on reproduction. However, for the studied species, sexual reproduction is possible at salinities above 3.5 psu

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>, so our models do not overestimate the future range of these species.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contemporary climate change, principally caused by human induced global warming poses a threat to marine life
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Many previous studies have focused on tropical ecosystems with negligible annual temperature fluctuations, and where even a minor temperature increase can lead to regime shifts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. In contrast, the Baltic Sea shows strong annual fluctuations from subzero during winter to +25 °C in summer, and thereby projected changes in average future temperatures have less severe effects compared to the predicted shift in salinity. Here, both 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> live within their optimal temperature range and can tolerate much higher average seawater temperatures than predicted by future climate scenarios
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>. Nevertheless, the expected increase in temperature may still lead to re-structuring of the Baltic Sea ecosystem through increasing the frequency of heat waves and through multiple synergistic effects of climate change conditions on producer, herbivore and predator trophic levels

 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> models suggest that species interactions are expected to modulate responses induced by contemporary climate change. Most of the species in the Baltic Sea live close to their physiological salinity tolerance limits but different species have different threshold levels. Although 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> tolerate slightly lower salinities than 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>, the range retreats were similar due to the strong preference of 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> for 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> as a host species and consequent covariation of their distribution
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>. In fact, our models predicted that the future Baltic Sea has very sporadic occurrences of 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span>, mostly associated with the future 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> habitats and as such demonstrated how the availability of habitat and/or resource can narrow the realized niche of a species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to stress that our modelling study is limited to the provision of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> habitat for 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> whereas other biotic interactions remained unaccounted for. To some extent the populations of 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> are controlled by fish species; however, the magnitude of such control is not known. Moreover, there is no common agreement on the projections of predator populations to the future Baltic Sea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>. Earlier studies have indicated though, that bottom up processes (i.e. the availability of nutrients and macroalgae) primarily describe the spatial patterns and dynamics of herbivore populations in the study area, even at the marginal low salinity regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. Significant effects of 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> on 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> are expected only when populations of the host alga are severely stressed from other disturbances such as strong epiphytic load induced by coastal eutrophication

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span>. SDMs often neglect species interactions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span>, which impedes the effectiveness of climate change projections, as biotic interactions (e.g. mutualism, competition and predation) may constrain the responses of species

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One potentially important aspect that may affect range shifts driven by climate change is the presence of intra-specific variation in niche space, e.g. ecotypes and locally adapted populations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> with varying potential to respond to shifts in environmental conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Previous reports suggest that 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> shows inter-regional genetic differentiation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
  </span>, although it is poorly known if this variation is correlated with physiological differences. Also for 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> geographic genetic and phenotypic differentations are known
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span>. Recently, some studies have explored how the presence of locally adapted populations within a species may affect projections from SDMs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>
  </span>. Although occurrence data may accurately model the present distribution even without any knowledge about locally adapted subpopulations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>
  </span>, this may not be the case when SDMs are used to predict future range shifts, e.g. driven by climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>
  </span>. SDM projections may both underestimate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>
  </span> and overestimate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>
  </span> the loss of future habitat when intraspecific variation is neglected. This happens if all individuals are considered to form a single population when training models with data instead of using separate regression fits for each differentiated subpopulation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our experiments we sampled 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> populations along the Baltic Sea, from the entrance to the marginal region
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>. Then the species were reared under the current ambient and future conditions projected to occur in the region of origin of the populations. By experimentally quantifying the potential differentiation in tolerance of populations along the salinity and temperature gradients we were able to incorporate realistic responses of locally adapted populations in our joint models.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The models we present here are based on fixed niches so that populations follow the environmental change by range shifts. Another possibility is that populations adapt to tolerate the novel conditions, i.e. the traits providing tolerance evolve through selection by the changing environment
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">75</a>
  </span>. Thus, a projection of future distribution that takes into account evolutionary responses requires knowledge on heritable genetic variation in tolerance that provides adaptation potential to climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>
  </span>. Unfortunately, scientists seldom know if, or how quickly, the climate-sensitive traits of populations can evolve
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">75</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>
  </span>. Our experiment on 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> provided evidence for inter-population variation as well as genotypic variation in the performance responses to future conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. Thus, in this sense niche-based models may overestimate the predicted range shifts.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even though an inclusion of the experimental data did not improve the predictive performance of SDMs in our tests, it improves the credibility of our results concerning climate change projections. Since our inference is conditioned on experimental data, we can make more conclusive claims on the cause-effect relationship between temperature, salinity and species distribution than would be possible when including only noncausal species distribution data. The credibility of such interdependencies is of central importance in SDM since it governs how well the model can project species distribution patterns in a set of environmental conditions that we have not yet witnessed but are projected to occur under future climate

 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conclusive causal experiments on biotic-abiotic interdependencies are possible only in highly simplified settings. When using our methodology, targeted experiments can be planned to inform about the most important abiotic effects and/or interspecific interactions expected to drive the distribution changes. Moreover, we can also infer environmental responses at a wider spectrum of factors than what is possible by using only either of the data sets. One of the strengths of our method is that it is a rather straightforward extension of current SDMs and, hence, easily applicable for other species and statistical SDMs as well. We build our model using semiparametric GP models which have gained increasing interest in ecology in recent years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>
  </span> because such models allow an easy inclusion of flexible response curves and interaction terms

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. However, the hierarchical structure to combine experimental and distribution data could, in principle, be implemented in any statistical SDM, such as generalized linear or additive models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>
  </span>. In addition to combining experimental and non-causal distribution data, we extend the existing GP methods by incorporating qualitative prior knowledge on the direction of the response. This is a novel methodological advance in SDMs and is expected to improve the predictive performance of semiparametric SDMs more generally.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, our method is still purely statistical in the sense that it does not involve any mechanistic description of the cause-effect relationship and it makes only very simplistic assumption concerning interactions between the study species. These components would need further development to better understand the mechnisms behind species distribution changes
