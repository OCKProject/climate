 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By combining qualitative prior knowledge, data from tolerance experiments and field surveys into a single modelling framework, and taking into account the covariation of distributions of closely interacting species, this study greatly contributed towards understanding the effects of climate change on species distribution and enhanced the predictive capacity and robustness of current modelling techniques. Experimentally-derived knowledge allows us to define accurate cause-effect relationships and thereby better foresee alterations in ecosystem structure and functioning under future climate conditions that are not necessarily seen in projections based on statistical (non-causal) SDMs alone. Moreover, an inclusion of region-specific physiological tolerance limits (i.e. local adaptation in tolerance) and plant-herbivore interactions (i.e. species interactions) further increases the predictive power and robustness of model outputs.</p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As demonstrated in this study, climate change-driven shifts in biota can be dramatic and complex, causing fundamental transitions in ecosystems thereby endangering important ecosystem services. In order to understand trajectories of rapidly progressing global pressures and their consequences, efficient modelling solutions are needed. The methodology developed here is a promising approach to synthetize the often scattered and diverse information on organismal responses to climate change.</p>
