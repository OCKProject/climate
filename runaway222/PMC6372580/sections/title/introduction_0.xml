 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global climate change has a remarkable, but still largely unexplored potential to alter both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by directly modifying the abiotic environment (e.g. changes in temperature, rainfall, acidity, salinity) and indirectly altering biotic interaction networks
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. This in turn drives the need for ecologists to examine whether and how ecosystems and species within these systems can withstand such rapid environmental changes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species distribution responses to climate change are commonly studied using predictive species distribution models (SDMs). These models are often based on finding statistical dependence between environmental and distributional data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Even though these models do not rely only on correlations, they are often called correlative since they do not include mechanistic, causal, knowledge on a species’ dependence on its environment or other species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Moreover, an important assumption behind most of them is that relationships between the observed patterns of environment and species distribution will remain unchanged over the study region and time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Due to non-stationarity of ecosystem processes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span> such an assumption seems unrealistic and will likely be violated under future climate conditions, when statistical patterns between current species distributions and the environment are expected to become uncoupled
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Moreover, under future climate scenarios statistical SDMs are often applied outside the environmental gradient where they have been initially trained
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> in which case the results may become unreliable
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. One potentially important aspect that may affect range shifts driven by climate change is the presence of locally adapted populations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> with varying potential to respond to shifts in environmental conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Local differentiation in tolerance is currently poorly understood but an inclusion of such genetic within-species variation likely improves the model performance.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A fully mechanistic SDM requires extensive data about how species’ unique biology governs their responses to environmental factors
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. In order to overcome the issue of data deficiency, hybrid statistical-mechanistic SDMs offer a pragmatic approach to add key mechanisms to simple statistical predictive SDMs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Recent studies have highlighted the need to include physiological limits in the form of tolerance to varying environmental conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. Although these physiological mechanisms play key roles in mediating biotic responses to climate change, current predictive SDMs mostly neglect tolerances of species to environmental factors
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Various physiological thresholds are known for a number of taxa and can be experimentally tested under elevated stress conditions. Therefore, information from such tolerance experiments, especially when including relevant aspects and levels of possible futures, should be combined with traditional SDM approaches in order to achieve more robust projections of biotic patterns under known climate change scenarios
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Although it is widely acknowledged that communities are more than the sum of the parts, most SDMs neglect biological mechanisms despite the fact that species interactions often explain unexpected responses to climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>, and most extinctions attributed to climate change to date have involved altered species interactions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. Thus, informing statistical SDMs with the species-specific tolerance limits of locally adapted populations, and including the main species interactions into these models, will significantly increase model realism and improve climate change projections
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>,

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to improve the realism of statistical SDMs under climate change projections, we developed a novel semiparametric methodology that can combine qualitative prior information and experimentally defined tolerance levels on species’ response to selected environmental gradients with information obtained from surveyed non-causal distribution data. The methodology extends the state-of-the-art Gaussian process (GP) SDMs
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span> under an hierarchical Bayesian approach (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). We quantified the current and future distribution patterns of the foundation macroalgal species 
  <span class="italic">Fucus vesiculosus</span> (
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> hereafter) and its herbivore 
  <span class="italic">Idotea balthica</span> (
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> hereafter) throughout the Baltic Sea. Importantly, both distributional and experimental data were resolved at sub-regional level (i.e. entrance, central and marginal areas of the Baltic Sea) to account for potential local differentiation in tolerance as well as spatial variation in current and future environmental conditions. Moreover, experiments evaluated the physiological tolerance of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> to the projected changes in salinity and temperature as they are the most important regional drivers of future biotic communities in the Baltic Sea

    <p>Summary of the noncausal distribution and causal experimental data (
     <span class="bold">A</span>) and the SDMs with alternative data (
     <span class="bold">B</span>–
     <span class="bold">E</span>). Panel E shows the model where both 
     <span class="italic">Fucus</span> biomass data (distribution) and growth data (experimental) are combined. The key component of the model is the response function along salinity and temperature (
     <span class="bold">D</span>) which is shared between the model’s experimental and distribution data components. This allows integrating the information from these two information sources. The rest of the model components are specific to either experimental or distribution data and explain the mean level of data (
     <span class="italic">intercept</span>) and the structured (
     <span class="italic">effect of depth</span> and 
     <span class="italic">spatial random effect</span>) and unstructured (
     <span class="italic">Gaussian noise</span>) variation in observations not explained by temperature and salinity. When analyzing experimental (
     <span class="bold">B</span>) and distribution data (
     <span class="bold">C</span>) separately we used only the respective model components from the combined model (
     <span class="bold">E</span>) in which case information from only either one of the data sources is used to learn the response along salinity and temperature. The alternative models were compared in interpolation and extrapolation scenario by training the models with experimental data and a subset of the distribution data (training data) and predicting to the left out distribution data (test data). In interpolation tests, distribution data were divided at random and in extrapolation tests the data were divided at 17.5 degrees temperature (blue dashed line in 
     <span class="bold">A</span>). The 
     <span class="italic">Fucus</span> presence/absence model follows independently the same hierarchical structure as presented here. The 
     <span class="italic">Idotea</span> model is otherwise similar but instead of depth it includes the effect of 
     <span class="italic">Fucus</span> biomass in the distribution data model.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Baltic Sea can serve as an excellent case study area to research the consequences of climate change, as climate change signals are visible already now and predicted to be particularly strong in the future
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. Moreover, due to a faster trajectory of anthropogenic perturbations and the presence of a diverse range of interacting pressures that most coastal areas will experience only in the future, evidence from the Baltic Sea may deliver important insight for the future coastal ocean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. Last but not least, the Baltic Sea region is also one of the most intensely studied coastal areas with high data density and many long-term data series. As such our study is a rare demonstration case in which the consequences of contemporary climate change can be realistically assessed in a regional sea. This assessment is supported by a novel developed state-of-the-art modelling method that can be applied beyond coastal habitats and aquatic ecosystems and used not only for climate change but also other purposes.
