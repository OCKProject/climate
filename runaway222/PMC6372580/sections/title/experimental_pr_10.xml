 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We quantified the joint effect of salinity and temperature on growth of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> and survival of 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> in experiments carried out at the Archipelago Sea Research Institute in Seili, SW Finland (60°14′N, 21°58′E) in 2014–2015 (for detailed descriptions of these experiments, see

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>). Experimental organisms were collected from multiple populations originating from three functionally different regions defined above (entrance, central and marginal) (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> was collected by snorkelling on hard bottom habitats at 0.5–2 m from June to July in 2014. To avoid sampling of close relatives we kept a minimum of 5 m distance between sampled algae. 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> was sampled from 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> algae at 1–3 m depth from May to June in 2015. In order to account for among-population variation in tolerance to environmental change, sampling sites were randomly chosen within each region to represent the distributional range of these species along the Baltic Sea salinity gradient.

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The collected 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> were exposed to the current (1978–2007) and future (2069–2098) conditions of surface seawater salinity and temperature (average for the main reproductive period: June to August for 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> and June for 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span>; Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>), separately for the three studied regions of the Baltic Sea (Supplementary Fig.

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>
  </span>. We used aquarium racks with a recirculating water system to provide the appropriate climatic conditions for each of the six treatment combinations of temperature and salinity (i.e. current and future scenario at entrance, central and marginal regions). We started the experiments by putting the organisms in the current conditions of their original region and then adjusted salinity and temperature to match those of the future projections (over the course of 24 h in 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> and 5 days in 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before deployment, 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> individuals were harvested for apical branches and then half of the apical fronds were exposed to current conditions and the other half to future conditions so that each individual could face both climatic conditions. The apical branches were randomly allocated to replicate 24 l aquaria, each aquarium having 24–35 algae. Within each condition and region we had 12 replicate aquaria, totaling to 72 aquaria and to 2079 algae. For 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span>, we only used females as their response is more important for the population growth. 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> were deployed individually in cylindrical cages (length 11 cm, diametre 3.5 cm) inside the aquaria, to allow their monitoring individually. Within each condition and region we had three replicate 54 l aquaria, each aquarium having 30–45 individuals totaling to 468 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span>. 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> were fed with 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> fresh tissue. We monitored the survival and ran the experiments until about a third of the intial number of individuals was left, 140 days for 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> and 55 days for 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the experiment the survival of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> was checked on a weekly basis and an individual frond was considered as dead when the thallus showed over 90% of tissue necrosis. The biomass growth of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> was measured as a difference in algal wet weight between the starting point and the last day of the experiment. The survival of 
  <span class="italic">Idotea</span> was monitored every two days.
