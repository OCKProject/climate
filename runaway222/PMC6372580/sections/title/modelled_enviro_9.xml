 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When assessing the effects of climate change on species distribution, ecological understanding is a prerequisite to select the environmental covariates to include in SDM. Therefore, care was taken to include the most relevant ecological variables in order to reach the best projections about the role of climate-driven effects on biotic patterns. When the selection is inadequate, a model may pick up irrelevant variables and its predictive power is low

  </span>. Earlier studies have shown that water salinity and temperature conditions are anticipated to shape the large scale patterns of benthic macrophyte and invertebrate species in the Baltic Sea area

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modelled temperature and salinity data were produced by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) using the echam5/RCAO model run covering the whole Baltic Sea at a grid resolution of 2 NM
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>
  </span>. In addition to current environmental data, the SMHI datasets had two scenarios for seasonal means: a reference for the years 1978–2007 and the climate scenario A1B for the years 2069–2098. The A1B climate scenario is a scenario proposed in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>
  </span>. The A1 scenario group describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and declines after that, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. A1B foresees a balance between energy sources, where the balanced energy consumption is defined as not relying too heavily on one particular energy source under the assumption that similar improvement rates apply to all energy supplies and end-use technologies. In our models we used averages of three summer months (June to August) to match our experimental design (see below). The current modelled salinity values were used to divide the Baltic Sea into three regions: entrance (dynamic area between the North and Baltic Seas; salinity &gt; 12), central (the Baltic Proper; salinity 5–12) and marginal regions of the Baltic Sea (inner gulfs; salinity &lt; 5) (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). These three functionally different regions characterised by genetically distinct and different proportions of marine, brackish and freshwater species
