 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Altogether 6407 stations from coastal hard bottom habitats of the Baltic Sea, that had quantitative information for both benthic macroalgae and associated invertebrates, were selected for this study (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). All this dataset had a uniform sampling and sample processing protocol developed for the HELCOM COMBINE programme
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>
  </span>. The included stations were sampled from June to August between 2005 and 2015. At each sampling site quantitative samples of macroalgae and associated invertebrate communities were collected by a diver using a standard bottom frame (0.04 m
  <span class="sup">2</span>). Samples were sieved in the field on 0.25 mm mesh screens. The residues were stored at −20 °C and subsequent sorting and counting of species was performed in the laboratory using a stereomicroscope. The dry weight of algae was obtained after drying the individuals at 60 °C for 2 weeks. These quantitative data were complemented by information on species occurrence (the HELCOM Red List dataset) (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>).
