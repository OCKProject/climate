 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The explanatory and predictive power of SDMs depended on the type of input data. The 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> SDMs that only included distribution data or combined distribution and experimental data performed equally well in explaining training data (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) and predicting test data in interpolation and extrapolation (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The SDM that included only experimental data, however, yielded poorer interpolation projections but practically equally good extrapolation projections as the other SDMs. Salinity and temperature explained about 30 to 60% of the total explained variability in the (expected) occurrence of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> but only 20% of the total explained variability in its (expected) biomass (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Salinity had stronger effects than temperature in these models with temperature having only marginal effects on the probability of occurrence and a small contribution to the growth rate and biomass of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Water depth had important effects in both models. The spatial random effects explained approximately 20–40% of the total variation and had long spatial correlation length indicating that there is strong regional variation in the distribution of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> not explained by salinity, temperature and depth.

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both experimental and distribution data yielded similar responses along salinity gradients (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). In all SDMs, the probability of occurrence, biomass per substrate area (biomass hereafter) and biomass increment (growth hereafter) of 
  <span class="italic">Fucus</span> started to increase at around salinity 3–5 psu (there was an earlier start in increase in the experimental and combined data SDMs compared to the distribution data SDM). The response of probability of occurrence along the salinity gradient was  the steepest at low temperatures and got  gradually less steep as temperature increases. The response along temperature was  the strongest at salinities from 20 to 30 psu. In the combined experimental and distribution data SDM the expected effects of temperature and salinity were  a compromise between the effects in the experimental and distribution data SDMs. In the combined data SDM the response along salinity was  steeper than in the distribution data model and the response along temperature was  similar in shape to the distribution data model.
