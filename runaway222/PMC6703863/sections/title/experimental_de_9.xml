 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used random block design with three warming treatments and five replications for each treatment in this study. Three 3 m by 2 m plots were laid out in each of the five blocks and randomly assigned to the three treatments of control (C), low-level warming (W1.5), and high-level warming (W2.5). The warmed plots were continuously heated, proceeding in June 2014, via 165 cm by 15 cm infrared radiators (MSR-2420, Kalglo Electronics Inc., Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA), which were suspended in the center of the plot, at 1.5 m above ground level. The heaters for the W1.5 treatments were set at an output power of approximately 1000 W, with the expectation of a 1.5°C increase in ST at 10-cm depth, while the heaters for the W2.5 treatments were set at an output power of approximately 2000 W, with the expectation of a 3°C increase in ST. In each control plot, we suspended a dummy heater whose appearance is identical to the infrared radiator at the same height to simulate the shading effect. The adjacent plots were 3 m apart.</p>
