  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experimental study was conducted in an alpine meadow of the Eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (32°48′N, 102°58′E), which locates in Hongyuan County, Sichuan of China, at an altitude of approximately 3500 m. Over the past 60 years, the MAP is 753 mm, with approximately 80% occurring during May to September, and the mean annual temperature is 1.1°C, with January as the coldest month (−10.3°C) and July as the hottest month (10.9°C). The soil at the study site is classified as Cryumbrept following the U.S. Soil Taxonomy (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used random block design with three warming treatments and five replications for each treatment in this study. Three 3 m by 2 m plots were laid out in each of the five blocks and randomly assigned to the three treatments of control (C), low-level warming (W1.5), and high-level warming (W2.5). The warmed plots were continuously heated, proceeding in June 2014, via 165 cm by 15 cm infrared radiators (MSR-2420, Kalglo Electronics Inc., Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA), which were suspended in the center of the plot, at 1.5 m above ground level. The heaters for the W1.5 treatments were set at an output power of approximately 1000 W, with the expectation of a 1.5°C increase in ST at 10-cm depth, while the heaters for the W2.5 treatments were set at an output power of approximately 2000 W, with the expectation of a 3°C increase in ST. In each control plot, we suspended a dummy heater whose appearance is identical to the infrared radiator at the same height to simulate the shading effect. The adjacent plots were 3 m apart.</p>

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We measured NEP and ER twice per month during the growing season on clear days from June to September in 2014 to 2016. In May 2014, we installed a 0.5 m by 0.5 m square aluminum frame into the soil at the depth of 3 cm in each plot, with a distance of at least 30 cm from the perimeter of the plot, to seal the canopy chamber (0.5 m by 0.5 m by 0.5 m, polymethyl methacrylate) to the soil surface and provided a plane interface between them. Care was taken to minimize soil disturbance during the installation. NEP and ER were measured using an infrared gas analyzer (LI-6400XT, LI-COR Environmental, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA), which was attached to the transparent canopy chamber. During measurements, two small fans were installed diagonally inside the chamber and fanned continuously to mix the atmosphere. Consecutive recordings of CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations were obtained once every 10 s in 80 s. NEP was calculated by the slope between recording time and concentrations [see the detailed method in (
   <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
    <span class="italic">11</span>
   </a>)]. Right after the NEP measurements, the chamber was lifted up to exchange air with the outside. Then, we covered an opaque cloth on the chamber and repeated the measurement to obtain ER. GEP was calculated as the difference between NEP and ER.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ST (°C) was measured at a 10-cm depth using a thermocouple probe concurrently with the ecosystem CO
   <sub>2</sub> fluxes measurements. The 10-cm SWC (%
   <span class="italic">V</span>) was measured using a time domain reflectometry instrumentation (TDR 100, Spectrum Technologies Inc., Chicago, USA). All measurements were performed at the same time with C fluxes measurement.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meta-analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To analyze the effect of precipitation on warming-induced changes in NEP at global scale, we synthesized various warming experiments involved in terrestrial ecosystems. First, we used “Web of Science” and “Google Scholar” to search peer-reviewed literatures that investigated NEP response under experimental warming during 1900–2019. Then, we screened the papers for analysis based on the criteria as follows. (i) Field studies must include a control and warming treatment under the same condition between them. (ii) The variable of NEP is shown by its mean and sample size. (iii) Experimental method needs to be explicitly described as well, such as warming magnitude, experimental duration, and warming method. Data shown in figures were extracted with the Engauge Digitizer (Free Software Foundation Inc., Boston, MA, USA). If multiple years’ data were reported in the same experiment, we only selected the latest measurement to assure statistical independence between observations. Overall, we established a global dataset composed of 34 independent experiments (including this study), with warming magnitude ranging from 0.2° to 3°C and experimental duration from 1 to 9 years. Since this study examines the response of NEE, we only included the direct measurement of NEE that was conducted by chambers in herbaceous ecosystem, including tall-grass prairie, temperate steppe, peatland, fens, alpine meadow, and tundra, with precipitation range from 100 to 914 mm and temperature from −14.6° to 16.3°C (table S1).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Warming effect was calculated as (NEP
   <sub>treatment</sub> − NEP
   <sub>control</sub>)/NEP
   <sub>control</sub>. These effects were weighted by their sample size, 
   <span class="italic">N</span>

   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>control</sub>/(
   <span class="italic">N</span>

   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>treatment</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>control</sub> represent the sample size of NEP in warming and control treatment, respectively. We analyzed the relationship between warming-induced changes in NEP and ambient precipitation with a linear mixed-effect model using the lme4 package (
   <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
    <span class="italic">39</span>
   </a>) in R 3.4.1 for Windows. Precipitation was considered as fixed effect, and studies were considered as random effect to interpret possible autocorrelation among observations in each experiment. Moreover, we also used a linear mixed-effect model to analyze the interactions of precipitation, temperature, warming magnitude, and experimental duration on NEP change (table S2). Similarly, precipitation, temperature, warming magnitude, and experimental duration were considered as fixed effect with a random effect of studies.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used three ways to justify that MAP is an adequate proxy for soil moisture. First, by substituting SWC with precipitation, we verified that the water-scaling patterns still existed firmly in this study. The warming effects on GEP, ER, and NEP varied from negative to positive when monthly precipitation changed from low to high in our site-level experiment (fig. S5). Second, we used data from a precipitation gradient experiment, which is adjacent to our warming experiment (less than 10 m) (
   <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
    <span class="italic">40</span>
   </a>). We found that precipitation was an adequate proxy for SWC at our study site (fig. S6). Third, at the global scale, previous studies indicate that MAP is a good proxy for soil moisture across large space or various experiments (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We performed model selection based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Because the nonlinear model (Eq. 4) consistently gave lower AIC (table S5), we selected the nonlinear threshold model, as shown in Eq. 4. The quadratic coefficients (γ
   <sub>1</sub>) for SWC were significantly different from zero for GEP, ER, and NEP (table S6), indicating bell-shaped response patterns. We validated the nonlinear model (Eq. 4) by comparing the observed and modeled values. The comparison showed that the model fitted the observations well, with a 49 to 76% agreement for different C fluxes (fig. S7).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We were aware that seasonality might bias the relationships between SWC and GEP, ER, or NEP. To evaluate the potential impacts of this bias, we used peak growing season (July and August) data and performed the same analyses. The results showed the same threshold response of C fluxes to SWC (fig. S8), which further justified the nonlinear threshold responses of ecosystem C fluxes to SWC.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then, we used the model (Eq. 4) to distinguish the impacts of warming-induced changes in ST, SWC, and their interactions on GEP, ER, and NEP (
