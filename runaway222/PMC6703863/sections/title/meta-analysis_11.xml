 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To analyze the effect of precipitation on warming-induced changes in NEP at global scale, we synthesized various warming experiments involved in terrestrial ecosystems. First, we used “Web of Science” and “Google Scholar” to search peer-reviewed literatures that investigated NEP response under experimental warming during 1900–2019. Then, we screened the papers for analysis based on the criteria as follows. (i) Field studies must include a control and warming treatment under the same condition between them. (ii) The variable of NEP is shown by its mean and sample size. (iii) Experimental method needs to be explicitly described as well, such as warming magnitude, experimental duration, and warming method. Data shown in figures were extracted with the Engauge Digitizer (Free Software Foundation Inc., Boston, MA, USA). If multiple years’ data were reported in the same experiment, we only selected the latest measurement to assure statistical independence between observations. Overall, we established a global dataset composed of 34 independent experiments (including this study), with warming magnitude ranging from 0.2° to 3°C and experimental duration from 1 to 9 years. Since this study examines the response of NEE, we only included the direct measurement of NEE that was conducted by chambers in herbaceous ecosystem, including tall-grass prairie, temperate steppe, peatland, fens, alpine meadow, and tundra, with precipitation range from 100 to 914 mm and temperature from −14.6° to 16.3°C (table S1).</p>

  <sub>control</sub> represent the sample size of NEP in warming and control treatment, respectively. We analyzed the relationship between warming-induced changes in NEP and ambient precipitation with a linear mixed-effect model using the lme4 package (

   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>) in R 3.4.1 for Windows. Precipitation was considered as fixed effect, and studies were considered as random effect to interpret possible autocorrelation among observations in each experiment. Moreover, we also used a linear mixed-effect model to analyze the interactions of precipitation, temperature, warming magnitude, and experimental duration on NEP change (table S2). Similarly, precipitation, temperature, warming magnitude, and experimental duration were considered as fixed effect with a random effect of studies.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used three ways to justify that MAP is an adequate proxy for soil moisture. First, by substituting SWC with precipitation, we verified that the water-scaling patterns still existed firmly in this study. The warming effects on GEP, ER, and NEP varied from negative to positive when monthly precipitation changed from low to high in our site-level experiment (fig. S5). Second, we used data from a precipitation gradient experiment, which is adjacent to our warming experiment (less than 10 m) (

   <span class="italic">40</span>
  </a>). We found that precipitation was an adequate proxy for SWC at our study site (fig. S6). Third, at the global scale, previous studies indicate that MAP is a good proxy for soil moisture across large space or various experiments (
