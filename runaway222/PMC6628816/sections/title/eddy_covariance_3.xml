 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the tier 1 (publicly available) eddy covariance data from the recently released FLUXNET2015 dataset. This contains data from &gt;200 eddy covariance sites from around the world with energy, water, and carbon fluxes and meteorological data and has undergone a standardized set of quality control and gap filling (
  <a rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" href="#r33">33</a>). We used the daily data for all analyses here, as our goal was to quantify multiday to multiweek soil moisture feedbacks. Sites that met the following criteria were included in our analyses: 1) forest sites, 2) no disturbance within 10 y before the onset of eddy covariance measurements, 3) on-site soil moisture measurements, and 4) available plant functional trait data for at least 2 functional traits for 80% of the tree community (see below). This led to a final list of 40 sites and 352 site years across 4 forest biomes—deciduous broadleaf forest, evergreen needleaf forest, mixed forest, and evergreen broadleaf forest—which were almost entirely in temperate and boreal regions (
