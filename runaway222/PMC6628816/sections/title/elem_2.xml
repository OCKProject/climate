  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the tier 1 (publicly available) eddy covariance data from the recently released FLUXNET2015 dataset. This contains data from &gt;200 eddy covariance sites from around the world with energy, water, and carbon fluxes and meteorological data and has undergone a standardized set of quality control and gap filling (
   <a rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" href="#r33">33</a>). We used the daily data for all analyses here, as our goal was to quantify multiday to multiweek soil moisture feedbacks. Sites that met the following criteria were included in our analyses: 1) forest sites, 2) no disturbance within 10 y before the onset of eddy covariance measurements, 3) on-site soil moisture measurements, and 4) available plant functional trait data for at least 2 functional traits for 80% of the tree community (see below). This led to a final list of 40 sites and 352 site years across 4 forest biomes—deciduous broadleaf forest, evergreen needleaf forest, mixed forest, and evergreen broadleaf forest—which were almost entirely in temperate and boreal regions (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trait and Climate Data.</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on an extensive review of the literature and publications from individual eddy covariance sites, we compiled lists of the dominant tree species present in the footprint of each tower and, where possible, the relative abundance of these species. Abundance data were available for around 60% of sites. We then compiled the functional traits for species present in these sites, drawing on the Global Wood Density Database (
   <a rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" href="#r34">34</a>) for wood density data, the dataset presented in ref. 
   <a rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" href="#r35">35</a> for light-saturated maximum photosynthetic rate and SLA, and the Xylem Functional Traits dataset (
   <a rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" href="#r36">36</a>) for data on the water potential at 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity and the hydraulic safety margin. These traits influence a diversity of important plant functions, including maximum gas exchange rate and the vulnerability of water transport to drought conditions. Furthermore, these traits are actively being incorporated into next-generation land surface models (
   <a rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" href="#r13">13</a>, 
   <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>, 
   <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>, 
   <a rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" href="#r37">37</a>) and thus their importance for drought intensification is useful to test. At each site, we calculated the community-weighted (i.e., composition weighted) trait mean and SD for each trait with values for more than 80% of the plant community. The mean provides an estimate of the average plant strategy in the ecosystem and the SD provides insight into the diversity of strategies/traits present.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, we compiled the reported age of the canopy trees and the mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation reported as metadata in the FLUXNET2015 dataset for each site as important climate variables that might influence cross-site patterns. We used the site latitude and longitude to extract the growing season (defined here as June–August for northern hemisphere and December–February for southern hemisphere) temperature and precipitation from Climatic Research Unit data (
   <a rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" href="#r38">38</a>) for the 1980–2008 period. We further extracted annual and growing season potential evapotranspiration (PET) for each site (averaged over the 1980–2008 period) from the Sheffield dataset (
   <a rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" href="#r39">39</a>) and included site mean annual PET, mean growing season PET, mean annual precipitation minus mean annual PET, and mean growing season precipitation minus mean growing season PET as potential climate predictor variables. Growing season temperature was also predictive of feedbacks, but was less strongly correlated with feedbacks than MAT (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil Moisture Feedback Methods.</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We restricted our data to the plant-active season using 2 different methods. In both, we removed all data where a quality flag indicated that a measurement of soil moisture, temperature, vapor pressure deficit, or sensible heat may have been flawed. We further verified this by plotting annual time courses of all variables for all sites to ensure that all data were within reasonable bounds. In the first method, we implemented a daily average temperature threshold of 15 °C for temperate and 10 °C for boreal sites and further removed 1 wk on either end of each plant-active season. In the second method, we implemented the cross-site method proposed by Gu et al. (40) and considered a growing season to be between the “stabilization day” and “downturn day” of annual GPP (via the nighttime partitioning method) time series. These methods yielded largely similar results (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a> and 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1904747116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S2
   </span>), and thus we present the temperature threshold (first) method in the main text.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We followed a number of previous studies in estimating the strength of soil moisture feedbacks and drought intensification as the correlation between previous soil moisture and subsequent T, VPD, or SH (
   <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>, 
   <a rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" href="#r8">8</a>, 
   <a rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" href="#r41">41</a>, 
   <a rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" href="#r42">42</a>). Quantifying land surface feedbacks is inherently challenging because 1) observational data are typically at much smaller spatial scales (e.g., an eddy covariance footprint) than the relevant atmospheric processes, 2) effects may arise from autocorrelation of dependent variables (e.g., synoptic patterns in precipitation), and 3) lagged correlations among variables may not mean causation (
   <a rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" href="#r2">2</a>, 
   <a rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" href="#r42">42</a>). Challenge 1 is largely unavoidable for site-level analyses where plant trait data are available, but we believe our approach is still reasonable for several reasons. First, this limitation has not precluded the detection of likely soil moisture feedbacks in previous studies (
   <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>, 
   <a rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" href="#r43">43</a>). Second, inferring feedbacks from site-level data are reasonable if the sites are representative of broader regional vegetation types (thereby capturing the main mechanisms for regional-scale feedbacks), which is largely the case of our focal flux towers. Finally, we analyze broader continental-scale datasets as well, which show a consistent pattern with flux-tower data (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). In addition, soil depth or properties such as soil texture, rooting depth, and belowground plant or mycorrhizal traits could all influence land–atmosphere interactions, but were not considered here due to a lack of available data. Challenge 2 is a much larger problem for the detection of soil moisture–precipitation feedbacks, and analyses focusing on soil moisture–temperature are likely to be more robust than soil moisture–precipitation feedbacks (
   <a rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" href="#r2">2</a>, 
   <a rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" href="#r42">42</a>). This is because soil moisture–temperature feedbacks are directly influenced by surface radiation budgets (e.g., Bowen ratio), are less likely to be driven by an external variable (e.g., sea surface temperatures), and are less influenced by statistical challenges of precipitation persistence (
   <a rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" href="#r2">2</a>). We further aimed to minimize the problems of challenge 2 by using an array of time windows and removing seasonal patterns in variables (see below). Challenge 3 is an important caveat in all soil moisture feedback analyses, and causality can only be fully prescribed with mechanistic model simulations that vary soil moisture boundary conditions, something that cannot be done with observational datasets. However, some statistical techniques assess “predictive causality” (e.g., Granger causality), which is more rigorous than simple correlation, and is used for the satellite-based feedbacks assessed here (
   <a rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" href="#r6">6</a>).

    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S1
   </span> presents an illustration of how we quantified feedbacks by showing the calculation from a given day 
   <span class="italic">i</span> at a given site. Within each growing season at each eddy covariance site, we first calculated all nonoverlapping 1-, 7-, and 14-d averages for T, VPD, and SH. From each period, we then calculated the preceding 1-, 7-, and 14-d period averages for soil moisture. Where preceding soil moisture data were not within the plant-active season, those dates were dropped from the analysis (for example, day 2 of a growing season would have a value for the preceding 1-d period, but not the preceding 7- or 14-d period, and thus would not be included in those analyses). In the case of data gaps, a majority of days with data were required to be included. The 3 time periods of dependent variables (T, VPD, SH) and 3 time periods of the independent variable (preceding soil moisture) led to 9 combinations over which we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients, where negative correlations indicate “drought intensification” because declines in soil moisture are correlated with subsequent increases in T/VPD/SH. We used this suite of different time periods to 1) ensure that the patterns in drought intensification that we observed were robust to different methods, and 2) to capture effects at longer timescales where autocorrelation of T, VPD, and SH are much lower (
   <a rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" href="#r44">44</a>). In addition, we calculated these correlations after removing a seasonal pattern from all variables via fitting a quadratic regression for each year and performing the correlations on the residuals for a random subset of 10 flux sites. The feedback correlations on the deseasonalized data were quite similar to the correlations used in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a> (
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.65, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001), indicating that seasonal or synoptic patterns are not likely behind site differences. Because the correlations were quite consistent across different time period combinations (e.g., 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>), we averaged all 9 time period combinations to yield an average feedback strength for each site for the model selection analyses.

   </span> for all predictor variables. Because multivariate analyses can be confounded by collinear predictor variables, we first removed collinear predictors following previously published methods (
   <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>) by calculating the pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients among all predictor variables. Whenever 2 predictor variables exhibited a correlation of &gt;0.5, each was then compared against the dependent variable and the predictor with the lowest correlation with the dependent variable was dropped. The final model set included 6 predictor variables and was consistent across all 3 dependent variables: mean annual temperature, community age, and community-weighted traits of: mean maximum photosynthetic rates (Amax.m), SD of the water potential at 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity (P50.sd), SD of maximum photosynthetic rates (Amax.sd), and mean minimum water potential experienced (PsiM.m).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then used the model selection technique of “all possible models” that calculates all potential combinations of predictor variables and ranks them by Akaike Information Criterion (
   <a rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" href="#r46">46</a>). This approach is considered superior to and more robust than stepwise techniques and has been used in soil moisture feedback analyses previously (
   <a rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" href="#r6">6</a>). From this extensive family of models, we then calculated the standardized variable coefficients, Akaike variable weights, and the prevalence of each variable in the top models (defined as all models within 3 AIC of the best model). No single model emerged as the most parsimonious model (e.g., &lt;−3 AIC from another model), and thus presenting the Akaike variable weights and prevalence of variables in the top models provides a holistic picture of the importance of each predictor variable.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we performed variance decomposition on the most complex model within the top models for each model selection analysis (i.e., soil moisture-T, soil moisture-VPD, or soil moisture-SH). This model had the form:

   </div>Variance decomposition allowed us to directly quantify the amount of variance explained by the full model (all predictor variables), climate (i.e., mean annual temperature) alone, traits alone, and climate and traits jointly. This was done by calculating the semipartial correlation—the correlation of 2 variables (e.g., Feedback∼MAT) with variation from all other variables removed only from the dependent variable (e.g., removing the variation of Amax.m and P50.sd from Feedback above). This was done separately for climate (MAT alone) and traits (Amax.m and P50.sd) to calculate the R

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Continental US Soil Moisture Feedback Analysis.</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis of Tuttle and Salvucci (ref. 
   <a rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" href="#r6">6</a>; results shown in their figure 1A and B) identified the causal influence of soil moisture on the occurrence of next-day precipitation. Precipitation is often autocorrelated, with precipitation events occurring in clusters over timescales of weeks, months, or years. This autocorrelation may be due to local (e.g., soil moisture feedbacks) or far-field influences (e.g., synoptic weather patterns, sea surface temperatures). No matter the cause of the autocorrelation in precipitation, this signal will be passed on to soil moisture, due to the direct coupling between the two (i.e., when it rains, soil moisture increases). Therefore, any lagged correlation between soil moisture and subsequent precipitation will be contaminated by autocorrelation in precipitation, regardless of the cause (
   <a rid="r47" ref-type="bibr" href="#r47">47</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To isolate the effect of soil moisture on the occurrence of next day precipitation, Tuttle and Salvucci (
   <a rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" href="#r6">6</a>) used generalized linear modeling (specifically, probit regression) within a Granger causality framework. Precipitation occurrence (a binary variable: rain vs. no rain) was modeled as a function of sinusoids that represented various modes of interannual variability and seasonality, and up to 4 d of past precipitation (see ref. 
   <a rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" href="#r6">6</a> for details). For each given location, models with all possible combinations of the independent variables were separately evaluated against observed precipitation (i.e., “all possible models” or “all possible regressions”), and the model with the combination of independent variables that yielded the lowest AIC was chosen as the best “restricted” model for that given location. Then, a similar probit regression model was evaluated, with 1-d lagged, seasonal soil moisture anomaly as the independent variable (along with 4 d of lagged atmospheric pressure) and the residual precipitation occurrence from the “restricted” model as the dependent variable. This second, “unrestricted” model tested whether or not soil moisture exerted a statistically significant influence on next-day precipitation occurrence, after accounting for seasonality, interannual variability, and precipitation persistence. The ratio of the predicted precipitation probability from the models with and without soil moisture as an independent variable provided a quantification of the impact of soil moisture on the occurrence of next-day precipitation (i.e., results shown in ref.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because community-weighted trait maps are not currently available for our key traits at continental scales, we used a tree species richness map for the continental United States (
   <a rid="r51" ref-type="bibr" href="#r51">51</a>). In addition, we drew upon a biome map (

   <a rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" href="#r54">54</a>), which was chosen to represent the peak growing season in the continental United States, and central in time for our analysis in the soil moisture feedback datasets. We included these ancillary datasets either as masks or covariates in our analyses (see below).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each of the 2 estimates of soil moisture–precipitation feedback, we restricted our analyses to only grid cells dominated with woody vegetation (cover types 1–9) and removed grid cells with values of 1 (no statistically significant feedback, which constituted 38% of woody vegetation grid cells). We then performed a multivariate ordinary least squares regression of the feedback as a function of species richness, average leaf area index, and their interaction term, which was the model that had the lowest AIC. We tested for spatial autocorrelation in our data with a Moran’s I test (
   <a rid="r55" ref-type="bibr" href="#r55">55</a>), which was not significant. Given the saturation of the feedback at higher values of richness, we further fit a generalized additive model with feedback as a function of richness.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To ensure that our results were not driven by a correlation of average soil moisture with the soil moisture feedback estimates, we also ran analyses where we first regressed the soil moisture feedback against average soil moisture from 1989 to 2008 and then used the residuals of this regression against tree species richness, which was still significant (
