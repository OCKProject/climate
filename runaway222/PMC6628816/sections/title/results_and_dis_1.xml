 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found substantial variability in soil moisture feedbacks across flux sites in the temperate and boreal forests, with strong variation in the temporal correlations between previous soil moisture and subsequent temperature, VPD, and sensible heat flux during the growing season (

  </span>). However, the signs and magnitudes of feedbacks were generally consistent within a given site across different time scales and meteorological response variables. This site-specific consistency of feedbacks is largely expected given the lack of large changes in vegetation composition or structure at individual sites. Positive feedbacks of drought intensification—negative correlations between soil moisture and subsequent T/VPD/SH—were observed in all biomes, but were more prevalent at warmer sites (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>). In this scenario, low soil moisture could feed back to increase T/VPD/SH, which further increases the evaporative demand and further decreases soil moisture. Negative feedbacks, where decreasing soil moisture preceded decreasing T/VPD/SH, were predominantly observed at cooler sites. These patterns were robust across a diversity of time-integration windows ranging from 1 to 14 d and to the method used to define the plant-active/growing season across sites (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate and plant functional traits explained between 54% and 67% of the observed cross-site patterns in drought intensification feedbacks (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>). Using a suite of model selection algorithms and variance decomposition, we determined that climate and traits jointly explained about half of this variation; climate alone explained about 33% and traits alone about 17% (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">A</span>

For functional traits, we examined the community-weighted mean and SD in maximum photosynthetic rate (Amax), specific leaf area (SLA), wood density, water potential at 50% loss of branch hydraulic conductivity (P50), minimum water potential (PsiM), and hydraulic safety margin, which capture a range of key resource acquisition and water transport strategies (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extensive previous research has documented the impacts of aridity or vegetation presence versus absence, such as deforestation, on surface energy fluxes (

  <a rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" href="#r7">7</a>,

  <a href="#r27">*</a>
  <a href="#r28">*</a>–
  <a rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" href="#r29">29</a>). Here, we demonstrate that plant physiological characteristics are important for land–atmosphere interactions beyond simply vegetation presence/absence or structure. We further show that plant functional traits, particularly those related to maximum carbon uptake and water transport, significantly influence soil moisture feedbacks across a diversity of temperate and boreal biomes. Using a hydraulic trait-based forest model (
  <a rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" href="#r21">21</a>), we performed several sensitivity tests to explore the potential mechanisms that underlie plant trait-mediated soil moisture feedbacks (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1904747116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Methods</span>
  </span>). We found that higher community-weighted mean Amax increased the maximum transpiration/LH fluxes during wet periods, led to faster soil moisture drawdown and sharper declines in LH fluxes during dry periods, and yielded a stronger drought intensification feedback (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1904747116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S5 
   <span class="italic">A</span>–
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </span>), consistent with the cross-site regression coefficient for Amax in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>. Higher diversity of species’ stem hydraulic vulnerability traits (P50 values) in an ecosystem, a hydraulic trait thought to capture drought tolerance through the water potentials that can be tolerated in the xylem (
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>), tended to decrease LH fluxes in wetter periods but sustain LH fluxes much longer during a dry-down, leading to weaker drought intensification feedbacks. Results from the mechanistic vegetation model analysis are consistent with the cross-site trait-based patterns in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">B</span>

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S5 
   <span class="italic">G</span>–
   <span class="italic">I</span>
  </span>). Overall, the combination of community-weighted average Amax and diversity in P50 is consistent with the soil moisture–drought intensification feedback framework, although further research is needed to fully understand the detailed processes and mechanisms.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The statistical and model selection procedures performed here identify important and explanatory variables, but have several limitations and uncertainties. The multivariate models demonstrate statistical linkages, which in complex situations such as the analyses here are often not straightforward to interpret. The statistical linkages between site climate and trait metrics can reveal patterns and associations, but are subject to uncertainties in the input variables (e.g., scaling individual species’ traits to whole communities, appropriate climate variables and uncertainties in using gridded climate datasets), output variables (e.g., quantification of feedbacks), and their statistical connections (e.g., unaccounted-for confounding variables). In particular, more work is needed using ecosystem-level experiments and process-based land surface model simulations to examine the processes and mechanisms through which community-level plant traits might directly affect feedbacks.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We next examined if plant diversity mediated regional-scale soil moisture feedbacks and drought intensifications. A recently published rigorous quantification of the soil moisture–precipitation feedback over the continental United States observed stark differences between the western and eastern United States (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3 
   <span class="italic">A</span> and 
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>) (
  <a rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" href="#r6">6</a>). As a preliminary exploration, we tested if the interaction between tree species diversity and local climate might explain spatial patterns in these feedbacks. We consider only woody-plant-dominated grid cells and included grid cell leaf area index (LAI) as a covariate to account for vegetation structure differences across sites. We used tree species richness as a predictor variable because community-weighted trait maps are not available for our primary functional traits at these scales. Tree species richness and LAI explained 36% and 57% of the spatial variation in soil moisture feedbacks (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.00001 for both feedback estimates; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). All else equal (e.g., accounting for mean soil moisture), regions with lower tree diversity tended to show stronger signals of drought intensification; i.e., that below average soil moisture anomalies were associated with decreased probabilities of subsequent precipitation. This finding was robust to accounting for the effect of spatial variations in average soil moisture across the United States (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1904747116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Methods</span>
  </span>). Furthermore, we observed a significant interaction between richness and LAI that indicated a saturation of the effect of species richness on soil moisture feedbacks at high LAI values (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results demonstrate that plant functional diversity can influence drought intensification and climate extremes. Current land surface models likely capture many of the key climate effects on soil moisture feedbacks, but do not represent the effects of decreasing soil moisture on transpiration with mechanistic fidelity, potentially adding substantial uncertainty to carbon cycle feedbacks (
  <a rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" href="#r12">12</a>). Our findings emphasize that simulating diversity in plant hydraulic transport and its mechanistic effects on stomatal conductance (e.g., refs. 
  <a rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" href="#r13">13</a> and 
  <a rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" href="#r21">21</a>) in land surface models may be crucial for capturing drought intensification and climate extremes because this would provide a mechanistic linkage between soil moisture and plant transpiration. Fortunately, large-scale hydraulic-enabled models are actively being developed (
  <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>, 
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>). This improved simulation of soil moisture feedbacks, including diversity in plant hydraulic strategies, will be critical for providing rigorous predictions of climate extremes and climate impacts.
