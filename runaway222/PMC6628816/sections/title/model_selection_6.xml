  </span> for all predictor variables. Because multivariate analyses can be confounded by collinear predictor variables, we first removed collinear predictors following previously published methods (
  <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>) by calculating the pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients among all predictor variables. Whenever 2 predictor variables exhibited a correlation of &gt;0.5, each was then compared against the dependent variable and the predictor with the lowest correlation with the dependent variable was dropped. The final model set included 6 predictor variables and was consistent across all 3 dependent variables: mean annual temperature, community age, and community-weighted traits of: mean maximum photosynthetic rates (Amax.m), SD of the water potential at 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity (P50.sd), SD of maximum photosynthetic rates (Amax.sd), and mean minimum water potential experienced (PsiM.m).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then used the model selection technique of “all possible models” that calculates all potential combinations of predictor variables and ranks them by Akaike Information Criterion (
  <a rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" href="#r46">46</a>). This approach is considered superior to and more robust than stepwise techniques and has been used in soil moisture feedback analyses previously (
  <a rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" href="#r6">6</a>). From this extensive family of models, we then calculated the standardized variable coefficients, Akaike variable weights, and the prevalence of each variable in the top models (defined as all models within 3 AIC of the best model). No single model emerged as the most parsimonious model (e.g., &lt;−3 AIC from another model), and thus presenting the Akaike variable weights and prevalence of variables in the top models provides a holistic picture of the importance of each predictor variable.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we performed variance decomposition on the most complex model within the top models for each model selection analysis (i.e., soil moisture-T, soil moisture-VPD, or soil moisture-SH). This model had the form:
  <div id="eq1" class="disp-formula">
   <div id="me1" class="math">
    <div class="mrow">
     <span mathvariant="italic" class="mi">Feedback</span>
     <span class="mo"> </span>
     <span mathvariant="italic" class="mi">∼</span>
     <div class="msub">
      <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">β</span>
      <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">1</span>
     </div>
     <span mathvariant="italic" class="mi">MAT</span>
     <span class="mo"> </span>
     <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">+</span>
     <span class="mo"> </span>
     <div class="msub">
      <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">β</span>
      <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">2</span>
     </div>
     <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">Amax.</span>
     <span class="mi">m</span>
     <span class="mo"> </span>
     <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">+</span>
     <span class="mo"> </span>
     <div class="msub">
      <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">β</span>
      <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">3</span>
     </div>
     <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">P50</span>
     <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">.sd</span>
    </div>
   </div>
   <span class="label">[1]</span>
  </div>Variance decomposition allowed us to directly quantify the amount of variance explained by the full model (all predictor variables), climate (i.e., mean annual temperature) alone, traits alone, and climate and traits jointly. This was done by calculating the semipartial correlation—the correlation of 2 variables (e.g., Feedback∼MAT) with variation from all other variables removed only from the dependent variable (e.g., removing the variation of Amax.m and P50.sd from Feedback above). This was done separately for climate (MAT alone) and traits (Amax.m and P50.sd) to calculate the R
  <span class="sup">2</span> from each semipartial correlation and the remaining R
  <span class="sup">2</span> is considered the variance explained by the joint variables (i.e., shared between the 2 sets of variables). See
