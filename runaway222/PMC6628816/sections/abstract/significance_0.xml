 <p>Terrestrial vegetation can affect climate extremes such as severe drought by mediating fluxes of energy and water from the land surface to the atmosphere. Declines in plant transpiration due to low soil moisture during drought, which is fundamentally determined by plant functional traits, can intensify drought, but this process is not well understood. We examine ecosystem-level eddy flux and satellite remote-sensing estimates of drought intensification and find that both mean climate and plant functional traits, particularly those related to water transport, explain drought intensification patterns across sites. Our findings highlight that plant physiology and water transport functional traits are likely crucial to include in earth system models for capturing landâ€“atmosphere feedbacks and climate extremes.</p>
