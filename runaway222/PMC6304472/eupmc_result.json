    "The Gomti River in Lucknow City, India, was an important source of water for the different uses few decades ago. However, because of the rapid global changes, current status of the river is very critical from environmental, aesthetic and commercial usage point of view. Henceforth, this research work focused on assessing the current as well as predicting its future situation using different scenarios while considering key drivers of global changes namely climate change and population growth. Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP), a numerical simulation tool, was used to model river water quality using two scenarios viz. business as usual (BAU) and scenario with mitigation measures. Water quality simulation was done along 24 km stretch of the Gomti River from downstream of Near Moosa Bird Sanctuary to Near Bharwara. Comparison of simulated water quality parameters for the current and BAU status clearly indicates that the water quality by 2030 will rapidly deteriorate and will be not suitable for many aquatic lives in terms of simulated water quality parameters. Results from scenario with mitigation measures suggest current planned wastewater treatment plants and policies are not sufficient enough to achieve desirable river water quality within class B and hence call for immediate and inclusive action."
