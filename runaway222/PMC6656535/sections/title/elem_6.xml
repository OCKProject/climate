    <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
     <span class="italic">34</span>

    <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
     <span class="italic">36</span>

    <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
     <span class="italic">27</span>
    </a>) for more details about PHYDA]. The PHYDA reconstructions were performed from the years 1 to 2000 CE targeting three different temporal windows: April to the next calendar year March annual means (indicated as A2M in figure legends), the boreal growing season of JJA, and the austral growing season of DJF. In addition to seasonal and annual variables, PHYDA also includes monthly ENSO indices that are used herein. For computing the probability density functions shown in 
    <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>, we reran the PHYDA reconstruction code (see “Data and materials availability”) to save the full 998-member ensemble for the specific NINO3.4 and AMO index variables.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PHYDA has been extensively validated against observational data in addition to related paleoclimate reconstructions (
    <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
     <span class="italic">27</span>
    </a>). Here, we also performed comparisons with the North American Drought Atlas for the specific region of interest (fig. S1). In addition, there may be concerns that the dynamics and temporal variability of PHYDA merely reflect those of the data assimilation prior, namely, the CESM climate model; to explore this possibility, we analyzed the power spectra of the North American Southwest PDSI (NASW PDSI) along with the NINO3.4 and AMO indices and found PHYDA to be much more similar to observations than to the CESM simulation used as the basis of PHYDA (fig. S7). We also found PHYDA to be more similar to observations and less similar to CESM in the cross-correlation of the NASW PDSI with the NINO3.4 and AMO indices (fig. S8). Because the analysis presented here relies on realistic ENSO-hydroclimate teleconnections in PHYDA, we also showed the point correlations between the A2M annual NINO3.4 index and the variables of 2-m surface temperature and PDSI in fig. S9.

Drought periods in each of these time series were identified as the persistently negative PDSI values relative to an 11-year moving average (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While this model is not spatially resolved, we used it here for two reasons: (i) There are no local, Southwest forcing estimates available before the Instrumental era. All Common era forcing estimates are available on the hemispheric or global scale (with any reconstructed spatial pattern of volcanic forcing based primarily on ice core records in only Greenland and Antarctica). A global-scale model is therefore a conservative use of the available forcing information. (ii) The use of a low-order model, as opposed to a global climate model, allows us to use an updated volcanic forcing estimate (
    <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
     <span class="italic">47</span>
    </a>) and to include uncertainties associated with the volcanic forcing. Including uncertainties (here within a Monte Carlo framework) is particularly important, given that volcanoes are the dominant forcing over the Common era and that their magnitude and spatial extent can be quite uncertain.

    <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a> (local temperature is not included in the regression model because PDSI is explicitly dependent on temperature). Because of the strong autocorrelation in the annual megadrought time series, we binned all the relevant annual time series according to the boundaries of the start and end years of the megadroughts. Each megadrought period is thus a megadrought bin (
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 14), and the surrounding periods are nonmegadrought bins that are divided according to the following rule: If a given nondrought period is larger than the average megadrought bin size of 22 years, then that period is divided into the largest possible equal (or equal ±1)–sized bins such that no bin is larger than 22 years; the continuous nondrought periods at the beginning and end of the time series also follow this rule.

    </span> for 
    <span class="italic">k</span> predictors. Because the bins are of varying sizes, the regression is weighted by the size of the bin. In addition, each variable is standardized so that the relative influence of each variable can be gauged by comparing the β
    <span class="italic">
     <sub>i</sub>
    </span> values. To address the issue of small sample size (
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 54 total bins) and to be commensurate with 
    <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> (A to C), we performed the regression using a bootstrap sampling with replacement 999 times for each predictor/predictand(s) option. From this, we showed the β
    <sub>1</sub> distributions (the β
    <span class="italic">
     <sub>i</sub>
    </span> distributions for multivariate logistic regression were very similar), and on the basis of the bootstrap sampling, we showed two different information criteria for determining the best regression model: the Akaike information criterion (AIC) corrected for the sample size and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC); both information criteria include a penalty term for the number of model parameters. For each bootstrap regression, the same randomly drawn data points were used for all the predictor/predictand(s) options, and the regression model with the minimum AIC and BIC was recorded; the bars in 
    <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2E</a> show the percentage of the bootstrap iterations where a given model had the lowest AIC and BIC and was thus the “best” model for those randomly drawn data points.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A further complication is that a few very large volcanic eruptions in the forcing time series introduce outliers that can influence the regression. Thus, in 
    <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> (D and E), we showed two logistic regression analyses with one using the full time series and another where four outlying bins were removed for all regression variables (these corresponded to two megadrought bins and two nondrought bins); the outliers in the total forcing time series were considered as those values that were more than three scaled median absolute deviations away from the median (the default outlier detection method of MATLAB).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SOMs are a neural network-based cluster analysis (
    <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
     <span class="italic">30</span>
    </a>) that has been used recently in the climate sciences to describe the continuum of climate patterns within a dataset [e.g., (
    <a rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" href="#R50">
     <span class="italic">50</span>
    </a>, 
    <a rid="R51" ref-type="bibr" href="#R51">
     <span class="italic">51</span>
    </a>)]. An analysis of climate modes using SOMs is conceptually similar to traditional principal component analysis: The “nodes” of a SOM represent the primary modes of the underlying climate field. A critical advantage of a SOM analysis compared to a principal component analysis is that it does not impose linearity and orthogonality on states that may be related in nonlinear, nonorthogonal ways; practically, this feature makes SOMs more likely to correspond to physically plausible patterns [e.g., (
    <a rid="R52" ref-type="bibr" href="#R52">
     <span class="italic">52</span>
    </a>)].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we used the SOM algorithm to assign annual SST anomaly fields to spatial patterns of a preset number. The SOM algorithm creates spatial patterns that maximize their similarity to the underlying SST fields (by minimizing their Euclidian distance) and then assigns each annual SST field to the best matching pattern. The SOM patterns are approximately the mean of the assigned SST fields and are thus approximately a composite of relatively similar SST fields (
    <a rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" href="#R50">
     <span class="italic">50</span>
    </a>). In addition, the SOM analysis organizes the patterns such that similar patterns are assigned to nearby locations within a regular two-dimensional grid. Thus, this full process allows one to visualize a reduced space continuum of patterns in the dataset (
    <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a> and figs. S4 and S5).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the SOM analysis, the SST fields are preprocessed by detrending the SST fields (removing the linear trend at each grid point over the full analysis period, 800–1925; c.f. fig. S2); this detrending prevents spurious trends in the pattern occurrence (
    <a rid="R51" ref-type="bibr" href="#R51">
     <span class="italic">51</span>
    </a>), although it does remove somewhat the influence of the warm AMO in the early centuries of the analysis. As in (
    <a rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" href="#R50">
     <span class="italic">50</span>
    </a>), we applied an area weighting of the SST fields according to the cosine of latitude because PHYDA is on a regular latitude-longitude grid. The SOM algorithm keeps track of which year’s SST field has been assigned to which best matching pattern (or “best matching unit”), and we made composites of JJA PDSI over the years assigned to each pattern, as shown in 
    <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a> and figs. S4 and S5.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the bootstrap resampling for 
    <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3B</a>, we performed a 500 iteration bootstrap resampling of the same number of years as in the megadroughts, drawn from the reference period; corresponding ranges for the nondrought years are very similar. Thus, they are not shown for clarity.
