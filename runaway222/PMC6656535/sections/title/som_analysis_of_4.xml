 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) SOM SST patterns (April to next calendar year March annual mean) with PDSI composites (JJA) over the best matching units for the years 800–1925 in PHYDA. The boxes in the lower left corner of each panel indicate the percent change in the frequency of occurrence of that pattern during the megadroughts relative to the 1601–1925 reference period. std units, standard units. (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) Frequency of occurrence of the SOM SST patterns during the full reference period 1601–1925, during megadroughts within the period 800–1600, and the remainder nonmegadrought years within the period 800–1600. The gray error bars around the reference value are the 2σ range of a bootstrap resampling (see Materials and Methods).
