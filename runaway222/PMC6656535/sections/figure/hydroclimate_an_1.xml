  <p>(
   <span class="bold">A</span>) The bootstrap distributions of adjusted 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> for the decadal linear regression of the predictand North American Southwest PDSI (NASW PDSI) and the predictors of NINO3.4 (or N), AMO (or A), and total forcing (Forc or F) (see Materials and Methods). For this and the other panels in this figure, the central box mark indicates the median, and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, while the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered outliers (outliers not shown for clarity). (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) Bootstrap distributions of adjusted 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> for the decadal linear regression with the predictands of NINO3.4, AMO, and NASW averaged 2-m temperature (T2m) and the predictor of total forcing (see Materials and Methods). (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) Bootstrap regression β
   <sub>1</sub> parameter distributions for the same regressions as shown in (B) (see Materials and Methods). Here and in (D), the numbers at the top indicate the whole percentage of data points below and above zero (below:above). (
   <span class="bold">D</span>) Bootstrap distributions of β
   <sub>1</sub> regression parameter values for a logistic regression binned over megadroughts (see Materials and Methods); here, the predictand is the binary variable of either being in a megadrought or not, while the predictors are the NINO3.4, AMO, and forcing indices. The suffix “All” indicates regressions with all data points, and the suffix “NLV” (or no large volcanoes) indicates regressions with outlier volcanic eruption bins removed for all variables (see Materials and Methods). (
   <span class="bold">E</span>) Percentage of bootstrap regressions for which a particular logistic regression model has a minimum information criterion, suggesting that it is the best of the tested models (see Materials and Methods). “AIC” is the Akaike information criterion corrected for the sample size, and “BIC” is the Bayesian information criterion. The regression models all use the megadrought predictand with different combinations of the predictors NINO3.4, AMO, and total forcing (see Materials and Methods).
