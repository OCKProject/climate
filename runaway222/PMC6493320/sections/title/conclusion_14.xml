 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the growing emphasis on the need to establish an educational alliance between learners and teachers to promote effective feedback, understanding the culture within which this dialogic interaction occurs becomes important. Our findings indicate that residents across different disciplines and institutions prefer a more ‘family’-type culture, which may promote more beneficial feedback for residents. Hierarchy cultures within residencies appear to be negatively associated with the perception of effective feedback. Addressing cultural barriers to feedback may be vital to improving the effective exchange of feedback in the clinical learning environment. Future studies may explore how residency programs could change from a hierarchal culture to a more clan culture.</p>
