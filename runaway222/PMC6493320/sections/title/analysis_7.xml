 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used SPSS 24.0 version for quantitative data analysis. We calculated descriptive statistics (e.g., means, standard deviations) for the OCAI scores and FEEDME-Culture items. Since the normality test was significant for the FEEDME-Culture mean score, we employed non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests to assess any differences in FEEDME-Culture mean scores between specialties from different institutions (i.e., Internal Medicine residents from MMC and BIA, and Pediatric residents from MMC and BIB).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, we examined the correlation between OCAI Now and Preferred culture types and applied multiple regression method to analyze the relationship between the FEEDME-Culture mean score and the OCAI scores of the Now culture type. We also conducted one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) tests to examine whether mean differences among specialty groups were likely to have occurred by chance [
