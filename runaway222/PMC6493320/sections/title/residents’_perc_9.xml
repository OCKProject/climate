  <a rid="T0002" href="#T0002">Table 2</a> shows MMC, BIA, and BIB scores of both Now and Preferred culture types (A = Clan, B = Adhocracy, C = Market, and D = Hierarchy) for each residency program, and the FEEDME-Culture mean scores.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reliability analysis findings indicated that the Cronbach’s alpha values of the collected data were reliable as the alpha values for the residency programs’ Now culture types ranged from 0.79 to 0.92 and the Preferred culture types ranged from 0.86 to 0.95.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results suggest that the dominant residency program Now culture type is the Clan and the least prevailing Now culture type is the Market. For the Preferred culture type, the dominant Preferred culture type is the Clan followed by the Adhocracy, the Hierarchy, and the Market.</p>
