 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We designed a cross-sectional survey study. Participants completed two survey instruments: the OCAI [
  <a rid="CIT0017" href="#CIT0017">17</a>] and the Feedback in Medical Education (FEEDME)-Culture survey [
  <a rid="CIT0020" href="#CIT0020">20</a>]. We considered this study design to be appropriate since our research questions were related to the beliefs, opinions, and attitudes of the intended participants.
