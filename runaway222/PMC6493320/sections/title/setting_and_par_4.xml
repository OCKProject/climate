 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maine Medical Center (MMC) is an independent, urban, academic medical center with approximately 250 residents and fellows across 25 training programs. A convenience sampling approach was used to recruit residents from the Departments of Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, OB/GYN, Pediatrics, Psychiatry and Surgery. Internal Medicine residents from Boston Institution A (BIA), which is a large urban academic medical center and a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School, were also recruited as well as Pediatric residents from Boston Institution B (BIB). A total of 306 residents from the above residency programs at the three institutions were invited to participate in the study. Residency programs in the U.S. are completed typically after four years of undergraduate schooling (i.e., college) and four years of medical school training. Residency programs can vary from three to five years in length depending on the specialty, with residents commonly spending the majority of their training at one institution.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In May and June of 2017, the 306 residents noted above were asked to voluntarily complete the anonymous, electronic survey instruments either via an email invitation, or at one of their regularly scheduled residency conferences. The residents were from all postgraduate levels. There were no incentives provided for participation. A reminder was sent to residents at Boston Institution B two weeks after the initial invitation; no reminders were sent to the MMC or Boston Institution A residents. The research project was determined to be exempt research by the MMC Institutional Review Board.</p>
