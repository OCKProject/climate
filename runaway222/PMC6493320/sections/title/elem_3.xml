  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maine Medical Center (MMC) is an independent, urban, academic medical center with approximately 250 residents and fellows across 25 training programs. A convenience sampling approach was used to recruit residents from the Departments of Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, OB/GYN, Pediatrics, Psychiatry and Surgery. Internal Medicine residents from Boston Institution A (BIA), which is a large urban academic medical center and a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School, were also recruited as well as Pediatric residents from Boston Institution B (BIB). A total of 306 residents from the above residency programs at the three institutions were invited to participate in the study. Residency programs in the U.S. are completed typically after four years of undergraduate schooling (i.e., college) and four years of medical school training. Residency programs can vary from three to five years in length depending on the specialty, with residents commonly spending the majority of their training at one institution.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In May and June of 2017, the 306 residents noted above were asked to voluntarily complete the anonymous, electronic survey instruments either via an email invitation, or at one of their regularly scheduled residency conferences. The residents were from all postgraduate levels. There were no incentives provided for participation. A reminder was sent to residents at Boston Institution B two weeks after the initial invitation; no reminders were sent to the MMC or Boston Institution A residents. The research project was determined to be exempt research by the MMC Institutional Review Board.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Study design</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We designed a cross-sectional survey study. Participants completed two survey instruments: the OCAI [
   <a rid="CIT0017" href="#CIT0017">17</a>] and the Feedback in Medical Education (FEEDME)-Culture survey [
   <a rid="CIT0020" href="#CIT0020">20</a>]. We considered this study design to be appropriate since our research questions were related to the beliefs, opinions, and attitudes of the intended participants.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Survey instruments</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the Qualtrics (Provo, UT) program to administer the surveys. This program allows participants to access the survey link on any desktop or mobile device. We sent emails to residents with a single anonymous electronic link. Residents were offered an option to complete the surveys at one sitting or to save and return to the surveys later. Residents completed the OCAI survey first and the FEEDME-Culture instrument afterwards.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The OCAI [
   <a rid="CIT0017" href="#CIT0017">17</a>] was slightly modified by replacing the word ‘organization’ with the words ‘residency program’ (electronic supplementary material). The OCAI consists of two sets of six questions to measure six domains – Dominant Characteristics, Organizational Leadership, Management of Employees, Organization Glue, Strategic Emphases and Criteria for Success. Each question has four alternatives (A = Clan, B = Adhocracy, C = Market, and D = Hierarchy). The first set of questions is labeled as ‘Now’ that refers to the existing culture. We asked the residents to divide 100 points among the four alternatives and give higher points to the options that were similar to their residency program culture. The same set of questions was repeated and labeled as ‘Preferred.’ With the second set, we asked the residents to allot points based on how they would like their residency program to look five years from now. The scores were calculated by taking the average of all alternative responses in the Now and Preferred sets. The Cronbach’s alpha value for the OCAI is 0.86 [
   <a rid="CIT0021" href="#CIT0021">21</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The FEEDME-Culture instrument (electronic supplementary material) comprises 16 items each with a 1–5 Likert-type rating scale. This tool assesses learners’ perceptions of the feedback culture in their learning environment [
   <a rid="CIT0020" href="#CIT0020">20</a>]. A FEEDME-Culture mean score is calculated from the average of all 16 items. Since the mean score is an aggregate score of 5-point Likert scale items, now it takes on the property of a continuous scale. Higher scores indicate a more positive feedback culture, where learners perceive that they are receiving effective, beneficial, and quality feedback about their performance. The Cronbach value of the FEEDME-Culture instrument is 0.94.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used SPSS 24.0 version for quantitative data analysis. We calculated descriptive statistics (e.g., means, standard deviations) for the OCAI scores and FEEDME-Culture items. Since the normality test was significant for the FEEDME-Culture mean score, we employed non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests to assess any differences in FEEDME-Culture mean scores between specialties from different institutions (i.e., Internal Medicine residents from MMC and BIA, and Pediatric residents from MMC and BIB).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, we examined the correlation between OCAI Now and Preferred culture types and applied multiple regression method to analyze the relationship between the FEEDME-Culture mean score and the OCAI scores of the Now culture type. We also conducted one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) tests to examine whether mean differences among specialty groups were likely to have occurred by chance [
   <a rid="CIT0022" href="#CIT0022">22</a>]. A priori power analysis suggested that for conducting MANOVA analysis, a minimum sample size of 103 is required to have 80% power for detecting a minimum effect size at the traditional statistical significance level of 0.05.
