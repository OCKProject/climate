 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted MANOVA analysis with only the Maine Medical Center (n = 86) OCAI and FEEDME-Culture data (one outlier case of the Hierarchy Now culture variable was deleted). We focused on only Maine Medical Center because of the small number of specialties and residents from the two Boston institutions, and the potential for confounding factors between institutions. Findings from the initial correlation analysis indicated that the FEEDME-Culture mean score was minimally and positively correlated with the Clan Now culture type (r = .18) and moderately and negatively correlated with Hierarchy Now culture type (r = −0.30). The rest of the culture type variables were not significantly correlated and therefore, they were excluded from the MANOVA analysis. All assumptions for MANOVA tests were met.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A statistically significant MANOVA effect was obtained, Pillai’s Trace = .43, F (5, 80) = 2.71, p &lt; .001. The multivariate effect size estimate was 0.145. Furthermore, subsequent one-way ANOVA was not significant for the Hierarchy Now culture type [F (5, 80) = 2.1, p = .07] but they were statistically significant for the Clan Now culture type [F (5, 80) = 3.2, (p = .011] and FEEDME-Culture mean score [F (5, 80) = 4.83, (p = .001], with effect sizes (partial η2) of .167 and.232.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we performed a series of posthoc analyses (Tukey) to examine mean difference comparisons across the two significant Clan Now culture type and FEEDME-Culture mean score dependent variables and all six specialties at only Maine Medical Center (n = 86). The results revealed that a few posthoc mean comparisons were statistically significant (
  <a rid="F0001" href="#F0001">Figure 1a</a> and 
  <a rid="F0001" href="#F0001">1b</a>). The Clan culture type was more dominant in the Pediatrics than in the Surgery residency program (p = 0.01). On an average, feedback culture was more established in the Psychiatry than in the OB/GYN (p = 0.01) and Internal Medicine residency (p = 0.01) programs.
