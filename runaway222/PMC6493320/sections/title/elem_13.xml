 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of our cross-sectional study involving residents from three institutions add to the medical literature by providing insights into the interplay between the residency program culture and the feedback culture, as perceived by residents. The findings suggested that a Clan culture was the current, dominant residency program culture as well as the preferred culture by residents. In addition, residents’ perceptions of a current Hierarchy culture were significantly associated with a negative impact on the feedback culture.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our first research question (what is the relationship between residents’ perceptions of their program’s organizational culture and feedback culture?) is answered with the correlational results between the OCAI and FEEDME-Culture mean scores. We are not entirely surprised by the findings, as organizations with a strong hierarchical culture are less likely to promote a safe culture where individuals can raise concerns and speak [
  <a rid="CIT0023" href="#CIT0023">23</a>]. Residents may perceive a hierarchal culture as a barrier to promoting a healthy feedback exchange. A study using the OCAI survey in 40 U.S. hospitals found that 37.5% had a dominant hierarchal culture, which was negatively associated with attitudes and climate for patient safety [
  <a rid="CIT0024" href="#CIT0024">24</a>]. Employees’ perceptions of being at a certain level within an organizational hierarchy may further impact their seeking of informal feedback [
  <a rid="CIT0025" href="#CIT0025">25</a>] and the hierarchy may explain employees’ perceptions of the quality of feedback [
  <a rid="CIT0026" href="#CIT0026">26</a>]. An organizational culture more similar to the Clan culture, as described in the Competing Values Framework [
  <a rid="CIT0017" href="#CIT0017">17</a>] and assessed by the OCAI instrument, has been described as having more frequent informal feedback for employees, higher levels of interaction between superiors and subordinates, and a stronger focus on employee development [
  <a rid="CIT0027" href="#CIT0027">27</a>] than a culture more akin to the Hierarchy culture.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding our second research question (are there differences in residents’ perceptions of their programs’ organizational and feedback cultures amongst residents from different disciplines and different institutions?), all residents regardless of discipline and institution perceived and desired a Clan culture, which is more like an extended family, with faculty and residency leadership seen as more mentors and even possibly parental figures. In this type of culture, commitment is high, and loyalty and traditions are valued [
  <a rid="CIT0017" href="#CIT0017">17</a>]. Due to the rigorous nature of residency with long hours, residents may desire a Clan culture, which might provide more support and encouragement. Residents were least desirable of a Market culture, which is more results-oriented, and focused on getting the work done. Individuals in Market cultures are competitive and value reputation and success [
  <a rid="CIT0017" href="#CIT0017">17</a>]. We also found significant differences in residents’ perceived program culture and feedback culture between specialties at one institution. These findings are consistent with the literature that described the feedback culture as challenging for surgeons [
  <a rid="CIT0028" href="#CIT0028">28</a>]. Scholars found that some surgery residents view intimidation and harassment by their surgery teachers as functional educational tools [
  <a rid="CIT0029" href="#CIT0029">29</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We believe the generalizability of our findings is strengthened by examining the perceptions of residents from many disciplines and three different institutions. That said, a limitation of our study is that all of the institutions are located in the Northeast and the relatively low overall response rate. In addition, we did not query residents who did not volunteer to participate in the study; these residents might have different perceptions of the residency program or feedback cultures than participating residents. Our findings of an association between only the Clan and Hierarchy cultures and not the other cultures may suggest the OCAI instrument is not refined enough. In addition, our methods do not explain why residents prefer a Clan culture; subsequent qualitative studies may help understand their perspectives. Last, our surveys assess learners’ perceptions only, which may not reflect the actual residency program and feedback culture.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conclusion</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the growing emphasis on the need to establish an educational alliance between learners and teachers to promote effective feedback, understanding the culture within which this dialogic interaction occurs becomes important. Our findings indicate that residents across different disciplines and institutions prefer a more ‘family’-type culture, which may promote more beneficial feedback for residents. Hierarchy cultures within residencies appear to be negatively associated with the perception of effective feedback. Addressing cultural barriers to feedback may be vital to improving the effective exchange of feedback in the clinical learning environment. Future studies may explore how residency programs could change from a hierarchal culture to a more clan culture.</p>
