 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relationship between residency programs’ feedback culture and now culture type</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We completed a multiple regression analysis to assess the relationship between the residency programs’ FEEDME-Culture mean scores (as the dependent variable) and Now culture types (Clan, Adhocracy, Market, and Hierarchy). These Now culture types variables were significantly related to the feedback culture mean scores, F (3, 110) = 7.87, p = .000, Adjusted R
  <span class="sup">2</span> = .154. The VIF value was 1.184 that led to a conclusion there was no multicollinearity. The results showed that the Hierarchy Now culture type was significantly related to the feedback culture mean score (B = −.023, p &lt; .01). For every one unit increase in the Hierarchy Now culture type, the FEEDME-Culture mean score decreases by 0.023 units.
