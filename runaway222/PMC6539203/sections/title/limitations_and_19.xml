 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study has several limitations. First, we only used employees’ self-reported data, which may be subject to common method bias, resulting in false or obscure relationships between variables (
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">Furnham, 1986</a>; 
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">Richman et al., 1999</a>). Therefore, future research should collect data from multiple sources by asking supervisors to report on their safety-specific leadership styles or using second-hand data to measure near-miss recognition (
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">Probst, 2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, because we conducted the study in the construction industry, the average education level in our sample was relatively low, which limits the generalizability of our results. For example, the complicated technology used in nuclear power plants generally requires employees to have a high level of education, so safety climate may have a different moderating effect in the nuclear power industry than in the construction industry. Therefore, we encourage researchers to explore the influence of safety climate on the relationship between safety-specific leadership and goal orientation in a wider range of safety scenarios. In addition, the proportion of women in the construction industry is quite small, which also weakens the generalizability of our results. More research is needed to explore the moderating effect of safety climate on the relationship between safety-specific leadership and goal orientation in safety scenarios with a relatively balanced gender ratio (e.g., in hospitals).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, the scale we used to measure safety climate differed from that developed by 
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">Zohar (1980)</a>. This may explain the insignificant cross-level moderation effect of safety climate on the path from safety-specific transformational leadership to learning goal orientation. Therefore, future research could use the safety climate scale developed by 
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">Zohar (1980)</a> for safety management to explore the effect of safety-specific leadership on employees’ goal orientations. The influence of safety-specific leadership on near-miss recognition may also be mediated by other factors (e.g., self-regulatory focus). In this study, goal orientation was the key exploratory variable. We thus call for more research that explores other potential mediators of the influence of safety-specific leadership on employees’ near-miss recognition.
