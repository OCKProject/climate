 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to SDT, an individual’s performance is affected by intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, which derive from different psychological needs. Specifically, intrinsic motivations drive individuals to engage in activities that satisfy their need for autonomy, while extrinsic motivations inspire individuals to engage in activities that meet their need for competence. In other words, individuals tend to participate in activities and pursue goals that promise to satisfy their key needs. Empirically, previous research has indicated that individuals driven by intrinsic motivations tend to engage in learning activities for personal growth (

  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">Deci and Ryan, 1985</a>). Many studies have supported this view (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to SDT, leadership, as an environmental factor, influences employees’ safety performance through their motivations. Safety-specific transformational leadership is a leadership style that delivers a shared vision of safety to employees and encourages them to exercise their energy, skills, and self-efficacy to realize this vision. In practice, a leader with a safety-specific transformational leadership style enhances employees’ safety performance, such as safety participation and compliance with safety regulations, through idealized influence, inspirational motivation, and intellectual stimulation (
   <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Barling et al., 2002</a>; 
   <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">Inness et al., 2010</a>). Employees under high level safety-specific transformational leadership, put more energy into safety management and detecting potential safety hazards. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:
  </p>
  <div list-type="simple" prefix-word="simple" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>
     <span class="bold">Hypothesis 1a:</span> Safety-specific transformational leadership has a positive effect on employee’s near-miss recognition.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individuals with a learning goal orientation are likely to adopt in-depth learning strategies (
   <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">Elliot and McGregor, 2001</a>) and diversified solutions (
   <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">Bereby-Meyer and Kaplan, 2005</a>) to satisfy their need to understand and master the surrounding environment. They view deficiencies in current safety management as opportunities to improve their ability to master situations in the workplace. Therefore, we speculate that employees with high level of learning goal orientation tend to recognize more potential safety hazards in safety management, enhancing their near-miss recognition.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Safety-specific transformational leadership can affect employees’ safety performance by stimulating their motivation. Research has shown that intrinsic motivations mediate the influence of transformational leadership not only on sports performance (
   <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">Charbonneau et al., 2001</a>), but also on employees’ creativity (
   <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">Shin and Zhou, 2003</a>). Some studies on safety management have found that safety-specific transformational leadership is positively associated with employees’ safety compliance via employees’ intrinsic motivations (
   <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Conchie and Donald, 2009</a>). 
   <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">Conchie (2013)</a> also found that intrinsic motivations mediate the relationship between safety-specific transformational leadership and employees’ safety citizenship behavior (i.e., voice behavior).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Combining all of the above evidence, and in light of SDT, we argue that safety-specific transformational leadership triggers employees’ intrinsic motivations through idealized influence, inspirational motivation, and intellectual stimulation (
   <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Button et al., 1996</a>; 
   <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">Payne et al., 2007</a>). This in turn fosters a learning goal orientation and thus enhances near-miss recognition. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:
  </p>
  <div list-type="simple" prefix-word="simple" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Safety-Specific Active Transactional Leadership, Performance Goal Orientation, and Near-Miss Recognition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike safety-specific transformational leadership, safety-specific active transactional leadership improves employees’ safety performance by clearly conveying contingent incentives and penalties and providing active supervision. Previous research has indicated that safety-specific active transactional leadership can motivate subordinates to obey safety regulations and seek to avoid mistakes and punishment (
   <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">Wallace and Chen, 2006</a>; 
   <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">Wallace et al., 2008</a>; 
   <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Kark et al., 2015</a>). When motivated by a leader who provides clear incentives and penalties, employees pay more attention to possible rewards and losses, and thus remain highly sensitive to near misses in safety management. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:
  </p>
  <div list-type="simple" prefix-word="simple" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>
     <span class="bold">Hypothesis 2a:</span> Safety-specific transactional leadership is positively associated with employees’ near-miss recognition.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individuals with a high level of performance goal orientation exhibit more external task motivation and tend to seek more positive and less negative feedback (
   <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">Wolters et al., 1996</a>; 
   <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">Brett and VandeWalle, 1999</a>; 
   <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">VandeWalle et al., 2001</a>). Individuals with this orientation seek to improve their safety performance to compensate for deficiencies in their work-related ability (
   <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">Elliot and Church, 1997</a>) and avoid negative feedback (
   <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Cron et al., 2005</a>). Therefore, individuals with high level of performance goal orientation are more sensitive to potential safety hazards and thus better able to recognize near misses in safety management. Safety-specific active transactional leadership, an important environmental factor, can affect employees’ safety performance by stimulating their extrinsic motivations. Previous research has shown that employees’ extrinsic motivations mediate the relationship between safety-specific active transactional leadership and employees’ performance (
   <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">Islam et al., 2012</a>). Studies of safety management have indicated that safety-specific active transactional leadership improves employees’ safety compliance by motivating them to avoid mistakes in safety operations (
   <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Kark et al., 2015</a>). Researchers have also found that employees’ extrinsic motivations mediate the relationship between transactional leadership and safety compliance (
   <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">Pilbeam et al., 2016</a>). Therefore, employees under high level of safety-specific active transactional leadership are better able to recognize near misses because they usually consider near misses as a source of punishment and make more effort to prevent accidents. We thus propose the following hypothesis:

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Moderating Effects of Safety Climate</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drawing on SDT, we anticipate that the effects of safety-specific leadership on employees’ goal orientation depend on employees’ perception of the extent to which safety is valued in their group. This shared perception is also known as the safety climate (
   <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">Zohar, 2000</a>). Research has suggested that the safety climate varies dramatically across workgroups (e.g., 
   <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Hofmann and Stetzer, 1996</a>, 
   <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">1998</a>; 
   <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">Zohar, 2000</a>; 
   <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">Hofmann et al., 2003</a>), and that the strength of the safety climate affects how individuals react to leaders’ behaviors. For example, 
   <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">Hofmann et al. (2003)</a> found that high-quality leader-member exchanges lead to stronger safety citizenship role definitions in a higher-safety climate. 
   <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">Kapp (2012)</a> also suggested that supervisors’ contingent reward leadership practices are more closely related to employee safety compliance or participation when the safety climate is stronger.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When a workgroup has a strong safety climate, members of the group support, value, and appreciate safety practices, such as consistently improving organizational reliability, promoting new security systems, and identifying safety hazards. Therefore, a strong safety climate supports the efforts of transformational leaders, who focus on improving safety performance, and thus enhances their motivational influence. Such a climate also supports the efforts made by active transactional leaders, who focus on minimizing safety hazards in the workplace by adhering to safety regulations, recognizing near misses, and preventing accidents. In contrast, when the safety climate is weak, employees may be extremely uncertain as to whether safety behavior and practices are appreciated and valued by other group members. In such situations, the motivational effects of safety-specific leadership on employees’ goal orientation tend to be weaker. Therefore, we offer the following hypotheses:</p>
  <div list-type="simple" prefix-word="simple" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>
     <span class="bold">Hypothesis 3a:</span> The relationship between safety-specific transformational leadership and an individual’s learning goal orientation is moderated by the safety climate, such that the relationship is stronger at high levels of safety climate.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>
     <span class="bold">Hypothesis 3b:</span> The relationship between safety-specific transactional leadership and an individual’s performance goal orientation is moderated by the safety climate, such that the relationship is stronger at high levels of safety climate.
