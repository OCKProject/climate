 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure safety-specific leadership, we adopted 
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">Conchie (2013)</a> eight-item safety-specific transformational leadership scale and 
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">Zohar (2002)</a> six-item safety-specific transactional leadership scale. Sample items for safety-specific transformational leadership include the following: “Our supervisor encourages me to express my ideas and opinions about safety at work” (A = 0.89). The scale for safety-specific active transactional leadership had two dimensions: contingent reward and management by exception (A = 0.91).
