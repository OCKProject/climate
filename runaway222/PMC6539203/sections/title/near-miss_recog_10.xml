 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Dillon et al. (2016)</a>, we developed the following near-miss scenario in the construction context.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Operating procedures prohibit employees on a construction site from placing nails in their mouths while working, as swallowing nails leads to safety incidents. Due to time limitations and negligence, Mr. Wang placed nails in his mouth during an operation and fell over due to a slippery scaffold. Fortunately, however, the nails in his mouth also fell out and caused no harm</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After reading the materials, the workers answered a questionnaire evaluating Mr. Wangâ€™s competence, intelligence, and decision-making ability (A = 0.83), and subsequently indicated whether he should be fired (reverse coded). The ICC (1) for near-miss recognition was 0.42, indicating that the sample data we collected in this research were suitable for cross-level analysis.</p>
