  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Barling et al., 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">Inness et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Kark et al., 2015</a>), we controlled for demographic variables such as age, gender, education, and tenure. However, the control variables did not change the relationships between the variables of interest and the dependent variables. Thus, for brevity, we report the findings of the analyses without these control variables.
