 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we explored how and when safety-specific leadership (i.e., safety-specific transformational leadership and active transactional leadership) enhances employees’ near-miss recognition. The findings suggest that (i) safety-specific transformational leadership enhances employees’ near-miss recognition by stimulating their learning goal orientation, and (ii) safety-specific active transactional leadership enhances employees’ near-miss recognition by promoting their performance goal orientation. Our findings also indicate that safety climate can enhance the positive effect of safety-specific active transactional leadership on performance goal orientation.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the results do not support our hypothesis that safety climate moderates the effect of safety-specific transformational leadership on learning goal orientation. This may be due to the scale we used to measure employees’ perceptions of safety climate. All of the items on the safety climate scale, such as “management places a strong emphasis on workplace health and safety,” “safety is given a high priority by management,” and “management considers safety to be important,” stressed the avoidance of safety hazards rather than the improvement of workplace safety. Therefore, we assumed that employees focus on preventing accidents rather than improving the reliability of the organization by mastering new skills related to safety. As a result, we did not observe the expected moderating effect.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Theoretical and Practical Implications</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The findings of this study have several theoretical implications. First, although a growing body of research has explored the antecedents of near-miss recognition (
   <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">Phimister et al., 2003</a>; 
   <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">Dillon et al., 2013</a>, 
   <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">2014b</a>, 
   <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">2016</a>; 
   <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">Soyer and Hogarth, 2015</a>), little attention has been paid to the influence of leadership on near-miss recognition. Extending previous research on the effects of safety-specific transformational leadership and active transactional leadership on employees’ safety performance (e.g., accident reduction and safety compliance), our study for the first time investigated the relationship between safety-specific leadership and employees’ near-miss recognition.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, the findings further our understanding of the mechanism by which safety-specific leadership influences employees’ near-miss recognition. Although researchers have studied the relationship between leadership and safety performance from the perspectives of safety climate (
   <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Barling et al., 2002</a>; 
   <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">Zohar, 2002</a>; 
   <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Kelloway et al., 2006</a>), self-regulatory focus (
   <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Kark et al., 2015</a>), leader-member exchange (
   <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">Michael et al., 2006</a>), and trust in leaders (
   <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Conchie and Donald, 2009</a>), few have adopted a motivational perspective. Drawing on SDT, we linked employees’ learning and performance goal orientations with different motivations and showed how these orientations mediated the relationship between two safety-specific leadership styles and near-miss recognition. Our study thus provides a new explanation of the relationship between safety-specific leadership and safety performance.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, our study highlights the effect of safety climate on the relationship between safety-specific leadership and employees’ goal orientations. Consistent with previous research showing that safety climate can enhance the positive effects and reduce the negative effects of leadership on employees’ safety performance (
   <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">Zohar, 2002</a>), our findings suggest that a strong safety climate can enhance the effect of safety-specific active transactional leadership on performance goal orientation. They also provide insights into the contingent nature of the relationship between safety-specific active transactional leadership and safety performance.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, our findings have some practical implications for safety management. First, both safety-specific leadership styles can enhance employees’ near-miss recognition, although the decision on which to adopt depends on the specific workplace conditions. Previous research has indicated that safety-specific transformational leadership and active transactional leadership influence safety performance through different mechanisms (
   <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Clarke, 2013</a>). Consistent with this research, our findings suggest that the two types of safety-specific leadership influence employees’ near-miss recognition by prompting different goal orientations. Second, our findings indicate that a positive safety climate can enhance employees’ performance goal orientation but not their learning goal orientation. Thus, for management practitioners, fostering a strong safety climate may enhance the positive influence on safety-specific transactional leadership on employees’ performance goal orientation, but will not affect the link between safety-specific transformational leadership and learning goal orientation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations and Future Research</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study has several limitations. First, we only used employees’ self-reported data, which may be subject to common method bias, resulting in false or obscure relationships between variables (
   <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">Furnham, 1986</a>; 
   <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">Richman et al., 1999</a>). Therefore, future research should collect data from multiple sources by asking supervisors to report on their safety-specific leadership styles or using second-hand data to measure near-miss recognition (
   <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">Probst, 2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, because we conducted the study in the construction industry, the average education level in our sample was relatively low, which limits the generalizability of our results. For example, the complicated technology used in nuclear power plants generally requires employees to have a high level of education, so safety climate may have a different moderating effect in the nuclear power industry than in the construction industry. Therefore, we encourage researchers to explore the influence of safety climate on the relationship between safety-specific leadership and goal orientation in a wider range of safety scenarios. In addition, the proportion of women in the construction industry is quite small, which also weakens the generalizability of our results. More research is needed to explore the moderating effect of safety climate on the relationship between safety-specific leadership and goal orientation in safety scenarios with a relatively balanced gender ratio (e.g., in hospitals).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, the scale we used to measure safety climate differed from that developed by 
   <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">Zohar (1980)</a>. This may explain the insignificant cross-level moderation effect of safety climate on the path from safety-specific transformational leadership to learning goal orientation. Therefore, future research could use the safety climate scale developed by 
   <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">Zohar (1980)</a> for safety management to explore the effect of safety-specific leadership on employees’ goal orientations. The influence of safety-specific leadership on near-miss recognition may also be mediated by other factors (e.g., self-regulatory focus). In this study, goal orientation was the key exploratory variable. We thus call for more research that explores other potential mediators of the influence of safety-specific leadership on employees’ near-miss recognition.
