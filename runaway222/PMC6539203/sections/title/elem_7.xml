 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We administered all of the questionnaires in Chinese. We translated and back-translated the measures originally developed in English to ensure their validity (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Brislin, 1980</a>). The original measurement of near-miss recognition was based on aviation scenarios (
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Dillon et al., 2016</a>). To tailor it to construction site situations and thus ensure its validity, we took the following steps. First, we created a team consisting of two construction workers with more than 10 years of work experience, two doctoral students with English translation expertise, and two doctoral students in the field of safety management research. Second, this team designed and selected a near-miss scenario on construction sites and developed a questionnaire on near-miss recognition based on previous research (
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Dillon et al., 2016</a>). Third, we distributed copies of the questionnaire to five experienced construction workers for validation. Based on their feedback, we improved and finalized the scenario and items measuring near-miss recognition.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Safety-Specific Leadership</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure safety-specific leadership, we adopted 
   <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">Conchie (2013)</a> eight-item safety-specific transformational leadership scale and 
   <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">Zohar (2002)</a> six-item safety-specific transactional leadership scale. Sample items for safety-specific transformational leadership include the following: “Our supervisor encourages me to express my ideas and opinions about safety at work” (A = 0.89). The scale for safety-specific active transactional leadership had two dimensions: contingent reward and management by exception (A = 0.91).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Goal Orientation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We measured goal orientation using the 16-item scale developed by 
   <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Button et al. (1996)</a>. Eight of the 16 items measured learning goal orientation, and the other eight measured performance goal orientation. For learning goal orientation, a sample item is as follows: “I try hard to improve on my past performance in safety management” (A = 0.90). A sample item for performance goal orientation is as follows: “The things I enjoy the most are the things I do the best in safety management” (A = 0.89).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Near-Miss Recognition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on 
   <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Dillon et al. (2016)</a>, we developed the following near-miss scenario in the construction context.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Operating procedures prohibit employees on a construction site from placing nails in their mouths while working, as swallowing nails leads to safety incidents. Due to time limitations and negligence, Mr. Wang placed nails in his mouth during an operation and fell over due to a slippery scaffold. Fortunately, however, the nails in his mouth also fell out and caused no harm</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After reading the materials, the workers answered a questionnaire evaluating Mr. Wang’s competence, intelligence, and decision-making ability (A = 0.83), and subsequently indicated whether he should be fired (reverse coded). The ICC (1) for near-miss recognition was 0.42, indicating that the sample data we collected in this research were suitable for cross-level analysis.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Safety Climate</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure safety climate, we used 
   <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">Neal and Griffin (2006)</a> three-item scale. Sample items include the following: “Management places a strong emphasis on workplace health and safety” and “Safety is given a high priority by management” (A = 0.72). A series of indicators demonstrated that the safety climate perceived by individual workers could be aggregated to the team level [ICC (1) = 0.25, ICC (2) = 0.59, and median rwg = 0.88].

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Control Variables</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following previous research (
   <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Barling et al., 2002</a>; 
   <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">Inness et al., 2010</a>; 
   <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Kark et al., 2015</a>), we controlled for demographic variables such as age, gender, education, and tenure. However, the control variables did not change the relationships between the variables of interest and the dependent variables. Thus, for brevity, we report the findings of the analyses without these control variables.
