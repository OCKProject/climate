 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study examined how and when two types of safety-specific leadership affect employees’ near-miss recognition. Our results suggest that safety-specific transformational leadership and active transactional leadership positively influence near-miss recognition by stimulating employees’ learning goal orientation and performance goal orientation, respectively. We also found that safety-specific active transactional leadership had a stronger effect on performance goal-orientation when the safety climate was high. However, the positive impact of safety-specific transformational leadership on learning goal orientation was immune to the influence of safety climate.</p>
