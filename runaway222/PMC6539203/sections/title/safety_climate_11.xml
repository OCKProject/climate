 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure safety climate, we used 
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">Neal and Griffin (2006)</a> three-item scale. Sample items include the following: “Management places a strong emphasis on workplace health and safety” and “Safety is given a high priority by management” (A = 0.72). A series of indicators demonstrated that the safety climate perceived by individual workers could be aggregated to the team level [ICC (1) = 0.25, ICC (2) = 0.59, and median rwg = 0.88].
