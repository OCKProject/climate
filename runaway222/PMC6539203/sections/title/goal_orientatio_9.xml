 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We measured goal orientation using the 16-item scale developed by 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Button et al. (1996)</a>. Eight of the 16 items measured learning goal orientation, and the other eight measured performance goal orientation. For learning goal orientation, a sample item is as follows: “I try hard to improve on my past performance in safety management” (A = 0.90). A sample item for performance goal orientation is as follows: “The things I enjoy the most are the things I do the best in safety management” (A = 0.89).
