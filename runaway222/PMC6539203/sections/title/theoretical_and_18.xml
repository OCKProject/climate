 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The findings of this study have several theoretical implications. First, although a growing body of research has explored the antecedents of near-miss recognition (

  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">Dillon et al., 2013</a>, 
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">2014b</a>, 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">2016</a>; 
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">Soyer and Hogarth, 2015</a>), little attention has been paid to the influence of leadership on near-miss recognition. Extending previous research on the effects of safety-specific transformational leadership and active transactional leadership on employees’ safety performance (e.g., accident reduction and safety compliance), our study for the first time investigated the relationship between safety-specific leadership and employees’ near-miss recognition.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, the findings further our understanding of the mechanism by which safety-specific leadership influences employees’ near-miss recognition. Although researchers have studied the relationship between leadership and safety performance from the perspectives of safety climate (
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Barling et al., 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">Zohar, 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Kelloway et al., 2006</a>), self-regulatory focus (
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Kark et al., 2015</a>), leader-member exchange (
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">Michael et al., 2006</a>), and trust in leaders (
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Conchie and Donald, 2009</a>), few have adopted a motivational perspective. Drawing on SDT, we linked employees’ learning and performance goal orientations with different motivations and showed how these orientations mediated the relationship between two safety-specific leadership styles and near-miss recognition. Our study thus provides a new explanation of the relationship between safety-specific leadership and safety performance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, our study highlights the effect of safety climate on the relationship between safety-specific leadership and employees’ goal orientations. Consistent with previous research showing that safety climate can enhance the positive effects and reduce the negative effects of leadership on employees’ safety performance (
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">Zohar, 2002</a>), our findings suggest that a strong safety climate can enhance the effect of safety-specific active transactional leadership on performance goal orientation. They also provide insights into the contingent nature of the relationship between safety-specific active transactional leadership and safety performance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, our findings have some practical implications for safety management. First, both safety-specific leadership styles can enhance employees’ near-miss recognition, although the decision on which to adopt depends on the specific workplace conditions. Previous research has indicated that safety-specific transformational leadership and active transactional leadership influence safety performance through different mechanisms (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Clarke, 2013</a>). Consistent with this research, our findings suggest that the two types of safety-specific leadership influence employees’ near-miss recognition by prompting different goal orientations. Second, our findings indicate that a positive safety climate can enhance employees’ performance goal orientation but not their learning goal orientation. Thus, for management practitioners, fostering a strong safety climate may enhance the positive influence on safety-specific transactional leadership on employees’ performance goal orientation, but will not affect the link between safety-specific transformational leadership and learning goal orientation.
