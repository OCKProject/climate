 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected data from a large construction company that undertakes various large-scale real estate projects in China and adopted a two-phase time lagged research design. At Time 1, the participating employees reported their perceptions of safety-specific leadership and goal orientation, along with information on their age, gender, educational level, and tenure. One month later, at Time 2, they rated their perceptions of safety climate and near-miss recognition.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also randomly selected 450 workers from 90 teams on three construction sites. With the assistance of project managers, we asked these workers to fill in questionnaires in the meeting rooms of their respective construction sites during non-working hours. By the end of the survey period, we had received 431 questionnaires at Time 1 (response rate 96%) and 370 questionnaires at Time 2 (response rate 86%). The final matched sample comprised 370 workers (79 teams). The majority of the construction workers were men (88.6%), with a mean age of 38 and a mean tenure of 10.8 years. The participants responded to most of the measures (two types of safety-specific leadership, goal orientation and near-miss recognition) using 5-point Likert scales (1 = “strongly disagree” to 5 = “strongly agree”). We measured perceptions of safety climate on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = “totally disagree” to 7 = “totally agree”).</p>
