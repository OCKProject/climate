 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Near misses—events in which hazardous conditions could produce a negative outcome but do not (
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">Dillon et al., 2014a</a>)—occur frequently in the workplace (
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">Phimister et al., 2003</a>). As recognizing near misses helps organizations avoid future hazards and improve safety (
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">Kalnins et al., 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">Kim and Miner, 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">Soyer and Hogarth, 2015</a>), enhancing near-miss recognition is an increasingly important task in safety management (
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">Baron and Hershey, 1988</a>; 
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">Phimister et al., 2003</a>;

  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Dillon et al., 2016</a>). At a Chinese stainless-steel company in 2014, for instance, the failure to recognize a potential workplace hazard led to an explosion, resulting in 146 deaths and 114 injuries. To find ways of promoting near-miss recognition, researchers have begun to explore its antecedents and related contextual factors (
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">Dillon et al., 2013</a>, 
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">2014a</a>; 
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">Madsen et al., 2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite this progress, however, we believe that research on near-miss recognition can be improved in several ways. First, although prior research has confirmed the critical influence of leadership on safety performance (
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Barling et al., 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Kelloway et al., 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">Inness et al., 2010</a>), it remains unclear whether and how leadership affects near-miss recognition. Second, while much previous research has focused on risk perception as the mechanism explaining the effects of antecedents of near-miss recognition (
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">Madsen et al., 2016</a>), few studies have investigated these effects from the perspective of employees’ motivation. Third, studies have indicated that the relationship between leadership and safety performance is complex and inconsistent (
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">Mullen and Kelloway, 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Clarke, 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Kark et al., 2015</a>). Further research is needed to explore the factors affecting the relationship between leadership and near-miss recognition. Therefore, our research explores how and when two key safety leadership styles (safety-specific transformational leadership and safety-specific active transactional leadership) influence near-miss recognition.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drawing on the self-determination theory (SDT) (
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">Deci and Ryan, 1985</a>; 
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Gagné and Deci, 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">Deci et al., 2017</a>), we propose that by communicating a positive and value-based vision of the organization to employees, safety-specific transformational leaders enhance near-miss recognition by evoking employees’ learning goal orientation. This orientation reflects the intrinsic motivation to control situations by increasing one’s competence and mastering something new (e.g., 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">Dweck, 1986</a>). We hypothesize that through contingent rewards and management by exception, safety-specific active transactional leaders motivate employees to continuously pay attention to potential safety hazards by fostering their performance goal orientation. This orientation reflects the extrinsic motivation to seek positive feedback or avoid negative evaluations of their competence (e.g., 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">Mehmood et al., 2016</a>). However, the influence of safety-specific leadership on employees’ motivation and safety performance varies with context (
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">Ehrhart and Klein, 2001</a>; 
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Boerner and Freiherr von Streit, 2005</a>). Leaders’ safety-specific behaviors guide employees to pursue safety-related goals, but employees’ safety performance is also influenced by group members’ behaviors and expectations (e.g., 
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">Jiang et al., 2010</a>). We propose that the group-level safety climate—i.e., group members’ shared perception of the extent to which safety is valued, supported, and expected within their group (
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">Zohar, 2000</a>; 
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">Neal and Griffin, 2006</a>)—moderates the influence of safety-specific leadership styles on employees’ goal orientations. Specifically, a high-safety climate conveys the message that group members value and appreciate safety behaviors, strengthening employees’ motivation to accept and internalize the safety goals advanced by the leader. In contrast, when the safety climate is low, employees may be extremely uncertain about whether the safety behavior advocated by the leader is appreciated and valued by other group members. This weakens the motivational effects of safety-specific leadership.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study makes several contributions. First, we respond to the call for leadership studies on near-miss recognition (
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Dillon et al., 2016</a>) by empirically examining the effects of safety-specific leadership on near-miss recognition. Second, we introduce employees’ motivation as a new theoretical perspective, showing how two important types of safety-specific leadership influence near-miss recognition via learning goal orientation and performance goal orientation. Third, the study provides practical guidance for safety practitioners on enhancing employees’ near-miss recognition by clarifying the particular safety climate under which safety-specific transformational leaders and active transactional leaders can most effectively influence employees’ goal orientation.
