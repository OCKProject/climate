  <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are larger ACE anomalies over the southeastern WNP in El Niño developing years (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), associated with a southeastward shift of the mean TC genesis location

   </span>. We find that the WNP ACE leads the N3.4 by ~3 months (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). The correlation of the N3.4 with its value 3 months earlier is closely related to the WNP ACE of 3-months earlier during El Niño developing years (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a> and Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The greater the ACE, the stronger the El Niño, particularly for TCs in J–A–S. As seen from Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> (combined with Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>,
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">a–e</a>), the mean explained percentages (see Methods) of both the WNP ACE and N3.4 in J–A–S to N3.4 in O–N–D are ~51%. The mean explained percentage of the N3.4-independent ACE in J–A–S to the N3.4 in O–N–D is equivalent to that of the ACE-independent N3.4 (17.3% vs 18%, respectively). The joint explained percentage of the preceding (3 months earlier) ACE and N3.4 is nearly 20% higher than that of either factor alone. An intermediate-complexity coupled ocean–atmosphere model

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span> can predict the sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies pattern well during El Niño developing years. Both the time series of N3.4 and the spatial patterns of the SST anomalies from observations and simulations are similar. The correlation coefficient between observed and simulated N3.4 reaches 0.86 (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). Model results agree with the aforementioned observations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>,
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">f–j</a>). The J–A–S WNP ACE can significantly intensify the O–N–D Niño-3.4 SST anomalies during El Niño developing years (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>), whereas the Niño-3.4 SST anomalies associated with simultaneous ACE (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b, c</a>) are noticeably weaker. These results support the finding that the J–A–S ACE has an important influence on the O–N–D El Niño. In addition, unlike N3.4, the autocorrelation of the WNP ACE with its value 3 months earlier is not significant (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2a</a>), and the ACE still leads the N3.4 even after removing the simultaneous N3.4 and the autocorrelation of the N3.4 index with its value 3 months earlier (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2b</a>). These results indicate that the lead of WNP ACE index over the N3.4 does not primarily result from the autocorrelation of the N3.4. Therefore, the cross-scale effect of WNP TC activity on El Niño events is not negligible. The mechanism underlying the effects of WNP TCs on El Niño is discussed next.

  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taking the year 2015 as an example, as shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>, daily strong westerly (easterly) anomalies are found on the southern (northern) flanks of TCs. From 1970 to 2016, the mean value of TC-related anomalous westerlies (5.41 m s
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) is 1.81 times that without TC occurrence (2.99 m s
   <span class="sup">−1</span>), and this ratio holds regardless of whether it is an El Niño developing year. This suggests that the enhancement of westerly winds related to TCs is independent of El Niño occurrence. The westerly anomalies associated with TC occurrence shift northward as TCs move northward. The range of latitudes of anomalous westerlies affected by TCs reach 5°−10° south of the TC centre. The regional meridionally averaged zonal wind anomalies on the southern flanks of TCs in 2015 are shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>. There are stronger anomalous westerlies when TCs are present. The mean value of TC-related anomalous westerlies (4.94 m s
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) is 2.66 times that without TC occurrence (1.86 m s
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) from 1970 to 2016, and this ratio changes little in El Niño developing years. In addition, the centres of strong TC-related westerly anomalies shift westward as TCs move westward. Because the low-pressure zones resulting from TC genesis do not vanish immediately as the TC moves away
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interannual climatic effect of the WNP ACE on El Niño</div>
  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On interannual timescale, at 850 hPa (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>), WNP TCs can lead to anomalous westerlies over 0°–10°N in the tropical western–central Pacific. This might result from tropical semi-geostrophic adjustment processes (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6a</a>), as more intense WNP TCs lead to a broad area of low pressure in the WNP, and the centre of significant zonal wind anomalies is located south of the selected ACE region (this centre is consistent with the main effect of the mean WNP TC genesis position at 12.07°N, 155.36°E). The anomalous westerlies increase the Niño-3.4 SST anomalies. At 200 hPa (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>), anomalous easterlies resulting from TCs occur from 10°N to 10°S, which do not seem to conform to the ACE locations. The main reason for this is a Hadley-like circulation (20°N−20°S, 135°−170°E) enhanced by the TCs (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3f</a>) on the basis of tropical semi-geostrophic adjustment processes at 200 hPa (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6b</a>). Anomalous northerlies south of the equator enhance the symmetry of the wind field in the upper troposphere with respect to the equator (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6c</a>), intensifying the anomalous upper easterlies over the tropical Pacific. Both the direct effect of asymmetrical anomalous westerlies at lower levels and the indirect effect of the Hadley-like circulation weaken the Walker circulation (5°N−5°S, 120°E−120°W; the Walker index changes from –5.47 to –3.84 m s
   <span class="sup">−1</span>; see Methods) over the equatorial region in J–A–S, further enhancing the equatorial Pacific eastward-flowing currents (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6d</a>), and thereby increasing the Niño-3.4 SST anomalies. The eastward-flowing currents are located north of the equator in J–A–S, which is consistent with lower-level anomalous westerlies. The ACE leads the lower-level westerlies (Walker circulation) in the tropical western–central Pacific by 2 (3) months regardless of whether the proceeding westerlies (Walker circulation) or their simultaneous signals are removed (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). This lead–lag correlation between the ACE and circulation is in accordance with that between the ACE and N3.4 (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Through the effect on the Walker circulation, the Niño-3.4 SST anomalies associated with TCs are strongest after 3 months.
  </p>
  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The evolution of the horizontal wind anomalies is also examined (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8a−c</a>). Compared with the situation in J–A–S, the significant anomalous westerlies related to TCs at 850 hPa shift eastward and become symmetric about the equator in O–N–D, and are accompanied by a significantly weakened Walker circulation. At the upper tropospheric level, the centre of significant anomalous easterlies also shifts eastward. All these effects enhance the eastward-flowing currents, and the centre of the eastward-flowing currents shifts equatorward in O–N–D (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8d</a>), and the Niño-3.4 SST anomalies significantly increase.
  </p>
  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another possible mechanism is the change in thermocline depth associated with WNP TCs. In J–A–S, TCs can shallow the tropical western Pacific thermocline (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). Agreeing with theory, the observed thermocline is shallowed via Ekman pumping associated with the downdrafts over 0°−10°S. However, there are updrafts over 5°−10°N, so theoretically the thermocline in these latitudes should deepen, contrary to what is actually found. One possible reason for this discrepancy is that wind forcing related to TCs excites or amplifies Kelvin waves, further affecting tropical thermocline adjustments
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span>. Another is TC turbulent mixing processes, in which strong surface TC winds cool the surface and warm the subsurface waters
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
   </span>. This vertical mixing might have a thermodynamic effect on wave formation. Warm water in the tropical western Pacific is carried eastward, in association with enhanced eastward-propagating equatorial Kelvin waves, further deepening the tropical eastern Pacific thermocline and thereby reducing the equatorial Pacific zonal thermocline gradient (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>). Due to the weakened Walker circulation, the thermocline at 5°S−15°N in the tropical western Pacific is shallower and flatter in O–N–D than in J–A–S, and the equatorial Pacific zonal thermocline gradient becomes smaller (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b, d</a>), as the Niño-3.4 SST anomalies become stronger. To further investigate the ocean-process effects of WNP ACE on El Niño, the depth–zonal distribution of monthly equatorial potential temperature anomalies averaged between 5°S−5°N during the El Niño developing year is shown in Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>. At the beginning of the year, the positive potential temperature anomalies begin to emerge in the western Pacific and then propagate eastward along the main thermocline and accumulate in the equatorial eastern Pacific. From June, the negative potential temperature anomalies grow in the western Pacific because of the eastward transport of warm surface water and upward compensation by cold water, which further enhances positive potential temperature anomalies in the equatorial eastern Pacific by transporting warm surface water. After removing the simultaneous TC signals (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>), this change in the potential temperature anomalies decreases, and can even disappear, particularly during the WNP TC season (May–October; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). In addition, when the proceeding ACE signal is removed, the potential temperature anomalies also decrease, and can even disappear, particularly in the 3 months after the TC season (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>). All the studied observations indicate that WNP TCs can enhance the transport of warm water from the equatorial western-to-eastern Pacific, thus increasing the Niño-3.4 SST anomalies.

The lead–lag correlation between WNP ACE and SST is largely unaffected by removal of the MJO signal, and the magnitude of the correlation coefficient only changes slightly (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11</a>). When compared with the original time series, the intensity of N3.4 changes only slightly by removing the MJO signal. This is also true for the WNP ACE. In addition, the intensity of the N3.4 related to the preceding ACE (after removing the MJO signal) is also only slightly changed (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12</a>). Thus, the MJO signal might only slightly affect the modulation of TCs to ENSO intensity on the interannual timescale. In addition, all three types of the MJO conditions (active MJO, inactive MJO, and non-MJO events) occur in J–A–S during eight studied El Niño developing years (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">13</a>). There are no significant differences among the occurrence frequency of the three types, and the non-MJO events occur most often, particularly in July (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). This suggests that the modulation of TCs to El Niño intensity on an interannual timescale has few dependencies on the MJO conditions. To further verify this conclusion, hit rates (see Methods) between ACE and MJO events in El Niño developing years and a composite year are investigated. Monthly hit rates remain low for both individual years and the composite year (21.8% for July, 35.4% for August and 30.8% for September), except for 2015. Results indicate the MJO does not play a major role in modulating TCs to El Niño intensity.

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a La Niña event, the key domain of the preceding WNP TCs changes to 10°−25°N, 130°−155°E and WNP TCs have a negative effect on La Niña (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">14</a>). The greater the WNP ACE, the weaker the La Niña. Based on the possible physical mechanisms that relate the preceding WNP TCs to ENSO, a new physics-based empirical model for ENSO (the ACE + N3.4 model) is constructed. The predicted skill of the ACE + N3.4 model for ENSO is assessed by comparison with single-factor models (N3.4 model and ACE model), current dynamics and statistical models.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A holdout method (see Methods) is first employed and the N3.4 predicted by models is compared with observations. There is a high correlation coefficient (~0.91) and sign consistency (92%) between the observed N3.4 and that predicted by the ACE + N3.4 model, much higher than for the single-factor N3.4 model (correlation coefficient of 0.75, sign consistency of 79%) and ACE model (correlation coefficient of 0.66, sign consistency of 65%) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7a</a>). The root mean square error (RMSE) between the observed N3.4 and that predicted by the ACE + N3.4 model is 0.39°C, which is smaller than that for the N3.4 model (0.58°C) and the ACE model (0.68°C). These results indicate that the ACE + N3.4 model has better prediction skill for N3.4 than single-factor models. Because the ACE model has the lowest prediction skill, we only consider the ACE + N3.4 model and the N3.4 model in further analyses of El Niño and La Niña events. The N3.4 predicted by the ACE + N3.4 model is closer to observations than that predicted by the N3.4 model during the development periods of El Niño and La Niña events (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7c, e</a>). The peak N3.4 index obtained with the N3.4 model occurs 3 months after the peak in the observations, while the predictions by the ACE + N3.4 model peak at the same time as the observations. The maximum relative advantage of the ACE + N3.4 model for N3.4 relative to the N3.4 model is about 0.62°C in November during the El Niño developing year. This value of the maximum relative advantage is about 43% of the observed anomaly in November. Although the predicted advantage of the ACE + N3.4 model relative to the N3.4 model for N3.4 in other months is smaller than in November, the proportion of the relative advantage in observations in some months might be higher than in November, such as in April, May, June and July. The relative predicted advantage of the ACE + N3.4 model is also evident during the La Niña developing year, with a maximum of nearly 0.48 °C in December; this value of maximum relative advantage is about 50% of the observed value. This proportion might be higher in October and November. The predictions by the ACE + N3.4 and N3.4 models are similar during the decaying periods of both types of event, because there are few TCs in this period. To evaluate further the predicted ability, a running holdout method is employed. The prediction skill of the ACE + N3.4 model for N3.4 is better than that with the holdout method (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7b</a>). It does not seem to be very different. The predicted N3.4 from July to December closely approximates observations because of the TC contribution (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">15</a>). The ACE + N3.4 model also shows better predicted ability for ENSO than the N3.4 model, especially during the development periods of El Niño and La Niña events (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7d, f</a>). This predicted ability does not change with the selection of the training period (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">16</a>); the mean correlation coefficient between predicted and observed N3.4 is 0.912 and the mean RMSE is 0.376 °C. This verifies the stability of the ACE + N3.4 model.

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model prediction skills for ENSO are compared for the ACE + N3.4 model, 18 dynamical models and eight current statistical models. For the whole year, the N3.4 predicted by the ACE + N3.4 model shows a high correlation (~0.92; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a</a>) and low RMSE (~0.35 °C; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8b</a>) with observations at a lead time of 2 months (see Methods). The correlation coefficient (~0.91) and RMSE (~0.35 °C) between the average skill level of dynamical models and observed N3.4 are nearly equivalent to those from the ACE + N3.4 model, but the current statistical models clearly show a predicted disadvantage relative to the ACE + N3.4 model; the average correlation coefficient between prediction and observations is ~0.88 and the RMSE is ~0.42 °C. For the period July−December, the N3.4 predicted by the ACE + N3.4 model shows a higher correlation coefficient (~0.94; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8c</a>) and lower RMSE (~0.32 °C; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8d</a>) than the average for both the dynamical models (correlation coefficient of ~0.91, RMSE of ~0.40 °C) and pre-existing statistical models (correlation coefficient of ~0.90, RMSE of ~0.47 °C). However, for the period January−June, the ACE + N3.4 model shows a predictability barrier, with its prediction skill for N3.4 being close to the average skill of the pre-existing statistical models (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8e, f</a>). This might be related to the WNP TC genesis season, as there are few TCs in this period, which further verifies the importance of TCs in ENSO forecasts. El Niño and La Niña events are also examined. Compared with the average prediction skill for current dynamical models (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9a, b</a>), the ACE + N3.4 model has a higher prediction skill for ENSO intensity during the ENSO developing period. Both the N3.4 predicted by the ACE + N3.4 model and the observed N3.4 show a peak at the same time, while the peaks of average predictions from current dynamical models lag the observations. This predicted advantage of the ACE + N3.4 model for ENSO is more evident when compared with the average prediction skill for current statistical models (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">17</a>). The unexpected halt of N3.4 growth in 2014 and the development of an extreme El Niño in 2015 have attracted much research interest
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
   </span>. Here, the predicted N3.4 values in 2014/2015 are shown. Unlike most of the current dynamical and statistical models, the ACE + N3.4 model does not show the El Niño signal before October in 2014 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9c</a>) because of the anomalous absence of the preceding TCs (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">18a</a>). In 2014, the WNP ACE is far below the average ACE level during El Niño events, and is even close to the average WNP ACE during La Niña events. The N3.4 predicted by the ACE model closely follows the variations in the observations after February of that year (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">18b</a>). In 2015, the ACE + N3.4 model successfully predicts El Niño intensity close to the observations because the preceding WNP ACE in 2015 was well above the average ACE level of El Niño events. During the 2015 El Niño developing period, the ACE + N3.4 model shows even some predicted advantage relative to the average skill of the dynamical models.
