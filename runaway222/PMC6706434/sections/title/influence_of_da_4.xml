 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taking the year 2015 as an example, as shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>, daily strong westerly (easterly) anomalies are found on the southern (northern) flanks of TCs. From 1970 to 2016, the mean value of TC-related anomalous westerlies (5.41 m s
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) is 1.81 times that without TC occurrence (2.99 m s
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), and this ratio holds regardless of whether it is an El Niño developing year. This suggests that the enhancement of westerly winds related to TCs is independent of El Niño occurrence. The westerly anomalies associated with TC occurrence shift northward as TCs move northward. The range of latitudes of anomalous westerlies affected by TCs reach 5°−10° south of the TC centre. The regional meridionally averaged zonal wind anomalies on the southern flanks of TCs in 2015 are shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>. There are stronger anomalous westerlies when TCs are present. The mean value of TC-related anomalous westerlies (4.94 m s
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) is 2.66 times that without TC occurrence (1.86 m s
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) from 1970 to 2016, and this ratio changes little in El Niño developing years. In addition, the centres of strong TC-related westerly anomalies shift westward as TCs move westward. Because the low-pressure zones resulting from TC genesis do not vanish immediately as the TC moves away
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>, a TC’s influence on anomalous westerlies remains after the TC moves away or disappears (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). These features indicate that TC occurrence intensifies the westerly anomalies on the southern flanks of TCs. Anomalous wind forcing related to TCs excites or amplifies Kelvin waves, further affecting the Niño-3.4 SST anomalies
