 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a La Niña event, the key domain of the preceding WNP TCs changes to 10°−25°N, 130°−155°E and WNP TCs have a negative effect on La Niña (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">14</a>). The greater the WNP ACE, the weaker the La Niña. Based on the possible physical mechanisms that relate the preceding WNP TCs to ENSO, a new physics-based empirical model for ENSO (the ACE + N3.4 model) is constructed. The predicted skill of the ACE + N3.4 model for ENSO is assessed by comparison with single-factor models (N3.4 model and ACE model), current dynamics and statistical models.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A holdout method (see Methods) is first employed and the N3.4 predicted by models is compared with observations. There is a high correlation coefficient (~0.91) and sign consistency (92%) between the observed N3.4 and that predicted by the ACE + N3.4 model, much higher than for the single-factor N3.4 model (correlation coefficient of 0.75, sign consistency of 79%) and ACE model (correlation coefficient of 0.66, sign consistency of 65%) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7a</a>). The root mean square error (RMSE) between the observed N3.4 and that predicted by the ACE + N3.4 model is 0.39°C, which is smaller than that for the N3.4 model (0.58°C) and the ACE model (0.68°C). These results indicate that the ACE + N3.4 model has better prediction skill for N3.4 than single-factor models. Because the ACE model has the lowest prediction skill, we only consider the ACE + N3.4 model and the N3.4 model in further analyses of El Niño and La Niña events. The N3.4 predicted by the ACE + N3.4 model is closer to observations than that predicted by the N3.4 model during the development periods of El Niño and La Niña events (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7c, e</a>). The peak N3.4 index obtained with the N3.4 model occurs 3 months after the peak in the observations, while the predictions by the ACE + N3.4 model peak at the same time as the observations. The maximum relative advantage of the ACE + N3.4 model for N3.4 relative to the N3.4 model is about 0.62°C in November during the El Niño developing year. This value of the maximum relative advantage is about 43% of the observed anomaly in November. Although the predicted advantage of the ACE + N3.4 model relative to the N3.4 model for N3.4 in other months is smaller than in November, the proportion of the relative advantage in observations in some months might be higher than in November, such as in April, May, June and July. The relative predicted advantage of the ACE + N3.4 model is also evident during the La Niña developing year, with a maximum of nearly 0.48 °C in December; this value of maximum relative advantage is about 50% of the observed value. This proportion might be higher in October and November. The predictions by the ACE + N3.4 and N3.4 models are similar during the decaying periods of both types of event, because there are few TCs in this period. To evaluate further the predicted ability, a running holdout method is employed. The prediction skill of the ACE + N3.4 model for N3.4 is better than that with the holdout method (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7b</a>). It does not seem to be very different. The predicted N3.4 from July to December closely approximates observations because of the TC contribution (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">15</a>). The ACE + N3.4 model also shows better predicted ability for ENSO than the N3.4 model, especially during the development periods of El Niño and La Niña events (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7d, f</a>). This predicted ability does not change with the selection of the training period (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">16</a>); the mean correlation coefficient between predicted and observed N3.4 is 0.912 and the mean RMSE is 0.376 °C. This verifies the stability of the ACE + N3.4 model.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model prediction skills for ENSO are compared for the ACE + N3.4 model, 18 dynamical models and eight current statistical models. For the whole year, the N3.4 predicted by the ACE + N3.4 model shows a high correlation (~0.92; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a</a>) and low RMSE (~0.35 °C; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8b</a>) with observations at a lead time of 2 months (see Methods). The correlation coefficient (~0.91) and RMSE (~0.35 °C) between the average skill level of dynamical models and observed N3.4 are nearly equivalent to those from the ACE + N3.4 model, but the current statistical models clearly show a predicted disadvantage relative to the ACE + N3.4 model; the average correlation coefficient between prediction and observations is ~0.88 and the RMSE is ~0.42 °C. For the period July−December, the N3.4 predicted by the ACE + N3.4 model shows a higher correlation coefficient (~0.94; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8c</a>) and lower RMSE (~0.32 °C; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8d</a>) than the average for both the dynamical models (correlation coefficient of ~0.91, RMSE of ~0.40 °C) and pre-existing statistical models (correlation coefficient of ~0.90, RMSE of ~0.47 °C). However, for the period January−June, the ACE + N3.4 model shows a predictability barrier, with its prediction skill for N3.4 being close to the average skill of the pre-existing statistical models (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8e, f</a>). This might be related to the WNP TC genesis season, as there are few TCs in this period, which further verifies the importance of TCs in ENSO forecasts. El Niño and La Niña events are also examined. Compared with the average prediction skill for current dynamical models (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9a, b</a>), the ACE + N3.4 model has a higher prediction skill for ENSO intensity during the ENSO developing period. Both the N3.4 predicted by the ACE + N3.4 model and the observed N3.4 show a peak at the same time, while the peaks of average predictions from current dynamical models lag the observations. This predicted advantage of the ACE + N3.4 model for ENSO is more evident when compared with the average prediction skill for current statistical models (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">17</a>). The unexpected halt of N3.4 growth in 2014 and the development of an extreme El Niño in 2015 have attracted much research interest
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>. Here, the predicted N3.4 values in 2014/2015 are shown. Unlike most of the current dynamical and statistical models, the ACE + N3.4 model does not show the El Niño signal before October in 2014 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9c</a>) because of the anomalous absence of the preceding TCs (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">18a</a>). In 2014, the WNP ACE is far below the average ACE level during El Niño events, and is even close to the average WNP ACE during La Niña events. The N3.4 predicted by the ACE model closely follows the variations in the observations after February of that year (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">18b</a>). In 2015, the ACE + N3.4 model successfully predicts El Niño intensity close to the observations because the preceding WNP ACE in 2015 was well above the average ACE level of El Niño events. During the 2015 El Niño developing period, the ACE + N3.4 model shows even some predicted advantage relative to the average skill of the dynamical models.
