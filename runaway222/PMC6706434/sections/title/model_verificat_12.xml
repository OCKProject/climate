The horizontal wind is obtained by simultaneous regression with respect to the corresponding factor. Then, the discrepancy between the observed and simulated SST anomalies is corrected. Finally, the simulated SST anomalies after correction are employed to predict SST anomalies 3-months later in the model. Using TCs as an example, we first obtain the 925-hPa horizontal wind related to TCs by simultaneously regressing ACE on wind. We obtain the simulated SST anomalies by taking the 925-hPa horizontal wind related to TCs as an initial forcing. Then, the discrepancy between the observed and simulated SST anomalies is corrected. Finally, the simulated SST anomalies after correcting for errors are employed to predict SST anomalies 3 months later in the model.
