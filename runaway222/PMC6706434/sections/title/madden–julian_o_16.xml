  </div>1 defines MJO events, with others considered to be non-MJO events. A MJO is divided into eight phases. Generally, TCs in the WNP are readily generated in phases 4−7, as the convective centre propagates into the Pacific. In contrast, TC genesis is suppressed in phases 8 and 1−3 when the convective centre is located in the Indian Ocean
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. As a result, MJO events are divided into active (phases 4−7) and inactive (phases 8 and 1−3) MJO events. The hit rate is the ratio of days in which the anomalous ACE corresponds to the MJO event type (i.e. positive ACE during active MJO events and negative ACE during inactive MJO events).
