 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the model comparison, the lead time is defined by the number of months difference between the latest available observed data and the middle of the running 3-month hindcasting target period. For example, if the latest available observed data are through January, a prediction for the January–March season has a lead time of 1 month, and for February–April a lead of 2 months. Hence, in our research we mainly compare model hindcasting results at a lead of 2 months. Typically, new predictions become available one to two weeks following the last available month of observed data
