  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. In modern times, &gt;30% of TCs worldwide occur in the western North Pacific (WNP), resulting in enormous societal impacts on littoral regions. More TCs tend to be generated in the southeastern WNP
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> during El Niño developing years (see Methods). However, the effect of TCs on El Niño intensity has not been examined on interannual timescales. The motivation of this study is to explore the role of the southeastern (10°−20°N, 135°−170°E) WNP TC (in short, WNP TC) activity in El Niño events from the perspective of accumulated cyclone energy (ACE)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. We also consider whether TC activity can be used for ENSO forecasting. Good prediction skill will provide powerful evidence for the role of WNP TCs in ENSO.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current study demonstrates that the ACE index in the region (10°−20°N, 135°−170°E; hereafter WNP ACE) leads the Niño-3.4 index (N3.4) by about 3 months, as deduced from observations and an intermediate-complexity coupled ocean–atmosphere model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. WNP TCs in July–September (J–A–S) can significantly intensify El Niño in October–December (O–N–D); and the greater the ACE, the stronger the El Niño. WNP TCs weaken significantly the Walker circulation by stressing lower-level anomalous westerlies over 0°−10°N in the tropical western–central Pacific and generating a Hadley-like circulation in the tropical western Pacific. TCs also shallow the tropical western Pacific thermocline and enhance eastward-propagating Kelvin waves, resulting in a significant decrease of zonal thermocline gradient in the equatorial Pacific. Consequently, El Niño is intensified. In same way, La Niña is weakened; and the greater the ACE, the weaker the La Niña. In addition, this study constructs a new physics-based empirical model (the ACE + N3.4 model) for ENSO. This new model is significantly better than the current dynamical and statistical models for predicting ENSO intensity from July to December and addressing the target period slippage of ENSO as it predicts ENSO maxima closer to the time they are actually observed. The ACE + N3.4 model can successfully predict the intensity of extreme El Niño in 2015, and it does not show any El Niño signal before October in 2014, instead of a strong or even extreme El Niño to occur later in 2014 as many models’ prediction.
