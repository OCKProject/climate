  </span> indicated the MJO plays an important role in the onset of El Niño and can also affect WNP TC activity on intraseasonal timescale. Hence, the role of the MJO in the modulation of TCs to the El Niño intensity is investigated. The lead–lag correlation between WNP ACE and SST is largely unaffected by removal of the MJO signal, and the magnitude of the correlation coefficient only changes slightly (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11</a>). When compared with the original time series, the intensity of N3.4 changes only slightly by removing the MJO signal. This is also true for the WNP ACE. In addition, the intensity of the N3.4 related to the preceding ACE (after removing the MJO signal) is also only slightly changed (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12</a>). Thus, the MJO signal might only slightly affect the modulation of TCs to ENSO intensity on the interannual timescale. In addition, all three types of the MJO conditions (active MJO, inactive MJO, and non-MJO events) occur in J–A–S during eight studied El Niño developing years (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">13</a>). There are no significant differences among the occurrence frequency of the three types, and the non-MJO events occur most often, particularly in July (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). This suggests that the modulation of TCs to El Niño intensity on an interannual timescale has few dependencies on the MJO conditions. To further verify this conclusion, hit rates (see Methods) between ACE and MJO events in El Niño developing years and a composite year are investigated. Monthly hit rates remain low for both individual years and the composite year (21.8% for July, 35.4% for August and 30.8% for September), except for 2015. Results indicate the MJO does not play a major role in modulating TCs to El Niño intensity.
