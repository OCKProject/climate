 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, the feedback of WNP TCs on ENSO on interannual timescale is examined using observational data over several decades, revealing that WNP TCs can significantly intensify Niño-3.4 SST 3 months later, particularly for J–A–S TCs. This modulation has few dependencies on the MJO. WNP TCs in J–A–S can affect both the atmospheric and oceanic processes that drive the O–N–D ENSO, which differs from the early Pliocene epoch

  </span>. As shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig10">10</a>, WNP TCs can weaken the Walker circulation via direct effects of equatorial asymmetrically anomalous westerlies at lower tropospheric levels and indirect effects of Hadley-like circulation. TCs can shallow the thermocline in the tropical Western Pacific. Warm water in the tropical Western Pacific is carried eastward, in association with the enhanced eastward-propagating equatorial Kelvin waves, further deepening the thermocline in the tropical eastern Pacific, thereby reducing the gradient of the zonal thermocline in the equatorial Pacific. These two processes lead to an intensified El Niño or weakened La Niña. The greater the WNP ACE, the stronger (weaker) the El Niño (La Niña). Secondly, a new physics-based empirical model (the ACE + N3.4 model) has been constructed based on the preceding ACE and N3.4. Compared with current dynamical and statistical models, the ACE + N3.4 model, although very simple, gives a significantly better ENSO intensity forecast, especially for June−December during the developing period of ENSO. Moreover, the peak N3.4 predicted by current dynamical and statistical models lags the observations (the target period slippage of ENSO

  </span>), but for the ACE + N3.4 model the predictions and observations peak at the same time. The TC genesis season in the WNP directly affects the forecasting ability of the ACE + N3.4 model. The predictions of the ACE + N3.4 model also provide powerful evidence that TCs are essential to ENSO development and can significantly improve the prediction skill for ENSO intensity.

    <p>Schematic diagram of the modulation of running 3-month mean SST intensity for the Niño 3.4 region (5°N−5°S, 120°−170°W) by tropical cyclones (TCs) over the western North Pacific. Walker circulation (light blue circle) is weakened by the direct effect of asymmetrically anomalous westerlies within 0°−10°N (light blue thick arrows) related with TCs (TC symbol) at lower tropospheric levels and by the indirect effect of the Hadley-like circulation (red circle) over the tropical western Pacific. Red (blue) heavy arrows indicate updrafts (downdrafts). Moreover, TCs can shallow the thermocline (red dashed curve) in the tropical western Pacific (pink curve indicates the thermocline without TCs and blue solid line the climatological thermocline). Enhanced eastward-propagating equatorial Kelvin waves (red wavy arrow, pink wavy arrow indicates the Kelvin wave without TCs) carries warm water eastward, further deepening the thermocline in the tropical eastern Pacific, thereby reducing the gradient of the zonal thermocline in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Both effects intensify (weaken) the El Niño (La Niña). Black arrows represent the changing direction of the thermocline</p>

  </span> also found this SST-lagged signal using ACE lag correlations (July−October) with Niño indices for different seasons, but the maximum correlation between the ACE and N3.4 occurs when N3.4 leads ACE in their study. Thus, they suggested that ACE leads N3.4 primarily because of the autocorrelation of SST anomalies in the Niño-3.4 region, and that TCs only play a small positive role in ENSO dynamics. To examine this result, we further investigate the relationship between the ACE in the key domain (10°−20°N, 135°−170°E) from July to October and the seasonal N3.4 during 1970−2016 and 1970−2002 (the latter is the period used in Camargo and Sobel’s work). Results indicate that the correlation between ACE from July to October and the seasonal N3.4 reaches a maximum when ACE leads N3.4. Our aforementioned analysis indicates that TCs play an important role in the intensity of ENSO. Therefore, our current finding is evidently different from that of Camargo and Sobel.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the primary focus here is on the feedback of WNP TC occurrence on ENSO, other related topics warrant further investigation. For example, the effect of the MJO and other factors on TC genesis and the causality associated with the influence of WNP TCs on Hadley-like circulations and tropical westerlies still need to be further verified in a fully coupled model. Previous studies

  </span> have provided fundamental insights into simulating climatic TCs in a fully coupled model, but were restricted to TC climatic distributions (or to accumulated TCs). Currently, fully coupled models that perform well in simulating interannual variabilities of both TC activity and El Niño are rare, and remain an important challenge for researchers. In general, although TC activity is usually considered a synoptic event, the cumulative effect of TCs can provide a significant cross-scale feedback to the large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulations that then affects the intensity of ENSO. TC activity thus help to improve ENSO forecasts. How this under-investigated relationship between TCs and ENSO is incorporated into existing forecasting models still needs to be determined. In addition, these results highlight the need for further study of the cross-scale effect of short-timescale events on long-timescale events. Perhaps the cumulative effect of TCs in other basins (e.g. hurricanes over the North Atlantic) affects intraseasonal or longer-timescale climatic events in other regions by modulating the large-scale dynamic processes. The cumulative effect may be a critical link between synoptic and climatic events. If this cumulative effect of short-term events can be reproduced well in the existing forecasting models, the prediction skill of models would be improved. Furthermore, we can also apply this cumulative effect to cross-scale studies in other disciplines. For example, in oceanography, it may deepen our understanding of the inverse energy cascade from mesoscale eddies to large-scale circulation. All these aspects belong to the category of cross-scale dynamics, which deserves further in-depth study.
