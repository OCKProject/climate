 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The period from 1970.01 to 1999.12 is defined as the base period. The anomalies of N3.4 and ACE in the model are calculated relative to the base period. Standardized anomalies are then calculated on the basis of the length of the chosen period. All ENSO events (no restrictions on intensity) during the hindcasting period are selected for analysis.</p>
