  <p>Temporal correlation and root mean square error (RMSE, °C) between predictions and observations from 2002 to 2016, as a function of lead time. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Correlation coefficient for all months combined. Each line represents one model. Eighteen dynamical models (thin dashed lines with circles), eight statistical models (thin solid lines with asterisks), the N3.4 model (black thick line with dots) and the ACE + N3.4 model (red thick line with dots) are employed. The blue (turquoise) thick line with dots denotes the average of the dynamical (statistical) models. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Same as 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, but for RMSE (°C). 
   <span class="bold">c</span> Same as 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, but for July–December. 
   <span class="bold">d</span> Same as 
   <span class="bold">c</span>, but for RMSE. 
   <span class="bold">e</span> Same as 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, but for January–June. 
   <span class="bold">f</span> Same as
