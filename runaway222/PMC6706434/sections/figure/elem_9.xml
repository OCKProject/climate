  <p>Schematic diagram of the modulation of running 3-month mean SST intensity for the Niño 3.4 region (5°N−5°S, 120°−170°W) by tropical cyclones (TCs) over the western North Pacific. Walker circulation (light blue circle) is weakened by the direct effect of asymmetrically anomalous westerlies within 0°−10°N (light blue thick arrows) related with TCs (TC symbol) at lower tropospheric levels and by the indirect effect of the Hadley-like circulation (red circle) over the tropical western Pacific. Red (blue) heavy arrows indicate updrafts (downdrafts). Moreover, TCs can shallow the thermocline (red dashed curve) in the tropical western Pacific (pink curve indicates the thermocline without TCs and blue solid line the climatological thermocline). Enhanced eastward-propagating equatorial Kelvin waves (red wavy arrow, pink wavy arrow indicates the Kelvin wave without TCs) carries warm water eastward, further deepening the thermocline in the tropical eastern Pacific, thereby reducing the gradient of the zonal thermocline in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Both effects intensify (weaken) the El Niño (La Niña). Black arrows represent the changing direction of the thermocline</p>
