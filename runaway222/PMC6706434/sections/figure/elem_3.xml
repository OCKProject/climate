The blue dashed line indicates the original thermocline; the red line associated with the preceding WNP ACE signal in J–A–S, and the thicker line indicates significance above the 95% confidence level. An El Niño developing year is defined when the above-moderate El Niño events (including moderate events) develops from weak to strong
