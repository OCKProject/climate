  <p>Wind anomalies and circulation associated with the accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) anomalies over the western North Pacific (10°–20°N, 135°–170°E; WNP). 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Latitude–time Hovmöller diagram (along 135°–170°E) of zonal wind anomalies (shading, m s
   <span class="sup">–1</span>) in 2015. Black contours indicate the 1 m
   <span class="sup">2</span> s
   <span class="sup">–2</span> isoline of WNP ACE, representing the TC life cycle. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> As in 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, but for longitude–time (along 0°–15°N). 
   <span class="bold">c</span> Composite time series of zonal wind anomalies (m s
   <span class="sup">–1</span>) on the southern flank (within 5° of lon
   <sub>0</sub>, and within 10° south of lat
   <sub>0</sub>; lon
   <sub>0</sub> and lat
   <sub>0</sub> indicate the longitude and latitude of the TC genesis position, respectively) of single TC genesis in the period 1970–2016. Black (red) line indicates the wind anomalies with (without) the contribution of the Niño-3.4 SST. 
   <span class="bold">d</span> Composite of the 850-hPa zonal (shading) and horizontal (vectors) wind anomalies (m s
   <span class="sup">–1</span>) in J–A–S associated with the J–A–S WNP ACE during El Niño developing years. An El Niño developing year is defined when the above-moderate El Niño events (including moderate events) develops from weak to strong. Shading and black vectors indicate significance above the 95% confidence level using Student’s 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-test. The two black rectangles denote the selected ACE region (10°–20°N, 135°–170°E) and the Niño-3.4 region (5°S–5°N, 120°–170°W). 
   <span class="bold">e</span> As in 
   <span class="bold">d</span>, but for the 200-hPa level. 
   <span class="bold">f</span> As in 
   <span class="bold">d</span>, but for the vertical 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-velocity (shading, Pa s
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) and the wind (vectors) in the vertical–meridional plane. Vectors are obtained by the zonal wind anomalies (m s
   <span class="sup">–1</span>) and magnified vertical 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-velocity (×(−200))
