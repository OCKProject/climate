  <p>Time series of the running 3-month mean SST anomaly for the Niño 3.4 region (5°N−5°S, 120°−170°W) (N3.4, an ENSO index, °C) for observations and predictions. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Composite time series of N3.4 for all El Niño events in the hindcasting period (2002–2016). The blue dashed line is the average prediction by dynamical models, and the red line the ACE + N3.4 model. The black solid line is the observations. Bars indicate the amplitude of the models’ relative advantage between the average of the dynamical models and the ACE + N3.4 model. Blue (orange) bars represent the advantage of the dynamical models average relative to the ACE + N3.4 model (ACE + N3.4 model relative to dynamical models average). DJF-1 and DJF0 represent the December−February in last year and the year concurring with El Niño, respectively. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Same as 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, but for La Niña. 
   <span class="bold">c</span> Time series (2014–2015) of average N3.4 from dynamical models (blue dashed line), the ACE + N3.4 model (red dashed line), and observations (black solid line)
