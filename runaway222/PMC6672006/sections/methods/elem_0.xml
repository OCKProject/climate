   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). We refer to winter (November–January) SST averaged over the eastern equatorial Pacific (Nino-3.4: 5°S–5°N, 120°–170°W) as the ENSO index
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span>. To determine the major modes of SLP variations, we performed an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of early winter (OND) SLP poleward of the equator. Before the EOF analysis, SLP anomaly data were weighted by the cosine of latitude to ensure that equal areas were afforded equal weight in the analysis. A wave activity flux that represents stationary Rossby wave propagation is based on ref.

   </span>. All regression and correlation analyses are conducted after linear detrending, and the ENSO index is normalised. The significance test used in this study is a standard two-tailed

  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have used the US Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Atmospheric Model version 2.1 (AM2.1) with 24 vertical layers and ~200 km horizontal resolution. Atmospheric model simulation has the distinct advantage that SST and sea ice can be perturbed in a controlled way, to isolate its influence on the atmosphere

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
   </span>. In CTL experiment, the model is forced by climatological SST and sea ice for the period 1958–2015 and integrated for 50 years after 1-year spinup. ATL, ICE and ATL + ICE experiments branch off from CTL at January 1st of each year, thereby comprising 50-member ensembles. SST anomalies in the tropical North Atlantic (0º–30ºN, from the west to east coasts, with 10º linear tapering zones north and south) from January to December and SIC anomalies in the Norwegian and BK Seas (10º–110ºE, from the Eurasian coast to 90ºN, with 10º linear tapering zones east and west) from September to December of ENSO-decay year, obtained as regression anomalies onto ENSO(–1), are superposed to the global climatology for ATL and ICE, respectively, while both anomalies are superposed for ATL + ICE. Each experiment is integrated for 1 year. Radiative forcing is fixed at the 1990 level.

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used AMIP experiment data provided by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) Physical Sciences Division. The experiments chosen apply the observed radiative forcing and specify the observed SSTs under an atmospheric model. Two model ensembles are considered here; a 17-member ensemble with the GFDL AM3 for 1958–2014 and a 16-member ensemble with the ESRL-Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5) for 1958–2015. We have used the ensemble mean anomalies for each model and regressed them onto the ENSO index. We have linearly detrended the data beforehand for consistency with other analyses.</p>
