  <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">El Niño usually develops during summer and autumn, peaks during early winter, and decays through the following spring. El Niño heats also the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans by the tropical tropospheric warming and atmospheric bridges, like a battery charges a capacitor
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>. The persisting tropical Indian Ocean warming affects western Pacific climate like a discharging capacitor during summer when the equatorial Pacific signal of El Niño has dissipated
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span>. Furthermore, this Indian Ocean capacitor effect extends to the following September–November (SON) by maintaining equatorial wave response to isolated heating on the equator
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
   </span> (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Indeed, these atmospheric responses in SON in the decay year of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are distinct from those in the ENSO-developing year (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Here we denote the ENSO index at preceding and subsequent boreal winters as ENSO(–1) and ENSO(0), respectively (the lagged autocorrelation of the ENSO index is close to unity from summer though subsequent winter
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, another atmospheric wave train is found over the North Atlantic and northern Eurasia in SON of ENSO-decay year, which persists into early winter (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Of noteworthy is the lower sea level pressure (SLP) over northern Eurasia, indicating the weakened Siberian high. This leads to Eurasian warming in its southeastern flank through anomalous warm advection and Arctic cooling by anomalous cold advection over the Barents–Kara (BK) Seas
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
   </span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). These features are confirmed in other reanalysis and reconstruction data sets (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The BK sea-ice concentration (SIC) indeed increases during the freezing season following El Niño decay (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>), supporting that BK SIC variability is associated with atmospheric variability
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span>. The correlation between BK SIC and ENSO(–1) is 0.344 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>), significant at the 99% confidence level, while ENSO(0) correlation is close to zero. Although moderate, this significant BK SIC correlation with ENSO(–1) exceeds the persistence of summer BK SIC anomalies in early winter (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>), as the persistence of Arctic sea-ice anomalies dramatically decreases from summer to autumn in only a few months
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
   </span>. In the North Atlantic, SST warms near 60°N, in the tropics, and along the eastern coast of the North Atlantic (Fig.

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Another strong SST cooling is also prominent in the northeast Pacific, with a cyclonic anomaly to the east (Fig.

  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distinct atmospheric and oceanic variations after ENSO dissipation are also supported by an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis (see Methods). Figure 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows the second and third EOF modes (EOF-2 and EOF-3, respectively) of SLP over the Northern Hemisphere in early winter for 1958–2015 (explaining 15.2% and 11.5% of the total variance, respectively). The leading EOF mode represents the Arctic Oscillation, which explains 19.4% (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). The principal component (PC) corresponding to EOF-2 has an upward trend before the 1980s but a downward trend afterwards (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>), intensifying in a negative phase. The EOF-3 resembles the wave-train pattern seen in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>. Although this wave-train pattern has similar long-term changes to the EOF-2 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>), surface air temperature (SAT), SST and SIC anomalies are quite distinct (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). The EOF-2 pattern is related to a Pacific–North America (PNA)-like teleconnection combined with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
   </span>, while the EOF-3 pattern captures Arctic cooling, Eurasian warming and the North Atlantic SST variation as in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>. The PC corresponding to EOF-3 is correlated with ENSO(–1), while EOF-2 is correlated with ENSO(0) (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Although significant, the EOF-3 correlation with ENSO(–1) is moderate, consistent with a view that this anomaly pattern is an atmospheric internal mode whose occurrence is modulated by SST and sea ice anomalies

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SAT variations are tied to upper-level atmospheric circulation. The PNA combined with NAO in the EOF-2 pattern can roughly explain ENSO(0) anomalies (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e, g</a>). The SLP EOF-3 is associated with a Rossby wave train that extends from the tropical North Atlantic towards the Arctic and eastern Eurasia (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2f</a>), resembling the Eurasian teleconnection pattern
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span>. ENSO(–1) also features a similar wave train from the North Atlantic across Eurasia (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2h</a>). The combination of a trough over the BK Seas and a downstream anticyclone leads to Arctic cooling and Eurasian warming. These results demonstrate that the atmospheric circulation response to ENSO(–1) is completely different from that in ENSO(0), and suggest that the Arctic and Eurasian contrasting SAT anomalies are associated with ENSO(–1) and BK sea ice anomalies through the atmospheric circulation anomalies.

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although POGA successfully reproduces the lingering tropical Atlantic warming and its influence on the extra-tropics, a possibility remains that the extratropical North Pacific SST anomalies, which are stronger than in observations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>), are the driver of the Eurasian atmospheric circulation. To elucidate the tropical Atlantic role, we simulate atmospheric response to the tropical Atlantic warming in ENSO-decay year using an atmospheric general circulation model (Methods). A control (CTL) experiment consists of a 50-year integration forced by climatological SST and SIC. We have performed a tropical Atlantic (ATL) experiment forced by SST anomalies in the tropical North Atlantic (0°–30°N) in ENSO-decay year superposed on the global climatology. ATL—CTL difference (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>) reproduces the observed Eurasian warming with weakened Siberian high in response to the tropical North Atlantic warming (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>, b). In the upper troposphere, it captures anticyclonic anomalies over Eurasia, but the anomalous Arctic trough is missing (Fig.

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further examine impact of the BK sea ice increase on atmospheric circulation by additional two experiments (ICE and ATL + ICE). They are forced by BK SIC anomalies in ENSO-decay year (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) solely (ICE) and in combination with the tropical North Atlantic SST anomalies as in ATL (ATL + ICE) (see Methods). (ATL + ICE)—CTL difference presents amplified Eurasian warming with Siberian high weakening, producing the observed dipole of Arctic cooling and Eurasian warming (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>) in a comparable magnitude with observations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). The Eurasian warming in ATL + ICE is significantly stronger than in ATL, highlighting an amplifying role by the BK sea ice anomalies. Compared with ATL, the geopotential height response better captures the observed wave train from the tropical Atlantic towards eastern Eurasia via the Arctic (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>). By contrast, ICE—CTL difference shows cooling only over the ice-increased BK Seas and cannot produce the Arctic-Eurasian linkage (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4e, f</a>). Besides, the Arctic cooling in ICE is considerably weaker than in ATL + ICE. This indicates an important contribution of the Siberian high weakening to the Arctic cooling, in support of atmospheric driving of Arctic sea-ice variability

Despite that we do not artificially inflate prescribed SST or SIC anomalies, the Arctic–Eurasian SAT linkage is comparable in magnitude to observations.

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite gradual weakening of the warmer tropical Atlantic condition throughout ENSO-decay year (Fig.

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
   </span>. The increased precipitation over the warm pool is reproduced by ATL + ICE (and also ATL), resulting from the tropical Atlantic SST warming. To the northwest of the increased precipitation, upper-tropospheric anticyclonic anomalies intensify in both observations and model (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>), consistent with the characteristics of a Rossby wave response to enhanced latent heating. The intensified anticyclonic anomalies act as a Rossby wave forcing, propagating the wave activity northeastward, which lead to the Eurasian wave train in early winter (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>). Although the observed wave train appears to propagate from the extratropical North Atlantic (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2h</a>), the enhanced baroclinic atmospheric response over the tropical Atlantic is evident in SON (e.g., Supplementary Fig.

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>), although the response is weaker. We conclude that the coupling between tropical oceans and Arctic sea ice through atmospheric circulation plays a substantial role in Arctic and Eurasian climate linkage.
