 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">El Niño usually develops during summer and autumn, peaks during early winter, and decays through the following spring. El Niño heats also the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans by the tropical tropospheric warming and atmospheric bridges, like a battery charges a capacitor
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. The persisting tropical Indian Ocean warming affects western Pacific climate like a discharging capacitor during summer when the equatorial Pacific signal of El Niño has dissipated
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, this Indian Ocean capacitor effect extends to the following September–November (SON) by maintaining equatorial wave response to isolated heating on the equator
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Indeed, these atmospheric responses in SON in the decay year of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are distinct from those in the ENSO-developing year (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Here we denote the ENSO index at preceding and subsequent boreal winters as ENSO(–1) and ENSO(0), respectively (the lagged autocorrelation of the ENSO index is close to unity from summer though subsequent winter
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, another atmospheric wave train is found over the North Atlantic and northern Eurasia in SON of ENSO-decay year, which persists into early winter (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Of noteworthy is the lower sea level pressure (SLP) over northern Eurasia, indicating the weakened Siberian high. This leads to Eurasian warming in its southeastern flank through anomalous warm advection and Arctic cooling by anomalous cold advection over the Barents–Kara (BK) Seas
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). These features are confirmed in other reanalysis and reconstruction data sets (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The BK sea-ice concentration (SIC) indeed increases during the freezing season following El Niño decay (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>), supporting that BK SIC variability is associated with atmospheric variability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. The correlation between BK SIC and ENSO(–1) is 0.344 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>), significant at the 99% confidence level, while ENSO(0) correlation is close to zero. Although moderate, this significant BK SIC correlation with ENSO(–1) exceeds the persistence of summer BK SIC anomalies in early winter (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>), as the persistence of Arctic sea-ice anomalies dramatically decreases from summer to autumn in only a few months
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. In the North Atlantic, SST warms near 60°N, in the tropics, and along the eastern coast of the North Atlantic (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>), resembling the major mode of the North Atlantic SST variations in autumn and winter
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. In ENSO(0), however, these features including the Arctic SIC increase and the North Atlantic SST pattern are missing (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Another strong SST cooling is also prominent in the northeast Pacific, with a cyclonic anomaly to the east (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), reminiscent of the recent warm blob when the sign is flipped
