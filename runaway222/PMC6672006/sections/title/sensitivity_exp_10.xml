 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have used the US Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Atmospheric Model version 2.1 (AM2.1) with 24 vertical layers and ~200 km horizontal resolution. Atmospheric model simulation has the distinct advantage that SST and sea ice can be perturbed in a controlled way, to isolate its influence on the atmosphere

  </span>. In CTL experiment, the model is forced by climatological SST and sea ice for the period 1958–2015 and integrated for 50 years after 1-year spinup. ATL, ICE and ATL + ICE experiments branch off from CTL at January 1st of each year, thereby comprising 50-member ensembles. SST anomalies in the tropical North Atlantic (0º–30ºN, from the west to east coasts, with 10º linear tapering zones north and south) from January to December and SIC anomalies in the Norwegian and BK Seas (10º–110ºE, from the Eurasian coast to 90ºN, with 10º linear tapering zones east and west) from September to December of ENSO-decay year, obtained as regression anomalies onto ENSO(–1), are superposed to the global climatology for ATL and ICE, respectively, while both anomalies are superposed for ATL + ICE. Each experiment is integrated for 1 year. Radiative forcing is fixed at the 1990 level.
