  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). We refer to winter (November–January) SST averaged over the eastern equatorial Pacific (Nino-3.4: 5°S–5°N, 120°–170°W) as the ENSO index

  </span>. To determine the major modes of SLP variations, we performed an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of early winter (OND) SLP poleward of the equator. Before the EOF analysis, SLP anomaly data were weighted by the cosine of latitude to ensure that equal areas were afforded equal weight in the analysis. A wave activity flux that represents stationary Rossby wave propagation is based on ref.
