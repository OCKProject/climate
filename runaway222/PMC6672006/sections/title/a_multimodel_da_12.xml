 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used AMIP experiment data provided by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) Physical Sciences Division. The experiments chosen apply the observed radiative forcing and specify the observed SSTs under an atmospheric model. Two model ensembles are considered here; a 17-member ensemble with the GFDL AM3 for 1958–2014 and a 16-member ensemble with the ESRL-Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5) for 1958–2015. We have used the ensemble mean anomalies for each model and regressed them onto the ENSO index. We have linearly detrended the data beforehand for consistency with other analyses.</p>
