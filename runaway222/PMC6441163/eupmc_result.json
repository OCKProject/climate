    "BACKGROUND:Accurate and valid measures for implementation constructs are critical to advance research and guide implementation efforts. However, there is a continued need for valid and reliable measures for implementation research. The purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of measures for the Inner Setting domain of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) in a network of pediatric clinics. METHODS:This study used cross-sectional survey data collected from physicians, advanced practice providers, clinic managers, and clinical staff (n = 546) working in a pediatric clinic network (n = 51). Surveys included measures assessing Inner Setting constructs from CFIR (culture, learning climate, leadership engagement, and available resources). We used a series multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models to assess factorial validity. We also examined measure correlations to test discriminant validity and intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC(1) and ICC(2), to assess inter-rater reliability. RESULTS:Factor loadings were high (≥0.60) for all but one of the measurement items. Most CFA models for respective constructs demonstrated adequate or good model fit (CFI > 0.90, TLI > 0.90, RMSEA< 0.08, and SRMR< 0.08). The measures also demonstrated good discriminant validity (correlations< 0.90) aside from some evidence of overlap between leadership engagement and learning climate at the clinic level (0.91). The ICC(1) values ranged from 0.05-0.16 while the ICC(2) values ranged from 0.34-0.67. CONCLUSIONS:The measures demonstrated good validity and adequate reliability with the exception of available resources, which had some evidence of lower than desired reliability and validity at the clinic level. Our findings extend previous work by providing additional psychometric evidence to support the use of these Inner Setting measures in pediatric clinics implementing human papillomavirus programs."
