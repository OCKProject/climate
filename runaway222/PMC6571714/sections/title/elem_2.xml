 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agriculture and food production can damage the environment through extensive pesticide use and expose farmworkers to toxic chemicals that are linked to cancer, birth defects, and neurological damage. Unhealthy processed food has contributed to a large rise in obesity and non-communicable diseases around the world. Industrial meat production is an important contributor to antibiotic resistance, which in Europe causes morbidity and mortality of a similar scale to influenza, tuberculosis, and HIV combined, and is projected to substantially increase healthcare costs over the next decade. Many hospitals contribute to these problems, serving food that causes the same diseases they are treating through its low nutritional quality and unsustainable production methods.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some healthcare organisations are beginning to improve the food they serve their patients and the systems that produce that food. These organisations are treating “food as medicine”— providing prescriptions for fruits and vegetables, teaching cooking classes, and integrating other creative approaches to healthy eating with clinical care. They are also leveraging their purchasing power to support local and sustainable agriculture in the communities they serve, modelling healthy food environments and contributing to healthier food systems and guaranteed markets for sustainable growers (b

  </p>
  <p>The Vienna Hospital Association is a group of 11 hospitals, nine geriatric centres, and six long term care homes in Vienna, Austria. It cares for 400 000 inpatients and 3.5 million outpatients a year and serves 30 000 patient meals a day. As part of Vienna’s green procurement policy, more than 30% of all the ingredients in the food served across the hospital system are organic, and most of this food is sourced from local suppliers. It serves less meat and also provides tap water rather than bottled water.</p>
  <p>The healthcare sector’s food purchasing strategy is embedded in the city’s climate action plan, which requires a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 for products procured. Through this integrated approach, the hospital system is taking better care of its patients, modelling healthy food environments in its facilities, supporting sustainable agriculture in the community, and reducing its climate footprint.
