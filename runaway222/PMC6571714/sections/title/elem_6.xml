 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his 1981 essay, “Solving for Pattern,”
  <a rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref25">25</a> the writer and social and environmental activist Wendell Berry discussed a remarkably similar challenge to the one we currently face in healthcare. He noted that although industrial methods had solved some of the problems of food production, they had produced “side effects” so damaging that they threatened the survival of farming. He proposed that farmers and others focus on a solution that was biological and not industrial—a solution that recognised the planet as an interdependent whole.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Organisations have a responsibility to society and the environment that goes beyond their primary purpose, and the healthcare sector is no different. Given the different ways that healthcare organisations affect health, we should pursue a triple aim of healthy people, living in equitable and resilient communities, on a sustainable planet. The examples presented here show that it is possible.</p>

    <p>The healthcare sector contributes to these harms, undermining its efforts to improve health </p>

    <p>To reverse these harmful effects, healthcare practitioners and organisations must adopt a broader aim of healthy people, living in equitable and resilient communities, on a sustainable planet.</p>
