 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initial testing using the subsample of pixels removed before training revealed that the random forests classification has a classification accuracy of 99.3%. More rigorous evaluation of classification performance was judged by calculating errors of bare ice omission (i.e., bare ice incorrectly classified as snow) and commission (i.e., snow incorrectly classified as bare ice). We evaluated these errors by comparing classified MODIS pixels with coincidently acquired (i.e., same day) Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+, 8 OLI pixels, which were treated as “ground truth” (i.e., zero error) (fig. S3). Bare ice and snow pixels were manually digitized in the higher-resolution satellite imagery between 2001 and 2017 using Google Earth Engine. Manual digitization was undertaken using multiband Landsat L1T composites containing visible and near-infrared bands to improve discrimination between bare ice and snow. To ensure fair consideration of uncertainties, pixels were sampled in close proximity to the snowline. In total, a sample of 133,588 Landsat pixels were obtained. Of these pixels, 61,108 were dedicated to the estimation of omission (i.e., Landsat pixels identified as bare ice), and 72,480 pixels were dedicated to commission (i.e., Landsat pixels identified as snow). When compared to the MODIS classification, we found that errors of bare ice omission were 4.6% and errors of bare ice commission were 0.3%. The higher errors of omission mean that we likely underestimate rather than overestimate bare ice presence, making our bare ice extent and snowline metrics (described in the next paragraphs) conservative (
