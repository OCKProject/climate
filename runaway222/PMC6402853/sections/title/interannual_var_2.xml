 <div class="title">Interannual variations in frequency of summer bare ice exposure around the Greenland Ice Sheet over the study period (2001–2017).</div>
 <p>A value of 1 indicates that bare ice was observed in every non–cloud contaminated summer June, July, and August (JJA) MODIS observation. Satellite-derived bare ice exposure maps were used to delineate the end-of-summer (maximum) snowline elevation (represented by vertical black lines) for each year. (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) Pan-Greenland bare ice exposure averaged over the 2001–2017 study period. Black lines denote the IMBIE sectors used for regional analysis. Numbered labels are as follows: 1, North; 2, Northeast; 3, East; 4, Southeast; 5, South; 6, Southwest; 7, West; and 8, Northwest Greenland. (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) Frequency of bare ice exposure and snowline elevation at Humboldt Glacier, North Greenland. (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) Frequency of bare ice exposure and snowline elevation at Kangerlussuaq Glacier, East Greenland. (
  <span class="bold">D</span>) Frequency of bare ice exposure and snowline elevation across the K-transect of automated weather stations (AWSs) in Southwest Greenland. The location of each transect is displayed in (A). Note that the 
  <span class="italic">x</span>-axis scale is the same for (B) to (D).
