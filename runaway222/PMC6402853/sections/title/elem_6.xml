 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In principle, the current generation of physically based RCMs should capture the contemporary and future strength of the snowline-albedo feedback, since they couple sophisticated multilayer snow models with realistic ice sheet surface topography (

  </a>). However, we find that two RCMs commonly used for forecasting Greenland meltwater runoff [MAR3.9 (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>) and Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO) 2.3p2 (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>)] do not accurately capture maximum snowline elevations and bare ice extent (
  <a rid="F5" ref-type="fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>). In comparison to our remotely sensed bare ice presence metrics, we find that, on average, RACMO2.3p2 underestimates maximum bare ice extent by 6%, while MAR3.9 overestimates by 13% during the 2001–2017 study period (
  <a rid="F5" ref-type="fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5, A and B</a> and fig. S2). Furthermore, we find that these discrepancies are significantly correlated with total summer runoff (
  <a rid="F5" ref-type="fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5, C and D</a>). This suggests that MAR3.9 and RACMO2.3p2 do not sufficiently capture the role of the snowline-albedo feedback during extreme melt years (e.g., 2010, 2012, and 2016). Given that bare ice exposure is a primary control on meltwater production (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>) and that extreme melt events are projected to increase in the future (
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>), the failure of RCMs to accurately predict snowline elevation and bare ice extent during high melt years raises uncertainty in 21st-century forecasts of Greenland’s future runoff contributions to global sea level rise (
  <a rid="F6" ref-type="fig" href="#F6">Fig. 6</a>). Moreover, uncertainty in bare ice extent adds an additional challenge for modeling the spatiotemporal variability of bare ice albedo and its impact on future runoff (

Note that the timing of bare ice exposure is also modeled inaccurately during high melt years (see fig. S2). These discrepancies introduce uncertainties in RCM forecasts of future Greenland runoff contributions to sea level rise.

   <p>Note that both variables are modeled by MAR3.9. The labeled lines indicate the mean end-of-season snowline observed by this study (solid), modeled by RACMO2.3p2 (dotted), and modeled by MAR3.9 (dashed) over the 2001–2017 study period. The strong positive correlation between snowline and runoff indicates that accurate representation of snowlines in climate models is critical for accurate forecasts of Greenland Ice Sheet runoff.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings indicate that future projections of ice sheet runoff by the current generation of semi-empirical models (e.g., positive-degree day or temperature index) must also be treated with caution. These models, which are typically calibrated to RCM-modeled runoff, assume that the strength of melt-albedo feedbacks observed in the past remains constant into the future (
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>). However, since the snowline-albedo feedback is not accurately captured by RCMs and bare ice exposure increases nonlinearly as snowlines rise, this assumption appears unjustified. If semi-empirical models are to be used for forecasts of Greenland’s future contribution to sea level rise, then they should therefore account for the increasing strength of melt-albedo feedbacks, such as that induced by snowline migration.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study quantifies, for the first time, the importance of Greenland’s snowline for amplifying ice sheet melt. We find that snowlines exhibit substantial seasonal and interannual variation and are the dominant control on shortwave energy absorption and meltwater production in the ablation zone. While hydrological and biological processes that darken bare ice also influence shortwave energy absorption and runoff generation, they are secondary to the extent of bare ice exposure associated with snowline fluctuations. Unless offset by enhanced winter accumulation, snowlines will rise to higher elevations in a warmer climate and seasonally amplify melt even more than they presently do because of the hypsometry of the ice sheet. Since bare ice has much lower porosity than snow and firn, rising snowlines will reduce not only ice sheet albedo but also the capacity of the ice sheet to retain meltwater. Furthermore, since bare ice has substantially higher surface roughness than snow, the exposure of bare ice will also increase the rate of turbulent heat transfer from the atmosphere to the ice sheet surface. Improved representation of snowlines and bare ice exposure in climate models is therefore critical for accurately projecting future Greenland Ice Sheet runoff contributions to global sea level rise.</p>
