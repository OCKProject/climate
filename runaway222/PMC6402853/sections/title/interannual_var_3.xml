 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) End-of-season (or maximum) snowline elevation; (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) maximum bare ice extent. Gray shaded areas represent the uncertainty of both metrics (see Materials and Methods). Neither metric exhibits a statistically significant linear trend over the entire study period (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.10), partly owing to low snowline elevation and bare ice extent in 2013 and 2017. However, snowline elevation and bare ice extent increased significantly (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01) between 2001 and 2012, a period of declining albedo on the ice sheet often attributed to hydrological and/or biological processes that darken the ice sheet surface. Relationship between (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) snowline elevation and (
  <span class="bold">D</span>) bare ice extent with mean summer panâ€“Greenland Ice Sheet albedo. Both metrics are significantly correlated, indicating that the area of bare ice exposure and total ice sheet albedo are closely coupled.
