 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We interpolated almost all the missing values (i.e., pixels flagged as cloud) in the MODIS bare ice classification and albedo products from 2001 to 2017 using a gap-filling method. Missing pixels were reclassified on the basis of the value of the same pixel in the antecedent grid. If the same pixel in the antecedent grid was also missing, then the preceding grid was used to reclassify the pixel. This process was repeated incrementally up to 3 days before and after the original grid. The gap filling reduced the fraction of missing pixels from 59 to 0.7%.</p>
