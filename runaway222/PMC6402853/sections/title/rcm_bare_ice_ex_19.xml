 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily bare ice extent was derived from two RCMs commonly used for future projections of Greenland SMB: MAR3.9 (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>) and RACMO2.3p2 (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>). To discriminate between bare ice and snow pixels in RACMO2.3p2, we used an albedo threshold of &lt;0.55. In MAR3.9, bare ice pixels were identified as those with a density between 915 and 925 kg m
  <span class="sup">−3</span> at a depth of 0 cm and an albedo of less than 0.60.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both models were coupled to multilayer, one-dimensional snow models that explicitly simulate surface albedo as a function of snow grain size and impurity content. When snowpack thickness reaches zero, MAR3.9 prescribes an initial bare ice albedo of 0.55, which can decrease depending on the depth of water layer covering the ice to a minimum of 0.35 and increase depending on clouds and solar zenith angle to 0.60. RACMO2.3p2 calculates bare ice albedo as the 5% lowest surface albedo measured by the MODIS 16-day albedo product (MCD43A3) during the 2001–2010 period. The daily bare ice extent maps from the models were used to calculate a summer bare ice presence index in the same way as for the MODIS composite products. To enable comparison between different products, we resampled all products to a 1-km grid using bilinear interpolation. We then clipped all bare ice presence index maps to a common mask based on the GIMP ice mask and calculated the end-of-summer bare ice extent and snowline elevation for each model (fig. S2).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that some approaches for hindcasting Greenland melt and runoff directly incorporate observed albedo from MODIS. For example, the albedo field of HIRHAM5 (
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
   <span class="italic">43</span>
  </a>) is based on de-noised MOD10A1 surface albedo. Both snow and bare ice were therefore observed (i.e. spatially and temporally variable), and HIRHAM5 implicitly captured the strength of the snowline-albedo and bare ice–albedo feedback. By incorporating observed albedo from MODIS, (
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
   <span class="italic">43</span>
  </a>) shows that discrepancies between observed and modeled ice sheet melt and runoff are substantially reduced. However, this approach is not applicable for future projections of Greenland SMB, since observations of surface albedo are not available. Accurate predictions of Greenland’s future meltwater runoff contributions to global sea level are therefore likely to rely on refining snowpack models to more accurately determine the timing of bare ice exposure and associated strength of the snowline-albedo feedback.
