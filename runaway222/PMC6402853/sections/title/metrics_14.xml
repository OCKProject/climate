 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual maximum elevation of the snowline and extent of bare ice were derived from the summer bare ice presence index maps (fig. S5). The annual maximum extent of bare ice is defined as the number of pixels having a bare ice presence index of &gt;0.1. This value was chosen to protect against potentially misclassified pixels and makes the maximum bare ice extent metric conservative. Interannual variations of end-of-summer bare ice extent for the entire ice sheet are presented in 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>. End-of-summer bare ice extent is also provided for each of the eight IMBIE sectors in tables S1 and S2.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual maximum snowline elevation, corresponding to the end-of-summer snowline in alpine glaciology literature, is defined as the 90th percentile of bare ice pixel elevations (i.e., those with a bare ice presence of &gt;0.1) (
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
   <span class="italic">41</span>
  </a>) (fig. S5). The elevation of each pixel was derived from the GIMP digital elevation model (
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
   <span class="italic">37</span>
  </a>). The 90th percentile was chosen to protect against potentially misclassified pixels and makes the end-of-summer snowline metric conservative. We note that the end-of-summer snowline metric is a useful relative summary metric for assessing and conceptualizing interannual changes of bare ice exposure but has limited usefulness as an absolute metric due to strong latitudinal gradients of snowline elevation across the ice sheet (e.g., fig. S5). To account for latitudinal snowline variations, we provided end-of-season snowline elevation for each IMBIE sector in tables S1 and S2.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The uncertainties of both metrics were evaluated by considering the errors of commission (0.3%) and omission (4.6%) in the bare ice classification. By incorporating these uncertainties into our metrics, we find that maximum summer bare ice extent may be overestimated by 790 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> and underestimated by up to 12,103 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. Likewise, the end-of-season snowline may be overestimated by 5 m and underestimated by up to 70 m. We consider these uncertainties when the remotely sensed metrics were compared with similar metrics derived from RCMs.
