 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Greenland Ice Sheet now contributes over 25% of observed global sea level rise, making it the largest single cryospheric contributor(
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>). Its enhanced mass loss over the 21st century (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>) is primarily attributed to increased surface meltwater runoff (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>), of which ~93% derives from the relatively small ablation zone (~22% of the ice sheet area) along the ice sheet margin (
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>). As the winter snowpack melts during the summer, bare glacial ice is exposed in the ablation zone. Since bare ice is both darker and less porous than snow, it absorbs more than twice as much solar radiation and retains less meltwater. Bare ice therefore produces a large proportion (~78%) of Greenland’s total runoff into the ocean (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>), although it is only exposed across a small area of the ice sheet during the summer. Accurately capturing the reduced albedo and full extent of bare ice in climate models is therefore critical for determining Greenland’s current and future runoff contributions to sea level rise (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Representing bare ice albedo and extent in climate models is challenging since both impart nonlinear positive feedbacks between net shortwave radiation and surface melt over seasonal time scales (
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>). A seasonal increase in downward shortwave radiation reduces bare ice albedo through melt processes that darken the ice surface, notably, exposure of dust layers, pooling of surface meltwater, increased interstitial water content, and liquid meltwater–induced growth of pigmented ice algal assemblages that inhabit the bare ice surface (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>). Despite operating over a relatively small area of the ice sheet, it is argued that these bare ice processes have contributed substantially to an observed reduction in albedo and associated increase in melt across Greenland’s ablation zone from 2000 to 2011 (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). We collectively term this category of physical and biological melt-albedo processes that darken bare ice the “bare ice–albedo feedback”.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A seasonal increase in downward shortwave radiation also increases the extent of bare ice through the annual migration of the summer snowline. As sufficient energy is received at the surface to completely melt the accumulated winter snowpack, darker bare glacial ice is exposed, further enhancing the absorption of shortwave radiation by the ice sheet. We term this melt-albedo feedback the “snowline-albedo feedback.” While the importance of this process has long been recognized in alpine glacier settings (
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>), snowlines have received suprisingly little focus in Greenland beyond the pioneering facies work in the 1960s and 1990s (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>). The importance of the snowline-albedo feedback for amplifying melt, and its efficacy relative to the bare ice–albedo feedback, has therefore yet to be evaluated.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we assess the importance of the snowline-albedo feedback and its influence on Greenland Ice Sheet meltwater production using a new remotely sensed bare ice presence product (see Materials and Methods). We derive this product from daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery acquired by NASA’s Terra satellite and validated using Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite imagery and in situ field observations. We use our product to map snowline variability across Greenland from 2001 to 2017 and to evaluate its impact on the total net shortwave radiation relative to processes that darken bare ice and firn/snow. We then combine our snowline dataset with ice sheet surface topography to investigate how the strength of the snowline-albedo feedback changes as snowlines rise to higher elevations under a warmer climate. Last, owing to their heavy use for predicting future Greenland Ice Sheet melting and runoff contribution to global sea level rise, we assess whether regional climate models (RCMs) accurately determine snowline elevations.</p>
