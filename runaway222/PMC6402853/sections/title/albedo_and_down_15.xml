 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily ice sheet albedo from 2001 to 2017 was obtained from the albedo layer (300 to 3000 nm) in the MOD10A1 C6 product. MOD10A1 is a “blue-sky” albedo product, meaning that it is a linear combination of directional-hemispherical reflectance (“black-sky albedo”) and bi-hemispherical reflectance (“white-sky albedo”) (

  </a>) and therefore is directly comparable with both modeled and spectrometer albedo values. Like the MOD09GA surface reflectance products, MOD10A1 was resampled (nearest neighbor) to a pixel size of 500 × 500 m, reprojected to North Pole Stereographic (ESRI:102018), and clipped to the GIMP ice mask. All pixels flagged as clouds in either the MOD10A1 or the coincident MOD09GA cloud-state layer were excluded from the analysis.

  </a>). A climatology of downward shortwave radiation was produced by averaging data over the 2001–2017 period resulting in 92 downward shortwave radiation fields (one for every day of the summer). Like the albedo data, the daily downward shortwave radiation data were reprojected to North Pole Stereographic, resampled (nearest neighbor) to 500 × 500 m pixels, and clipped to the GIMP ice mask (
