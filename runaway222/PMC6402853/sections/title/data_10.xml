 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MOD09GA daily land surface reflectance Collection 6 products for every summer (June 1 to August 31) between 2001 and 2017 were downloaded from NASA’s Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The MOD09GA product provides atmospherically corrected surface reflectance from Terra’s MODIS for bands 1 to 7. The product was collected daily and delivered on a sinusoidal grid with a grid cell resolution of ~0.25 km

  <span class="sup">2</span>. We noted that MOD10A1 Collection 6 accounts for Terra MODIS sensor degradation, which was uncorrected for in the previous collection (C5) (

The eight MOD09GA and MOD10A1 tiles that cover Greenland (h15v01, h15v02, h16v00, h16v01, h16v02, h17v00, h17v01, and h17v02) were mosaicked, reprojected to North Pole Stereographic (ESRI:102018), and resampled (nearest neighbor) to a pixel resolution of 500 × 500 m. The mosaic was then clipped using the Greenland Ice Mapping Project (GIMP) ice mask (
