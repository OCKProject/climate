  </a>). We first produced a training dataset by manually classifying pixels as bare ice, snow, or water in the MOD09GA and MOD10A1 composite images. Field in situ portable spectrometer measurements made between 2014 and 2016 indicate that the greatest differences in spectral reflectance between ice and snow occur in the visible wavelengths. The red (band 1: 620 to 670 nm), green (band 4: 545 to 565 nm), and blue (band 3: 459 to 479 nm) bands were therefore used for distinguishing between ice and snow during the manual digitization process (e.g., fig. S4). Where the surface type was unclear in the MODIS visible-band composites, higher-resolution (30 m) Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper-plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) orthorectified, top-of-atmosphere reflectance images (L1T) were used to guide manual classification.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 5359 MODIS pixels spread across different sectors of the ice sheet were manually classified on the basis of their spectral attributes. Of these pixels, 3631, 1408, and 320 were identified as snow, bare ice, and water, respectively. The training dataset is available upon request from the authors. For testing purposes, a random subsample containing 20% of the pixels was removed from training dataset. The remaining bare ice, snow, and water samples were used to train the random forests classification, which was subsequently used to classify all summer MOD09GA and MOD10A1 mosaics between 2001 and 2017. Since snow and ice are best distinguished in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths, only nonâ€“cloud contaminated pixels in a MODIS composite containing MOD09GA bands 1 (620 to 670 nm), 2 (841 to 876 nm), 3 (459 to 479 nm), and 4 (545 to 565 nm) and the MOD10A1 albedo layer were considered for classification (figs. S3 and S4).</p>
