The MOD09GA product provides atmospherically corrected surface reflectance from Terra’s MODIS for bands 1 to 7. The product was collected daily and delivered on a sinusoidal grid with a grid cell resolution of ~0.25 km

   <span class="sup">2</span>. We noted that MOD10A1 Collection 6 accounts for Terra MODIS sensor degradation, which was uncorrected for in the previous collection (C5) (

   <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
    <span class="italic">38</span>
   </a>). We first produced a training dataset by manually classifying pixels as bare ice, snow, or water in the MOD09GA and MOD10A1 composite images. Field in situ portable spectrometer measurements made between 2014 and 2016 indicate that the greatest differences in spectral reflectance between ice and snow occur in the visible wavelengths. The red (band 1: 620 to 670 nm), green (band 4: 545 to 565 nm), and blue (band 3: 459 to 479 nm) bands were therefore used for distinguishing between ice and snow during the manual digitization process (e.g., fig. S4). Where the surface type was unclear in the MODIS visible-band composites, higher-resolution (30 m) Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper-plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) orthorectified, top-of-atmosphere reflectance images (L1T) were used to guide manual classification.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 5359 MODIS pixels spread across different sectors of the ice sheet were manually classified on the basis of their spectral attributes. Of these pixels, 3631, 1408, and 320 were identified as snow, bare ice, and water, respectively. The training dataset is available upon request from the authors. For testing purposes, a random subsample containing 20% of the pixels was removed from training dataset. The remaining bare ice, snow, and water samples were used to train the random forests classification, which was subsequently used to classify all summer MOD09GA and MOD10A1 mosaics between 2001 and 2017. Since snow and ice are best distinguished in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths, only non–cloud contaminated pixels in a MODIS composite containing MOD09GA bands 1 (620 to 670 nm), 2 (841 to 876 nm), 3 (459 to 479 nm), and 4 (545 to 565 nm) and the MOD10A1 albedo layer were considered for classification (figs.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Validation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initial testing using the subsample of pixels removed before training revealed that the random forests classification has a classification accuracy of 99.3%. More rigorous evaluation of classification performance was judged by calculating errors of bare ice omission (i.e., bare ice incorrectly classified as snow) and commission (i.e., snow incorrectly classified as bare ice). We evaluated these errors by comparing classified MODIS pixels with coincidently acquired (i.e., same day) Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+, 8 OLI pixels, which were treated as “ground truth” (i.e., zero error) (fig. S3). Bare ice and snow pixels were manually digitized in the higher-resolution satellite imagery between 2001 and 2017 using Google Earth Engine. Manual digitization was undertaken using multiband Landsat L1T composites containing visible and near-infrared bands to improve discrimination between bare ice and snow. To ensure fair consideration of uncertainties, pixels were sampled in close proximity to the snowline. In total, a sample of 133,588 Landsat pixels were obtained. Of these pixels, 61,108 were dedicated to the estimation of omission (i.e., Landsat pixels identified as bare ice), and 72,480 pixels were dedicated to commission (i.e., Landsat pixels identified as snow). When compared to the MODIS classification, we found that errors of bare ice omission were 4.6% and errors of bare ice commission were 0.3%. The higher errors of omission mean that we likely underestimate rather than overestimate bare ice presence, making our bare ice extent and snowline metrics (described in the next paragraphs) conservative (
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>). Overall, we find that bare ice is classified with an average accuracy of 97.8% based on comparison with Landsat imagery.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bare ice presence index</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The daily classified bare ice maps derived from MODIS were used to calculate a summer June, July, and August (JJA) bare ice presence index (or exposure frequency) (fig. S5). The bare ice presence index varies between 0 and 1 in any given summer and is defined as the number of times a pixel is classified as bare ice divided by the total number of valid observations of that pixel (i.e., when not cloud-obscured) between June 1 and August 31. The mean number of valid pixel observations for the whole ice sheet ranged between 45 and 61 days (50 to 68%) and averaged 56 days (62%) between 2001 and 2017. We find that there is some variability between the number of valid observations in June, July, and August (fig. S6). However, the variability is small (SD = ±1.3 days) and cannot explain the observed fluctuations of bare ice presence between 2001 and 2017. Seasonal variability in the number of valid observations therefore does not appear to have biased our results (fig. S6).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Validation of the bare ice presence index was achieved with comparison to in situ albedo measurements derived from 21 PROMICE/GAP automated weather station (AWS) measurements around the ice sheet (
   <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
    <span class="italic">39</span>
   </a>). AWS albedo is measured by Kipp &amp; Zonen CNR1 or CNR4 net radiometers, which measure downward and upward shortwave radiation fluxes with a specified uncertainty of less than 5% (
   <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
    <span class="italic">40</span>
   </a>). Downward shortwave radiation was corrected for tilt and was only calculated when solar zenith angles were larger than 70°. Daily albedo was calculated by integrating the hourly averaged albedo data over a 24-hour period. Bare ice was defined as daily albedo &lt;0.55, and summer bare ice presence index was calculated in the same way as the MODIS bare ice maps. This threshold is based on in situ portable spectrometer and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) albedo measurements, which indicate that bare ice is rarely brighter than 0.55. We find that our MODIS bare ice presence product is in close agreement with that measured by the AWS with an 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> equal to 0.82 (fig. S7).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Metrics</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual maximum elevation of the snowline and extent of bare ice were derived from the summer bare ice presence index maps (fig. S5). The annual maximum extent of bare ice is defined as the number of pixels having a bare ice presence index of &gt;0.1. This value was chosen to protect against potentially misclassified pixels and makes the maximum bare ice extent metric conservative. Interannual variations of end-of-summer bare ice extent for the entire ice sheet are presented in 
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>. End-of-summer bare ice extent is also provided for each of the eight IMBIE sectors in tables S1 and S2.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual maximum snowline elevation, corresponding to the end-of-summer snowline in alpine glaciology literature, is defined as the 90th percentile of bare ice pixel elevations (i.e., those with a bare ice presence of &gt;0.1) (
   <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
    <span class="italic">41</span>
   </a>) (fig. S5). The elevation of each pixel was derived from the GIMP digital elevation model (
   <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
    <span class="italic">37</span>
   </a>). The 90th percentile was chosen to protect against potentially misclassified pixels and makes the end-of-summer snowline metric conservative. We note that the end-of-summer snowline metric is a useful relative summary metric for assessing and conceptualizing interannual changes of bare ice exposure but has limited usefulness as an absolute metric due to strong latitudinal gradients of snowline elevation across the ice sheet (e.g., fig. S5). To account for latitudinal snowline variations, we provided end-of-season snowline elevation for each IMBIE sector in tables S1 and S2.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The uncertainties of both metrics were evaluated by considering the errors of commission (0.3%) and omission (4.6%) in the bare ice classification. By incorporating these uncertainties into our metrics, we find that maximum summer bare ice extent may be overestimated by 790 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> and underestimated by up to 12,103 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>. Likewise, the end-of-season snowline may be overestimated by 5 m and underestimated by up to 70 m. We consider these uncertainties when the remotely sensed metrics were compared with similar metrics derived from RCMs.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Albedo and downward shortwave radiation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily ice sheet albedo from 2001 to 2017 was obtained from the albedo layer (300 to 3000 nm) in the MOD10A1 C6 product. MOD10A1 is a “blue-sky” albedo product, meaning that it is a linear combination of directional-hemispherical reflectance (“black-sky albedo”) and bi-hemispherical reflectance (“white-sky albedo”) (
   <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
    <span class="italic">42</span>
   </a>) and therefore is directly comparable with both modeled and spectrometer albedo values. Like the MOD09GA surface reflectance products, MOD10A1 was resampled (nearest neighbor) to a pixel size of 500 × 500 m, reprojected to North Pole Stereographic (ESRI:102018), and clipped to the GIMP ice mask. All pixels flagged as clouds in either the MOD10A1 or the coincident MOD09GA cloud-state layer were excluded from the analysis.

   </a>). A climatology of downward shortwave radiation was produced by averaging data over the 2001–2017 period resulting in 92 downward shortwave radiation fields (one for every day of the summer). Like the albedo data, the daily downward shortwave radiation data were reprojected to North Pole Stereographic, resampled (nearest neighbor) to 500 × 500 m pixels, and clipped to the GIMP ice mask (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We interpolated almost all the missing values (i.e., pixels flagged as cloud) in the MODIS bare ice classification and albedo products from 2001 to 2017 using a gap-filling method. Missing pixels were reclassified on the basis of the value of the same pixel in the antecedent grid. If the same pixel in the antecedent grid was also missing, then the preceding grid was used to reclassify the pixel. This process was repeated incrementally up to 3 days before and after the original grid. The gap filling reduced the fraction of missing pixels from 59 to 0.7%.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ablation zone, where the annual melt and runoff exceed the snow accumulation rate and the SMB is negative, was defined using daily SMB data from MAR3.9 (
   <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Net shortwave radiation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Net shortwave radiation at each pixel was calculated by subtracting the pixel albedo from one and multiplying by the daily downward shortwave radiation at that pixel. We first partitioned the net shortwave radiation absorbed by bare ice and firn/snow in the ablation zone for every summer between 2001 and 2017 using observed, seasonally evolving albedo of each surface type. Next, we calculated the mean bare ice and firn/snow albedo observed on June 1 during the 2001–2017 study period. The albedo of bare ice and firn/snow was then fixed to these mean values (0.55 and 0.78, respectively), and we recalculated the net shortwave radiation received by bare ice and firn/snow. The residual difference between bare ice or firn/snow with observed albedo versus bare ice or firn/snow with fixed albedo allowed us to isolate the relative importance of the extent and albedo of bare ice and firn/snow on net shortwave radiation in the ablation zone.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the sensitivity of our results to the choice of fixed bare ice albedo value, we repeated the net shortwave radiation analysis while incrementally increasing and decreasing the fixed bare ice albedo by ±0.01 from the original value (0.55). We find that the bare ice–albedo feedback only becomes stronger than the snowline-albedo feedback when the fixed albedo of bare ice is raised by +0.12 (to 0.67). The conclusion of our study (that snowline migration is a primary amplifier of melt and that bare ice or firn/snow albedo are secondary in comparison) therefore appears robust to uncertainties in the choice of fixed bare ice albedo that, when averaged across the ablation zone, are not expected to be greater than ±0.02.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">RCM bare ice extent and snowline</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily bare ice extent was derived from two RCMs commonly used for future projections of Greenland SMB: MAR3.9 (
   <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
    <span class="italic">26</span>
   </a>) and RACMO2.3p2 (
   <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
    <span class="italic">30</span>
   </a>). To discriminate between bare ice and snow pixels in RACMO2.3p2, we used an albedo threshold of &lt;0.55. In MAR3.9, bare ice pixels were identified as those with a density between 915 and 925 kg m
   <span class="sup">−3</span> at a depth of 0 cm and an albedo of less than 0.60.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both models were coupled to multilayer, one-dimensional snow models that explicitly simulate surface albedo as a function of snow grain size and impurity content. When snowpack thickness reaches zero, MAR3.9 prescribes an initial bare ice albedo of 0.55, which can decrease depending on the depth of water layer covering the ice to a minimum of 0.35 and increase depending on clouds and solar zenith angle to 0.60. RACMO2.3p2 calculates bare ice albedo as the 5% lowest surface albedo measured by the MODIS 16-day albedo product (MCD43A3) during the 2001–2010 period. The daily bare ice extent maps from the models were used to calculate a summer bare ice presence index in the same way as for the MODIS composite products. To enable comparison between different products, we resampled all products to a 1-km grid using bilinear interpolation. We then clipped all bare ice presence index maps to a common mask based on the GIMP ice mask and calculated the end-of-summer bare ice extent and snowline elevation for each model (fig. S2).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that some approaches for hindcasting Greenland melt and runoff directly incorporate observed albedo from MODIS. For example, the albedo field of HIRHAM5 (
   <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
    <span class="italic">43</span>
   </a>) is based on de-noised MOD10A1 surface albedo. Both snow and bare ice were therefore observed (i.e. spatially and temporally variable), and HIRHAM5 implicitly captured the strength of the snowline-albedo and bare ice–albedo feedback. By incorporating observed albedo from MODIS, (
   <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
    <span class="italic">43</span>
   </a>) shows that discrepancies between observed and modeled ice sheet melt and runoff are substantially reduced. However, this approach is not applicable for future projections of Greenland SMB, since observations of surface albedo are not available. Accurate predictions of Greenland’s future meltwater runoff contributions to global sea level are therefore likely to rely on refining snowpack models to more accurately determine the timing of bare ice exposure and associated strength of the snowline-albedo feedback.
