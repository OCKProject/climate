 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 2001–2017 study period, Greenland Ice Sheet snowline elevations exhibited substantial interannual variation (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). Averaged across the ice sheet, end-of-summer (i.e., maximum) pan-Greenland snowline attained a maximum elevation of 1650 m in 2012 and a minimum of 1330 m in 2009, with a mean 2001–2017 elevation of 1450 ± 90 m (mean ± SD) (see Materials and Methods for the description of the snowline metric; 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>). The pan-Greenland snowline elevation did not rise linearly over the entire 2001–2017 study period but rose significantly (

  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>). Spatially, end-of-season snowline elevations exhibited substantial regional variation, generally rising with decreasing latitude and ranging from 980 ± 67 m (mean ± SD) in North Greenland to 1520 ± 113 m in Southwest Greenland (see tables S1 and S2). In general, end-of-summer snowline elevations displayed greatest variability in Southwest Greenland (varying by ±385 m over the 2001–2017 study period; 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1D</a>) and least variability in East Greenland (varying by ±132 m over the 2001–2017 study period;

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the position of the seasonal snowline is the primary determinant of bare ice exposure, bare ice extent closely tracks interannual variations in snowline elevation (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>). End-of-summer pan-Greenland bare ice extent averaged 221,890 ± 30,120 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (12 ± 2% of the total ice sheet area; mean ± SD) over the 2001–2017 study period. The maximum mapped bare ice extent (300,050 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) occurred in summer 2012, a record-setting melt year when bare ice was exposed across 16% of the ice sheet. In contrast, the smallest mapped extent of bare ice (184,660 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) occurred in 2006, when bare ice was exposed across just 10% of the ice sheet (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>), nearly 40% percent less area than that in 2012. Like snowline elevation, bare ice extent did not exhibit any discernible temporal trend over the 2001–2017 study period (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We demonstrate the importance of snowline migration on overall ice sheet melt production by quantifying how fluctuations in bare ice extent affect net shortwave radiation, the dominant contributor of Greenland Ice Sheet melt energy (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). To do this, we combine our daily bare ice presence product with daily albedo data from MODIS (MOD10A1) and daily downward shortwave radiation fields from Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR) 3.9 (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>), to partition the total shortwave radiation absorbed by bare ice versus firn/snow in the ablation zone [i.e., where net surface mass balance (SMB) is &lt;0] (see Materials and Methods). Net shortwave radiation is then partitioned again by fixing the albedo of bare ice to the mean bare ice albedo observed on June 1 during the 2001–2017 study period. The residual difference between the shortwave energy absorbed by bare ice with fixed albedo and bare ice with observed albedo allows us to evaluate the efficacy of increasing bare ice extent versus decreasing bare ice albedo on melt.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that net shortwave radiation in the ablation zone is primarily controlled by fluctuations in bare ice extent during the 2001–2017 study period (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>). Net shortwave radiation attributed solely to variations in the extent of bare ice (and corresponding extent of firn/snow) had an SD of ±9 exajoules (EJ; 10
  <span class="sup">18</span> J) during our study period, equivalent to 53% of the total net shortwave radiation variability in the ablation zone (±17 EJ). This is exemplified by years 2010 and 2012, when an additional 12 EJ (7%) and 18 EJ (11%) of shortwave energy were absorbed in the ablation zone relative to the 2001–2017 mean solely because snowlines rose earlier in the season and to higher elevations (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>). These energy quantities are equivalent to +36 and + 54 Gt of additional melt, when converted to mass using the latent heat of fusion for ice (334 kJ kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). Since shortwave radiation is the dominant contributor of ice sheet melt energy, it follows that interannual fluctuations in bare ice extent, driven by snowline migration, were an important control on ice sheet meltwater production during the 2001–2017 study period.

Interannual fluctuations in bare ice extent (and corresponding fluctuations in firn/snow extent) drive most of the variation in net shortwave radiation, signifying that the processes that expose bare ice (e.g., snowline migration) are the strongest melt-albedo feedback operating on the ice sheet.

 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other processes that reduce the albedo of bare ice and firn/snow also influence interannual variations in net shortwave radiation in the ablation zone. Excluding the effects of snowline fluctuations, shortwave radiation absorption attributed to temporal variability in bare ice albedo and firn/snow albedo had an SD of ±5 and ± 3 EJ during the study period, accounting for 29 and 18% of the total net shortwave radiation variability in the ablation zone, respectively (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>). In 2010 and 2012, the reduction in bare ice albedo increased net shortwave radiation absorbed in the ablation zone by 4 and 5%, respectively, relative to the 2001–2017 mean. However, while processes that darken bare ice [e.g., exposure of dust (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>), presence of surface and interstitial water (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>), and algal growth (
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>)] and snow [e.g., impurities and snow grain size (
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>)] are important amplifiers of melt, our analysis suggests that they are secondary in comparison to processes that expose bare ice (i.e., snowline migration).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonally (i.e., from June 1 to August 31), we find that increasing bare ice extent, rather than decreasing bare ice albedo, is the primary driver of shortwave radiation absorption in the ablation zone when averaged over the entire 17-year study period (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3B</a>). From 2001 to 2017, a mean 84% (77 EJ) of the total shortwave radiation absorbed by bare ice was due to its increasing extent. In contrast, the mean net shortwave radiation due to the seasonal decline in bare ice albedo (15 EJ) was just a fifth of the additional net shortwave radiation due to increases in bare ice extent (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3B</a>). This may be explained, at least partly, by the magnitude of albedo reduction caused by bare ice darkening processes. The mean reduction of bare ice albedo over the summer (from June 1 to August 31) was 0.12 (i.e., from 0.57 to 0.45). In contrast, the difference between the albedo of firn/snow and bare ice is almost double (i.e., 0.22, from 0.79 to 0.57). The strongest melt-albedo feedback operating on the Greenland Ice Sheet is therefore caused by rising seasonal snowlines, rather than biological and/or hydrological processes that alter the bare ice albedo itself.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of differences in ice sheet hypsometry (i.e., the relationship between surface area and elevation) and climate, the strength of the snowline-albedo feedback varies regionally around the ice sheet (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). To assess where the snowline-albedo feedback had greatest impact during the 2001–2017 study period, we subdivide our net shortwave radiation analysis into eight ice sheet sectors based on the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE) (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>). We then evaluate the sensitivity of each sector to the snowline-albedo feedback by quantifying the relative impact of snowline fluctuations on bare ice extent and total net shortwave variability in the ablation zone [i.e., the SD of shortwave radiation absorbed by bare ice extent from 2001–2017 divided by the mean shortwave radiation absorbed by bare ice extent from 2001–2017, i.e., the coefficient of variation (
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>v</sub>)]. This allows assessment of which sectors of the ice sheet are most sensitive to the snowline-albedo feedback due to the current topographic hypsometry of the ice sheet surface.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that Southwest Greenland (IMBIE sector 6) was the most sensitive sector to the snowline-albedo feedback (
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>v</sub> = 0.31) during the 2001–2017 study period. Of the total shortwave radiation absorbed by bare ice, 42% was absorbed in this sector. This is because the gently sloping ice surface topography of Southwest Greenland, together with mild summer air temperatures and low snow accumulation (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>), exposes large areas of bare ice every summer as the regional snowline rises to higher elevation (e.g., 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>). In this sector, small increases/decreases in melt cause large increases/decreases in snowline and associated bare ice exposure. This is exemplified by the difference between 2012 and 2013, when a reduction in bare ice extent reduced summer shortwave radiation absorption in the ablation zone by 7 EJ (potential melt, 21 Gt) equivalent to 54% of the total reduction in net shortwave radiation in the ablation zone in this sector [13 EJ; (potential melt, 39 Gt)]. The snowline-albedo feedback is thus strongest in Southwest Greenland.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The coefficient of variation indicates that the snowline-albedo feedback also drives large fluctuations in shortwave energy absorbed in North (
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>v</sub> = 0.28), Northeast (
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>v</sub> = 0.25), South (
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>v</sub> = 0.27), and Northwest Greenland (
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>v</sub> = 0.26) (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>). Although less bare ice is exposed in these sectors (e.g., 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1, B and D</a>), they either have gently sloping ice surface topography (e.g., North and Northeast Greenland) or experience large interannual climatic variations (e.g., variable winter snowfall), which induce large interannual variations in summer bare ice exposure. In contrast, the coefficient of variation in East (
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>v</sub> = 0.19) and Southeast (
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>v</sub> = 0.23) Greenland is smaller, indicating that the topography and climate of these sectors act to suppress snowline variability and associated fluctuations in net shortwave radiation. An example of this is East Greenland where steep ice surface topography constrains interannual variations in bare ice exposure (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1D</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summer air temperatures over the Greenland Ice Sheet are projected to increase up to 4.1°C by the end of the 21st century (
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>). Snowlines will likely rise to higher elevations than the range that we observe during our 2001–2017 study period (
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, gray shaded area). This will, depending on the ice sheet hypsometry, cause the snowline-albedo feedback to intensify. To evaluate the hypsometric sensitivity of the snowline-albedo feedback, we calculate the area of new bare ice exposure that would be introduced by raising the snowline up to 500 m above the corresponding mean 2001–2017 elevations [
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a> (red shaded area) and fig. S1]. This metric (in units of square kilometer of bare ice exposed per meter of snowline elevation change) enables the assessment of the potential amplification of the snowline-albedo feedback under a future warmer climate.

    </a>) and assume static, present-day surface topography. The exponential relationships suggest that strength of the snowline-albedo feedback reported here will become stronger in the future as snowlines rise to higher, flatter areas of the ice sheet, owing to increasing areas of bare ice exposed per unit rise in snowline elevation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results demonstrate that the area of bare ice exposure per meter of snowline elevation rise increases exponentially in all sectors because of a flatter ice sheet surface at higher elevations. This nonlinear increase of bare ice exposure signifies that the impact of Greenland’s snowline-albedo feedback will become even stronger as snowlines rise, including areas other than Southwest Greenland. In North Greenland, for example, the strength of the snowline-albedo feedback increases by 51% relative to our 2001–2017 study period (
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>). In East, Southwest, West, and Northwest Greenland, it increases by between 30 and 40% relative to the present day (

In contrast, the snowline-albedo feedback does not intensify substantially in Northeast, Southeast, and South Greenland, where current elevation-area relationships remain relatively constant under a scenario of 500 m of snowline elevation rise (
