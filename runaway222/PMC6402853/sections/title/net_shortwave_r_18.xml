 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Net shortwave radiation at each pixel was calculated by subtracting the pixel albedo from one and multiplying by the daily downward shortwave radiation at that pixel. We first partitioned the net shortwave radiation absorbed by bare ice and firn/snow in the ablation zone for every summer between 2001 and 2017 using observed, seasonally evolving albedo of each surface type. Next, we calculated the mean bare ice and firn/snow albedo observed on June 1 during the 2001–2017 study period. The albedo of bare ice and firn/snow was then fixed to these mean values (0.55 and 0.78, respectively), and we recalculated the net shortwave radiation received by bare ice and firn/snow. The residual difference between bare ice or firn/snow with observed albedo versus bare ice or firn/snow with fixed albedo allowed us to isolate the relative importance of the extent and albedo of bare ice and firn/snow on net shortwave radiation in the ablation zone.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the sensitivity of our results to the choice of fixed bare ice albedo value, we repeated the net shortwave radiation analysis while incrementally increasing and decreasing the fixed bare ice albedo by ±0.01 from the original value (0.55). We find that the bare ice–albedo feedback only becomes stronger than the snowline-albedo feedback when the fixed albedo of bare ice is raised by +0.12 (to 0.67). The conclusion of our study (that snowline migration is a primary amplifier of melt and that bare ice or firn/snow albedo are secondary in comparison) therefore appears robust to uncertainties in the choice of fixed bare ice albedo that, when averaged across the ablation zone, are not expected to be greater than ±0.02.</p>
