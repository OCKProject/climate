 <div class="title">Relationship between end-of-season snowline elevation and total summer runoff during the 2001–2017 period (

 <p>Note that both variables are modeled by MAR3.9. The labeled lines indicate the mean end-of-season snowline observed by this study (solid), modeled by RACMO2.3p2 (dotted), and modeled by MAR3.9 (dashed) over the 2001–2017 study period. The strong positive correlation between snowline and runoff indicates that accurate representation of snowlines in climate models is critical for accurate forecasts of Greenland Ice Sheet runoff.</p>
