  <div class="title">Comparison between observed (MODIS) and modeled (MAR3.9 and RACMO2.3p2) bare ice extent and snowline during the 2001â€“2017 study period.</div>
  <p>Interannual variations in (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) maximum bare ice extent and (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) maximum snowline elevation. The residual between observed and modeled (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) bare ice extent and (
   <span class="bold">D</span>) snowline is greatest during years with higher runoff, because RACMO2.3p2 does not expose enough bare ice while MAR3.9 exposes too much. Note that the timing of bare ice exposure is also modeled inaccurately during high melt years (see fig. S2). These discrepancies introduce uncertainties in RCM forecasts of future Greenland runoff contributions to sea level rise.
