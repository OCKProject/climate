  </span>, outdoor air pollution-related premature mortality is projected to roughly double by 2050 compared to 2010 when considering the current climate (REF) and air pollution (FLE) policies combined with population and economic growth, whereas ambitious policies (2 °C—BAT) bring the number of premature deaths below the level of 2010 despite population growth by 2050 (premature mortality per scenario, region, and pollutant are detailed in Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">35</a>–
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">40</a>). Climate policies as currently pledged under the NDCs lead to between 71 and 99 thousand avoided premature deaths globally in the year 2030 compared to current climate policies (REF), while bringing greenhouse emissions in line with a 2 °C temperature goal prevents between 178 and 346 thousand premature deaths globally in the year 2030. In the year 2050, 2 °C-compatible climate action reduces the premature deaths from air pollution by 0.7–1.5 million compared to the REF, of which more than two thirds are prevented in India and China (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The gap between the NDC and 2 °C scenarios is explained by countries like India, for which the current NDC up to 2030 fails to capture the potential air quality co-benefits of climate action. In addition to avoided premature mortality, reductions in air pollution bring benefits in terms of reduced sickness days, thereby boosting labour markets (see Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">41</a>).

In addition to global results, the figure shows avoided premature mortality (in thousands) for six regions. To display the absolute numbers in a way that makes the regional figures comparable against each other, the range of the vertical axes is scaled to 0.04% of the region-specific population in 2050

  </span>. By reducing ozone precursor emissions, global climate policy can improve crop yields. Using exposure–response functions (ERFs) for seven crop types, we calculate the crop yield impact of climate policy-induced reductions in tropospheric ozone mixing ratios. Projecting future changes in crop yield onto current values of agricultural output, we obtain the impacts shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, where monetary agricultural co-benefits are expressed in per capita terms. The results for the NDC scenario highlight the areas where ozone reductions overlap with high production values of ozone-sensitive crops, such as maize, soybeans, and wheat in the US or sugar cane and soybeans in Brazil. Whereas the NDCs globally raise the yields of maize, rice, soy, and wheat by 0.4–0.7%, 0.1–0.3%, 0.8–1.1%, and 0.4–0.6% in 2030, respectively, more ambitious climate policy limiting global warming to 2 °C increases productivity of those crops by 0.8–1.5%, 0.2–0.8%, 1.8–2.7%, and 0.9–1.7% compared to the REF in 2030 (see also Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">42</a>). Estimates of monetary agricultural co-benefits corresponding to yield impacts for the year 2050 exceed 10$ per capita in some regions, when calculated using current-day value of agricultural production. Importantly, increased agricultural crop yields could contribute to reaching the Sustainable Development Goal No hunger (SDG2).
