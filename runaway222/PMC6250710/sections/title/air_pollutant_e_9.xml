 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Air pollutant emissions, historical and projected, were obtained using emission factors data multiplied by activity data for each sectoral flow, endogenously produced by POLES-JRC. This was done for 35 sectoral flows (sectoral and fuel-specific energy demand, industrial activity, population) for each of the 6 pollutants (SO
