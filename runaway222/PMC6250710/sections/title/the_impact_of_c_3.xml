  </span>, particularly when both share the same underlying drivers. The extent to which CO
  <sub>2</sub> reductions are correlated with changes in air pollutants differs by region and type of air pollutant (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). For pollutants that mainly result from the combustion of fossil fuels, such as SO
  <sub>2</sub> and NO
  <sub>x</sub>, emission reductions tend to be strongly correlated with decreasing emissions of CO
  <sub>2</sub>. This co-movement is less obvious for regions with large GHG abatement potential from options other than the burning of fossil fuels, such as land use in Brazil (see Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>), and for regions with important industrial sources of pollutants, such as SO
  <sub>2</sub> from production of metals in Russia. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows that air quality co-benefits generally outweigh adverse side effects on the aggregate level for most pollutants and regions, although there are some trade-offs embedded in technological choices such as carbon capture and storage

  </span>. For organic carbon and CO in particular, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows that not all models in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span> agree on the sign of the change in emissions on the global level, indicating uncertainty in the estimates. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> furthermore indicates the sensitivity of co-reductions with respect to the implemented air pollution control technologies (Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>–
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">28</a> provide numbers by region and scenario). Low air pollutant emission intensities (BAT) in the benchmark in key climate change mitigation sectors reduce the scope for co-benefits, as can be seen from the sulphur dioxide emission reductions in India, for instance, where the implementation of BAT implies less polluting coal-fired electricity generation facilities.

  <sub>2.5</sub>) and tropospheric ozone mixing ratio mapped in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> are the results of emissions, transportation, and atmospheric chemistry reactions of pollutants (see detailed numbers in Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">29</a>–
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">34</a>). Hence, results for PM include both direct emissions from primary sources, such as BC and organic matter, and secondary PM that derives from emissions of NH
  <sub>3</sub>, NO
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">x</span>
  </sub>, SO
  <sub>2</sub>, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Ozone is formed by the reaction of precursor gases NO
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">x</span>
  </sub>, VOCs, and CO in the presence of sunlight. By 2030, the time horizon of most NDCs, the Paris pledges lead to globally relatively small but locally significant reductions in the concentration of PM
  <sub>2.5</sub>, while a decrease in ozone mixing ratio spreads more widely across the globe. Over the long run (2050), the impact of a more ambitious climate policy setting (2 °C) reveals that the potential contribution of GHG abatement policies to improved air quality is substantial, particularly in China, India, and the Middle East, where benchmark concentrations are comparably high.
