  </span>. Future work could shed light on these issues in the context of the Paris Agreement. The analysis presented here illustrates that the co-benefits of climate policy depend on the stringency of air pollution control measures and the valuation of avoided premature mortality, but additional sources of uncertainty can be found in each step of the methodology. Future research efforts could assess the combined uncertainty throughout the modelling chain based on a multi-model assessment. A better measurement of (exposure to) air pollution

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis presented here quantifies the local and global air quality co-benefits of climate policies (1) as pledged in the NDCs and (2) in a scenario where countries ratchet up ambition levels in order to curb global GHG emissions to reach the 2 °C temperature goal, complementing recent work on the health effects of a pathway compatible with 1.5 °C warming
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. In addition to other co-benefits of climate action, such as improved human health through diet change

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>

  </span>, the synergies with air quality call for an integrated policy perspective to enable progress in a broader context of sustainability, as represented by the Sustainable Development Goals. This paper takes climate policy objectives as a starting point, but long-term strategies to be submitted by 2020 in accordance with Article 4 (Paragraph 19) of the Paris Agreement can reach benefits beyond those presented here when an integrated policy is designed explicitly to balance trade-offs and ancillary benefits from the outset. Effective policymaking should therefore account for multiple externalities in the pricing of food and energy
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span>, consider the interplay of various policy design features, such as taxes and cap-and-trade mechanisms
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>

Future research should aim to show how policies that provide the right market incentives for technology trade-offs can exploit synergies and avoid lock-in effects in infrastructure by combining effective short-term air pollution control measures with an ambitious decarbonisation roadmap to maximise benefits for climate and human health simultaneously.
