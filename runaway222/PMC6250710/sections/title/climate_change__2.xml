The NDC scenario implements the GHG emission reductions and related policies in the Paris pledges, including the emission reductions that are conditional on other aspects of the Paris Agreement such as financing. Jointly, the current pledges represented by this scenario imply a likely increase in global average temperature of 2.5–3.2 °C, in line with the range provided by other studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. We address the implications of air pollution policy uncertainty for the co-benefits by exploring three storylines. The Fixed Legislation (FLE) scenario considers no additional implementation of air pollution abatement technologies from 2010 onwards. In combination with a REF climate policy, this assumption implies that economic and population growth lead to increasing global emissions over time for all air pollutants, with the exception of carbon monoxide (CO), for which a rising trend is offset by ongoing progress in energy technology and corresponding efficiency improvements. Because high levels of air pollution provide a broad base for reductions, the estimates of the co-benefits of climate policy derived under the assumption of Fixed air quality Legislation will be considered here as an upper bound. A gradual adoption and diffusion of air pollution control measures is included in the Stringent Legislation (SLE) scenario, which better reflects ambitious recent policy objectives in fast-growing countries, such as China. In the Best Available Technologies (BAT) scenario, countries fully adopt the maximum technically feasible air pollutant emission reduction technologies by 2030. This hypothetical benchmark identifies how structural changes induced by climate policy can improve air quality beyond what can be expected by end-of-pipe air pollution abatement technologies alone. By implementing stringent air pollution abatement, the BAT scenario leaves less room for co-benefits of climate action and will be used here to quantify a lower bound for the co-benefits.

  </span>. The effect of air pollution control on climate change is a priori unclear, because the radiative forcing of some pollutants, such as black carbon (BC), is positive, while other pollutants (NO

  </sub>, SO
  <sub>2</sub>) have a cooling effect on the climate. In addition to the median estimate of global average temperature change and the 50% probability bounds for the SLE scenario, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> (dotted lines) includes the median estimate in case of less (FLE) and more (BAT) stringent air pollution control measures. The figure shows that the temperature change relative to pre-industrial levels in the REF climate policy under more ambitious air pollution controls (BAT) exceeds the central case estimate (SLE) by 0.08 °C in 2100, while the higher end of the air pollution projection (FLE) implies temperature changes that are 0.32 °C below the SLE case in 2100. Hence, the end-of-pipe reduction of air pollutants with a cooling effect outweighs the decrease in air pollutants that contribute to global warming in our scenarios, leading to a net upward effect on global mean temperatures, in line with other work
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. This result does not consider the effect of air pollution controls on GHG emissions and is less pronounced in more ambitious climate mitigation scenarios. Compared to the REF, the decrease in GHG emissions in the 2 °C scenario implies larger reductions in global mean temperature in the case of cleaner air (1.84 °C under BAT vs. 1.62 °C under FLE, REF—2 °C in 2100), since co-reduction of cooling aerosols plays a smaller role when stringent air pollution controls (BAT) are in place.

Energy efficiency drives total global energy consumption down by approximately 10% in the NDC scenario and by more than a quarter (27%) in the 2 °C scenario in the year 2050 compared to the REF. Moreover, the rising share of renewables represents a structural change in the energy sector, especially in electricity generation.
