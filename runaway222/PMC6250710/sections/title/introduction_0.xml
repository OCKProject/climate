  </span> and air pollution. This paper combines extensive data sets and models on emissions, climate, the energy system, the dispersion and impacts of ambient air pollutants, and the economy to quantify the impact of actual climate change mitigation policies proposed in the run-up to the 21st Conference Of the Parties in Paris on three inter-related Sustainable Development Goals
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>: Good health (SDG3), Clean energy (SDG7), and Climate action (SDG13). As emphasised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>, a comprehensive analysis of co-benefits and adverse side effects is essential to estimate the actual costs of mitigation policies. In a political context, the co-benefits on air pollution are particularly relevant because they are mainly local and short term, while the averted climate change impacts occur globally over a decadal temporal scale.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While earlier regional estimates present a broad range of values for the co-benefits of climate policy on air quality (between 2 and 196$ per tonne of carbon dioxide, with mean value of 49$/tCO

  </span> highlights that the improved human health outcomes due to cleaner air can largely offset the costs to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs), particularly in heavily polluted regions. Here we assess the global and regional mortality, morbidity, and agricultural air quality co-benefits in the context of the Paris Agreement while accounting for future uncertainty in air pollution control measures. The main contribution lies in the quantification of ancillary benefits of actual (pledged) climate and energy policy elements in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), thereby capturing the heterogeneity in country-specific ambition levels and in sector coverage, in contrast with scenarios studying global and economy-wide carbon pricing, and complementing recent studies for the US

  </span>. The results show that the NDCs as pledged in the run-up to the Paris Agreement could improve health outcomes substantially, avoiding 71–99 thousand premature deaths in the year 2030. Present study furthermore compares the value of the air quality co-benefits with the macroeconomic cost of climate change mitigation policies, the latter also depending on the relative ambition levels across countries through industry competitiveness and international trade. We find that the value of co-benefits differs widely across regions and outweighs the costs of reducing GHGs on a global level in the majority of scenarios.
