  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">47</a>). Using the changes in ozone mixing ratios across climate scenarios (keeping air pollution control scenario fixed to FLE, SLE, or BAT) and the ERFs, we obtain the yield impact in percentage terms by crop, climate scenario, air pollution control scenario, country, and year. Next, we aggregate crop productivity impacts across crops and regions using 5-year average (2009–2013) gross production values from FAOSTAT (
