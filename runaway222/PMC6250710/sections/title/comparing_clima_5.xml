 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The air quality co-benefits of the NDC and 2 °C-consistent climate policies on avoided premature mortality, reduced lost work days due to sickness, and improved agricultural crop yields more than offset the cost of climate change mitigation policies on a global average over the 2015–2050 period under the majority of scenario settings (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). This result implies that air quality provides further justification to GHG abatement policies, in addition to avoided climate change damages, which are not considered here. Whereas crop yields and work days are reflected by a (agriculture and labour) market value, the avoided premature mortality is largely a nonmarket co-benefit, evaluated here by using the Value of Statistical Life (VSL). The low, medium, and high VSLs are heterogeneous across regions and grow with income over time (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">43</a>), as empirical studies typically find that the willingness-to-pay for health risk reductions varies with income. For comparison, we also include the results with a VSL that is homogeneous across regions and fixed in time at a more conservative value. Compared to an approach based on years of life lost, the use of the same VSL for all deaths may bias the valuation upwards when the population affected is characterised by relatively old age, poor health conditions, and comparably short life expectancy.

    <p>The value of the co-benefits of improved air quality due to climate polices in NDC and 2 °C scenarios. Values represent the average over 2015–2050 for Fixed Legislation (FLE), Stringent Legislation (SLE), and Best Available Technologies (BAT) air quality policies. Co-benefits include the value of avoided premature mortality as well as the co-benefits on the labour and agricultural markets via avoided work days lost and improved crop yields, respectively. The whiskers indicate high, medium, and low value of statistical life (VSL), heterogeneous across regions and time depending on GDP per capita. The black cross indicates results with the value of statistical life of 1.5 million US$(2005) constant across regions and over time. The shaded area presents the costs (change in welfare expressed as equivalent variation) of climate change mitigation policy over 2015–2050 and does not consider any co-benefits, nor does it include direct benefits of avoided impacts of climate change. Both cost and co-benefits are expressed per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions reduced excluding land use (change) and forestry</p>

  </span>, while high numbers for India point to the potential domestic gains if the country were to step up the level of climate policy ambition. The results for Europe reveal the transboundary benefits of the Paris Agreement on a reduction of ozone mixing ratio worldwide. As relatively ambitious climate policies are already adopted in the EU (hence included in the REF), the additional GHG reductions to reach the NDC target are relatively small, while the region’s air quality improves also due to climate change mitigation efforts in other regions. A high population density, relatively clean air in the REF (which places the starting point for the health analysis in the steep part of the non-linear ERF), strong energy efficiency improvements in the residential and transport sectors, and an important component of secondary PM (for which reductions tend to correlate well with CO

  </span> further contribute to the co-benefits in Europe. The bottom–up nature of the Paris pledges results in a wide range of mitigation costs across countries. Results presented in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a> account for the impact on competitiveness on international markets and incorporate the macroeconomic cost of decreasing global demand for fossil fuel-producing countries’ exports. The impact on crop yields (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">44</a>) accounts for the growth of the agricultural sector over time, in contrast to the results presented in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>. Induced technological change is not included, which may lead to the cost estimate to be biased upwards. In order to attribute the impacts uniquely to climate policy, we derive the costs (as well as the co-benefits) of climate policy by comparing the NDC and 2 °C scenario with the REF under the same assumption for air pollution control (e.g. REF—FLE vs. NDC—FLE) and therefore exclude the costs of air pollution control technologies.
