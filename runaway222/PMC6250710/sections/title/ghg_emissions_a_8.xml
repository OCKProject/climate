  </span> is a global sectoral simulation model for the development of long‐term energy demand and supply pathways with worldwide coverage. Projections are made on the basis of exogenous economic growth, demographic projections, and energy resources for each region, with prices driving the balance of supply and demand and international trade for each type of energy. POLES-JRC describes energy and emissions balances for 54 individual countries and 12 regions; it identifies 14 fuel supply branches and 15 energy demand sectors, and &gt;40 energy technologies with endogenous technical progress. Energy-related GHG emissions are directly derived from the energy balances; emissions from the industry sector are calculated using marginal abatement curves derived from Environmental Protection Agency

  </span>, with similar sources for the assumptions on macroeconomic development and the same set of policies considered for the REF, NDC, and 2 °C scenarios. The full detail on GHG emissions per region and scenario is presented in the additional results. The REF considers current and announced energy and climate policies only up to 2020. The NDC scenario assumes attainment of the objectives put forward in the NDC documents with the time horizon of 2025–2030. After 2030, we assume continued decarbonisation effort such that at the world (not regional) level the rate of decrease of the emissions intensity of the economy over 2030–2050 is the same to that of 2020–2030. Importantly, the NDC scenario has been developed by scanning all NDCs submitted to the UNFCCC and incorporating explicitly the policy details on renewables, biofuels, electric vehicles, etc. The 2 °C takes the NDC scenario as a starting point and lower limit and considers a 2011–2100 global carbon budget of 1100 GtCO

Regionally differentiated carbon prices reflect common but differentiated responsibilities as included in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, negotiated at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 by assuming carbon price convergence only by the year 2050, with convergence speed depending on GDP per capita.
