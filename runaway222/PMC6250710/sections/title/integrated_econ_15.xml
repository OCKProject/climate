 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the economic valuation of co-benefits, we follow a hybrid approach that combines market and nonmarket benefits, mirroring the methodology recently applied in the literature assessing the economic impacts of climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>
  </span>. The market co-benefits for labour markets through a reduction of lost work days due to illness (PM
  <sub>2.5</sub>) and for agriculture markets via improved crop yields (O
  <sub>3</sub>) are fed into the global economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) model JRC-GEM-E3 to assess the broader economic impacts. Avoided lost work days translate to an expansion of the labour supply, while crop yield benefits are implemented through raised total factor productivity in the agricultural sector. The methodology builds on earlier work on air pollution

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">93</a>
  </span> and allows inclusion of feedback effects via firms’ supply chains, via households’ income, and via international trade. The impact of changes in competitiveness on international trade may be especially important for agricultural crops that are traded on global markets, while general equilibrium effects could be substantial for the impact through changes in labour supply because a rise in income generates additional demand for goods. The valuation of avoided premature mortality does not enter the CGE model but is monetised by using the VSLs discussed in the next section. For mortality, earlier work
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>
  </span> shows that the nonmarket component by far exceeds the market component (e.g. lost earnings).

 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The JRC-GEM-E3 model describes consumer and producer behaviour; represents government policies such as taxes, subsidies, transfers, and emission caps; captures endogenously the international trade flows based on (changes in) relative prices; and includes macro feedback mechanisms via forward and backward supply chain linkages and via labour market, wages, and employment effects. The model is designed to also estimate the cost of climate change mitigation policies, as presented in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a> and in earlier work
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. In addition to common baseline pathways for economic growth, population projections, and GHG emissions, the POLES-JRC and JRC-GEM-E3 are fully harmonised in terms of GHG emissions and the regional electricity generation technology mix in the scenarios studied. A more extensive description of the model and the mathematical expressions can be found in the model documentation

  </span>. The regional aggregation used in this paper is shown in Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">48</a>. The metric best used to assess cost and benefits in this framework is welfare changes in terms of equivalent variation, which measures the difference in expenditure needed to bridge the change in utility levels at base prices. The costs and co-benefits presented in this paper are undiscounted.
