The NDC scenario implements the GHG emission reductions and related policies in the Paris pledges, including the emission reductions that are conditional on other aspects of the Paris Agreement such as financing. Jointly, the current pledges represented by this scenario imply a likely increase in global average temperature of 2.5–3.2 °C, in line with the range provided by other studies

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
   </span>. We address the implications of air pollution policy uncertainty for the co-benefits by exploring three storylines. The Fixed Legislation (FLE) scenario considers no additional implementation of air pollution abatement technologies from 2010 onwards. In combination with a REF climate policy, this assumption implies that economic and population growth lead to increasing global emissions over time for all air pollutants, with the exception of carbon monoxide (CO), for which a rising trend is offset by ongoing progress in energy technology and corresponding efficiency improvements. Because high levels of air pollution provide a broad base for reductions, the estimates of the co-benefits of climate policy derived under the assumption of Fixed air quality Legislation will be considered here as an upper bound. A gradual adoption and diffusion of air pollution control measures is included in the Stringent Legislation (SLE) scenario, which better reflects ambitious recent policy objectives in fast-growing countries, such as China. In the Best Available Technologies (BAT) scenario, countries fully adopt the maximum technically feasible air pollutant emission reduction technologies by 2030. This hypothetical benchmark identifies how structural changes induced by climate policy can improve air quality beyond what can be expected by end-of-pipe air pollution abatement technologies alone. By implementing stringent air pollution abatement, the BAT scenario leaves less room for co-benefits of climate action and will be used here to quantify a lower bound for the co-benefits.

The figure shows that the temperature change relative to pre-industrial levels in the REF climate policy under more ambitious air pollution controls (BAT) exceeds the central case estimate (SLE) by 0.08 °C in 2100, while the higher end of the air pollution projection (FLE) implies temperature changes that are 0.32 °C below the SLE case in 2100. Hence, the end-of-pipe reduction of air pollutants with a cooling effect outweighs the decrease in air pollutants that contribute to global warming in our scenarios, leading to a net upward effect on global mean temperatures, in line with other work

Compared to the REF, the decrease in GHG emissions in the 2 °C scenario implies larger reductions in global mean temperature in the case of cleaner air (1.84 °C under BAT vs. 1.62 °C under FLE, REF—2 °C in 2100), since co-reduction of cooling aerosols plays a smaller role when stringent air pollution controls (BAT) are in place.

The gap between the NDC and 2 °C scenarios is explained by countries like India, for which the current NDC up to 2030 fails to capture the potential air quality co-benefits of climate action.

Using exposure–response functions (ERFs) for seven crop types, we calculate the crop yield impact of climate policy-induced reductions in tropospheric ozone mixing ratios. Projecting future changes in crop yield onto current values of agricultural output, we obtain the impacts shown in Fig.

The results for the NDC scenario highlight the areas where ozone reductions overlap with high production values of ozone-sensitive crops, such as maize, soybeans, and wheat in the US or sugar cane and soybeans in Brazil. Whereas the NDCs globally raise the yields of maize, rice, soy, and wheat by 0.4–0.7%, 0.1–0.3%, 0.8–1.1%, and 0.4–0.6% in 2030, respectively, more ambitious climate policy limiting global warming to 2 °C increases productivity of those crops by 0.8–1.5%, 0.2–0.8%, 1.8–2.7%, and 0.9–1.7% compared to the REF in 2030 (see also Supplementary Table

Estimates of monetary agricultural co-benefits corresponding to yield impacts for the year 2050 exceed 10$ per capita in some regions, when calculated using current-day value of agricultural production. Importantly, increased agricultural crop yields could contribute to reaching the Sustainable Development Goal No hunger (SDG2).

This result implies that air quality provides further justification to GHG abatement policies, in addition to avoided climate change damages, which are not considered here. Whereas crop yields and work days are reflected by a (agriculture and labour) market value, the avoided premature mortality is largely a nonmarket co-benefit, evaluated here by using the Value of Statistical Life (VSL). The low, medium, and high VSLs are heterogeneous across regions and grow with income over time (Supplementary Table

For comparison, we also include the results with a VSL that is homogeneous across regions and fixed in time at a more conservative value. Compared to an approach based on years of life lost, the use of the same VSL for all deaths may bias the valuation upwards when the population affected is characterised by relatively old age, poor health conditions, and comparably short life expectancy.

In order to attribute the impacts uniquely to climate policy, we derive the costs (as well as the co-benefits) of climate policy by comparing the NDC and 2 °C scenario with the REF under the same assumption for air pollution control (e.g. REF—FLE vs. NDC—FLE) and therefore exclude the costs of air pollution control technologies.
