  <p>Climate policy scenarios and corresponding energy systems. The figure shows greenhouse gas emissions, global average temperature change compared to pre-industrial levels, and energy consumption by source in the three climate policy scenarios. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Greenhouse gas emissions and median temperature changes over the course of the century. Median temperature changes in the case of Best Available Technologies (BAT) and Fixed Legislation (FLE) air quality scenarios are shown by dotted lines above and below the white line indicating the Stringent Legislation (SLE), respectively. Shaded area indicates 25th and 75th percentiles. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Total primary energy consumption by source. Other renewables include solar, wind, and geothermal energy. The percentage of solids, gas, and biomass energy consumption that uses carbon capture and storage (CCS) is indicated for the 2 °C scenario
