  <p>The value of the co-benefits of improved air quality due to climate polices in NDC and 2 °C scenarios. Values represent the average over 2015–2050 for Fixed Legislation (FLE), Stringent Legislation (SLE), and Best Available Technologies (BAT) air quality policies. Co-benefits include the value of avoided premature mortality as well as the co-benefits on the labour and agricultural markets via avoided work days lost and improved crop yields, respectively. The whiskers indicate high, medium, and low value of statistical life (VSL), heterogeneous across regions and time depending on GDP per capita. The black cross indicates results with the value of statistical life of 1.5 million US$(2005) constant across regions and over time. The shaded area presents the costs (change in welfare expressed as equivalent variation) of climate change mitigation policy over 2015–2050 and does not consider any co-benefits, nor does it include direct benefits of avoided impacts of climate change. Both cost and co-benefits are expressed per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions reduced excluding land use (change) and forestry</p>
