 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 463 invited employees working more than 20% in the nursing homes, 288 (62.2%) responded. Response rates varied between 56.9% and 72.2% across the five nursing homes. 30% of respondents were registered nurses, 47% nursing assistants, and 16% health workers. The remaining were kitchen, laundry, secretary, and “other” staff. The average proportion of items with missing values/not applicable was 9.4%. All items of the factor model were answered by 169 respondents. After imputation of missings, 288 health care providers had responses to all items in the factor model.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When comparing the two-level models (ward and responder) with the single level models, the exclusion of ward level weakened model fit for four of the six patient safety climate factors, Safety climate, Job satisfaction, Working conditions and Perceptions of management as indicated by changes in AIC for these four factors, where smaller values mean better model fit. For three of these patient safety factors Safety climate, Working conditions and Perceptions of management, there was significant score variation across the wards (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To check whether ward-level variation in 
  <a rid="pone.0218244.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0218244.t003">Table 3</a> might reflect staff background differences from ward to ward, and not ward differences in organization culture, we included the following individual characteristics: gender, age, length of work experience at the nursing home, and Norwegian as mother tongue to the two-level model. The inclusion of sociodemographic explanatory variables into the multilevel regression analysis models improved the models’ fit to the data considerably, as shown by the large AIC-value reduction for all factors, ranging from 384.6 for the factor Perceptions of management to 287.0 for the factor Safety Climate, as shown in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218244.s001" href="#pone.0218244.s001">S1 Table</a>. The included responder background variables eliminate ward level variation of the Safety climate factor score, but not of the Working conditions and Perceptions of management factor scores. For these two factors the ICCs even increased.
