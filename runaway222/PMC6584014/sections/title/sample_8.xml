 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is an observational study with a cross-sectional design. The study was conducted in all five nursing homes in Tønsberg, which is an average-sized Norwegian town and municipality with 42,000 inhabitants. Tønsberg was chosen as it was the first municipality in Norway to pilot the concept “Patient and user safe municipalities” for Norway’s national patient safety program. Recruiting the nursing homes for this study was part of the national pilot role for the municipality. The number of patients in each nursing home varied between 38 and 101. In total, there were 366 patients. In these five nursing homes 765 employees were nested in 34 wards. In our analysis, we did not include health care providers who worked less than/equal to 20% of a full-time position or were on leave during the study period (n = 302). In the latter group, most employees worked only one weekend every third or fourth week. Most of the remaining 463 employees were registered nurses or nursing assistants.</p>
