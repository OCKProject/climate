  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is an observational study with a cross-sectional design. The study was conducted in all five nursing homes in Tønsberg, which is an average-sized Norwegian town and municipality with 42,000 inhabitants. Tønsberg was chosen as it was the first municipality in Norway to pilot the concept “Patient and user safe municipalities” for Norway’s national patient safety program. Recruiting the nursing homes for this study was part of the national pilot role for the municipality. The number of patients in each nursing home varied between 38 and 101. In total, there were 366 patients. In these five nursing homes 765 employees were nested in 34 wards. In our analysis, we did not include health care providers who worked less than/equal to 20% of a full-time position or were on leave during the study period (n = 302). In the latter group, most employees worked only one weekend every third or fourth week. Most of the remaining 463 employees were registered nurses or nursing assistants.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The original version of the SAQ-A questionnaire was translated from English to Norwegian following modified principles adapted from Beaton et al [
    <a rid="pone.0218244.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref027">27</a>]. Based on a back-translated version, an expert committee made adjustments to avoid misunderstandings and adapt the questionnaire to the Norwegian nursing home setting. For instance, the original SAQ-A statement “Medical errors are handled appropriately in this office” was changed to “Medical errors are handled appropriately in this nursing home ward”, and “Nurse input is well received in this office” was changed to “Staff input is well received in this nursing home ward”. The pre-final version was evaluated by a group of health care providers in nursing homes. Based on their feedback, the final version of the Norwegian SAQ-A questionnaire for nursing homes was developed.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected in February 2016. Information about the study was presented on posters in the nursing home wards and in handouts to all participants prior to–and during–the data collection. Key administrative persons in the nursing homes distributed a paper version of the SAQ-A to the employees, and reminded them one week before deadline. It took approximately 15 minutes to complete the SAQ-A. We did include part-time workers, however, as this was a study on safety climate amongst employees, we excluded those working in very small positions ≤ 20%. To ensure confidentiality, filled-in questionnaires were returned anonymously in boxes placed in the nursing home wards. Questionnaires were scanned into an SPSS data file for analysis.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To protect the confidentiality of the respondents, feedback reports were only produced for wards with five respondents or more.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SAQ-A is a 62-item questionnaire where respondents rate their agreement using a five-point Likert scale. Before analysis, scores of negatively worded items were reversed, so that higher scores in the data set always indicate a more positive evaluation of the unit’s patient safety climate. 
    <a rid="pone.0218244.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0218244.t001">Table 1</a> presents 28 of 62 items of the SAQ-A for nursing homes, which corresponds to the measurement model of SAQ which has been tested and validated in a previous study [
    <a rid="pone.0218244.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref025">25</a>]. Items in the SAQ-A not covered by the six factors in the original model were kept in the questionnaire because they considered useful for local improvement processes and discussions. Factor scores for each individual respondent were computed as (mean value of item scores that belong to the factor—1) *25, so that the score”1” is transformed to”0”,”2” to”25”,”3” to”50”,”4” to”75”, and”5” to”100”.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To reduce loss of cases by listwise deletion of cases with missing data, single imputation of missings were done by multiple regression analysis with SPSS v.24. Imputation by multiple regression analysis means predicting missing values of variables, using values from several other variables. For each variable with missing values imputed scores were predicted by the five answers most strongly correlated to the variable in the questionnaire [
   <a rid="pone.0218244.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref025">25</a>]. Values were not imputed for those who failed to return a valid value by ticking the box “Not applicable”. We did multilevel analysis to quantify how strongly staff patient safety scores varied both across ward level and across nursing homes [
   <a rid="pone.0218244.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref029">29</a>] and estimate and identify how much of the variance in the data was at the responder level and how much at organizational level [
   <a rid="pone.0218244.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref030">30</a>]. Large variation at the organization level, as shown by a large intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), would indicate that patient safety climate scores vary between individuals in a ward-specific way and that patient safety climate improvement work should be tailored to address problems of wards with low scoring respondents. An ICC of 0.10 (10%) or more is commonly seen as indicating a strong clustering of scores by organization units [

   <a rid="pone.0218244.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref032">32</a>]. Three empty models were estimated, one including nursing home level and respondent level, one including ward level and respondent level, and one with only the respondent level. Models were compared by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), where smaller values were seen as indicating better model fit.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ICC was calculated using random effects with unstructured covariance structure, using the lme4 R package and in SPSS. Confidence intervals were computed using the bootstrap.</p>
