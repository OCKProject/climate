 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Patient safety improvement seems to be related to healthcare organizations’ ability to address and improve safety culture [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref002">2</a>]. Patient safety climate survey scores may show variation in staff perceptions across organizational units [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref003">3</a>]. Such variation may indicate risks related to leadership or other aspects of organization. That offers the opportunity to address patient safety improvement through organizational interventions, e.g. mentoring leaders to conduct patient safety walkrounds, or facilitate improvement board meetings and informal regular meetings where frontline staff may plan and evaluate implementation of improvement efforts [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref004">4</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref005">5</a>]. Patient safety culture involves leader and staff interactions, attitudes, routines, awareness, and practices that influence risks of adverse events in patient care [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref006">6</a>]. A cultural trait may for example be how leaders facilitate dialogue with staff to uncover negative relationships and behaviour, promote mutual understanding of the causes of adverse events, and establish consensus regarding safety priorities [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref007">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in safety culture in hospitals has been associated with variation in rates of adverse events [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref008">8</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref010">10</a>]. Studies have also found variations in patient safety culture in nursing homes, and associations with clinical outcomes, like the prevalence of patients injured by falls [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref012">12</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some studies have shown that safety cultures are less developed in nursing homes than in hospitals–which is a rather unpleasant finding, given that adverse event rates increase with patient age [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref013">13</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref015">15</a>]: nursing home patients are at high risk of adverse events due to their age, non-specific presentation of illnesses, cognitive impairment, complex multiple-disease conditions, polypharmaceutic errors and drug interactions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efforts to address patient safety culture in healthcare are widespread [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref016">16</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref017">17</a>]. Measuring staff perceptions of patient safety culture with safety climate surveys is a relevant approach. Safety climate is the measurement of perceptions of safety culture shared amongst staff in an organizational unit. Although staff perceptions of safety culture are influenced by their profession or role, and facility characteristics such as ownership [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref018">18</a>], valid safety climate measurements can identify levels of staff perceptions, the extent to which they are shared, and how they vary across organizational units. Such assessments may predict variability in risk related to tasks, work environment, staff behaviour, and patient outcome [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref019">19</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref020">20</a>]. They give leaders the opportunity to address cultural obstacles. One example may be that staff in some units feel that it is difficult to speak up about risks and short-cuts in patient care. Climate measurements will indicate such problems, which could be further specified by dialogue with staff during a patient safety walkround. Patient safety walkrounds are conducted by a senior leader or executive, and set up to deepen clinical staff and leaders understanding of risks in patient care at their own ward. Improvement opportunities could be addressed in the walkround by discussing what the safety standards should be, setting ward-specific quality targets and facilitating improvement board meetings. Additional improvement could be provided by establishing multidisciplinary quality teams to work continually with improvement [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref006">6</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref021">21</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref023">23</a>]. Modak et al developed the Ambulatory Version of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ-A) to measure patient safety climates in an outpatient setting [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref024">24</a>]. The original version included six patient safety climate factors: Teamwork climate, Safety climate, Job satisfaction, Working conditions, Stress recognition, and Perceptions of management. In the first report from our study, we confirmed that this six factor model could be identified in Norwegian nursing homes [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref025">25</a>]. In the second paper we documented factor score variations by age, gender, position, profession and mother tongue [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref026">26</a>]. The aim of this third paper is to explore the degree to which the Norwegian version of the SAQ-A identifies variation in safety climate perceptions across wards in Norwegian nursing homes. No clustering at ward level would imply that the entire variance in patient safety climate scores was across individual responders, and that, accordingly, no ward was a more promising candidate for patient safety improvement intervention than any other. Considerable variation across nursing home wards would imply that the SAQ-A is useful for identifying nursing home wards with high and low scores, and to steer patient safety improvement work towards work places with lower scores on specific patient safety climate factors.
