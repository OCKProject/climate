 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To reduce loss of cases by listwise deletion of cases with missing data, single imputation of missings were done by multiple regression analysis with SPSS v.24. Imputation by multiple regression analysis means predicting missing values of variables, using values from several other variables. For each variable with missing values imputed scores were predicted by the five answers most strongly correlated to the variable in the questionnaire [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref025">25</a>]. Values were not imputed for those who failed to return a valid value by ticking the box “Not applicable”. We did multilevel analysis to quantify how strongly staff patient safety scores varied both across ward level and across nursing homes [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref029">29</a>] and estimate and identify how much of the variance in the data was at the responder level and how much at organizational level [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref030">30</a>]. Large variation at the organization level, as shown by a large intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), would indicate that patient safety climate scores vary between individuals in a ward-specific way and that patient safety climate improvement work should be tailored to address problems of wards with low scoring respondents. An ICC of 0.10 (10%) or more is commonly seen as indicating a strong clustering of scores by organization units [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref031">31</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref032">32</a>]. Three empty models were estimated, one including nursing home level and respondent level, one including ward level and respondent level, and one with only the respondent level. Models were compared by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), where smaller values were seen as indicating better model fit.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ICC was calculated using random effects with unstructured covariance structure, using the lme4 R package and in SPSS. Confidence intervals were computed using the bootstrap.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To check whether between-ward variance could be explained by background differences among responders we applied a mixed-effects model with gender, age, years working in present ward and Norwegian as mother tongue as fixed effects and ward-level as random effect.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within-group agreement (Rwg) (
  <a rid="pone.0218244.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0218244.t003">Table 3</a>) was computed to analyze the extent to which staffs assessments were aligned within wards. Within-group agreement relates to how consistently employee perceptions in a ward are aligned, which may influence how climate measurements predict process outcomes and results [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref020">20</a>]. Within-group agreement values above. 7 suggest strong agreement and are considered adequate to justify aggregation. The within-group agreement analysis is based on a uniform probability distribution, which makes it easier to interpret [
