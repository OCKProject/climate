 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Staff perception of the Norwegian SAQ-A factor scores Safety climate, Working conditions and Perceptions of management varied significantly across wards in nursing homes. The results mean that these climate survey scores may probably be used to identify wards in nursing homes with high and low risk of adverse events. Patient safety improvement work in nursing homes should be guided by such measurements so that improvement resources are spent where they are most needed.</p>
