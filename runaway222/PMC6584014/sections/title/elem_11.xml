 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SAQ-A is a 62-item questionnaire where respondents rate their agreement using a five-point Likert scale. Before analysis, scores of negatively worded items were reversed, so that higher scores in the data set always indicate a more positive evaluation of the unit’s patient safety climate. 
  <a rid="pone.0218244.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0218244.t001">Table 1</a> presents 28 of 62 items of the SAQ-A for nursing homes, which corresponds to the measurement model of SAQ which has been tested and validated in a previous study [
  <a rid="pone.0218244.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref025">25</a>]. Items in the SAQ-A not covered by the six factors in the original model were kept in the questionnaire because they considered useful for local improvement processes and discussions. Factor scores for each individual respondent were computed as (mean value of item scores that belong to the factor—1) *25, so that the score”1” is transformed to”0”,”2” to”25”,”3” to”50”,”4” to”75”, and”5” to”100”.
