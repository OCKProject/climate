Measuring staff perceptions of patient safety culture by using safety climate surveys is a possible way of addressing patient safety. Studies have documented that patient safety climates vary significantly between work sites in hospitals. Across-ward variations in the measurements of safety climate factor scores may indicate ward-specific risk of adverse events related to patient care routines, work environment, staff behaviour, and patient results. Variation in patient safety climates has not yet been explored in nursing homes.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Objectives</title><p>To investigate whether the Norwegian translation of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire&#x02014;Ambulatory Version is useful to identify significant variation in the patient safety climate factor scores: Teamwork climate, Safety climate, Job satisfaction, Working conditions, Stress recognition, and Perceptions of management, across wards in nursing homes.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Methods</title><p>Four hundred and sixty three employees from 34 wards in five nursing homes were invited to participate. Cronbach alphas were computed based on individual respondents&#x02019; scores on the six patient safety climate factor scores. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated by multilevel analysis to measure patient safety climate variance at ward level.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Results</title><p>Two hundred and eighty eight (62.2%) returned the questionnaire. At ward level Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for the factors were 10.2% or higher for the factors Safety climate, Working conditions and Perceptions of management, 2.4% or lower for Teamwork climate, Job satisfaction, and zero for Stress recognition. ICC for variance at nursing home level was zero or less than one per cent for all factor scores.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Staff perceptions of Safety climate, Working conditions and Perceptions of management varied significantly across wards. These factor scores may, therefore, be used to identify wards in nursing homes with high and low risk of adverse events, and guide improvement resources to where they are most needed.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Akershus University Hospital</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6527-5636</contrib-id><name><surname>Deilk&#x000e5;s</surname><given-names>Ellen Catharina Tveter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005366</institution-id><institution>Universitetet i Oslo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hofoss</surname><given-names>Dag</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005036</institution-id><institution>Universitetet i Bergen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Husebo</surname><given-names>Bettina S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005036</institution-id><institution>Universitetet i Bergen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bondevik</surname><given-names>Gunnar Tschudi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for working with this paper.

Patient safety climate survey scores may show variation in staff perceptions across organizational units [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Such variation may indicate risks related to leadership or other aspects of organization. That offers the opportunity to address patient safety improvement through organizational interventions, e.g. mentoring leaders to conduct patient safety walkrounds, or facilitate improvement board meetings and informal regular meetings where frontline staff may plan and evaluate implementation of improvement efforts [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218244.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Patient safety culture involves leader and staff interactions, attitudes, routines, awareness, and practices that influence risks of adverse events in patient care [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A cultural trait may for example be how leaders facilitate dialogue with staff to uncover negative relationships and behaviour, promote mutual understanding of the causes of adverse events, and establish consensus regarding safety priorities [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Variation in safety culture in hospitals has been associated with variation in rates of adverse events [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies have also found variations in patient safety culture in nursing homes, and associations with clinical outcomes, like the prevalence of patients injured by falls [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218244.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Some studies have shown that safety cultures are less developed in nursing homes than in hospitals&#x02013;which is a rather unpleasant finding, given that adverse event rates increase with patient age [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]: nursing home patients are at high risk of adverse events due to their age, non-specific presentation of illnesses, cognitive impairment, complex multiple-disease conditions, polypharmaceutic errors and drug interactions.</p><p>Efforts to address patient safety culture in healthcare are widespread [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218244.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Measuring staff perceptions of patient safety culture with safety climate surveys is a relevant approach. Safety climate is the measurement of perceptions of safety culture shared amongst staff in an organizational unit. Although staff perceptions of safety culture are influenced by their profession or role, and facility characteristics such as ownership [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], valid safety climate measurements can identify levels of staff perceptions, the extent to which they are shared, and how they vary across organizational units. Such assessments may predict variability in risk related to tasks, work environment, staff behaviour, and patient outcome [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218244.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. They give leaders the opportunity to address cultural obstacles. One example may be that staff in some units feel that it is difficult to speak up about risks and short-cuts in patient care. Climate measurements will indicate such problems, which could be further specified by dialogue with staff during a patient safety walkround. Patient safety walkrounds are conducted by a senior leader or executive, and set up to deepen clinical staff and leaders understanding of risks in patient care at their own ward. Improvement opportunities could be addressed in the walkround by discussing what the safety standards should be, setting ward-specific quality targets and facilitating improvement board meetings. Additional improvement could be provided by establishing multidisciplinary quality teams to work continually with improvement [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218244.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Modak et al developed the Ambulatory Version of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ-A) to measure patient safety climates in an outpatient setting [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The original version included six patient safety climate factors: Teamwork climate, Safety climate, Job satisfaction, Working conditions, Stress recognition, and Perceptions of management. In the first report from our study, we confirmed that this six factor model could be identified in Norwegian nursing homes [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the second paper we documented factor score variations by age, gender, position, profession and mother tongue [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The aim of this third paper is to explore the degree to which the Norwegian version of the SAQ-A identifies variation in safety climate perceptions across wards in Norwegian nursing homes. No clustering at ward level would imply that the entire variance in patient safety climate scores was across individual responders, and that, accordingly, no ward was a more promising candidate for patient safety improvement intervention than any other. Considerable variation across nursing home wards would imply that the SAQ-A is useful for identifying nursing home wards with high and low scores, and to steer patient safety improvement work towards work places with lower scores on specific patient safety climate factors.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Sample</title><p>This is an observational study with a cross-sectional design. The study was conducted in all five nursing homes in T&#x000f8;nsberg, which is an average-sized Norwegian town and municipality with 42,000 inhabitants. T&#x000f8;nsberg was chosen as it was the first municipality in Norway to pilot the concept &#x0201c;Patient and user safe municipalities&#x0201d; for Norway&#x02019;s national patient safety program. Recruiting the nursing homes for this study was part of the national pilot role for the municipality. The number of patients in each nursing home varied between 38 and 101. In total, there were 366 patients. In these five nursing homes 765 employees were nested in 34 wards. In our analysis, we did not include health care providers who worked less than/equal to 20% of a full-time position or were on leave during the study period (n = 302). In the latter group, most employees worked only one weekend every third or fourth week. Most of the remaining 463 employees were registered nurses or nursing assistants.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Data collection</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Survey</title><p>The original version of the SAQ-A questionnaire was translated from English to Norwegian following modified principles adapted from Beaton et al [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Based on a back-translated version, an expert committee made adjustments to avoid misunderstandings and adapt the questionnaire to the Norwegian nursing home setting. For instance, the original SAQ-A statement &#x0201c;Medical errors are handled appropriately in this office&#x0201d; was changed to &#x0201c;Medical errors are handled appropriately in this nursing home ward&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Nurse input is well received in this office&#x0201d; was changed to &#x0201c;Staff input is well received in this nursing home ward&#x0201d;. The pre-final version was evaluated by a group of health care providers in nursing homes. Based on their feedback, the final version of the Norwegian SAQ-A questionnaire for nursing homes was developed.</p><p>Data were collected in February 2016. Information about the study was presented on posters in the nursing home wards and in handouts to all participants prior to&#x02013;and during&#x02013;the data collection. Key administrative persons in the nursing homes distributed a paper version of the SAQ-A to the employees, and reminded them one week before deadline. It took approximately 15 minutes to complete the SAQ-A. We did include part-time workers, however, as this was a study on safety climate amongst employees, we excluded those working in very small positions &#x02264; 20%. To ensure confidentiality, filled-in questionnaires were returned anonymously in boxes placed in the nursing home wards. Questionnaires were scanned into an SPSS data file for analysis.</p><p>To protect the confidentiality of the respondents, feedback reports were only produced for wards with five respondents or more.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Variables, scores and measurements</title><p>The SAQ-A is a 62-item questionnaire where respondents rate their agreement using a five-point Likert scale. Before analysis, scores of negatively worded items were reversed, so that higher scores in the data set always indicate a more positive evaluation of the unit&#x02019;s patient safety climate. <xref rid="pone.0218244.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents 28 of 62 items of the SAQ-A for nursing homes, which corresponds to the measurement model of SAQ which has been tested and validated in a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Items in the SAQ-A not covered by the six factors in the original model were kept in the questionnaire because they considered useful for local improvement processes and discussions. Factor scores for each individual respondent were computed as (mean value of item scores that belong to the factor&#x02014;1) *25, so that the score&#x0201d;1&#x0201d; is transformed

Large variation at the organization level, as shown by a large intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), would indicate that patient safety climate scores vary between individuals in a ward-specific way and that patient safety climate improvement work should be tailored to address problems of wards with low scoring respondents.

For Working conditions and Perceptions of management ward level variance even increased, indicating that actual ward differences were hidden in the empty models, in which staff age, gender, mother tongue and job experience were not taken into account. The significant clustering of the factor scores Safety climate, Working conditions, and Perceptions of management indicates that leaders can address patient safety at organizational level by using climate survey scores to identify nursing home wards with high and low climate scores. This is important for clinicians and patients in wards with lower scores, where the SAQ-A may identify potentials for and perhaps lead to improvement.</p><p>In general, 42 000 people with and without dementia are residing in one of the 955 nursing homes in Norway, most of them&#x02014;about 31 000&#x02014;in long-term care units [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The average nursing home has 44 residents (range 8&#x02013;200). The usual nursing home unit has 8 to 14 residents, usually in single-bed rooms (98%). Almost 90% of all institutions are owned and run by the municipalities, and more than 145 000 registered nurses and lisenced practical nurses are responsible for care and treatment. Nursing home care in Norway is a standardized service, available in all municipalities. It is paid for by the Government, which requires homogeneous provision of care for the frailest old. The included nursing homes in T&#x000f8;nsberg are comparable to usual nursing home standard, staffing and education level at baseline. However, individual variations for instance in connection with leader awareness and engagement are possible.</p><p>In a previous paper we already found that considerable parts of the patient safety climate factor score variations in hospitals were at ward and department levels [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. More variation was seen at ward level than at department level. We concluded that patient safety culture improvement efforts in hospitals should not be limited to all-hospital interventions or interventions aimed at entire departments, but also include involvement at the ward level, selectively aimed at low scoring wards. In the present study, we have found that the same principle applies to nursing homes. Improvement tools to help discuss measurement results are developed and have been shown effective in dealing with ward-specific patient safety problems [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218244.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>A strength of the study is that besides studying between-ward variance, we also evaluated the climate strength by calculating within-groups agreement, thereby quantifying the degree to which patient safety is a shared concern within organizational units. It is relevant when applying the tool in practical improvement work; the stronger the climate, the more it predicts care processes and outcome [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The Stress recognition factor lacked variance between wards. In a previous patient safety climate study in departments of non-psychiatric care in a Norwegian hospital no between-site variation in staff perceptions of Stress recognition was found [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. An explanation may be that the items reflect individual level attitudes and not a group phenomenon. Therefore, the factor is probably not useful for organizational climate measurements.</p><p>Staff perception of Teamwork climate and Job satisfaction were good in most wards, with little variation between wards. The variance at ward level for Teamwork climate and Job satisfaction was low and insignificant, indicating low between-ward heterogeneity. The results means that the Teamwork climate and Job satisfaction factors are less useful for identifying wards with improvement opportunities in nursing homes. This stands in contrast to a hospital study where the Teamwork climate and Job satisfaction factors produced significant between-ward variance [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The small ICCs produced by these two factors in nursing homes may be due to differences, e.g., in the presence or absence of medical doctors.</p><p>Hospital studies have found that medical doctors have significantly more positive Teamwork climate perceptions than do nurses [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218244.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The difference in Teamwork climate factor and Job satisfaction factor variance between wards in hospitals and nursing homes may therefore perhaps be related to differences in the composition of professions. The extent to which doctors and nurses expect that voicing patient safety concerns will be met with respect within their team may for example have an impact [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. That will naturally depend on interpersonal relations and support across professional boundaries to make patients safe. Positive experiences may create positive perceptions of the two factors as well as good relationships and trust between doctors and nurses. Bad experiences may, on the contrary, create distrust and negative perceptions of the same factors. In this way, measurements of Teamwork climate and Job satisfaction may expose how relationships between and within professions vary across hospital wards. In nursing homes, where differences in professional background are smaller, relationships between staff members vary less, which is reflected in little variance in the measurements.</p><p>In this study, we did not measure the nursing home care process, or its outcome. We therefore cannot validate whether variation in climate scores produces variation in care processes and outcome. This relationship has, however, been established in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218244.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It would also have been useful to have data on leadership practices regarding dialogue meetings with staff and the extent of patient safety issues on board meeting agendas [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. With such data we could have studied if the variation was related to leadership activities [<xref rid="pone.0218244.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The results in this study were fed back to each of the participating nursing home wards with five or more respondents. Each ward was shown its own scores and compared with the scores of all the other participating wards, the latter presented anonymously, so no accidental reader could identify the other wards. The healthcare providers and supervisors were encouraged to focus on specific factors related to patient safety in their own wards and to discuss possible strategies for improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Staff perception of the Norwegian SAQ-A factor scores Safety climate, Working conditions and Perceptions of management varied significantly across wards in nursing homes. The results mean that these climate survey scores may probably be used to identify wards in nursing homes with high and low risk of adverse events. Patient safety improvement work in nursing homes should be guided by such measurements so that improvement resources are spent where they are most needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0218244.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Ward-level variation in factor scores after inclusion of sociodemographic explanatory variables (gender, age*, years of employment at current nursing home* and Norwegian-or-other mother tongue).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0218244.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0218244.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Median, mean, minimum and maximum factor scores across separate wards for each factor.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0218244.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0218244.s003"><label>S1 Data File</label><caption><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0218244.s003.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the health care providers in the five nursing homes in T&#x000f8;nsberg municipality, Norway (Attendo Maribu, Attendo Marie Treschow, Eik sykehjem, Nes sykehjem and Tr&#x000e6;leborg bo og behandlingssenter) for participating in the study.
