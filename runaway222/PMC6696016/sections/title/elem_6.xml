 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the 49 unique citations identified in the initial database search; the screening and eligibility assessments resulted in a final set of 29 (See 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02662-f001" href="#ijerph-16-02662-f001">Figure 1</a> and

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. General Characteristics of Papers</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Key findings from exploration of the general characteristics of the solastalgia literature show the literature to be recent, multidisciplinary, and empirical in nature, and further, the Australian origins of the work is clear. All papers were published between 2004 and 2018; our results indicate that the number of published scholarly papers has increased over these 15 years (See 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02662-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02662-f002">Figure 2</a>). The concept of solastalgia was first introduced by Dr. Glenn Albrecht in 2003 at an Ecohealth Forum in Montreal, Canada, so it is not surprising that 2004 is the year when we begin to see publications. The year 2018 had the largest number of papers published (17%) suggesting a growing interest in solastalgia since the early 2000s. It should be noted that our review only covered articles published between January and October 2018, and therefore did not capture the full year. The use of the concept is not confined to a specific discipline; the solastalgia literature spans a wide range of academic disciplines, including public health, human geography, anthropology, and philosophy. Concerning geographic distribution among the papers in our final sample, there is a focus on Australia, which comprised half of all articles while another 19% of articles focused on the United States. The large proportion of solastalgia-related papers focused on Australia may be explained by the fact that more than half of the lead authors are situated in Australia and because Albrecht, who coined the term and still leads much of the work and discourse around solastalgia, resides in Australia. Countries in the Global South were underrepresented.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We coded papers in our review as ‘empirical,’ ‘theoretical/conceptual,’ ‘review papers,’ or ‘practice/policy focused papers.’ The majority were empirical papers (59%), 24% were theoretical or conceptual papers, and 17% were review papers. None were coded as practice/policy focused papers.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. How is Solastalgia Conceptualized and Applied in the Literature?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through the scoping review process, we sought to advance our understanding of how solastalgia is conceptualized and applied in the published literature. The data charting form included eight specific items to assist in answering the question (see 
   <a rid="ijerph-16-02662-t0A1" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02662-t0A1">Table A1</a>). We examined how authors define solastalgia in their work using textual analysis of verbatim definitions employed. Common elements of definition of solastalgia included: (i) a description of the transformation of the environment (i.e., unwelcome environmental change associated with resource extraction); (ii) a description of the place/environment being transformed (i.e., one’s valued home environment); and (iii) mention of specific impact(s) associated with the transformation (i.e., mental health impacts, depression). Textual analysis of the verbatim definitions illustrates that the words ‘environment’, ‘home,’ ‘distress,’ and ‘loss’ are the most commonly employed words when defining and describing solastalgia. Albrecht and his influential paper titled “‘Solastalgia’: A New Concept in Health and Identity” [
   <a rid="B1-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-16-02662">1</a>] is commonly referenced by the papers in our review when defining solastalgia. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also sought to gain a more in-depth understanding of the sources of environmental change resulting in solastalgic experiences as well as the terms employed to describe these sources. We found that there is a diversity of factors triggering solastalgia including extreme weather events, (e.g., Warsini [
   <a rid="B26-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-16-02662">26</a>]), resource extraction (e.g., Canu [
   <a rid="B27-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-16-02662">27</a>]), climate change (e.g., Tschekart et al. [
   <a rid="B28-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-16-02662">28</a>]), and political violence (e.g., Sousa [
   <a rid="B29-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-16-02662">29</a>]) (See 
   <a rid="ijerph-16-02662-t002" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02662-t002">Table 2</a>). Extreme weather events such as flooding, drought, or earthquakes are the most commonly considered sources of environmental change described in the literature. Some of the factors causing the negative transformation of places ‘acute’ in nature, leading to dramatic and sudden transformation with ongoing impacts, while others are ‘chronic’ and result in more gradual and subtle degradation of places. Climate change is also a commonly examined cause of environmental degradation and transformation; interestingly, climate change leads to both acute impacts (e.g., floods and wildfires) and chronic degradation of places (e.g., sea level rise). Examples of terms commonly used to describe the environmental change include: ‘cumulative’, ‘compounding’, ‘imposed’, ‘unwelcome’, ‘unwanted’, ‘dramatic’, ‘negative’, and ‘profound/intense’ [

   <a rid="B38-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-16-02662">38</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of understanding how solastalgia is conceptualized and applied, we also examined whether the papers in our review describe related concepts—i.e., alternative concepts used to understand distress and associated emotional, spiritual, or mental health implications of changing environments—and if so, which concepts specifically. Solastalgia is part of an emerging set of concepts aimed at describing and accounting for the implications of climatic and environmental change on mental health and wellness. This emerging set of related emotional concepts has been described as “psychoterratic” or earth-related states [
   <a rid="B30-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijerph-16-02662">30</a>,
   <a rid="B39-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-16-02662">39</a>]. Related concepts most commonly described in the solastalgia literature include ecological grief i.e., “the grief felt in relation to experienced or anticipated ecological losses including the loss of species, ecosystems, and meaningful landscapes due to acute or chronic environmental change” [
   <a rid="B33-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-16-02662">33</a>], and eco-anxiety, i.e., “anxiety related to a changing and uncertain environment...people become overwhelmed by the sheer scale, complexity and ‘wickedness’ of the problems we are facing" [
   <a rid="B31-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-16-02662">31</a>]. Other concepts discussed, but less commonly, include topophilia [
   <a rid="B40-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-16-02662">40</a>], nature-deficit disorder [
   <a rid="B41-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-16-02662">41</a>], and eco-paralysis. Most (75%) of the papers we reviewed make mention of at least one additional related concept. However, few papers provide clear definitions of these related concepts or outline explicitly the similarities and differences between solastalgia and these associated concepts leading to a lack of conceptual clarity in the literature overall.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. How is Solastalgia Experienced and Measured in the Literature?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A series of items were included in this scoping review to consider the details of solastalgic experiences, who is experiencing solastalgia, and how it is measured. To better understand the measurement of solastalgia, we focused on the subset of empirical studies, specifically (n = 17). Study populations were quite varied and ranged from geographically based residents of specific cities or regions, culturally identified subpopulations such as Palestinian women of the West Bank, and victims of natural disasters, such as volcano survivors, etc. Overall, there is a focus on individuals and groups that depend on and/or live close to the land, farmers for example. Notably, a single empirical study focused on youth as the specific study population of interest.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that a variety of approaches were used to measure solastalgic experiences in the sub-set of empirical studies. The most common was the use of qualitative interviews (n = 12). Five studies used surveys or scales. The Environmental Distress Scale (EDS), developed and validated by Higginbotham et al. [
   <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-02662">3</a>], is a key example. The EDS was informed by qualitative fieldwork in Australia’s Upper Hunter Valley, a region where open-cut coal mining has dramatically altered and degraded landscapes [
   <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-02662">3</a>]. One of the six components of the EDS specifically measures feelings of solastalgia using a set of nine Likert items (see 
   <a rid="ijerph-16-02662-t003" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02662-t003">Table 3</a>) [
   <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-02662">3</a>]; these items were used by the researchers to map the dimensions of solastalgia. The EDS was applied in two other empirical studies examining the impacts of living in an environment degraded by an extreme weather event [
   <a rid="B34-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-16-02662">34</a>,
   <a rid="B42-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-16-02662">42</a>]. A subscale of the EDS was also used in one additional study [
   <a rid="B43-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-16-02662">43</a>]. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With regards to the lived experiences of solastalgia as described in the literature, we examined whether gender dimensions were explicitly considered (using a binary yes/no item). Results indicate that only three papers investigated gender as it pertains to solastalgia in a meaningful way. One example of a paper with an explicit gendered focus is McNamara and Westoby [
   <a rid="B44-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-16-02662">44</a>] who considered responses to climate change among Elder women in a Pacific Island community in their study titled “Solastalgia and the Gendered Nature of Climate Change: An Example from Erub Island, Torres Strait”. We also sought to gain an understanding of the mediating factors theorized and measured in the literature (i.e., factors that affect the presence or degree of solastalgia in response to climatic or environmental change). Common mediating factors identified in our review include: sense of place, place attachment, powerlessness/sense of power, trust in government or industry, and uncertainty about the future. The focus on these mediating factors is likely informed by the conceptual framework outlined in Higginbotham et al.’s [
   <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-02662">3</a>] foundational paper which described environmental distress and human distress as a cycle where sense of place trust in government and trust industry were hypothesized as key mediating factors in response to environmentally-induced distress. Specific measurement of mediating factors, and quantitative work using population-based studies in particular, is lacking from the literature at present.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.4. How is ‘Place’ Understood in the Solastalgia Literature?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nearly all papers in this review (27/29) specifically describe solastalgia as a place-based phenomenon. Interestingly, despite the centrality of place in relation to solastalgia, few authors clearly and explicitly define what they mean by ‘place’. We found that only 14% of the reviewed articles provided a specific definition of place as applied in their work. We also found that only five papers clearly articulate a specific place theory. Moreover, ambiguity across key people–place concepts (i.e., sense of place, place attachment, and connectedness to place) is common.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Authors conceptualized ‘place’ in three main ways: (1) as a social-ecological concept; (2) as an ecological or environmental concept; or (3) as a political or geographic concept. The majority (66%) of the papers reviewed conceptualized place as a social-ecological construct. This idea is generally defined as an integrated perspective of humans-in-nature and part of place [
   <a rid="B45-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-16-02662">45</a>]. For example, Tschakert et al. [
   <a rid="B28-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-16-02662">28</a>] considered embodied experiences of environmental and climatic changes in landscapes of everyday life in Ghana and clearly articulated the interconnectedness between ecological systems and social systems. In nearly one-quarter of papers in this review, place was conceptualized as an ecological or environmental construct, i.e., as “a neutral backdrop or setting for human activity” [
   <a rid="B46-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-16-02662">46</a>]. The remaining 14% conceptualized place using a geographic boundary or political definition, defining place primarily by geography and location. We also found that place is described in myriad ways such as “ecosystem” or “traditional land” [
   <a rid="B30-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijerph-16-02662">30</a>]. ‘Landscape’ is another term used by authors to describe place. For example, Canter describe landscape as the “interplay among the physical attributes of an area, people’s conceptions and interpretations, and their actions and activities within the physical setting’’ [
   <a rid="B47-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-16-02662">47</a>]. Similarly, the landscape idea was captured by Pannell via the use of the term “geo-cultural landscape” [
   <a rid="B38-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-16-02662">38</a>]. The use of landscape emphasizes the interrelatedness between biophysical settings and social, cultural, or interpersonal meaning [
   <a rid="B2-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-16-02662">2</a>] while also articulating that places are imbued with meaning [
   <a rid="B48-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-16-02662">48</a>]. A specific aspect of meaning that is evident in the literature is the idea of belonging and attachment. Also noted was how people–place relationships may affect susceptibility; may make one more susceptible to distress from environmental or climatic change in other words [
   <a rid="B33-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-16-02662">33</a>].

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.5. How does the Literature on Solastalgia Engage with Indigenous Worldviews and Experiences?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The review team used binary codes to categorize papers according to whether or not they (i) include any discussion or analysis about how solastalgia relates to Indigenous worldview; (ii) substantively consider Indigenous people/communities in discussions of solastalgia, and (iii) discuss and/or account for the unique lived experiences of Indigenous peoples/communities. After the first round of coding and preliminary analysis, and after receiving feedback from the members of the International Solastalgia Collaborative, an additional item was added: a binary code to identify whether the papers’ research was conducted by Indigenous peoples and/or in partnership with Indigenous peoples (coded for empirical papers specifically).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 29 papers reviewed, nearly all (approximately 90%) examined solastalgia either through a western worldview or through multiple worldviews, rather than using an Indigenous worldview specifically (or multiple Indigenous worldviews). While none of the papers explicitly defined Indigenous versus western worldviews, our review team understood Indigenous worldview(s) to mean how Indigenous people understand the way the world works, and their relationship to it. Despite the diversity across Indigenous populations worldwide, many Indigenous scholars have attempted to articulate the common features across worldviews shared by Indigenous peoples across, including Simpson [
   <a rid="B49-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-16-02662">49</a>], who outlined seven principles of Indigenous worldviews in her 2000 paper Anishinaabe ways of knowing. Knowledge is holistic, cyclic, and dependent upon relationships and connections to living and non-living beings and entities. Second, there are many truths, and these truths are dependent upon individual experiences. Third, everything is alive. Fourth, all things are equal. Fifth, the land is sacred. Sixth, the relationship between people and the spiritual world is important. Seventh, human beings are the least important in the world [
   <a rid="B50-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-16-02662">50</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Almost one-fourth (24%) of the papers considered the unique lived experiences of Indigenous people and communities when discussing or describing solastalgia. Most of these discussions were rather general descriptions of Indigenous cultures and their relationships to land. For example, McManus et al. [
   <a rid="B51-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-16-02662">51</a>] explain that “the positive love of landscape and place is typically a more intense feeling/emotion for Indigenous people and people such as rural and remote folk who live closely to the land/soil. When a much-loved landscape is desolated, an equally powerful negative feeling/emotion is likely to be experienced” [
   <a rid="B51-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-16-02662">51</a>]. Throughout this paper we use the term “Indigenous” to refer to “communities, peoples and nations which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing on those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal system” [
   <a rid="B52-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-16-02662">52</a>]. However, it is important to note that, “Indigenous peoples have argued against the adoption of a formal definition at the international level, stressing the need for flexibility and for respecting the desire and the right of each Indigenous people to define themselves,” and therefore we have not imposed any definitions of indigeneity here [
   <a rid="B53-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-ijerph-16-02662">53</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, several papers do describe specific experiences of solastalgia by Indigenous peoples. McNamara and Westoby [
   <a rid="B44-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-16-02662">44</a>], for example, focus on the experiences of respected elders—women called ‘aunties’—on Erub Island of Torres Strait, concerning climate change specifically. In addition to outlining specific emotions, feelings, and mental health implications experienced by these women, the authors also assert that, “an intrinsic synergistic relationship connects the health of Islanders and the well-being of their land and sea country. Consequently, biophysical impacts have the potential to affect mental health in ways not often considered in non-Indigenous societies” [
   <a rid="B44-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-16-02662">44</a>]. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the 17 empirical papers in our final sample, we found that no research was conducted by or in collaboration with Indigenous peoples. Without study led by or conducted in collaboration with Indigenous people or groups, we cannot truly answer the question of whether or not solastalgia is a useful and or appropriate conceptual framework for understanding the lived experiences of climatic and environmental change among Indigenous peoples.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.6. Strengths and Limitations </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to map the published literature on solastalgia using a systematic process. A key strength of this work is the use of a systematic, transparent, and repeatable process. Also noteworthy, two independent reviewers assessed article eligibility (with very high agreement between reviewers) and data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second to minimize bias and enhance the robustness of our results [
   <a rid="B54-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-16-02662">54</a>]. Working with an experienced health sciences librarian and meaningful consultation with a diverse group of scholars, practitioners, and potential knowledge users at several stages of the scoping review process also enhanced the rigor of this study. There are however, several limitations that must also be acknowledged when interpreting the results reported here and when considering the implications of this work. First, our study did not search the grey literature, such that some characteristics of the emerging work on solastalgia—and practice- and policy-focused dimensions, specifically—may not be fully captured in this review. Additionally, not included in this review are solastalgia-related works of fiction, arts, popular culture, or the media. Second, we focused on English language publications only, which may have led to the exclusion of relevant papers published in other languages. A Spanish speaking co-author did search the Spanish literature and determined that there were no papers published in Spanish missed by our search strategy (as of October 2018). Third, we did not appraise the quality of individual papers included in our review. Although this may have allowed low-quality papers to be included in our review, this approach is consistent with guidance on scoping review methods [
   <a rid="B18-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-16-02662">18</a>,
   <a rid="B55-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-16-02662">55</a>]. Unlike systematic reviews, scoping reviews do not aim to assess the quality of papers reviewed [
   <a rid="B55-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-16-02662">55</a>]. Finally, we did not carefully consider the points of convergence and divergence between solastalgia and the range of other related concepts and areas of inquiry that also explore the lived experiences of loss, distress, and health consequences due to environmental change such as eco-anxiety, ecological grief, historical trauma, and mental and emotional impacts of climate change. This effort to focus may have led to the exclusion of a number of closely related papers; for example, ongoing work has identified sources such as Cunsolo et al.’s methodologically rigorous study combining EDS with qualitative methods on climate change among an Indigenous community [
   <a rid="B56-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-ijerph-16-02662">56</a>].
