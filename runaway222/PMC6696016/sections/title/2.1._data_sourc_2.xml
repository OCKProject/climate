 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the help of an experienced health sciences librarian, our team systematically searched 10 electronic databases using the keyword ‘solastalgia’ (in title, keywords, subject, and abstract). Specifically, we explored the following electronic databases: Web of Science, Pubmed, PsycINFO, GreenFile, PhilPapers, ProQuest, Scholar Portal Books, Embase, Academic Search Premier, and Academic OneFile. This set of databases was identified to cast a wide net and to ensure identification of all papers in the published scholarly literature concerning the concept of solastalgia in our search. Grey literature was not included in our search process. The database search was conducted in October 2018. The database search identified a total of 95 papers; after removing 46 duplicates, 49 papers remained. An adapted version of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram is presented in
