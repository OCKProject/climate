  <a rid="B35-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-16-02662">35</a>] argue that solastalgic experiences often come “on top of other economic and social stressors”, thereby exacerbating health disadvantages and inequities [
  <a rid="B35-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-16-02662">35</a>]. We certainly agree with this notion and see evidence of this in our review. The research aimed at understanding how multiple factors interact with the transformation of cherished landscapes, across both time and space, resulting in cumulative impacts on emotional, mental, and spiritual health is a priority moving forward. Integrating the work on historical trauma [

  <a rid="B79-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79-ijerph-16-02662">79</a>] into future solastalgia research could be a useful avenue for advancing our understanding of the cumulative nature of impacts. Historical trauma, understood as the cumulative and intergenerational experiences of multiple chronic traumas experienced by Indigenous peoples (and others) including, but certainly not limited to, land dispossession and degradation [

  <a rid="B80-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80-ijerph-16-02662">80</a>]. The emerging literature on the cumulative environmental, community, and health impacts of resource development (e.g., Parkes [

  <a rid="B6-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-16-02662">6</a>]) could also be useful for scholars aiming to examine the cumulative nature of health impacts that emerge as a consequence of the transformation of cherished landscapes.
