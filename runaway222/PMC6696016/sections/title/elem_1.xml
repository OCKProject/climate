 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A scoping review, one of many different forms of knowledge synthesis, was identified as the most appropriate review method for mapping the solastalgia literature for several reasons. First, solastalgia is a relatively new concept, and scoping reviews are most useful for examining literature that has not been previously reviewed [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-16-02662">17</a>]. Second, scoping reviews are useful for bodies of research that cross disciplinary and methodological boundaries, which is undoubtedly the case with the solastalgia literature. Third, scoping reviews are helpful for identifying research gaps and emerging research priorities. This review was guided by the framework for conducting scoping reviews outlined by Arksey and O’Malley [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-16-02662">20</a>], while also considering suggestions from Levac et al. [
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-16-02662">21</a>]. Therefore, we applied a six-phase process: (1) identifying the research question(s); (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) selecting studies for inclusion in the review; (4) data charting; (5) collating, synthesizing, summarizing, and reporting results; and (6) consulting with other scholars, practitioners, and potential knowledge-users [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-16-02662">20</a>]. It is important to note that in practice, these phases unfold iteratively rather than linearly. Also noteworthy, following the recommendation by Levac et al. [
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-16-02662">21</a>], the review team met regularly to review progress, address challenges, and discuss discrepancies. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four specific research questions guided the scoping review process: </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(1) How is solastalgia conceptualized and applied in the literature? </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(2) How is solastalgia experienced and measured in the literature? </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(3) How is ‘place’ understood in the solastalgia literature? </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(4) Does the current body of literature on solastalgia engage with Indigenous worldviews and experiences? </p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.1. Data Sources and Search Strategy</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the help of an experienced health sciences librarian, our team systematically searched 10 electronic databases using the keyword ‘solastalgia’ (in title, keywords, subject, and abstract). Specifically, we explored the following electronic databases: Web of Science, Pubmed, PsycINFO, GreenFile, PhilPapers, ProQuest, Scholar Portal Books, Embase, Academic Search Premier, and Academic OneFile. This set of databases was identified to cast a wide net and to ensure identification of all papers in the published scholarly literature concerning the concept of solastalgia in our search. Grey literature was not included in our search process. The database search was conducted in October 2018. The database search identified a total of 95 papers; after removing 46 duplicates, 49 papers remained. An adapted version of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram is presented in

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.2. Relevance Screening and Eligibility </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The remaining 49 articles were screened for relevance by reading titles and abstracts; a process which resulted in the exclusion of 3 additional citations deemed as irrelevant. Furthermore, the reference lists of the 46 remaining papers were manually searched to identify any additional citations missed from the database search. An additional 5 citations were added following the full reference list review for a total of 51 papers. Subsequently, eligibility was assessed by two independent reviewers using as a priori developed inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in 
   <a rid="ijerph-16-02662-t001" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02662-t001">Table 1</a> were applied to the set of 51 papers by reading abstracts and the full text. Discussion was used to resolve any difference of opinion between the two independent reviewers. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using percentage agreement between the two reviewers. Percentage agreement for article eligibility was 94.11%; more than 90% percentage agreement is generally considered sufficiently high to continue with a review process. A total of 29 articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in the data charting and synthesis process.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.3. Data Charting and Synthesis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The four research questions guided the data charting and synthesis process, and a data extraction form that was co-created by all review team members. Two reviewers independently pilot-tested the data extraction form using a set of four sample articles. The two reviewers then assessed the data extraction form for completeness, clarity, and ease of use. The form was modified based on the pilot-testing process. The final data extraction form included five main categories: (1) general characteristics of the paper; (2) conceptualization and application of solastalgia; (3) experience and measurement of solastalgia; (4) how place is understood; and (5) engagement with Indigenous worldviews and experiences. Each of these main categories contained multiple specific items for coding using either verbatim text extraction, textual description, categorical coding, or binary coding. (see 
   <a rid="ijerph-16-02662-t0A1" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02662-t0A1">Table A1</a> for the full data extraction form).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The full review team extracted data for each article using the finalized data extraction form and Google sheets software. For each paper in our final sample, one member of the review team acted as ‘primary reviewer’ and a second member of the review team acted as the ‘verifier.’ The primary reviewer and the verifier discussed discrepancies in their respective data charting processes and resolved any discrepancies through discussion. Finally, the reviewers used extracted data to tabulate, summarize, and synthesize the content using frequencies, percentages, tables, and textual analyses where appropriate. </p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.4. Consultation Process </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consultation with other scholars, practitioners, and potential knowledge-users (both settler and indigenous) was an important part of this study. The development of our specific research questions was informed in large part by knowledge gaps and priorities identified at a workshop entitled “Solastalgia: Investigating the nexus of climate change, place, and human well-being” which took place in October 2018 in Minnesota, USA. This workshop was inspired by place-based climate change research in the Western Lake Superior region [
   <a rid="B22-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-16-02662">22</a>,
   <a rid="B23-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-16-02662">23</a>,
   <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-02662">24</a>] including the North Shore Climate readiness project and the Twin Ports Climate Conversations [
   <a rid="B25-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-16-02662">25</a>] and was supported by funding from the University of Minnesota’s “On the Horizon” program. Participants included a diverse group of researchers and practitioners working on issues at the environment–health–place nexus in the Western Lake Superior region, and interested in exploring the concept of solastalgia, as well as research and practice concerning solastalgia more specifically. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the first workshop in October 2018, a more formal group formed, now calling itself the International Solastalgia Collaborative. “International” to acknowledge participation by First Nations people, Canadians, and Americans (and institutions from those nations). The International Solastalgia Collaborative met for a second workshop in January 2019 in Superior, Wisconsin. During the workshop, the authors of this paper presented preliminary findings of the scoping review and received criticism and feedback in a large group discussion. Feedback collected during the consultation process was documented and incorporated into the discussion and recommendations for further research presented in this paper. Final consultation took place in June 2019. The group was also invited to review and make comments on the manuscript at several stages throughout its development.</p>
