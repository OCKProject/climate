 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The remaining 49 articles were screened for relevance by reading titles and abstracts; a process which resulted in the exclusion of 3 additional citations deemed as irrelevant. Furthermore, the reference lists of the 46 remaining papers were manually searched to identify any additional citations missed from the database search. An additional 5 citations were added following the full reference list review for a total of 51 papers. Subsequently, eligibility was assessed by two independent reviewers using as a priori developed inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in 
  <a rid="ijerph-16-02662-t001" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02662-t001">Table 1</a> were applied to the set of 51 papers by reading abstracts and the full text. Discussion was used to resolve any difference of opinion between the two independent reviewers. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using percentage agreement between the two reviewers. Percentage agreement for article eligibility was 94.11%; more than 90% percentage agreement is generally considered sufficiently high to continue with a review process. A total of 29 articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in the data charting and synthesis process.
