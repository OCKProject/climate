 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to map the published literature on solastalgia using a systematic process. A key strength of this work is the use of a systematic, transparent, and repeatable process. Also noteworthy, two independent reviewers assessed article eligibility (with very high agreement between reviewers) and data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second to minimize bias and enhance the robustness of our results [

Working with an experienced health sciences librarian and meaningful consultation with a diverse group of scholars, practitioners, and potential knowledge users at several stages of the scoping review process also enhanced the rigor of this study. There are however, several limitations that must also be acknowledged when interpreting the results reported here and when considering the implications of this work. First, our study did not search the grey literature, such that some characteristics of the emerging work on solastalgia—and practice- and policy-focused dimensions, specifically—may not be fully captured in this review. Additionally, not included in this review are solastalgia-related works of fiction, arts, popular culture, or the media. Second, we focused on English language publications only, which may have led to the exclusion of relevant papers published in other languages. A Spanish speaking co-author did search the Spanish literature and determined that there were no papers published in Spanish missed by our search strategy (as of October 2018). Third, we did not appraise the quality of individual papers included in our review. Although this may have allowed low-quality papers to be included in our review, this approach is consistent with guidance on scoping review methods [

  <a rid="B55-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-16-02662">55</a>]. Unlike systematic reviews, scoping reviews do not aim to assess the quality of papers reviewed [
  <a rid="B55-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-16-02662">55</a>]. Finally, we did not carefully consider the points of convergence and divergence between solastalgia and the range of other related concepts and areas of inquiry that also explore the lived experiences of loss, distress, and health consequences due to environmental change such as eco-anxiety, ecological grief, historical trauma, and mental and emotional impacts of climate change. This effort to focus may have led to the exclusion of a number of closely related papers; for example, ongoing work has identified sources such as Cunsolo et al.’s methodologically rigorous study combining EDS with qualitative methods on climate change among an Indigenous community [
