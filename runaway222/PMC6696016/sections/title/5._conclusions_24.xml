 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Solastalgia is an increasingly useful concept for understanding the links between ecosystem health and human health, specifically, the cumulative impacts of climatic and environmental change on mental, emotional, and spiritual health. Given the speed and scale of climate change and the unbridled advancement of resource extraction, more and more people will experience the unwelcome transformation of cherished landscapes and solastalgic distress. Consequently, we anticipate that solastalgia will be increasingly applied, developed, and measured across a range of scholarly arenas. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study reviewed 15 years of scholarly literature on solastalgia using a scoping review process. Drawing on our findings, we have offered several priorities to advance the study of solastalgia and its application. Overall, we identify a need for additional research using diverse methodologies and data collection methods, across a greater diversity of people and landscapes, and conducted in collaboration with affected populations and potential knowledge users, alongside greater attention to the practical implications and applications of solastalgia research. Further conceptual clarity and theoretical development is called for. More work is needed to advance our collective understanding of mediating factors and to identify the points of convergence and divergence between solastalgia and related areas of inquiry such as ecological grief and eco-anxiety in particular. Two key outcomes of this study include our use of the landscape construct in relation to solastalgia and a call to better understand Indigenous peoples’ lived experiences of landscape transformation and degradation in the context of historical traumas. Finally, whether solastalgia is a useful concept for understanding the mental, emotional, and spiritual health impacts of environmental and climatic change from the perspective of Indigenous peoples themselves remains unclear. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As Albrecht himself reminds us, solastalgia is “a work in process” as the “novel effects of grand-scale environmental damage to places, hearts and psyches become evident” [
