 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A series of items were included in this scoping review to consider the details of solastalgic experiences, who is experiencing solastalgia, and how it is measured. To better understand the measurement of solastalgia, we focused on the subset of empirical studies, specifically (n = 17). Study populations were quite varied and ranged from geographically based residents of specific cities or regions, culturally identified subpopulations such as Palestinian women of the West Bank, and victims of natural disasters, such as volcano survivors, etc. Overall, there is a focus on individuals and groups that depend on and/or live close to the land, farmers for example. Notably, a single empirical study focused on youth as the specific study population of interest.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that a variety of approaches were used to measure solastalgic experiences in the sub-set of empirical studies. The most common was the use of qualitative interviews (n = 12). Five studies used surveys or scales. The Environmental Distress Scale (EDS), developed and validated by Higginbotham et al. [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-02662">3</a>], is a key example. The EDS was informed by qualitative fieldwork in Australia’s Upper Hunter Valley, a region where open-cut coal mining has dramatically altered and degraded landscapes [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-02662">3</a>]. One of the six components of the EDS specifically measures feelings of solastalgia using a set of nine Likert items (see

  <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-02662">3</a>]; these items were used by the researchers to map the dimensions of solastalgia. The EDS was applied in two other empirical studies examining the impacts of living in an environment degraded by an extreme weather event [
  <a rid="B34-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-16-02662">34</a>,
  <a rid="B42-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-16-02662">42</a>]. A subscale of the EDS was also used in one additional study [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With regards to the lived experiences of solastalgia as described in the literature, we examined whether gender dimensions were explicitly considered (using a binary yes/no item). Results indicate that only three papers investigated gender as it pertains to solastalgia in a meaningful way. One example of a paper with an explicit gendered focus is McNamara and Westoby [
  <a rid="B44-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-16-02662">44</a>] who considered responses to climate change among Elder women in a Pacific Island community in their study titled “Solastalgia and the Gendered Nature of Climate Change: An Example from Erub Island, Torres Strait”. We also sought to gain an understanding of the mediating factors theorized and measured in the literature (i.e., factors that affect the presence or degree of solastalgia in response to climatic or environmental change). Common mediating factors identified in our review include: sense of place, place attachment, powerlessness/sense of power, trust in government or industry, and uncertainty about the future. The focus on these mediating factors is likely informed by the conceptual framework outlined in Higginbotham et al.’s [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-02662">3</a>] foundational paper which described environmental distress and human distress as a cycle where sense of place trust in government and trust industry were hypothesized as key mediating factors in response to environmentally-induced distress. Specific measurement of mediating factors, and quantitative work using population-based studies in particular, is lacking from the literature at present.
