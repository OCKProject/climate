 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In early and foundational discussions of solastalgia, scholars took care to describe the nature of Indigenous peoples’ and non-Indigenous peoples’ relationships to the land [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-16-02662">1</a>,
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-16-02662">2</a>,
  <a rid="B30-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijerph-16-02662">30</a>,
  <a rid="B32-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-16-02662">32</a>]. In his early work, Albrecht [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-16-02662">1</a>] described Indigenous experiences of distress related to environmental change as amplified given that “they (Indigenous peoples) live through the destruction of their cultural traditions and their lands”. In many cases, Indigenous people’s sense of personal and cultural identity derives from their relationships with the land (including water and non-human beings). Indigenous peoples suffer from distress when their ties to those places (or the places themselves) change, inferring that such distress may be experienced differently than the place-related distress of non-Indigenous people. However, there are other factors—in addition to strong relationships with the land—that are common among Indigenous populations, and that may impact Indigenous peoples’ experiences of solastalgia. Indigenous people’s collective and layered experiences of historical trauma like land dispossession, colonization and forced assimilation, boarding/residential schools, and broken nation-to-nation treaties may also shape experiences and responses to climatic and environmental change, or the intensity of experiences of solastalgia [

  <a rid="B82-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82-ijerph-16-02662">82</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importantly, solastalgia may be an inadequate or even inappropriate way of describing Indigenous peoples’ experiences of distress related to changes to their cherished landscapes. In our consultation process, an Indigenous scholar asserted that “solastalgia is a colonized word, and using the term solastalgia (to describe Indigenous experiences) feels like trying to knock a square peg into a round hole. There are Indigenous concepts that can be used to describe solastalgia-like experiences better” [
  <a rid="B84-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84-ijerph-16-02662">84</a>]. In some applications, solastalgia has been used to describe individual, rather than collective, experiences of distress, emphasizing an “individualism and colonial isolation that settler colonialism fosters” [
  <a rid="B85-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-ijerph-16-02662">85</a>]. It is also important to acknowledge that there is an intimate and reciprocal relationship between Indigenous languages and the landscapes and places in which they develop: “Indigenous Knowledge comes from the land through the relationships Indigenous People develop and foster with the essential forces of nature. These relationships are encoded in the structure of Indigenous languages and in Indigenous political and spiritual systems. They are practiced in traditional forms of governance, and they are lived in the hearts and minds of Indigenous People” [
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-16-02662">49</a>]. Therefore, the concept of solastalgia may be best articulated in the specific language(s) of the peoples who are experiencing it. Albrecht [
  <a rid="B30-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijerph-16-02662">30</a>] provides some examples of this, including the Baffin Island Inuit term 
  <span class="italic">uggianaqtuq</span>, which has connotations of “a friend acting ‘strangely’ or in an unpredictable way”. There are other bodies of literature that use different conceptual frameworks and theories to understand and describe Indigenous peoples’ experiences of distress related to environmental change and loss, including historical trauma, ecological grief, and the mental health impacts of climate change (sources). The work of Cunsolo et al. [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-16-02662">13</a>,
  <a rid="B86-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86-ijerph-16-02662">86</a>] in Canada’s far North is an excellent example of community-led research examining the mental health implications of climatic change, in partnership with Inuit peoples. Another example is the research conducted by Rigby et al. [
  <a rid="B87-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87-ijerph-16-02662">87</a>], which explored the impact of prolonged drought on the emotional well-being of Aboriginal communities in rural Australia, in collaboration with Aboriginal partners. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of these critical considerations could be addressed through research led-by, or conducted in partnership with, Indigenous scholars and Indigenous communities. Non-Indigenous scholars and practitioners seeking to understand Indigenous peoples’ experiences of solastalgia may benefit from using “two-eyed seeing” [
  <a rid="B88-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88-ijerph-16-02662">88</a>] and decolonizing methodologies to inform and guide their collaborative solastalgia research. “Two-eyed seeing” is a framework that embraces both Indigenous and western ways of knowing in balance with one another and has the power to “reshape the nature of the questions we ask in the realm of Indigenous health research” [
  <a rid="B88-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88-ijerph-16-02662">88</a>]. Decolonizing methodologies encourage scholars to care for the land and stewards of the land while also encouraging critical questions throughout research processes to “enhance, rather than simply describe or define, the lives of Indigenous peoples” [
  <a rid="B89-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89-ijerph-16-02662">89</a>,
  <a rid="B90-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90-ijerph-16-02662">90</a>]. Ultimately, it is for Indigenous researchers and their communities to decide if the idea of solastalgia is useful to express experiences of negative environmental change or if existing concepts from Indigenous scholarship are more appropriate.
