 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the empirical papers reviewed here used qualitative methods, specifically interviews, to collect data on the lived experiences of solastalgia. Qualitative methods are undoubtedly appropriate and useful, however, the solastalgia literature overall would benefit from additional quantitative and mixed-method research. A specific area for advancement is further development, validation, and application of scales to quantitatively measure solastalgia. The EDS developed by Higginbotham [

  <a rid="B34-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-16-02662">34</a>] is a strong foundation to build on. Additional testing, across diverse landscapes and populations, and in response to a greater variety of sources of hazards (both acute and chronic), is warranted. Note, a number of masters and PhD studies have made use of EDS/solastalgia framework, and many of these have not shown up in the 29 studies (outside the scoping criteria); these additional sources may be able to provide support and/or critique to the use of the EDS [

Further, population-based studies using quantitative data collection and analysis methods could help enhance our limited understanding of mediating factors as described above, risk factors, and vulnerable sub-groups, while also helping to address an important and yet unanswered question: what is the burden of solastalgia at the population level?
