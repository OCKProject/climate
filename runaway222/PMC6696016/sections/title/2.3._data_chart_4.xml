 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.3. Data Charting and Synthesis</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The four research questions guided the data charting and synthesis process, and a data extraction form that was co-created by all review team members. Two reviewers independently pilot-tested the data extraction form using a set of four sample articles. The two reviewers then assessed the data extraction form for completeness, clarity, and ease of use. The form was modified based on the pilot-testing process. The final data extraction form included five main categories: (1) general characteristics of the paper; (2) conceptualization and application of solastalgia; (3) experience and measurement of solastalgia; (4) how place is understood; and (5) engagement with Indigenous worldviews and experiences. Each of these main categories contained multiple specific items for coding using either verbatim text extraction, textual description, categorical coding, or binary coding. (see

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The full review team extracted data for each article using the finalized data extraction form and Google sheets software. For each paper in our final sample, one member of the review team acted as ‘primary reviewer’ and a second member of the review team acted as the ‘verifier.’ The primary reviewer and the verifier discussed discrepancies in their respective data charting processes and resolved any discrepancies through discussion. Finally, the reviewers used extracted data to tabulate, summarize, and synthesize the content using frequencies, percentages, tables, and textual analyses where appropriate. </p>
