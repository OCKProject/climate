 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our scoping review process has underscored that the practical implications and the potential applications of solastalgia research are generally overlooked at present. Potential practical applications of solastalgia include its use in health and environmental impact assessment processes [
  <a rid="B51-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-16-02662">51</a>], clinical settings (i.e., social work, psychology), and climate change and health vulnerability assessments. How to integrate solastalgia into these practical arenas remains unclear and doing so will require further theoretical development in addition to the development of validated scales to empirically measure and monitor solastalgic experiences. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a rich scholarly history documenting that connectedness to nature is critical to health and wellness [
  <a rid="B91-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91-ijerph-16-02662">91</a>,
  <a rid="B92-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92-ijerph-16-02662">92</a>,
  <a rid="B93-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B93-ijerph-16-02662">93</a>,
  <a rid="B94-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94-ijerph-16-02662">94</a>]. Therefore, an important practical implication of a better understanding of solastalgia is greater recognition of the importance of safeguarding access to nature. Efforts to expand equitable access to nature must be taken as part of a response to the distress experienced by negative transformations of cherished landscapes. Our interconnectedness with nature may not only be at the core of our distress, but also key to coping with unwelcome transformations we experience. Given the centrality of place in the lived experiences of solastalgia, interventions aimed at responding to, and coping with, solastalgic distress will have to be informed by an in-depth understanding of people–place relationships across unique landscapes. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Key questions also remain in terms of how to address solastalgia. For instance, how can individuals and groups cope with solastalgic distress? Can the restoration of degraded landscapes help people cope with distress and enable healing? Can interventions focused on collective healing enable coping with solastalgia in ways that promote human and ecosystem health? These questions will be a central focus of the International Solastalgia Collaborative in the Lake Superior basin moving forward. We believe that responses to solastalgia have the potential to simultaneously heal human and ecosystem health while inspiring collective action against the structural forces underpinning climatic and environmental change; how exactly we can and should go about this in practice remains untested and under-investigated. We also believe that benefits can be derived from exploring the emotional dimensions of climatic and environmental change more fully. Emotions are defined broadly as “that which moves us” [
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-16-02662">39</a>]; it is often affect, rather than knowledge or information alone, that moves people to take action in the face of climatic and environmental change [
