 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.5. How does the Literature on Solastalgia Engage with Indigenous Worldviews and Experiences?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The review team used binary codes to categorize papers according to whether or not they (i) include any discussion or analysis about how solastalgia relates to Indigenous worldview; (ii) substantively consider Indigenous people/communities in discussions of solastalgia, and (iii) discuss and/or account for the unique lived experiences of Indigenous peoples/communities. After the first round of coding and preliminary analysis, and after receiving feedback from the members of the International Solastalgia Collaborative, an additional item was added: a binary code to identify whether the papers’ research was conducted by Indigenous peoples and/or in partnership with Indigenous peoples (coded for empirical papers specifically).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 29 papers reviewed, nearly all (approximately 90%) examined solastalgia either through a western worldview or through multiple worldviews, rather than using an Indigenous worldview specifically (or multiple Indigenous worldviews). While none of the papers explicitly defined Indigenous versus western worldviews, our review team understood Indigenous worldview(s) to mean how Indigenous people understand the way the world works, and their relationship to it. Despite the diversity across Indigenous populations worldwide, many Indigenous scholars have attempted to articulate the common features across worldviews shared by Indigenous peoples across, including Simpson [
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-16-02662">49</a>], who outlined seven principles of Indigenous worldviews in her 2000 paper Anishinaabe ways of knowing. Knowledge is holistic, cyclic, and dependent upon relationships and connections to living and non-living beings and entities. Second, there are many truths, and these truths are dependent upon individual experiences. Third, everything is alive. Fourth, all things are equal. Fifth, the land is sacred. Sixth, the relationship between people and the spiritual world is important. Seventh, human beings are the least important in the world [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Almost one-fourth (24%) of the papers considered the unique lived experiences of Indigenous people and communities when discussing or describing solastalgia. Most of these discussions were rather general descriptions of Indigenous cultures and their relationships to land. For example, McManus et al. [
  <a rid="B51-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-16-02662">51</a>] explain that “the positive love of landscape and place is typically a more intense feeling/emotion for Indigenous people and people such as rural and remote folk who live closely to the land/soil. When a much-loved landscape is desolated, an equally powerful negative feeling/emotion is likely to be experienced” [
  <a rid="B51-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-16-02662">51</a>]. Throughout this paper we use the term “Indigenous” to refer to “communities, peoples and nations which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing on those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal system” [
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-16-02662">52</a>]. However, it is important to note that, “Indigenous peoples have argued against the adoption of a formal definition at the international level, stressing the need for flexibility and for respecting the desire and the right of each Indigenous people to define themselves,” and therefore we have not imposed any definitions of indigeneity here [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, several papers do describe specific experiences of solastalgia by Indigenous peoples. McNamara and Westoby [
  <a rid="B44-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-16-02662">44</a>], for example, focus on the experiences of respected elders—women called ‘aunties’—on Erub Island of Torres Strait, concerning climate change specifically. In addition to outlining specific emotions, feelings, and mental health implications experienced by these women, the authors also assert that, “an intrinsic synergistic relationship connects the health of Islanders and the well-being of their land and sea country. Consequently, biophysical impacts have the potential to affect mental health in ways not often considered in non-Indigenous societies” [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the 17 empirical papers in our final sample, we found that no research was conducted by or in collaboration with Indigenous peoples. Without study led by or conducted in collaboration with Indigenous people or groups, we cannot truly answer the question of whether or not solastalgia is a useful and or appropriate conceptual framework for understanding the lived experiences of climatic and environmental change among Indigenous peoples.</p>
