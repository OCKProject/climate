 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.4. How is ‘Place’ Understood in the Solastalgia Literature?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nearly all papers in this review (27/29) specifically describe solastalgia as a place-based phenomenon. Interestingly, despite the centrality of place in relation to solastalgia, few authors clearly and explicitly define what they mean by ‘place’. We found that only 14% of the reviewed articles provided a specific definition of place as applied in their work. We also found that only five papers clearly articulate a specific place theory. Moreover, ambiguity across key people–place concepts (i.e., sense of place, place attachment, and connectedness to place) is common.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Authors conceptualized ‘place’ in three main ways: (1) as a social-ecological concept; (2) as an ecological or environmental concept; or (3) as a political or geographic concept. The majority (66%) of the papers reviewed conceptualized place as a social-ecological construct. This idea is generally defined as an integrated perspective of humans-in-nature and part of place [
  <a rid="B45-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-16-02662">45</a>]. For example, Tschakert et al. [
  <a rid="B28-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-16-02662">28</a>] considered embodied experiences of environmental and climatic changes in landscapes of everyday life in Ghana and clearly articulated the interconnectedness between ecological systems and social systems. In nearly one-quarter of papers in this review, place was conceptualized as an ecological or environmental construct, i.e., as “a neutral backdrop or setting for human activity” [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-16-02662">46</a>]. The remaining 14% conceptualized place using a geographic boundary or political definition, defining place primarily by geography and location. We also found that place is described in myriad ways such as “ecosystem” or “traditional land” [
  <a rid="B30-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijerph-16-02662">30</a>]. ‘Landscape’ is another term used by authors to describe place. For example, Canter describe landscape as the “interplay among the physical attributes of an area, people’s conceptions and interpretations, and their actions and activities within the physical setting’’ [
  <a rid="B47-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-16-02662">47</a>]. Similarly, the landscape idea was captured by Pannell via the use of the term “geo-cultural landscape” [
  <a rid="B38-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-16-02662">38</a>]. The use of landscape emphasizes the interrelatedness between biophysical settings and social, cultural, or interpersonal meaning [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-16-02662">2</a>] while also articulating that places are imbued with meaning [
  <a rid="B48-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-16-02662">48</a>]. A specific aspect of meaning that is evident in the literature is the idea of belonging and attachment. Also noted was how people–place relationships may affect susceptibility; may make one more susceptible to distress from environmental or climatic change in other words [
