 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Solastalgia was developed “to give greater meaning and clarity to environmentally induced distress” [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-16-02662">2</a>]. The past 15 years of research have certainly contributed to growing conceptual clarity and theoretical advancement, as well as a more nuanced understanding of the emotional, mental, and spiritual health toll posed by our rapidly changing world. Nonetheless, additional research is needed to advance conceptual clarity and the theoretical foundations of solastalgia further. Efforts directed at clarifying the distinguishing features of solastalgia and unpacking the points of convergence and divergence between solastalgia and related concepts such as ecological grief, eco-anxiety, nature-deficit disorder, and mental health impacts of climate change, are particularly important. In their review of ecological grief, Cunsolo and Ellis [
  <a rid="B33-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-16-02662">33</a>] have similarly called for additional work to understand how ecological grief relates to solastalgia more fully. Albrecht [

  <a rid="B65-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65-ijerph-16-02662">65</a>] has done recent work towards developing nuances of solastalgia, grief, morning, and related emotional states including a “psychoterratic typology” and describing what he calls negative and positive Earth emotions [
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-16-02662" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-16-02662">39</a>]; this is a strong foundation to build on to advance conceptual clarity and theoretical development.
