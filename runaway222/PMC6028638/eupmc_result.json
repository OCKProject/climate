    "In this study, a comprehensive investigation is carried out to examine the sensitivity of tropospheric relative humidity (RH) on monsoon depressions (MDs) under a changing climate regime through surrogate climate change approach over the Indian region. Composite analysis of four MDs show a persistent warming (RH2+) and cooling (RH2-) throughout the troposphere in the sensitivity experiments. In-depth analysis of a MD over the Arabian Sea (AS) exhibits sustained warming for RH2+, which is accredited to 2.6% increase in stratiform clouds accounting for 13% increment in heating, whereas 5% increment in convective clouds hardly contribute to total heating. Frozen hydrometeors (graupel and snow) are speculated to be the major contributors to this heating. Stratiform clouds showed greater sensitivity to RH perturbations in the lower troposphere (1000-750 hPa), albeit very less sensitivity for convective clouds, both in the lower and mid-troposphere (700-500 hPa). Precipitation is enhanced in a moist situation (RH2+) owing to positive feedbacks induced by moisture influx and precipitation efficiency, while negative feedbacks suppressed precipitation in a dry troposphere (RH2-). In a nutshell, it is inferred that under moist (dry) situations, it is highly likely that intense (weak) MDs will occur in the near future over the Indian region."
