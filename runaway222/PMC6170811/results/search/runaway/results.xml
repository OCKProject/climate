 <result pre="social groups are complex systems that are likely to exhibit" exact="tipping" post="points—which are defined as drastic shifts in the dynamics"/>
 <result pre="applied to these systems. Here, we summarize the concepts behind" exact="tipping" post="points and describe instances in which they are likely"/>
 <result pre="We also offer ways in which the study of social" exact="tipping" post="points can open up new lines of inquiry in"/>
 <result pre="living systems are hard to predict, we argue that probing" exact="tipping" post="points across animal societies and across tiers of biological"/>

 <result pre="responsiveness to the environment. Here, we introduce the idea of" exact="tipping" post="points, which have been used to better understand the"/>
 <result pre="the dynamics of complex systems in many fields. The term" exact="tipping" post="point was first used in the academic literature by"/>
 <result pre="cities [ 1]. Ecologists and climate scientists have since used" exact="tipping" post="points to better understand shifts in lake eutrophication ["/>
 <result pre="and coral reef states [ 4]. Although the idea of" exact="tipping" post="points has been used as a popular analogy for"/>
 <result pre="for sudden changes in social systems, the conceptual framework underlying" exact="tipping" post="points has not been widely applied to questions in"/>
 <result pre="questions in behavioural ecology. In this article we explain what" exact="tipping" post="points are, how they have been studied in other"/>
 <result pre="they have been studied in other contexts, and how the" exact="tipping" post="point framework could provide new insights and predictive power"/>
 <result pre="power into the study of animal behaviour. (a) What are" exact="tipping" post="points? Tipping points are drastic shifts in the behaviour"/>

 <result pre="of the lake's community. Other commonly cited examples of ecological" exact="tipping" post="points include sudden shifts in species dominance or population"/>
 <result pre="collapse [ 8, 9]. Similarly, in a social context, social" exact="tipping" post="points occur when small changes to the physical or"/>
 <result pre="to group behaviour or dynamics [ 10]. In animal societies," exact="tipping" post="points could be used to explain social transitions such"/>
 <result pre="transition between these states is density-mediated and catalysed by positive" exact="feedback" post="loops between population density, individual activity level, and serotonin-mediated"/>
 <result pre="group dynamics in these locusts. 2. Core concepts of social" exact="tipping" post="points There are several concepts that are needed to"/>
 <result pre="concepts that are needed to apply the conceptual framework of" exact="tipping" post="points to social systems. We describe these concepts here"/>
 <result pre="concepts here using an example. Social spider colonies exhibit a" exact="tipping" post="point towards violent infighting in response to heat stress"/>
 <result pre="this shift is conspicuously abrupt, which is diagnostic of social" exact="tipping" post="points ( figure 2). Figure 1. A hysteresis window"/>
 <result pre="suddenly to the alternate remaining equilibrium. In this system the" exact="tipping" post="points are at T 1 (when the system is"/>
 <result pre="the calm state and temperature is increasing). Figure 2. Social" exact="tipping" post="points are characterized by an abrupt change in behaviour"/>
 <result pre="on whether food is limited. One sign of a possible" exact="tipping" post="point is a change point in the data, where"/>

 <result pre="then applied to cases where food supply is high, the" exact="model" post="will have very large error. This reinforces the point"/>
 <result pre="very large error. This reinforces the point that the old" exact="model" post="is no longer valid for the new data if"/>
 <result pre="is no longer valid for the new data if a" exact="tipping" post="point has occurred. The three functions fitted to the"/>
 <result pre="above have all been used to estimate the position of" exact="tipping" post="points along environmental gradients, though the centre panel reinforces"/>
 <result pre="be required to explain system properties before versus after a" exact="tipping" post="point. (a) Behavioural states and environmental parameters Many animal"/>
 <result pre="internal parameters such as metabolic or cognitive factors. For social" exact="tipping" post="points, we deem forces acting from outside the group"/>
 <result pre="Environmental parameters can be abiotic or biotic. Most studies on" exact="tipping" post="points have examined abiotic drivers [ 3, 6, 14],"/>
 <result pre="Abiotic parameters include temperature, light, precipitation, oxygen levels, pH, aridity," exact="anthropogenic" post="noise, tides, and terrain [ 3, 6, 8]. Biotic"/>
 <result pre="or presence of parasites/disease). It is worth noting that many" exact="tipping" post="points may be driven by changes in several environmental"/>
 <result pre="disappear, depending on environmental parameters. In some cases, environmentally driven" exact="tipping" post="points may be irreversible. For example, events such as"/>
 <result pre="have vanished as a consequence of the system undergoing a" exact="tipping" post="point. In addition to the presence and number of"/>
 <result pre="of these basins of attraction determine the strength of the" exact="feedback" post="mechanisms keeping the system in a given state—the steeper"/>
 <result pre="this kind of perturbation is not technically classified as a" exact="tipping" post="point because the transition was not caused by changes"/>
 <result pre="governing the basins of attraction. The society moves through a" exact="tipping" post="point when a small change to environmental parameters results"/>
 <result pre="between the two types of perturbations is that when a" exact="tipping" post="point occurs, the underlying dynamics have changed and thus"/>
 <result pre="Tipping points: frequently asked questions (a) How can we recognize" exact="tipping" post="points? It can be difficult to recognize that a"/>
 <result pre="tipping points? It can be difficult to recognize that a" exact="tipping" post="point has occurred from observational data alone, especially if"/>
 <result pre="if observations are noisy. However, there are some signatures of" exact="tipping" post="points that one may recognize in their system of"/>
 <result pre="their system of interest. One signature is that when a" exact="tipping" post="point occurs, small environmental changes alter system dynamics so"/>
 <result pre="the regime has shifted. Although there are many reasons a" exact="model" post="may not explain data, assuming an equilibrium state, a"/>
 <result pre="data, assuming an equilibrium state, a potential indication of a" exact="tipping" post="point is when a model explains the data well"/>
 <result pre="a potential indication of a tipping point is when a" exact="model" post="explains the data well under some conditions but then"/>
 <result pre="then fails when environmental parameters change. Other possible signatures of" exact="tipping" post="points include flickering between behavioural states and delayed recovery"/>
 <result pre="states following perturbation [ 10]. (b) Are critical points and" exact="tipping" post="points equivalent? While the terms tipping point and critical"/>
 <result pre="Are critical points and tipping points equivalent? While the terms" exact="tipping" post="point and critical point are often used interchangeably in"/>
 <result pre="result of minor changes in environmental parameters. This makes all" exact="tipping" post="points critical points, but not all critical points tipping"/>
 <result pre="all tipping points critical points, but not all critical points" exact="tipping" post="points. For example, a system moving through a critical"/>
 <result pre="state as environmental parameters change, but a system with a" exact="tipping" post="point would have a discontinuity in the behavioural state"/>
 <result pre="allows for the possibility of hysteresis—a concept often linked to" exact="tipping" post="points in the literature [ 25– 27]. Hysteresis is"/>
 <result pre="environmental parameters in a system that has passed through a" exact="tipping" post="point to the parameters immediately preceding the change does"/>
 <result pre="to a calm state ( figure 1). However, not all" exact="tipping" post="points will exhibit hysteresis. Tipping points and hysteresis are"/>
 <result pre="not the case. (d) Are there early warning signs of" exact="tipping" post="points? One of the most challenging aspects of tipping"/>
 <result pre="of tipping points? One of the most challenging aspects of" exact="tipping" post="points is anticipating when and where they are likely"/>
 <result pre="general predictors whose presence is thought to anticipate an impending" exact="tipping" post="point. First, increased variance in a system's internal dynamics"/>
 <result pre="system's internal dynamics is predicted to warn of an approaching" exact="tipping" post="point [ 9, 29]. Destabilized dynamics, large swings and"/>
 <result pre="oscillations, or flickering between states all potentially convey that the" exact="feedback" post="that keeps a system at one attractor state is"/>
 <result pre="is predicted to decrease when a system is approaching its" exact="tipping" post="point [ 2, 9]. This is because the strength"/>
 <result pre="[ 2, 9]. This is because the strength of the" exact="feedback" post="that maintains systems in one state decreases as a"/>
 <result pre="in one state decreases as a system moves toward a" exact="tipping" post="point, and therefore the rate of recovery is slower."/>
 <result pre="behavioural outcomes prior to more dramatic state shifts. 4. Applying" exact="tipping" post="points to animal societies (a) What can be learned?"/>
 <result pre="of animal societies in a variety of ways. First, documenting" exact="tipping" post="points aids our ability to forecast dramatic state shifts"/>
 <result pre="parameters, which is required for conservation [ 30– 32]. Second," exact="tipping" post="points convey information about societies' comparative sensitivity to environmental"/>
 <result pre="societies' comparative sensitivity to environmental parameters. The presence of abrupt" exact="tipping" post="points, pronounced hysteresis, an inability to recover to baseline"/>
 <result pre="a system are strongly nonlinear. Additionally, in the presence of" exact="tipping" post="points, a system's responsiveness to the environment could appear"/>
 <result pre="appear deceptively small, save for the regions immediately around the" exact="tipping" post="point. Many systems therefore may appear deceptively stable, unless"/>
 <result pre="of conditions that trigger the system to tip. Third, scrutinizing" exact="tipping" post="points and their adaptive function may shed light on"/>
 <result pre="that societies may self-organize or evolve to keep themselves near" exact="tipping" post="points, so that they can respond dynamically to new"/>
 <result pre="advantages of both order and disorder [ 33]. Fourth, scrutinizing" exact="tipping" post="points across tiers of biological organization may help us"/>
 <result pre="dynamics that bridge tiers of biological organization. Fifth, knowledge of" exact="tipping" post="points can help guide researchers as to when a"/>
 <result pre="to predict system behaviour. (b) How can social properties affect" exact="tipping" post="points in social systems? Many social properties could influence"/>
 <result pre="points in social systems? Many social properties could influence whether" exact="tipping" post="points occur in a society. These include relatedness and"/>
 <result pre="as a lens to pose how social properties might impact" exact="tipping" post="points. Consider a hypothetical situation where the activity level"/>
 <result pre="mild to moderate increases in predation risk. However, at a" exact="tipping" post="point, even a distracted group will detect heightened risk,"/>
 <result pre="Relatedness and group size Group relatedness and size likely influence" exact="tipping" post="points. Relatedness has an impact on a variety of"/>
 <result pre="decreased exploitation among group members [ 34, 35]. Thus, social" exact="feedback" post="driven by competitive interactions may be less stable between"/>
 <result pre="(ii) Keystone individuals The presence of influential individuals impacts social" exact="tipping" post="points. For instance, the presence of leaders or reconciliatory"/>
 <result pre="the presence of leaders or reconciliatory individuals may prevent tit-for-tat" exact="feedback" post="loops from ever starting [ 41, 42]. In contrast,"/>
 <result pre="thus changing the environmental parameter values that result in a" exact="tipping" post="point and the feedback strength that underlies them. (iii)"/>
 <result pre="parameter values that result in a tipping point and the" exact="feedback" post="strength that underlies them. (iii) Behavioural diversity More phenotypically"/>
 <result pre="44, 45]. This, in turn, will shift the timing of" exact="tipping" post="points or cause a more linear collective response to"/>
 <result pre="a more linear collective response to environmental changes, i.e. eliminating" exact="tipping" post="points altogether. The so-called portfolio effect predicts that more"/>
 <result pre="diverse groups, there will be some environmental parameters that cause" exact="tipping" post="points in spite of any benefits. (iv) Social organization"/>
 <result pre="the space in which the interactions occur also likely affect" exact="tipping" post="points [ 29]. In groups that live in or"/>
 <result pre="exposed to specific environmental parameters will likely impact their future" exact="tipping" post="points [ 2, 6]. For instance, prior experience with"/>
 <result pre="tipping points [ 2, 6]. For instance, prior experience with" exact="anthropogenic" post="noise might prime a marmoset group and desensitize it"/>
 <result pre="such experiences will likely not be equivalent. (c) Organizing social" exact="tipping" post="points (i) Social scale Social tipping points can be"/>
 <result pre="equivalent. (c) Organizing social tipping points (i) Social scale Social" exact="tipping" post="points can be the additive outcome of tipping points"/>

 <result pre="(ii) Metabolic tipping points A system may pass through a" exact="tipping" post="point if environmental parameters drive individuals into alternative metabolic"/>
 <result pre="a nest site entirely. Another potential example of a metabolic" exact="tipping" post="point is when excessive cold or aridity causes collective"/>
 <result pre="heat and water in small bodied animals [ 55]. Metabolic" exact="tipping" post="points can be additive or synergistic. For instance, collective"/>
 <result pre="cannot share metabolic heat [ 57]. Other examples of metabolic" exact="tipping" post="points can occur because of contrasting hunger levels, fat"/>
 <result pre="infection status, microbiomes, and so on. (iii) Social or cognitive" exact="tipping" post="points Tipping points can also be mediated by social"/>
 <result pre="result in a synergistic shift [ 61]. 5. Why study" exact="tipping" post="points in social behaviour? Many disciplines already use the"/>
 <result pre="behaviour? Many disciplines already use the ideas and terminology of" exact="tipping" post="points to explore the properties of complex systems. This"/>
 <result pre="strengths can behavioural ecologists bring to the broader study of" exact="tipping" post="points? First, animal social systems provide us with the"/>
 <result pre="with the opportunity to observe interactions between individual-level and group-level" exact="tipping" post="points. Although this review pertains to social tipping points"/>
 <result pre="and group-level tipping points. Although this review pertains to social" exact="tipping" post="points in the dynamics of whole societies, individual organisms"/>
 <result pre="themselves complex living systems with metabolic processes that can undergo" exact="tipping" post="points in response to environmental parameters [ 62, 63]."/>
 <result pre="62, 63]. One can therefore probe the scale at which" exact="tipping" post="points occur by evaluating behavioural dynamics in response to"/>
 <result pre="or across groups of various size. Linking tiers of multilevel" exact="tipping" post="points is a problem already faced by the tipping"/>

 <result pre="versus ecosystem) might be intractably great in such systems. Social" exact="tipping" post="points in animal societies might therefore serve as a"/>
 <result pre="in which to develop and critically evaluate theory on multilevel" exact="tipping" post="points. Such individual versus group-level comparisons do not have"/>
 <result pre="comparisons do not have clear analogues in the application of" exact="tipping" post="points in the physical sciences. This opens the door"/>
 <result pre="[ 65, 66] and manipulate environmental parameters thought to cause" exact="tipping" post="points [ 13], thus allowing cause-effect inferences that elude"/>
 <result pre="studies on other living systems. General ecologists have used the" exact="tipping" post="point framework to explore contrasting ecosystem dynamics [ 2],"/>
 <result pre="many social systems, this is not so. Third, using the" exact="tipping" post="point framework has the potential to foster crosstalk between"/>
 <result pre="principles might underlie the presence, severity, timing, and recoverability of" exact="tipping" post="points across contrasting physical and living systems is intriguing,"/>
 <result pre="interaction rules, and therefore promise to inspire new kinds of" exact="tipping" post="point models, which often assume that interaction rules are"/>
 <result pre="While behavioural ecologists have potentially much to gain from the" exact="tipping" post="point literature, the intellectual exchange promises to be bidirectional."/>
 <result pre="animal societies—like other kinds of living systems—can be subject to" exact="tipping" post="points and that a better understanding of tipping point"/>
 <result pre="subject to tipping points and that a better understanding of" exact="tipping" post="point dynamics can help us to predict changes in"/>
 <result pre="crosstalk between fields of ecology that typically operate independently. The" exact="tipping" post="point framework in turn offers us (behavioural ecologists) a"/>
 <result pre="offers us (behavioural ecologists) a variety of opportunities. First, the" exact="tipping" post="point framework asks us to re-examine familiar topics—information spread,"/>
 <result pre="new perspective, which opens up new flavours of inquiry. Second," exact="tipping" post="points draw our attention to possible connections between the"/>
 <result pre="for generalizing principles across tiers of biological organization. Third, the" exact="tipping" post="points framework draws our attention to ideas from other"/>

 <result pre="tiers of biological organization, which permits basic researchers to probe" exact="tipping" post="points while simultaneously collecting data that could prove useful"/>
