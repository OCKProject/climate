 <div class="caption">
  <p>A hysteresis window depicting the relationship between group activity level (
   <span class="italic">y</span>-axis) in association with contrasting levels of predation risk (
   <span class="italic">x</span>-axis). At low levels of predation groups engage in social interactions that heighten group activity (1) but also distract groups from detecting small to moderate levels of predation risk (2). However, at some increased level of predation risk groups decrease activity and become vigilant (3), and extreme levels of risk will cause groups to go into hiding and cease activity (4). As risk dissipates, groups require a much lower level of risk to resume social activity (5).
