         <p>A hysteresis window between an environmental condition (e.g. temperature) and group
            behaviour (e.g. degree of infighting). This figure is modelled after a study on within-group
            conflict in response to heat stress in social spiders. Groups that have been in an
            agitated state (red) tend to remain agitated, whereas calm groups (blue) tend to remain
            calm. Therefore, there exists a set of intermediate environmental conditions (
            <span>T</span><sub>1</sub> &lt; 
            <span>T</span> &lt; 
            <span>T</span><sub>2</sub>) where a group can be either calm or agitated depending on its historical dynamics.
            In the lower panel, solid lines represent stable equilibria states and the shaded
            regions show their basins of attraction. The dashed line is an unstable equilibrium,
            which demarks the boundary between the basins of attraction. The upper panels (A–E)
            provide an alternate abstraction of this system: for a given environmental condition,
            the group response tends to a low point on the ‘landscape’. The bottoms of the troughs
            in the upper panels are therefore stable equilibria and correspond to the locations
            of the solid red and blue lines in the lower panel (see ‘
            <span>Y</span>’ label for an example). Tipping points occur when a stable equilibrium (solid line/trough)
            collides with an unstable equilibrium (dashed line/peak) and is eliminated—at this
            point the system transitions suddenly to the alternate remaining equilibrium. In this
            system the tipping points are at 
            <span>T</span><sub>1</sub> (when the system is in the agitated state and temperature is decreasing) and at 
            <span>T</span><sub>2</sub> (when the system is in the calm state and temperature is increasing).
