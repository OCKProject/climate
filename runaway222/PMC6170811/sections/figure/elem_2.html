         <p>A hysteresis window depicting the relationship between group activity level (
            <span>y</span>-axis) in association with contrasting levels of predation risk (
            <span>x</span>-axis). At low levels of predation groups engage in social interactions that heighten
            group activity (1) but also distract groups from detecting small to moderate levels
            of predation risk (2). However, at some increased level of predation risk groups decrease
            activity and become vigilant (3), and extreme levels of risk will cause groups to
            go into hiding and cease activity (4). As risk dissipates, groups require a much lower
            level of risk to resume social activity (5).
