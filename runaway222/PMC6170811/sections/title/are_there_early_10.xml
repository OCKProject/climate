 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Are there early warning signs of tipping points?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most challenging aspects of tipping points is anticipating when and where they are likely to occur [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C22">22</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C23">23</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C28">28</a>]. There are two general predictors whose presence is thought to anticipate an impending tipping point. First, increased variance in a system's internal dynamics is predicted to warn of an approaching tipping point [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C9">9</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C29">29</a>]. Destabilized dynamics, large swings and oscillations, or flickering between states all potentially convey that the feedback that keeps a system at one attractor state is weakening, which allows the system to wander farther from the attractor. Second, the speed of recovery to baseline conditions is predicted to decrease when a system is approaching its tipping point [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C2">2</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C9">9</a>]. This is because the strength of the feedback that maintains systems in one state decreases as a system moves toward a tipping point, and therefore the rate of recovery is slower. In behaviour, there may be other warning signs based on individual-level characteristics, or early behavioural outcomes prior to more dramatic state shifts.
