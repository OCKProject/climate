      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many animal social systems are capable of exhibiting multiple qualitatively distinct
         states. We refer to these as 
         <span>behavioural states</span>, such as the calm (blue) and agitated (red) colony states in the spiders in 
         <a>figure 1</a>. The behavioural state expressed is dictated by the system's dynamics as well as
         
         <span>environmental parameters</span> such as humidity or temperature (
         <a>figure 1</a>, 
         <span>x</span>-axis) and 
         <span>internal parameters</span> such as metabolic or cognitive factors. For social tipping points, we deem forces
         acting from outside the group to be 
         <span>environmental parameters</span> and forces emerging from within the group as 
         <span>internal parameters</span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental parameters can be abiotic or biotic. Most studies on tipping points
         have examined abiotic drivers [
         <a>3</a>,
         <a>6</a>,
         <a>14</a>], whereas relatively few have examined biotic drivers, social or otherwise. Abiotic
         parameters include temperature, light, precipitation, oxygen levels, pH, aridity,
         anthropogenic noise, tides, and terrain [
         <a>3</a>,
         <a>6</a>,
         <a>8</a>]. Biotic parameters can be social (e.g. the number or collective phenotypes of nearby
         groups) or nonsocial (e.g. predation threat, food availability, or presence of parasites/disease).
         It is worth noting that many tipping points may be driven by changes in several environmental
         parameters, such as the combination of heat and UV exposure. Because of the potential
         combined effects, it is important to consider to what degree phenomena like priming,
         enhanced lethality of multiple stressors, or cross-tolerance affect group behaviour
         [
         <a>15</a>–
         <a>18</a>]. Multiple interacting environmental parameters could be grouped into functionally
         similar groups based on their properties or because of the shared effects that they
         have on social groups.
