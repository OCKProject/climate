      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Up to this point we have presented behavioural states as categorical (such as calm
         and agitated), but behaviours can actually be more fluid. For example, a spider may
         be slightly irritated, but not fully agitated. As time progresses, the spider may
         become calm or agitated, depending on environmental parameters. In this example, the
         categorical states of calm and agitated are referred to as 
         <span>attractors</span> and the set of fluid states that tend towards these categorical states are these
         attractors' 
         <span>basins of attraction</span>. In 
         <a>figure 1</a>, the solid red and blue lines depict the agitated and calm attractors for a range
         of environmental parameters (here, temperature). The lighter shaded areas in 
         <a>figure 1</a> are the basins of attraction for these two attractors. For intermediate environmental
         parameters, two attractors exist. At very low temperatures, there is only one attractor,
         the calm state, while at very high temperatures, only the agitated attractor exists.
         It is important to emphasize that attractors can appear and disappear, depending on
         environmental parameters.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In some cases, environmentally driven tipping points may be irreversible. For example,
         events such as the onset of sex change in sequential hermaphrodites [
         <a>19</a>], the onset of epidemic spawning in marine invertebrates [
         <a>20</a>], or the emergence of sexual alates in social insects [
         <a>21</a>] can be one-way transitions in behavioural state driven by minor perturbations to
         environmental parameters. In these cases, the former attractors have vanished as a
         consequence of the system undergoing a tipping point.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the presence and number of attractors, the landscape of attraction
         can vary. In 
         <a>figure 1</a>, this is depicted with the landscape slices above the main figure which show how
         the geometry of the basins of attraction are modified as environmental parameters
         change. In each case, the blue or red balls indicate the attractors at the bottom
         of wells symbolizing the basins of attraction. The steepness of the walls of these
         basins of attraction determine the strength of the feedback mechanisms keeping the
         system in a given state—the steeper the walls of the wells, the quicker the system
         returns to the attractor state and the more resistant the state is to noise. When
         the wells are shallow, the system returns to the attractor more slowly and drifts
         more widely in response to noise [
         <a>9</a>,
         <a>22</a>,
         <a>23</a>].
