      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A system may pass through a tipping point if environmental parameters drive individuals
         into alternative metabolic states that affect individuals' behaviour. For example,
         excessive heat can force social ectotherms into collective activity either to cool
         themselves, like collective fanning behaviour in honeybees [
         <a>54</a>], or to evacuate a nest site entirely. Another potential example of a metabolic tipping
         point is when excessive cold or aridity causes collective huddling to preserve heat
         and water in small bodied animals [
         <a>55</a>]. Metabolic tipping points can be additive or synergistic. For instance, collective
         huddling behaviour may enable groups of homeotherms to remain socially active in environments
         that exceed the thresholds of each individual in isolation [
         <a>56</a>]. In contrast, social ectotherms may exhibit a more additive response because constituents
         cannot share metabolic heat [
         <a>57</a>]. Other examples of metabolic tipping points can occur because of contrasting hunger
         levels, fat stores, hypoxia, exposure to contaminants, infection status, microbiomes,
         and so on.
