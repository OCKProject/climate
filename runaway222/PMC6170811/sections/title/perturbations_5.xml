 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are two fundamentally different ways that a system can be perturbed. Either the behavioural state or the environmental parameters can be perturbed. To think about the effect of perturbations to the behavioural state, consider a single slice of the landscape of attractors in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F1" href="#RSPB20181282F1">figure 1</a>. When the behavioural state is perturbed, envision the system as one of the coloured balls that are subject to that particular landscape. If the ball is perturbed enough that it moves to another basin of attraction then the system undergoes a behavioural state change. However, this kind of perturbation is not technically classified as a tipping point because the transition was not caused by changes to the external environment. In contrast, when an environmental parameter changes, the landscape itself changes, which can alter the existence of attractors and the shapes of their basins of attraction. In 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F1" href="#RSPB20181282F1">figure 1</a>, this is depicted by the series of slices showing the landscapes governing the basins of attraction. The society moves through a tipping point when a small change to environmental parameters results in a drastic enough modification to the attractor landscape that the society is now in an alternative basin of attraction. A critical difference between the two types of perturbations is that when a tipping point occurs, the underlying dynamics have changed and thus the previous regime's models and data are no longer effective in describing the new regime.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attractor states are not necessarily advantageous or disadvantageous. For example, social groups might proceed from a relatively calm cooperative stable state to disbandment or collapse due to infighting or cheating [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C14">14</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C24">24</a>]. However, a system might also switch between two states that perform equally well. The alternative states might even be part of a system's life history. Thus, attractor states are not necessarily evolutionary stable states (ESS) nor adaptive peaks in a fitness landscape, nor do they necessarily have negative consequences for social groups.
