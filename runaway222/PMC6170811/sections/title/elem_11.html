         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points can inform our understanding of animal societies in a variety of ways.
            First, documenting tipping points aids our ability to forecast dramatic state shifts
            in animal behaviour [
            <a>29</a>]. This, in turn, can help us to predict how societies will change in response to
            environmental parameters, which is required for conservation [
            <a>30</a>–
            <a>32</a>]. Second, tipping points convey information about societies' comparative sensitivity
            to environmental parameters. The presence of abrupt tipping points, pronounced hysteresis,
            an inability to recover to baseline dynamics following perturbation, and large differences
            in behavioural states all convey that the internal dynamics driving a system are strongly
            nonlinear. Additionally, in the presence of tipping points, a system's responsiveness
            to the environment could appear deceptively small, save for the regions immediately
            around the tipping point. Many systems therefore may appear deceptively stable, unless
            one specifically interrogates the limited set of conditions that trigger the system
            to tip. Third, scrutinizing tipping points and their adaptive function may shed light
            on how social groups are capable of incredible behavioural flexibility. For example,
            there is evidence that societies may self-organize or evolve to keep themselves near
            tipping points, so that they can respond dynamically to new information or environmental
            challenges [
            <a>27</a>,
            <a>33</a>] and potentially maximize the adaptive advantages of both order and disorder [
            <a>33</a>]. Fourth, scrutinizing tipping points across tiers of biological organization may
            help us to determine whether there are generalizable features about their dynamics
            that bridge tiers of biological organization. Fifth, knowledge of tipping points can
            help guide researchers as to when a new modelling paradigm may be necessary to predict
            system behaviour.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many social properties could influence whether tipping points occur in a society.
            These include relatedness and group size, presence of keystone individuals, within-group
            behavioural diversity, group social organization, and groups' prior experience. In
            this section, we present a hypothetical example and then use it as a lens to pose
            how social properties might impact tipping points.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consider a hypothetical situation where the activity level of a group of marmosets
            depends on the level of predation risk (
            <a>figure 3</a>). When predation risk is low, groups are socially active and have a chance of entering
            distracted social states. Distracted states may emerge when one individual steals
            fruit or chases another individual, resulting in a competitive tit-for-tat game. Once
            initiated, social activity can keep a group in an active and distracted state despite
            mild to moderate increases in predation risk. However, at a tipping point, even a
            distracted group will detect heightened risk, and activity will decrease in favour
            of vigilance. Returning back to social activity will then require a large decrease
            in predation risk because vigilance renders a group sensitive to even moderate risk.
            Thus, under some conditions, whether a group will be active or inactive will depend
            on its prior state (distracted versus vigilant), creating a hysteresis window. 
            
            <div><span>Figure 3.</span><div>
                  <p>A hysteresis window depicting the relationship between group activity level (
                     <span>y</span>-axis) in association with contrasting levels of predation risk (
                     <span>x</span>-axis). At low levels of predation groups engage in social interactions that heighten
                     group activity (1) but also distract groups from detecting small to moderate levels
                     of predation risk (2). However, at some increased level of predation risk groups decrease
                     activity and become vigilant (3), and extreme levels of risk will cause groups to
                     go into hiding and cease activity (4). As risk dissipates, groups require a much lower
                     level of risk to resume social activity (5).

         <div class="sec" title="sec"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(i)</span><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relatedness and group size</div>
            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Group relatedness and size likely influence tipping points. Relatedness has an impact
               on a variety of social outcomes, including increased prosocial behaviour and decreased
               exploitation among group members [
               <a>34</a>,
               <a>35</a>]. Thus, social feedback driven by competitive interactions may be less stable between
               relatives [
               <a>36</a>]. Kin groups may also be more likely to share information about predation risk even
               at risk to themselves, for instance, via alarm calls [
               <a>37</a>,
               <a>38</a>]. Group size is also likely to impact the above scenario. Increasing group size could
               augment competitive interactions and keep individuals in a distracted state for longer.
               Larger groups may also compete more [
               <a>39</a>] and this could increase group distraction. Yet, larger groups also have more individuals
               with which to detect changes in the environment and share information [
               <a>27</a>,
               <a>40</a>]. The net effect of group size may therefore depend on the degree to which social
               interactions impede individuals' probability of detecting risk and the degree of information
               sharing.

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The presence of influential individuals impacts social tipping points. For instance,
               the presence of leaders or reconciliatory individuals may prevent tit-for-tat feedback
               loops from ever starting [
               <a>41</a>,
               <a>42</a>]. In contrast, the presence of particularly aggressive, hungry, or bold individuals
               could increase within-group conflict [
               <a>43</a>], thus changing the environmental parameter values that result in a tipping point
               and the feedback strength that underlies them.

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More phenotypically diverse systems are predicted to be more resistant to and resilient
               from environmental stress [
               <a>44</a>,
               <a>45</a>]. This, in turn, will shift the timing of tipping points or cause a more linear collective
               response to environmental changes, i.e. eliminating tipping points altogether. The
               so-called 
               <span>portfolio effect</span> predicts that more diverse groups will have increased odds that at least some constituents
               can endure novel environments, and therefore, maintain group-level properties [
               <a>46</a>]. In contrast, homogeneous groups run the risk of all individuals possessing the
               same sensitivities, making abrupt collective state shifts more likely. However, even
               for diverse groups, there will be some environmental parameters that cause tipping
               points in spite of any benefits.

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The social structure of our marmoset groups and the space in which the interactions
               occur also likely affect tipping points [
               <a>29</a>]. In groups that live in or build structures, such as nests, the geometry of these
               spaces can determine the kinds of interactions that individuals engage in, the degree
               of competition among group members, risk of predation, environmental sensitivity,
               and so on [
               <a>47</a>]. Nests also provide some homeostatic benefits to their residents [
               <a>48</a>], which will likely impact the susceptibility of groups to changes in environmental
               parameters. For groups that live in more open environments, geographical constraints
               such as rivers, matrix habitat, and localized resources such as fruit trees will impact
               individuals' position in space and therefore the structure of social networks [
               <a>49</a>]. Networks, in turn, will shape whether and how individuals interact and influence
               each other's behaviour [

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whether or not social groups have previously been exposed to specific environmental
               parameters will likely impact their future tipping points [
               <a>2</a>,
               <a>6</a>]. For instance, prior experience with anthropogenic noise might prime a marmoset
               group and desensitize it to subsequent noise exposure [
               <a>51</a>]. In the related concept of cross-tolerance [
               <a>52</a>], experience with one stressor can increase the system's resistance to other stressors.
               The predicted outcome is similar to that of priming but differs in that stressors
               can appear interchangeable. A final stressor query is whether the social context of
               prior experience matters. For instance, the effects of prior experience may depend
               on whether individuals acquired their experience in isolation, in a group setting,
               or in a group setting that differs from their present group. The effects of such experiences
               will likely not be equivalent.

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social tipping points can be the 
               <span>additive</span> outcome of tipping points occurring within each individual (
               <span>individual-level</span>) or the 
               <span>synergistic</span> outcome of interactions among individuals (
               <span>group-level</span>). For instance, in 
               <span>Polistes</span> paper wasps, colonies may proceed nonlinearly from a quiescent state to responsive
               state related to increases in disturbance. This could be an additive process, whereby
               the group response is the sum of each individual wasp's threshold—beyond which it
               moves from inaction to agitation [
               <a>53</a>]. Alternatively, a group-level response can be an emergent property, mediated by
               
               <span>synergistic</span> interactions between group members. For instance, the probability of each wasp entering
               an agitated state may not be independent from other wasps. The threshold to enter
               an agitated state may, for example, decrease when neighbours become agitated. Experiments
               that evaluate individual responses in isolation versus group settings, in groups of
               various sizes, or in groups with contrasting abilities to interact will be helpful
               for demonstrating the social scale at which tipping points operate.

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A system may pass through a tipping point if environmental parameters drive individuals
               into alternative metabolic states that affect individuals' behaviour. For example,
               excessive heat can force social ectotherms into collective activity either to cool
               themselves, like collective fanning behaviour in honeybees [
               <a>54</a>], or to evacuate a nest site entirely. Another potential example of a metabolic tipping
               point is when excessive cold or aridity causes collective huddling to preserve heat
               and water in small bodied animals [
               <a>55</a>]. Metabolic tipping points can be additive or synergistic. For instance, collective
               huddling behaviour may enable groups of homeotherms to remain socially active in environments
               that exceed the thresholds of each individual in isolation [
               <a>56</a>]. In contrast, social ectotherms may exhibit a more additive response because constituents
               cannot share metabolic heat [
               <a>57</a>]. Other examples of metabolic tipping points can occur because of contrasting hunger
               levels, fat stores, hypoxia, exposure to contaminants, infection status, microbiomes,
               and so on.

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points can also be mediated by social or cognitive parameters, which arise
               because individuals' perception of their environment has changed. For instance, cautious
               or flight-prone behaviour in one group member might catalyse that behaviour in another
               individual [
               <a>58</a>]. Alternatively, observer individuals may copy the successful foraging strategies
               of innovative group mates [
               <a>59</a>] or the migration routes of older individuals [
               <a>42</a>,
               <a>60</a>]. The key ingredient for these transitions is that actors are capable of observing
               their environment, and then adjusting their behaviour accordingly. In principle, social
               or cognitive state transitions can occur at different social scales as well. For example,
               each individual may independently learn about its environment, and therefore, the
               group's behaviour changes as the sum of these individual assessments. However, social
               interactions will often result in a synergistic shift [
               <a>61</a>].
