 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A system may pass through a tipping point if environmental parameters drive individuals into alternative metabolic states that affect individuals' behaviour. For example, excessive heat can force social ectotherms into collective activity either to cool themselves, like collective fanning behaviour in honeybees [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C54">54</a>], or to evacuate a nest site entirely. Another potential example of a metabolic tipping point is when excessive cold or aridity causes collective huddling to preserve heat and water in small bodied animals [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C55">55</a>]. Metabolic tipping points can be additive or synergistic. For instance, collective huddling behaviour may enable groups of homeotherms to remain socially active in environments that exceed the thresholds of each individual in isolation [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C56" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C56">56</a>]. In contrast, social ectotherms may exhibit a more additive response because constituents cannot share metabolic heat [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C57" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C57">57</a>]. Other examples of metabolic tipping points can occur because of contrasting hunger levels, fat stores, hypoxia, exposure to contaminants, infection status, microbiomes, and so on.
