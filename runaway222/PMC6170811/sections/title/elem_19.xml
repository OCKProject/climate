  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social tipping points can be the 
   <span class="italic">additive</span> outcome of tipping points occurring within each individual (
   <span class="italic">individual-level</span>) or the 
   <span class="italic">synergistic</span> outcome of interactions among individuals (
   <span class="italic">group-level</span>). For instance, in 
   <span class="italic">Polistes</span> paper wasps, colonies may proceed nonlinearly from a quiescent state to responsive state related to increases in disturbance. This could be an additive process, whereby the group response is the sum of each individual wasp's thresholdâ€”beyond which it moves from inaction to agitation [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C53">53</a>]. Alternatively, a group-level response can be an emergent property, mediated by 
   <span class="italic">synergistic</span> interactions between group members. For instance, the probability of each wasp entering an agitated state may not be independent from other wasps. The threshold to enter an agitated state may, for example, decrease when neighbours become agitated. Experiments that evaluate individual responses in isolation versus group settings, in groups of various sizes, or in groups with contrasting abilities to interact will be helpful for demonstrating the social scale at which tipping points operate.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Metabolic tipping points</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A system may pass through a tipping point if environmental parameters drive individuals into alternative metabolic states that affect individuals' behaviour. For example, excessive heat can force social ectotherms into collective activity either to cool themselves, like collective fanning behaviour in honeybees [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C54">54</a>], or to evacuate a nest site entirely. Another potential example of a metabolic tipping point is when excessive cold or aridity causes collective huddling to preserve heat and water in small bodied animals [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C55">55</a>]. Metabolic tipping points can be additive or synergistic. For instance, collective huddling behaviour may enable groups of homeotherms to remain socially active in environments that exceed the thresholds of each individual in isolation [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C56" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C56">56</a>]. In contrast, social ectotherms may exhibit a more additive response because constituents cannot share metabolic heat [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C57" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C57">57</a>]. Other examples of metabolic tipping points can occur because of contrasting hunger levels, fat stores, hypoxia, exposure to contaminants, infection status, microbiomes, and so on.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social or cognitive tipping points</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points can also be mediated by social or cognitive parameters, which arise because individuals' perception of their environment has changed. For instance, cautious or flight-prone behaviour in one group member might catalyse that behaviour in another individual [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C58">58</a>]. Alternatively, observer individuals may copy the successful foraging strategies of innovative group mates [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C59" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C59">59</a>] or the migration routes of older individuals [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C42">42</a>,
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C60">60</a>]. The key ingredient for these transitions is that actors are capable of observing their environment, and then adjusting their behaviour accordingly. In principle, social or cognitive state transitions can occur at different social scales as well. For example, each individual may independently learn about its environment, and therefore, the group's behaviour changes as the sum of these individual assessments. However, social interactions will often result in a synergistic shift [
