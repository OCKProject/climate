 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many animal social systems are capable of exhibiting multiple qualitatively distinct states. We refer to these as 
  <span class="italic">behavioural states</span>, such as the calm (blue) and agitated (red) colony states in the spiders in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F1" href="#RSPB20181282F1">figure 1</a>. The behavioural state expressed is dictated by the system's dynamics as well as 
  <span class="italic">environmental parameters</span> such as humidity or temperature (

  <span class="italic">x</span>-axis) and 
  <span class="italic">internal parameters</span> such as metabolic or cognitive factors. For social tipping points, we deem forces acting from outside the group to be 
  <span class="italic">environmental parameters</span> and forces emerging from within the group as 
  <span class="italic">internal parameters</span>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental parameters can be abiotic or biotic. Most studies on tipping points have examined abiotic drivers [

  <a rid="RSPB20181282C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C6">6</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C14">14</a>], whereas relatively few have examined biotic drivers, social or otherwise. Abiotic parameters include temperature, light, precipitation, oxygen levels, pH, aridity, anthropogenic noise, tides, and terrain [

  <a rid="RSPB20181282C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C6">6</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C8">8</a>]. Biotic parameters can be social (e.g. the number or collective phenotypes of nearby groups) or nonsocial (e.g. predation threat, food availability, or presence of parasites/disease). It is worth noting that many tipping points may be driven by changes in several environmental parameters, such as the combination of heat and UV exposure. Because of the potential combined effects, it is important to consider to what degree phenomena like priming, enhanced lethality of multiple stressors, or cross-tolerance affect group behaviour [

  <a rid="RSPB20181282C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C18">18</a>]. Multiple interacting environmental parameters could be grouped into functionally similar groups based on their properties or because of the shared effects that they have on social groups.
