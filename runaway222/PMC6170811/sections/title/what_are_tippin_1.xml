 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What are tipping points?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points are drastic shifts in the behaviour of systems as a result of small changes to the environment. In ecology, tipping points are often referred to as 
  <span class="italic">ecological thresholds</span> [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C5">5</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C7">7</a>]. For example, a small change in the temperature of a lake can lead to large shifts in the composition of the lake's community. Other commonly cited examples of ecological tipping points include sudden shifts in species dominance or population collapse [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C8">8</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C9">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, in a social context, 
  <span class="italic">social tipping points</span> occur when small changes to the physical or social environment result in qualitative changes to group behaviour or dynamics [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C10">10</a>]. In animal societies, tipping points could be used to explain social transitions such as the onset of collective movements, shifts in group behaviour from calm to agitated states, the emergence and disappearance of wars between neighbouring societies, the formation or disbandment of cooperation, or the diffusion of new innovations. For instance, African desert locusts rapidly shift between their little-observed solitary state to a swarming plague phenotype. The transition between these states is density-mediated and catalysed by positive feedback loops between population density, individual activity level, and serotonin-mediated gregariousness [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C11">11</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C13">13</a>]. Thus, small changes in population density can cause large and abrupt changes in both individual state and group dynamics in these locusts.
