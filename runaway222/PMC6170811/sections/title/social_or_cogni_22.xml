 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points can also be mediated by social or cognitive parameters, which arise because individuals' perception of their environment has changed. For instance, cautious or flight-prone behaviour in one group member might catalyse that behaviour in another individual [

  <a rid="RSPB20181282C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C60">60</a>]. The key ingredient for these transitions is that actors are capable of observing their environment, and then adjusting their behaviour accordingly. In principle, social or cognitive state transitions can occur at different social scales as well. For example, each individual may independently learn about its environment, and therefore, the group's behaviour changes as the sum of these individual assessments. However, social interactions will often result in a synergistic shift [
