      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The existence of multiple behavioural states allows for the possibility of hysteresis—a
         concept often linked to tipping points in the literature [
         <a>25</a>–
         <a>27</a>]. Hysteresis is a system's lack of reversibility as environmental parameters are
         varied. A system exhibits hysteresis if reverting the environmental parameters in
         a system that has passed through a tipping point to the parameters immediately preceding
         the change does not cause the system to revert to the previous behavioural state.
         For example, once agitated, spider societies require cooling to far lower temperatures
         to return them to a calm state (
         <a>figure 1</a>). However, not all tipping points will exhibit hysteresis. Tipping points and hysteresis
         are important to consider because it changes the way that systems should be modelled.
         In particular, researchers may assume that their systems as reversible in parameter
         space but, if hysteresis is present, this is not the case.
