 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many living systems exhibit drastic state shifts in response to small changes in environmental parameters. We argue here that animal societies—like other kinds of living systems—can be subject to tipping points and that a better understanding of tipping point dynamics can help us to predict changes in sociality and behaviour. Behavioural ecologists interested in such dynamics are poised to contribute novel insights, both theoretically and empirically. The insights gleaned from such studies have the potential to generate crosstalk between fields of ecology that typically operate independently. The tipping point framework in turn offers us (behavioural ecologists) a variety of opportunities. First, the tipping point framework asks us to re-examine familiar topics—information spread, collective action, group formation/disbandment, etc.—from a new perspective, which opens up new flavours of inquiry. Second, tipping points draw our attention to possible connections between the dynamics of social systems and other kinds of complex living systems—highlighting the opportunity for generalizing principles across tiers of biological organization. Third, the tipping points framework draws our attention to ideas from other subdisciplines of ecology and allows us to critically evaluate these ideas in a new context. Finally, understanding tipping points is of conservation importance for multiple tiers of biological organization, which permits basic researchers to probe tipping points while simultaneously collecting data that could prove useful for applied scientists. This incipient field is therefore ripe for creation and entry, and there is much for us to discover together.</p>
