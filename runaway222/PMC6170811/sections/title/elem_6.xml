  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How can we recognize tipping points?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It can be difficult to recognize that a tipping point has occurred from observational data alone, especially if observations are noisy. However, there are some signatures of tipping points that one may recognize in their system of interest. One signature is that when a tipping point occurs, small environmental changes alter system dynamics so that previous models explaining the behaviour of the system built under one regime are no longer predictive when the regime has shifted. Although there are many reasons a model may not explain data, assuming an equilibrium state, a potential indication of a tipping point is when a model explains the data well under some conditions but then fails when environmental parameters change. Other possible signatures of tipping points include flickering between behavioural states and delayed recovery to prior states following perturbation [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Are critical points and tipping points equivalent?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the terms 
   <span class="italic">tipping point</span> and 
   <span class="italic">critical point</span> are often used interchangeably in the literature, there are distinctions. Loosely, a critical point occurs when the stability of attractors changes. Tipping points require a quantifiable change in behavioural state as a result of minor changes in environmental parameters. This makes all tipping points critical points, but not all critical points tipping points. For example, a system moving through a critical point could have a continuous behavioural state as environmental parameters change, but a system with a tipping point would have a discontinuity in the behavioural state as a function of the environmental parameters (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Is there hysteresis?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The existence of multiple behavioural states allows for the possibility of hysteresis—a concept often linked to tipping points in the literature [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C25">25</a>–
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C27">27</a>]. Hysteresis is a system's lack of reversibility as environmental parameters are varied. A system exhibits hysteresis if reverting the environmental parameters in a system that has passed through a tipping point to the parameters immediately preceding the change does not cause the system to revert to the previous behavioural state. For example, once agitated, spider societies require cooling to far lower temperatures to return them to a calm state (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F1" href="#RSPB20181282F1">figure 1</a>). However, not all tipping points will exhibit hysteresis. Tipping points and hysteresis are important to consider because it changes the way that systems should be modelled. In particular, researchers may assume that their systems as reversible in parameter space but, if hysteresis is present, this is not the case.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Are there early warning signs of tipping points?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most challenging aspects of tipping points is anticipating when and where they are likely to occur [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C22">22</a>,
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C23">23</a>,
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C28">28</a>]. There are two general predictors whose presence is thought to anticipate an impending tipping point. First, increased variance in a system's internal dynamics is predicted to warn of an approaching tipping point [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C9">9</a>,
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C29">29</a>]. Destabilized dynamics, large swings and oscillations, or flickering between states all potentially convey that the feedback that keeps a system at one attractor state is weakening, which allows the system to wander farther from the attractor. Second, the speed of recovery to baseline conditions is predicted to decrease when a system is approaching its tipping point [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C2">2</a>,
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C9">9</a>]. This is because the strength of the feedback that maintains systems in one state decreases as a system moves toward a tipping point, and therefore the rate of recovery is slower. In behaviour, there may be other warning signs based on individual-level characteristics, or early behavioural outcomes prior to more dramatic state shifts.
