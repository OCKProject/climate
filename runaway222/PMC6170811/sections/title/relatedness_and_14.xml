 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Group relatedness and size likely influence tipping points. Relatedness has an impact on a variety of social outcomes, including increased prosocial behaviour and decreased exploitation among group members [

  <a rid="RSPB20181282C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C35">35</a>]. Thus, social feedback driven by competitive interactions may be less stable between relatives [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C36" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C36">36</a>]. Kin groups may also be more likely to share information about predation risk even at risk to themselves, for instance, via alarm calls [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C37">37</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C38">38</a>]. Group size is also likely to impact the above scenario. Increasing group size could augment competitive interactions and keep individuals in a distracted state for longer. Larger groups may also compete more [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C39">39</a>] and this could increase group distraction. Yet, larger groups also have more individuals with which to detect changes in the environment and share information [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C27">27</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C40" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C40">40</a>]. The net effect of group size may therefore depend on the degree to which social interactions impede individuals' probability of detecting risk and the degree of information sharing.
