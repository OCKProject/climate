      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many disciplines already use the ideas and terminology of tipping points to explore
         the properties of complex systems. This leads one to ask: what strengths can behavioural
         ecologists bring to the broader study of tipping points?
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, animal social systems provide us with the opportunity to observe interactions
         between individual-level and group-level tipping points. Although this review pertains
         to social tipping points in the dynamics of whole societies, individual organisms
         are themselves complex living systems with metabolic processes that can undergo tipping
         points in response to environmental parameters [
         <a>62</a>,
         <a>63</a>]. One can therefore probe the scale at which tipping points occur by evaluating behavioural
         dynamics in response to environmental drivers when individuals are in isolation versus
         group settings or across groups of various size. Linking tiers of multilevel tipping
         points is a problem already faced by the tipping point literature on communities and
         ecosystems [
         <a>6</a>,
         <a>63</a>,
         <a>64</a>], but one fears that the problem of scale (individual versus population versus community
         versus ecosystem) might be intractably great in such systems. Social tipping points
         in animal societies might therefore serve as a convenient intermediate ground in which
         to develop and critically evaluate theory on multilevel tipping points. Such individual
         versus group-level comparisons do not have clear analogues in the application of tipping
         points in the physical sciences. This opens the door to new lines of empirical inquiry
         and theory.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, behavioural ecologists have the ability to create large numbers of experimental
         systems [
         <a>65</a>,
         <a>66</a>] and manipulate environmental parameters thought to cause tipping points [
         <a>13</a>], thus allowing cause-effect inferences that elude purely theoretical studies or
         correlative studies on other living systems. General ecologists have used the tipping
         point framework to explore contrasting ecosystem dynamics [
         <a>2</a>], shifts in community composition and functioning [
         <a>4</a>,
         <a>8</a>], and decreases in the viability of imperilled wildlife populations [
         <a>31</a>,
         <a>32</a>]. Engineering such systems or altering them experimentally with a high degree of
         replication is often impossible or unethical. For many social systems, this is not
         so.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, using the tipping point framework has the potential to foster crosstalk between
         the kinds of questions asked by behavioural ecologists and investigators interested
         in other kinds of complex systems. The notion that similar principles might underlie
         the presence, severity, timing, and recoverability of tipping points across contrasting
         physical and living systems is intriguing, and behavioural ecologists are poised to
         enter this dialogue with precision.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, animal societies raise our consciousness to the presence of asymmetrical
         interaction rules, and therefore promise to inspire new kinds of tipping point models,
         which often assume that interaction rules are simple, symmetrical, and invariant.
         In animals, we know that individuals differ from each other in their attributes, the
         ways in which they interact, and the social influence they exert over their groups.
         While behavioural ecologists have potentially much to gain from the tipping point
         literature, the intellectual exchange promises to be bidirectional.
