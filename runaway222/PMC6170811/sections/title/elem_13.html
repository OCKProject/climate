      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many social properties could influence whether tipping points occur in a society.
         These include relatedness and group size, presence of keystone individuals, within-group
         behavioural diversity, group social organization, and groups' prior experience. In
         this section, we present a hypothetical example and then use it as a lens to pose
         how social properties might impact tipping points.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consider a hypothetical situation where the activity level of a group of marmosets
         depends on the level of predation risk (
         <a>figureÂ 3</a>). When predation risk is low, groups are socially active and have a chance of entering
         distracted social states. Distracted states may emerge when one individual steals
         fruit or chases another individual, resulting in a competitive tit-for-tat game. Once
         initiated, social activity can keep a group in an active and distracted state despite
         mild to moderate increases in predation risk. However, at a tipping point, even a
         distracted group will detect heightened risk, and activity will decrease in favour
         of vigilance. Returning back to social activity will then require a large decrease
         in predation risk because vigilance renders a group sensitive to even moderate risk.
         Thus, under some conditions, whether a group will be active or inactive will depend
         on its prior state (distracted versus vigilant), creating a hysteresis window.

               <p>A hysteresis window depicting the relationship between group activity level (
                  <span>y</span>-axis) in association with contrasting levels of predation risk (
                  <span>x</span>-axis). At low levels of predation groups engage in social interactions that heighten
                  group activity (1) but also distract groups from detecting small to moderate levels
                  of predation risk (2). However, at some increased level of predation risk groups decrease
                  activity and become vigilant (3), and extreme levels of risk will cause groups to
                  go into hiding and cease activity (4). As risk dissipates, groups require a much lower
                  level of risk to resume social activity (5).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Group relatedness and size likely influence tipping points. Relatedness has an impact
            on a variety of social outcomes, including increased prosocial behaviour and decreased
            exploitation among group members [
            <a>34</a>,
            <a>35</a>]. Thus, social feedback driven by competitive interactions may be less stable between
            relatives [
            <a>36</a>]. Kin groups may also be more likely to share information about predation risk even
            at risk to themselves, for instance, via alarm calls [
            <a>37</a>,
            <a>38</a>]. Group size is also likely to impact the above scenario. Increasing group size could
            augment competitive interactions and keep individuals in a distracted state for longer.
            Larger groups may also compete more [
            <a>39</a>] and this could increase group distraction. Yet, larger groups also have more individuals
            with which to detect changes in the environment and share information [
            <a>27</a>,
            <a>40</a>]. The net effect of group size may therefore depend on the degree to which social
            interactions impede individuals' probability of detecting risk and the degree of information
            sharing.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The presence of influential individuals impacts social tipping points. For instance,
            the presence of leaders or reconciliatory individuals may prevent tit-for-tat feedback
            loops from ever starting [
            <a>41</a>,
            <a>42</a>]. In contrast, the presence of particularly aggressive, hungry, or bold individuals
            could increase within-group conflict [
            <a>43</a>], thus changing the environmental parameter values that result in a tipping point
            and the feedback strength that underlies them.

      <div class="sec" title="sec"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(iii)</span><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Behavioural diversity</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More phenotypically diverse systems are predicted to be more resistant to and resilient
            from environmental stress [
            <a>44</a>,
            <a>45</a>]. This, in turn, will shift the timing of tipping points or cause a more linear collective
            response to environmental changes, i.e. eliminating tipping points altogether. The
            so-called 
            <span>portfolio effect</span> predicts that more diverse groups will have increased odds that at least some constituents
            can endure novel environments, and therefore, maintain group-level properties [
            <a>46</a>]. In contrast, homogeneous groups run the risk of all individuals possessing the
            same sensitivities, making abrupt collective state shifts more likely. However, even
            for diverse groups, there will be some environmental parameters that cause tipping
            points in spite of any benefits.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The social structure of our marmoset groups and the space in which the interactions
            occur also likely affect tipping points [
            <a>29</a>]. In groups that live in or build structures, such as nests, the geometry of these
            spaces can determine the kinds of interactions that individuals engage in, the degree
            of competition among group members, risk of predation, environmental sensitivity,
            and so on [
            <a>47</a>]. Nests also provide some homeostatic benefits to their residents [
            <a>48</a>], which will likely impact the susceptibility of groups to changes in environmental
            parameters. For groups that live in more open environments, geographical constraints
            such as rivers, matrix habitat, and localized resources such as fruit trees will impact
            individuals' position in space and therefore the structure of social networks [
            <a>49</a>]. Networks, in turn, will shape whether and how individuals interact and influence
            each other's behaviour [
            <a>50</a>].

      <div class="sec" title="sec"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(v)</span><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior experience</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whether or not social groups have previously been exposed to specific environmental
            parameters will likely impact their future tipping points [
            <a>2</a>,
            <a>6</a>]. For instance, prior experience with anthropogenic noise might prime a marmoset
            group and desensitize it to subsequent noise exposure [
            <a>51</a>]. In the related concept of cross-tolerance [
            <a>52</a>], experience with one stressor can increase the system's resistance to other stressors.
            The predicted outcome is similar to that of priming but differs in that stressors
            can appear interchangeable. A final stressor query is whether the social context of
            prior experience matters. For instance, the effects of prior experience may depend
            on whether individuals acquired their experience in isolation, in a group setting,
            or in a group setting that differs from their present group. The effects of such experiences
            will likely not be equivalent.
