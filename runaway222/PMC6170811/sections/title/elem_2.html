      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several concepts that are needed to apply the conceptual framework of tipping
         points to social systems. We describe these concepts here using an example. Social
         spider colonies exhibit a tipping point towards violent infighting in response to
         heat stress (
         <a>figure 1</a>) [
         <a>14</a>]. When colonies have been in cool temperatures (less than 27°C) they are generally
         calm and cooperative but transition into infighting at higher temperatures (greater
         than 31°C). However, when the temperature cools, colonies do not immediately return
         to their calm state upon reaching the critical 30–31°C, but require much cooler temperatures
         (less than 27–28°C) to return to their prior state. Thus, at an equivalent temperature,
         say 29°C, a colony can be characterized by high levels of infighting or calm cooperation,
         depending on its history. Notably, the shift between calm and agitated colony behaviour
         is mediated by temperature (the external 
         <span>environmental parameter</span>), and this shift is conspicuously abrupt, which is diagnostic of social tipping points
         (
         <a>figure 2</a>). 
         
         <div><span>Figure 1.</span><div>
               <p>A hysteresis window between an environmental condition (e.g. temperature) and group
                  behaviour (e.g. degree of infighting). This figure is modelled after a study on within-group
                  conflict in response to heat stress in social spiders. Groups that have been in an
                  agitated state (red) tend to remain agitated, whereas calm groups (blue) tend to remain
                  calm. Therefore, there exists a set of intermediate environmental conditions (
                  <span>T</span><sub>1</sub> &lt; 
                  <span>T</span> &lt; 
                  <span>T</span><sub>2</sub>) where a group can be either calm or agitated depending on its historical dynamics.
                  In the lower panel, solid lines represent stable equilibria states and the shaded
                  regions show their basins of attraction. The dashed line is an unstable equilibrium,
                  which demarks the boundary between the basins of attraction. The upper panels (A–E)
                  provide an alternate abstraction of this system: for a given environmental condition,
                  the group response tends to a low point on the ‘landscape’. The bottoms of the troughs
                  in the upper panels are therefore stable equilibria and correspond to the locations
                  of the solid red and blue lines in the lower panel (see ‘
                  <span>Y</span>’ label for an example). Tipping points occur when a stable equilibrium (solid line/trough)
                  collides with an unstable equilibrium (dashed line/peak) and is eliminated—at this
                  point the system transitions suddenly to the alternate remaining equilibrium. In this
                  system the tipping points are at 
                  <span>T</span><sub>1</sub> (when the system is in the agitated state and temperature is decreasing) and at 
                  <span>T</span><sub>2</sub> (when the system is in the calm state and temperature is increasing).

               <p>Social tipping points are characterized by an abrupt change in behaviour state caused
                  by small changes in environmental parameters. Here, groups of territorial damselfish
                  (brown fishes) may respond with vigilance and inspection (top image) towards intruders
                  or not (bottom image) depending on whether food is limited. One sign of a possible
                  tipping point is a change point in the data, where the data suddenly appear to be
                  nonstationary. In the plot, this is depicted as a sudden change in the mean of aggressiveness
                  (
                  <span>y</span>-axis). If a model for aggressiveness is built for conditions where food supply is
                  low, but then applied to cases where food supply is high, the model will have very
                  large error. This reinforces the point that the old model is no longer valid for the
                  new data if a tipping point has occurred. The three functions fitted to the identical
                  data above have all been used to estimate the position of tipping points along environmental
                  gradients, though the centre panel reinforces the point that entirely new models may
                  be required to explain system properties before versus after a tipping point.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many animal social systems are capable of exhibiting multiple qualitatively distinct
            states. We refer to these as 
            <span>behavioural states</span>, such as the calm (blue) and agitated (red) colony states in the spiders in 
            <a>figure 1</a>. The behavioural state expressed is dictated by the system's dynamics as well as
            
            <span>environmental parameters</span> such as humidity or temperature (
            <a>figure 1</a>, 
            <span>x</span>-axis) and 
            <span>internal parameters</span> such as metabolic or cognitive factors. For social tipping points, we deem forces
            acting from outside the group to be 
            <span>environmental parameters</span> and forces emerging from within the group as 
            <span>internal parameters</span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental parameters can be abiotic or biotic. Most studies on tipping points
            have examined abiotic drivers [
            <a>3</a>,
            <a>6</a>,
            <a>14</a>], whereas relatively few have examined biotic drivers, social or otherwise. Abiotic
            parameters include temperature, light, precipitation, oxygen levels, pH, aridity,
            anthropogenic noise, tides, and terrain [
            <a>3</a>,
            <a>6</a>,
            <a>8</a>]. Biotic parameters can be social (e.g. the number or collective phenotypes of nearby
            groups) or nonsocial (e.g. predation threat, food availability, or presence of parasites/disease).
            It is worth noting that many tipping points may be driven by changes in several environmental
            parameters, such as the combination of heat and UV exposure. Because of the potential
            combined effects, it is important to consider to what degree phenomena like priming,
            enhanced lethality of multiple stressors, or cross-tolerance affect group behaviour
            [
            <a>15</a>–
            <a>18</a>]. Multiple interacting environmental parameters could be grouped into functionally
            similar groups based on their properties or because of the shared effects that they
            have on social groups.

      <div class="sec" title="sec"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(b)</span><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attractors and basins of attraction</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Up to this point we have presented behavioural states as categorical (such as calm
            and agitated), but behaviours can actually be more fluid. For example, a spider may
            be slightly irritated, but not fully agitated. As time progresses, the spider may
            become calm or agitated, depending on environmental parameters. In this example, the
            categorical states of calm and agitated are referred to as 
            <span>attractors</span> and the set of fluid states that tend towards these categorical states are these
            attractors' 
            <span>basins of attraction</span>. In 
            <a>figure 1</a>, the solid red and blue lines depict the agitated and calm attractors for a range
            of environmental parameters (here, temperature). The lighter shaded areas in 
            <a>figure 1</a> are the basins of attraction for these two attractors. For intermediate environmental
            parameters, two attractors exist. At very low temperatures, there is only one attractor,
            the calm state, while at very high temperatures, only the agitated attractor exists.
            It is important to emphasize that attractors can appear and disappear, depending on
            environmental parameters.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In some cases, environmentally driven tipping points may be irreversible. For example,
            events such as the onset of sex change in sequential hermaphrodites [
            <a>19</a>], the onset of epidemic spawning in marine invertebrates [
            <a>20</a>], or the emergence of sexual alates in social insects [
            <a>21</a>] can be one-way transitions in behavioural state driven by minor perturbations to
            environmental parameters. In these cases, the former attractors have vanished as a
            consequence of the system undergoing a tipping point.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the presence and number of attractors, the landscape of attraction
            can vary. In 
            <a>figure 1</a>, this is depicted with the landscape slices above the main figure which show how
            the geometry of the basins of attraction are modified as environmental parameters
            change. In each case, the blue or red balls indicate the attractors at the bottom
            of wells symbolizing the basins of attraction. The steepness of the walls of these
            basins of attraction determine the strength of the feedback mechanisms keeping the
            system in a given state—the steeper the walls of the wells, the quicker the system
            returns to the attractor state and the more resistant the state is to noise. When
            the wells are shallow, the system returns to the attractor more slowly and drifts
            more widely in response to noise [
            <a>9</a>,
            <a>22</a>,
            <a>23</a>].

      <div class="sec" title="sec"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(c)</span><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perturbations</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are two fundamentally different ways that a system can be perturbed. Either
            the behavioural state or the environmental parameters can be perturbed. To think about
            the effect of perturbations to the behavioural state, consider a single slice of the
            landscape of attractors in 
            <a>figure 1</a>. When the behavioural state is perturbed, envision the system as one of the coloured
            balls that are subject to that particular landscape. If the ball is perturbed enough
            that it moves to another basin of attraction then the system undergoes a behavioural
            state change. However, this kind of perturbation is not technically classified as
            a tipping point because the transition was not caused by changes to the external environment.
            In contrast, when an environmental parameter changes, the landscape itself changes,
            which can alter the existence of attractors and the shapes of their basins of attraction.
            In 
            <a>figure 1</a>, this is depicted by the series of slices showing the landscapes governing the basins
            of attraction. The society moves through a tipping point when a small change to environmental
            parameters results in a drastic enough modification to the attractor landscape that
            the society is now in an alternative basin of attraction. A critical difference between
            the two types of perturbations is that when a tipping point occurs, the underlying
            dynamics have changed and thus the previous regime's models and data are no longer
            effective in describing the new regime.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attractor states are not necessarily advantageous or disadvantageous. For example,
            social groups might proceed from a relatively calm cooperative stable state to disbandment
            or collapse due to infighting or cheating [
            <a>14</a>,
            <a>24</a>]. However, a system might also switch between two states that perform equally well.
            The alternative states might even be part of a system's life history. Thus, attractor
            states are not necessarily evolutionary stable states (ESS) nor adaptive peaks in
            a fitness landscape, nor do they necessarily have negative consequences for social
            groups.
