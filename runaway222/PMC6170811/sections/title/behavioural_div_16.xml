  <span class="italic">portfolio effect</span> predicts that more diverse groups will have increased odds that at least some constituents can endure novel environments, and therefore, maintain group-level properties [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C46" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C46">46</a>]. In contrast, homogeneous groups run the risk of all individuals possessing the same sensitivities, making abrupt collective state shifts more likely. However, even for diverse groups, there will be some environmental parameters that cause tipping points in spite of any benefits.
