      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The social structure of our marmoset groups and the space in which the interactions
         occur also likely affect tipping points [
         <a>29</a>]. In groups that live in or build structures, such as nests, the geometry of these
         spaces can determine the kinds of interactions that individuals engage in, the degree
         of competition among group members, risk of predation, environmental sensitivity,
         and so on [
         <a>47</a>]. Nests also provide some homeostatic benefits to their residents [
         <a>48</a>], which will likely impact the susceptibility of groups to changes in environmental
         parameters. For groups that live in more open environments, geographical constraints
         such as rivers, matrix habitat, and localized resources such as fruit trees will impact
         individuals' position in space and therefore the structure of social networks [
         <a>49</a>]. Networks, in turn, will shape whether and how individuals interact and influence
         each other's behaviour [
         <a>50</a>].
