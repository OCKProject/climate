 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social tipping points can be the 
  <span class="italic">additive</span> outcome of tipping points occurring within each individual (
  <span class="italic">individual-level</span>) or the 
  <span class="italic">synergistic</span> outcome of interactions among individuals (
  <span class="italic">group-level</span>). For instance, in 
  <span class="italic">Polistes</span> paper wasps, colonies may proceed nonlinearly from a quiescent state to responsive state related to increases in disturbance. This could be an additive process, whereby the group response is the sum of each individual wasp's thresholdâ€”beyond which it moves from inaction to agitation [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C53">53</a>]. Alternatively, a group-level response can be an emergent property, mediated by 
  <span class="italic">synergistic</span> interactions between group members. For instance, the probability of each wasp entering an agitated state may not be independent from other wasps. The threshold to enter an agitated state may, for example, decrease when neighbours become agitated. Experiments that evaluate individual responses in isolation versus group settings, in groups of various sizes, or in groups with contrasting abilities to interact will be helpful for demonstrating the social scale at which tipping points operate.
