      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many animals are social, and behaviours that occur within social groups can affect
         individuals, their immediate neighbours, and the overall performance of the society.
         In some cases, even small changes in external environmental conditions can cause large
         and abrupt changes to individuals' behaviours, interactions among group members, and
         therefore how the group functions as a whole. Examples of changing environmental conditions
         include food deprivation, heat/cold stress, predation risk, or various anthropogenic
         stressors. Uncovering how and why small perturbations can cause marked and abrupt
         shifts in group dynamics is important for understanding group functioning, cohesion,
         and responsiveness to the environment. Here, we introduce the idea of tipping points,
         which have been used to better understand the dynamics of complex systems in many
         fields.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The term 
         <span>tipping point</span> was first used in the academic literature by Morton Grodzins to describe racial segregation
         in US cities [
         <a>1</a>]. Ecologists and climate scientists have since used tipping points to better understand
         shifts in lake eutrophication [
         <a>2</a>], forest-grass transitions [
         <a>3</a>], and coral reef states [
         <a>4</a>]. Although the idea of tipping points has been used as a popular analogy for sudden
         changes in social systems, the conceptual framework underlying tipping points has
         not been widely applied to questions in behavioural ecology. In this article we explain
         what tipping points are, how they have been studied in other contexts, and how the
         tipping point framework could provide new insights and predictive power into the study
         of animal behaviour.

      <div class="sec" title="sec"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(a)</span><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What are tipping points?</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points are drastic shifts in the behaviour of systems as a result of small
            changes to the environment. In ecology, tipping points are often referred to as 
            <span>ecological thresholds</span> [
            <a>5</a>–
            <a>7</a>]. For example, a small change in the temperature of a lake can lead to large shifts
            in the composition of the lake's community. Other commonly cited examples of ecological
            tipping points include sudden shifts in species dominance or population collapse [
            <a>8</a>,
            <a>9</a>].
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, in a social context, 
            <span>social tipping points</span> occur when small changes to the physical or social environment result in qualitative
            changes to group behaviour or dynamics [
            <a>10</a>]. In animal societies, tipping points could be used to explain social transitions
            such as the onset of collective movements, shifts in group behaviour from calm to
            agitated states, the emergence and disappearance of wars between neighbouring societies,
            the formation or disbandment of cooperation, or the diffusion of new innovations.
            For instance, African desert locusts rapidly shift between their little-observed solitary
            state to a swarming plague phenotype. The transition between these states is density-mediated
            and catalysed by positive feedback loops between population density, individual activity
            level, and serotonin-mediated gregariousness [
            <a>11</a>–
            <a>13</a>]. Thus, small changes in population density can cause large and abrupt changes in
            both individual state and group dynamics in these locusts.
