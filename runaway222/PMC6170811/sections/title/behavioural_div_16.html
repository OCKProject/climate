      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More phenotypically diverse systems are predicted to be more resistant to and resilient
         from environmental stress [
         <a>44</a>,
         <a>45</a>]. This, in turn, will shift the timing of tipping points or cause a more linear collective
         response to environmental changes, i.e. eliminating tipping points altogether. The
         so-called 
         <span>portfolio effect</span> predicts that more diverse groups will have increased odds that at least some constituents
         can endure novel environments, and therefore, maintain group-level properties [
         <a>46</a>]. In contrast, homogeneous groups run the risk of all individuals possessing the
         same sensitivities, making abrupt collective state shifts more likely. However, even
         for diverse groups, there will be some environmental parameters that cause tipping
         points in spite of any benefits.
