      <div class="sec" title="sec"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(a)</span><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How can we recognize tipping points?</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It can be difficult to recognize that a tipping point has occurred from observational
            data alone, especially if observations are noisy. However, there are some signatures
            of tipping points that one may recognize in their system of interest. One signature
            is that when a tipping point occurs, small environmental changes alter system dynamics
            so that previous models explaining the behaviour of the system built under one regime
            are no longer predictive when the regime has shifted. Although there are many reasons
            a model may not explain data, assuming an equilibrium state, a potential indication
            of a tipping point is when a model explains the data well under some conditions but
            then fails when environmental parameters change. Other possible signatures of tipping
            points include flickering between behavioural states and delayed recovery to prior
            states following perturbation [
            <a>10</a>].

      <div class="sec" title="sec"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(b)</span><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Are critical points and tipping points equivalent?</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the terms 
            <span>tipping point</span> and 
            <span>critical point</span> are often used interchangeably in the literature, there are distinctions. Loosely,
            a critical point occurs when the stability of attractors changes. Tipping points require
            a quantifiable change in behavioural state as a result of minor changes in environmental
            parameters. This makes all tipping points critical points, but not all critical points
            tipping points. For example, a system moving through a critical point could have a
            continuous behavioural state as environmental parameters change, but a system with
            a tipping point would have a discontinuity in the behavioural state as a function
            of the environmental parameters (
            <a>figure 2</a>).

      <div class="sec" title="sec"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(c)</span><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Is there hysteresis?</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The existence of multiple behavioural states allows for the possibility of hysteresis—a
            concept often linked to tipping points in the literature [
            <a>25</a>–
            <a>27</a>]. Hysteresis is a system's lack of reversibility as environmental parameters are
            varied. A system exhibits hysteresis if reverting the environmental parameters in
            a system that has passed through a tipping point to the parameters immediately preceding
            the change does not cause the system to revert to the previous behavioural state.
            For example, once agitated, spider societies require cooling to far lower temperatures
            to return them to a calm state (
            <a>figure 1</a>). However, not all tipping points will exhibit hysteresis. Tipping points and hysteresis
            are important to consider because it changes the way that systems should be modelled.
            In particular, researchers may assume that their systems as reversible in parameter
            space but, if hysteresis is present, this is not the case.

      <div class="sec" title="sec"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(d)</span><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Are there early warning signs of tipping points?</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most challenging aspects of tipping points is anticipating when and where
            they are likely to occur [
            <a>22</a>,
            <a>23</a>,
            <a>28</a>]. There are two general predictors whose presence is thought to anticipate an impending
            tipping point. First, increased variance in a system's internal dynamics is predicted
            to warn of an approaching tipping point [
            <a>9</a>,
            <a>29</a>]. Destabilized dynamics, large swings and oscillations, or flickering between states
            all potentially convey that the feedback that keeps a system at one attractor state
            is weakening, which allows the system to wander farther from the attractor. Second,
            the speed of recovery to baseline conditions is predicted to decrease when a system
            is approaching its tipping point [
            <a>2</a>,
            <a>9</a>]. This is because the strength of the feedback that maintains systems in one state
            decreases as a system moves toward a tipping point, and therefore the rate of recovery
            is slower. In behaviour, there may be other warning signs based on individual-level
            characteristics, or early behavioural outcomes prior to more dramatic state shifts.
