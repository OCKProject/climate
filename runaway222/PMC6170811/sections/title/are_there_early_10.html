      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most challenging aspects of tipping points is anticipating when and where
         they are likely to occur [
         <a>22</a>,
         <a>23</a>,
         <a>28</a>]. There are two general predictors whose presence is thought to anticipate an impending
         tipping point. First, increased variance in a system's internal dynamics is predicted
         to warn of an approaching tipping point [
         <a>9</a>,
         <a>29</a>]. Destabilized dynamics, large swings and oscillations, or flickering between states
         all potentially convey that the feedback that keeps a system at one attractor state
         is weakening, which allows the system to wander farther from the attractor. Second,
         the speed of recovery to baseline conditions is predicted to decrease when a system
         is approaching its tipping point [
         <a>2</a>,
         <a>9</a>]. This is because the strength of the feedback that maintains systems in one state
         decreases as a system moves toward a tipping point, and therefore the rate of recovery
         is slower. In behaviour, there may be other warning signs based on individual-level
         characteristics, or early behavioural outcomes prior to more dramatic state shifts.
