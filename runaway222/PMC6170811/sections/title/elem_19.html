         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social tipping points can be the 
            <span>additive</span> outcome of tipping points occurring within each individual (
            <span>individual-level</span>) or the 
            <span>synergistic</span> outcome of interactions among individuals (
            <span>group-level</span>). For instance, in 
            <span>Polistes</span> paper wasps, colonies may proceed nonlinearly from a quiescent state to responsive
            state related to increases in disturbance. This could be an additive process, whereby
            the group response is the sum of each individual wasp's thresholdâ€”beyond which it
            moves from inaction to agitation [
            <a>53</a>]. Alternatively, a group-level response can be an emergent property, mediated by
            
            <span>synergistic</span> interactions between group members. For instance, the probability of each wasp entering
            an agitated state may not be independent from other wasps. The threshold to enter
            an agitated state may, for example, decrease when neighbours become agitated. Experiments
            that evaluate individual responses in isolation versus group settings, in groups of
            various sizes, or in groups with contrasting abilities to interact will be helpful
            for demonstrating the social scale at which tipping points operate.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A system may pass through a tipping point if environmental parameters drive individuals
            into alternative metabolic states that affect individuals' behaviour. For example,
            excessive heat can force social ectotherms into collective activity either to cool
            themselves, like collective fanning behaviour in honeybees [
            <a>54</a>], or to evacuate a nest site entirely. Another potential example of a metabolic tipping
            point is when excessive cold or aridity causes collective huddling to preserve heat
            and water in small bodied animals [
            <a>55</a>]. Metabolic tipping points can be additive or synergistic. For instance, collective
            huddling behaviour may enable groups of homeotherms to remain socially active in environments
            that exceed the thresholds of each individual in isolation [
            <a>56</a>]. In contrast, social ectotherms may exhibit a more additive response because constituents
            cannot share metabolic heat [
            <a>57</a>]. Other examples of metabolic tipping points can occur because of contrasting hunger
            levels, fat stores, hypoxia, exposure to contaminants, infection status, microbiomes,
            and so on.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points can also be mediated by social or cognitive parameters, which arise
            because individuals' perception of their environment has changed. For instance, cautious
            or flight-prone behaviour in one group member might catalyse that behaviour in another
            individual [
            <a>58</a>]. Alternatively, observer individuals may copy the successful foraging strategies
            of innovative group mates [
            <a>59</a>] or the migration routes of older individuals [
            <a>42</a>,
            <a>60</a>]. The key ingredient for these transitions is that actors are capable of observing
            their environment, and then adjusting their behaviour accordingly. In principle, social
            or cognitive state transitions can occur at different social scales as well. For example,
            each individual may independently learn about its environment, and therefore, the
            group's behaviour changes as the sum of these individual assessments. However, social
            interactions will often result in a synergistic shift [
            <a>61</a>].
