      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the terms 
         <span>tipping point</span> and 
         <span>critical point</span> are often used interchangeably in the literature, there are distinctions. Loosely,
         a critical point occurs when the stability of attractors changes. Tipping points require
         a quantifiable change in behavioural state as a result of minor changes in environmental
         parameters. This makes all tipping points critical points, but not all critical points
         tipping points. For example, a system moving through a critical point could have a
         continuous behavioural state as environmental parameters change, but a system with
         a tipping point would have a discontinuity in the behavioural state as a function
         of the environmental parameters (
