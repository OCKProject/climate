 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How can social properties affect tipping points in social systems?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many social properties could influence whether tipping points occur in a society. These include relatedness and group size, presence of keystone individuals, within-group behavioural diversity, group social organization, and groups' prior experience. In this section, we present a hypothetical example and then use it as a lens to pose how social properties might impact tipping points.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consider a hypothetical situation where the activity level of a group of marmosets depends on the level of predation risk (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F3" href="#RSPB20181282F3">figureÂ 3</a>). When predation risk is low, groups are socially active and have a chance of entering distracted social states. Distracted states may emerge when one individual steals fruit or chases another individual, resulting in a competitive tit-for-tat game. Once initiated, social activity can keep a group in an active and distracted state despite mild to moderate increases in predation risk. However, at a tipping point, even a distracted group will detect heightened risk, and activity will decrease in favour of vigilance. Returning back to social activity will then require a large decrease in predation risk because vigilance renders a group sensitive to even moderate risk. Thus, under some conditions, whether a group will be active or inactive will depend on its prior state (distracted versus vigilant), creating a hysteresis window.

    <p>A hysteresis window depicting the relationship between group activity level (
     <span class="italic">y</span>-axis) in association with contrasting levels of predation risk (
     <span class="italic">x</span>-axis). At low levels of predation groups engage in social interactions that heighten group activity (1) but also distract groups from detecting small to moderate levels of predation risk (2). However, at some increased level of predation risk groups decrease activity and become vigilant (3), and extreme levels of risk will cause groups to go into hiding and cease activity (4). As risk dissipates, groups require a much lower level of risk to resume social activity (5).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Group relatedness and size likely influence tipping points. Relatedness has an impact on a variety of social outcomes, including increased prosocial behaviour and decreased exploitation among group members [

   <a rid="RSPB20181282C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C35">35</a>]. Thus, social feedback driven by competitive interactions may be less stable between relatives [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C36" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C36">36</a>]. Kin groups may also be more likely to share information about predation risk even at risk to themselves, for instance, via alarm calls [

   <a rid="RSPB20181282C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C38">38</a>]. Group size is also likely to impact the above scenario. Increasing group size could augment competitive interactions and keep individuals in a distracted state for longer. Larger groups may also compete more [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C39">39</a>] and this could increase group distraction. Yet, larger groups also have more individuals with which to detect changes in the environment and share information [

   <a rid="RSPB20181282C40" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C40">40</a>]. The net effect of group size may therefore depend on the degree to which social interactions impede individuals' probability of detecting risk and the degree of information sharing.

In contrast, homogeneous groups run the risk of all individuals possessing the same sensitivities, making abrupt collective state shifts more likely. However, even for diverse groups, there will be some environmental parameters that cause tipping points in spite of any benefits.

The predicted outcome is similar to that of priming but differs in that stressors can appear interchangeable. A final stressor query is whether the social context of prior experience matters. For instance, the effects of prior experience may depend on whether individuals acquired their experience in isolation, in a group setting, or in a group setting that differs from their present group. The effects of such experiences will likely not be equivalent.
