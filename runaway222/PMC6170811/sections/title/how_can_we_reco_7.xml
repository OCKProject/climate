 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How can we recognize tipping points?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It can be difficult to recognize that a tipping point has occurred from observational data alone, especially if observations are noisy. However, there are some signatures of tipping points that one may recognize in their system of interest. One signature is that when a tipping point occurs, small environmental changes alter system dynamics so that previous models explaining the behaviour of the system built under one regime are no longer predictive when the regime has shifted. Although there are many reasons a model may not explain data, assuming an equilibrium state, a potential indication of a tipping point is when a model explains the data well under some conditions but then fails when environmental parameters change. Other possible signatures of tipping points include flickering between behavioural states and delayed recovery to prior states following perturbation [
