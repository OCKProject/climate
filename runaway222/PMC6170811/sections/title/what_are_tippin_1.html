      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points are drastic shifts in the behaviour of systems as a result of small
         changes to the environment. In ecology, tipping points are often referred to as 
         <span>ecological thresholds</span> [
         <a>5</a>–
         <a>7</a>]. For example, a small change in the temperature of a lake can lead to large shifts
         in the composition of the lake's community. Other commonly cited examples of ecological
         tipping points include sudden shifts in species dominance or population collapse [
         <a>8</a>,
         <a>9</a>].

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, in a social context, 
         <span>social tipping points</span> occur when small changes to the physical or social environment result in qualitative
         changes to group behaviour or dynamics [
         <a>10</a>]. In animal societies, tipping points could be used to explain social transitions
         such as the onset of collective movements, shifts in group behaviour from calm to
         agitated states, the emergence and disappearance of wars between neighbouring societies,
         the formation or disbandment of cooperation, or the diffusion of new innovations.
         For instance, African desert locusts rapidly shift between their little-observed solitary
         state to a swarming plague phenotype. The transition between these states is density-mediated
         and catalysed by positive feedback loops between population density, individual activity
         level, and serotonin-mediated gregariousness [
         <a>11</a>–
         <a>13</a>]. Thus, small changes in population density can cause large and abrupt changes in
         both individual state and group dynamics in these locusts.
