 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points can inform our understanding of animal societies in a variety of ways. First, documenting tipping points aids our ability to forecast dramatic state shifts in animal behaviour [

The presence of abrupt tipping points, pronounced hysteresis, an inability to recover to baseline dynamics following perturbation, and large differences in behavioural states all convey that the internal dynamics driving a system are strongly nonlinear. Additionally, in the presence of tipping points, a system's responsiveness to the environment could appear deceptively small, save for the regions immediately around the tipping point. Many systems therefore may appear deceptively stable, unless one specifically interrogates the limited set of conditions that trigger the system to tip. Third, scrutinizing tipping points and their adaptive function may shed light on how social groups are capable of incredible behavioural flexibility. For example, there is evidence that societies may self-organize or evolve to keep themselves near tipping points, so that they can respond dynamically to new information or environmental challenges [

  <a rid="RSPB20181282C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C33">33</a>] and potentially maximize the adaptive advantages of both order and disorder [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C33">33</a>]. Fourth, scrutinizing tipping points across tiers of biological organization may help us to determine whether there are generalizable features about their dynamics that bridge tiers of biological organization. Fifth, knowledge of tipping points can help guide researchers as to when a new modelling paradigm may be necessary to predict system behaviour.
