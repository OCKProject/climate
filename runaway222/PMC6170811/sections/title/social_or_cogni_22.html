      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points can also be mediated by social or cognitive parameters, which arise
         because individuals' perception of their environment has changed. For instance, cautious
         or flight-prone behaviour in one group member might catalyse that behaviour in another
         individual [
         <a>58</a>]. Alternatively, observer individuals may copy the successful foraging strategies
         of innovative group mates [
         <a>59</a>] or the migration routes of older individuals [
         <a>42</a>,
         <a>60</a>]. The key ingredient for these transitions is that actors are capable of observing
         their environment, and then adjusting their behaviour accordingly. In principle, social
         or cognitive state transitions can occur at different social scales as well. For example,
         each individual may independently learn about its environment, and therefore, the
         group's behaviour changes as the sum of these individual assessments. However, social
         interactions will often result in a synergistic shift [
         <a>61</a>].
