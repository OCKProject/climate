 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Is there hysteresis?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The existence of multiple behavioural states allows for the possibility of hysteresis—a concept often linked to tipping points in the literature [

  <a rid="RSPB20181282C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C27">27</a>]. Hysteresis is a system's lack of reversibility as environmental parameters are varied. A system exhibits hysteresis if reverting the environmental parameters in a system that has passed through a tipping point to the parameters immediately preceding the change does not cause the system to revert to the previous behavioural state. For example, once agitated, spider societies require cooling to far lower temperatures to return them to a calm state (

Tipping points and hysteresis are important to consider because it changes the way that systems should be modelled. In particular, researchers may assume that their systems as reversible in parameter space but, if hysteresis is present, this is not the case.
