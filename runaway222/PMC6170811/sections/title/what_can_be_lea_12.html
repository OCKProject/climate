      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points can inform our understanding of animal societies in a variety of ways.
         First, documenting tipping points aids our ability to forecast dramatic state shifts
         in animal behaviour [
         <a>29</a>]. This, in turn, can help us to predict how societies will change in response to
         environmental parameters, which is required for conservation [
         <a>30</a>â€“
         <a>32</a>]. Second, tipping points convey information about societies' comparative sensitivity
         to environmental parameters. The presence of abrupt tipping points, pronounced hysteresis,
         an inability to recover to baseline dynamics following perturbation, and large differences
         in behavioural states all convey that the internal dynamics driving a system are strongly
         nonlinear. Additionally, in the presence of tipping points, a system's responsiveness
         to the environment could appear deceptively small, save for the regions immediately
         around the tipping point. Many systems therefore may appear deceptively stable, unless
         one specifically interrogates the limited set of conditions that trigger the system
         to tip. Third, scrutinizing tipping points and their adaptive function may shed light
         on how social groups are capable of incredible behavioural flexibility. For example,
         there is evidence that societies may self-organize or evolve to keep themselves near
         tipping points, so that they can respond dynamically to new information or environmental
         challenges [
         <a>27</a>,
         <a>33</a>] and potentially maximize the adaptive advantages of both order and disorder [
         <a>33</a>]. Fourth, scrutinizing tipping points across tiers of biological organization may
         help us to determine whether there are generalizable features about their dynamics
         that bridge tiers of biological organization. Fifth, knowledge of tipping points can
         help guide researchers as to when a new modelling paradigm may be necessary to predict
         system behaviour.
