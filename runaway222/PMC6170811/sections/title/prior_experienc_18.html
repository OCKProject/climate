      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whether or not social groups have previously been exposed to specific environmental
         parameters will likely impact their future tipping points [
         <a>2</a>,
         <a>6</a>]. For instance, prior experience with anthropogenic noise might prime a marmoset
         group and desensitize it to subsequent noise exposure [
         <a>51</a>]. In the related concept of cross-tolerance [
         <a>52</a>], experience with one stressor can increase the system's resistance to other stressors.
         The predicted outcome is similar to that of priming but differs in that stressors
         can appear interchangeable. A final stressor query is whether the social context of
         prior experience matters. For instance, the effects of prior experience may depend
         on whether individuals acquired their experience in isolation, in a group setting,
         or in a group setting that differs from their present group. The effects of such experiences
         will likely not be equivalent.
