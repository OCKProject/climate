      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Group relatedness and size likely influence tipping points. Relatedness has an impact
         on a variety of social outcomes, including increased prosocial behaviour and decreased
         exploitation among group members [
         <a>34</a>,
         <a>35</a>]. Thus, social feedback driven by competitive interactions may be less stable between
         relatives [
         <a>36</a>]. Kin groups may also be more likely to share information about predation risk even
         at risk to themselves, for instance, via alarm calls [
         <a>37</a>,
         <a>38</a>]. Group size is also likely to impact the above scenario. Increasing group size could
         augment competitive interactions and keep individuals in a distracted state for longer.
         Larger groups may also compete more [
         <a>39</a>] and this could increase group distraction. Yet, larger groups also have more individuals
         with which to detect changes in the environment and share information [
         <a>27</a>,
         <a>40</a>]. The net effect of group size may therefore depend on the degree to which social
         interactions impede individuals' probability of detecting risk and the degree of information
         sharing.
