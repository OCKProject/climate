 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Core concepts of social tipping points</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several concepts that are needed to apply the conceptual framework of tipping points to social systems. We describe these concepts here using an example. Social spider colonies exhibit a tipping point towards violent infighting in response to heat stress (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F1" href="#RSPB20181282F1">figure 1</a>) [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C14">14</a>]. When colonies have been in cool temperatures (less than 27°C) they are generally calm and cooperative but transition into infighting at higher temperatures (greater than 31°C). However, when the temperature cools, colonies do not immediately return to their calm state upon reaching the critical 30–31°C, but require much cooler temperatures (less than 27–28°C) to return to their prior state. Thus, at an equivalent temperature, say 29°C, a colony can be characterized by high levels of infighting or calm cooperation, depending on its history. Notably, the shift between calm and agitated colony behaviour is mediated by temperature (the external 
  <span class="italic">environmental parameter</span>), and this shift is conspicuously abrupt, which is diagnostic of social tipping points (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F2" href="#RSPB20181282F2">figure 2</a>).

    <p>A hysteresis window between an environmental condition (e.g. temperature) and group behaviour (e.g. degree of infighting). This figure is modelled after a study on within-group conflict in response to heat stress in social spiders. Groups that have been in an agitated state (red) tend to remain agitated, whereas calm groups (blue) tend to remain calm. Therefore, there exists a set of intermediate environmental conditions (
     <span class="italic">T</span>
     <sub>1</sub> &lt; 
     <span class="italic">T</span> &lt; 
     <span class="italic">T</span>
     <sub>2</sub>) where a group can be either calm or agitated depending on its historical dynamics. In the lower panel, solid lines represent stable equilibria states and the shaded regions show their basins of attraction. The dashed line is an unstable equilibrium, which demarks the boundary between the basins of attraction. The upper panels (A–E) provide an alternate abstraction of this system: for a given environmental condition, the group response tends to a low point on the ‘landscape’. The bottoms of the troughs in the upper panels are therefore stable equilibria and correspond to the locations of the solid red and blue lines in the lower panel (see ‘
     <span class="italic">Y</span>’ label for an example). Tipping points occur when a stable equilibrium (solid line/trough) collides with an unstable equilibrium (dashed line/peak) and is eliminated—at this point the system transitions suddenly to the alternate remaining equilibrium. In this system the tipping points are at 
     <span class="italic">T</span>
     <sub>1</sub> (when the system is in the agitated state and temperature is decreasing) and at 
     <span class="italic">T</span>
     <sub>2</sub> (when the system is in the calm state and temperature is increasing).

    <p>Social tipping points are characterized by an abrupt change in behaviour state caused by small changes in environmental parameters. Here, groups of territorial damselfish (brown fishes) may respond with vigilance and inspection (top image) towards intruders or not (bottom image) depending on whether food is limited. One sign of a possible tipping point is a change point in the data, where the data suddenly appear to be nonstationary. In the plot, this is depicted as a sudden change in the mean of aggressiveness (
     <span class="italic">y</span>-axis). If a model for aggressiveness is built for conditions where food supply is low, but then applied to cases where food supply is high, the model will have very large error. This reinforces the point that the old model is no longer valid for the new data if a tipping point has occurred. The three functions fitted to the identical data above have all been used to estimate the position of tipping points along environmental gradients, though the centre panel reinforces the point that entirely new models may be required to explain system properties before versus after a tipping point.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Behavioural states and environmental parameters</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many animal social systems are capable of exhibiting multiple qualitatively distinct states. We refer to these as 
   <span class="italic">behavioural states</span>, such as the calm (blue) and agitated (red) colony states in the spiders in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F1" href="#RSPB20181282F1">figure 1</a>. The behavioural state expressed is dictated by the system's dynamics as well as 
   <span class="italic">environmental parameters</span> such as humidity or temperature (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F1" href="#RSPB20181282F1">figure 1</a>, 
   <span class="italic">x</span>-axis) and 
   <span class="italic">internal parameters</span> such as metabolic or cognitive factors. For social tipping points, we deem forces acting from outside the group to be 
   <span class="italic">environmental parameters</span> and forces emerging from within the group as 
   <span class="italic">internal parameters</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental parameters can be abiotic or biotic. Most studies on tipping points have examined abiotic drivers [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C3">3</a>,
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C6">6</a>,
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C14">14</a>], whereas relatively few have examined biotic drivers, social or otherwise. Abiotic parameters include temperature, light, precipitation, oxygen levels, pH, aridity, anthropogenic noise, tides, and terrain [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C3">3</a>,
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C6">6</a>,
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C8">8</a>]. Biotic parameters can be social (e.g. the number or collective phenotypes of nearby groups) or nonsocial (e.g. predation threat, food availability, or presence of parasites/disease). It is worth noting that many tipping points may be driven by changes in several environmental parameters, such as the combination of heat and UV exposure. Because of the potential combined effects, it is important to consider to what degree phenomena like priming, enhanced lethality of multiple stressors, or cross-tolerance affect group behaviour [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C15">15</a>–
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C18">18</a>]. Multiple interacting environmental parameters could be grouped into functionally similar groups based on their properties or because of the shared effects that they have on social groups.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attractors and basins of attraction</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Up to this point we have presented behavioural states as categorical (such as calm and agitated), but behaviours can actually be more fluid. For example, a spider may be slightly irritated, but not fully agitated. As time progresses, the spider may become calm or agitated, depending on environmental parameters. In this example, the categorical states of calm and agitated are referred to as 
   <span class="italic">attractors</span> and the set of fluid states that tend towards these categorical states are these attractors' 
   <span class="italic">basins of attraction</span>. In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F1" href="#RSPB20181282F1">figure 1</a>, the solid red and blue lines depict the agitated and calm attractors for a range of environmental parameters (here, temperature). The lighter shaded areas in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F1" href="#RSPB20181282F1">figure 1</a> are the basins of attraction for these two attractors. For intermediate environmental parameters, two attractors exist. At very low temperatures, there is only one attractor, the calm state, while at very high temperatures, only the agitated attractor exists. It is important to emphasize that attractors can appear and disappear, depending on environmental parameters.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In some cases, environmentally driven tipping points may be irreversible. For example, events such as the onset of sex change in sequential hermaphrodites [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C19">19</a>], the onset of epidemic spawning in marine invertebrates [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C20">20</a>], or the emergence of sexual alates in social insects [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C21">21</a>] can be one-way transitions in behavioural state driven by minor perturbations to environmental parameters. In these cases, the former attractors have vanished as a consequence of the system undergoing a tipping point.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the presence and number of attractors, the landscape of attraction can vary. In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F1" href="#RSPB20181282F1">figure 1</a>, this is depicted with the landscape slices above the main figure which show how the geometry of the basins of attraction are modified as environmental parameters change. In each case, the blue or red balls indicate the attractors at the bottom of wells symbolizing the basins of attraction. The steepness of the walls of these basins of attraction determine the strength of the feedback mechanisms keeping the system in a given state—the steeper the walls of the wells, the quicker the system returns to the attractor state and the more resistant the state is to noise. When the wells are shallow, the system returns to the attractor more slowly and drifts more widely in response to noise [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perturbations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are two fundamentally different ways that a system can be perturbed. Either the behavioural state or the environmental parameters can be perturbed. To think about the effect of perturbations to the behavioural state, consider a single slice of the landscape of attractors in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F1" href="#RSPB20181282F1">figure 1</a>. When the behavioural state is perturbed, envision the system as one of the coloured balls that are subject to that particular landscape. If the ball is perturbed enough that it moves to another basin of attraction then the system undergoes a behavioural state change. However, this kind of perturbation is not technically classified as a tipping point because the transition was not caused by changes to the external environment. In contrast, when an environmental parameter changes, the landscape itself changes, which can alter the existence of attractors and the shapes of their basins of attraction. In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F1" href="#RSPB20181282F1">figure 1</a>, this is depicted by the series of slices showing the landscapes governing the basins of attraction. The society moves through a tipping point when a small change to environmental parameters results in a drastic enough modification to the attractor landscape that the society is now in an alternative basin of attraction. A critical difference between the two types of perturbations is that when a tipping point occurs, the underlying dynamics have changed and thus the previous regime's models and data are no longer effective in describing the new regime.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attractor states are not necessarily advantageous or disadvantageous. For example, social groups might proceed from a relatively calm cooperative stable state to disbandment or collapse due to infighting or cheating [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C14">14</a>,
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C24">24</a>]. However, a system might also switch between two states that perform equally well. The alternative states might even be part of a system's life history. Thus, attractor states are not necessarily evolutionary stable states (ESS) nor adaptive peaks in a fitness landscape, nor do they necessarily have negative consequences for social groups.
