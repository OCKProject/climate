 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Are critical points and tipping points equivalent?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the terms 
  <span class="italic">tipping point</span> and 
  <span class="italic">critical point</span> are often used interchangeably in the literature, there are distinctions. Loosely, a critical point occurs when the stability of attractors changes. Tipping points require a quantifiable change in behavioural state as a result of minor changes in environmental parameters. This makes all tipping points critical points, but not all critical points tipping points. For example, a system moving through a critical point could have a continuous behavioural state as environmental parameters change, but a system with a tipping point would have a discontinuity in the behavioural state as a function of the environmental parameters (
