  <a rid="RSPB20181282C52" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C52">52</a>], experience with one stressor can increase the system's resistance to other stressors. The predicted outcome is similar to that of priming but differs in that stressors can appear interchangeable. A final stressor query is whether the social context of prior experience matters. For instance, the effects of prior experience may depend on whether individuals acquired their experience in isolation, in a group setting, or in a group setting that differs from their present group. The effects of such experiences will likely not be equivalent.
