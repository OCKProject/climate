      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social tipping points can be the 
         <span>additive</span> outcome of tipping points occurring within each individual (
         <span>individual-level</span>) or the 
         <span>synergistic</span> outcome of interactions among individuals (
         <span>group-level</span>). For instance, in 
         <span>Polistes</span> paper wasps, colonies may proceed nonlinearly from a quiescent state to responsive
         state related to increases in disturbance. This could be an additive process, whereby
         the group response is the sum of each individual wasp's thresholdâ€”beyond which it
         moves from inaction to agitation [
         <a>53</a>]. Alternatively, a group-level response can be an emergent property, mediated by
         
         <span>synergistic</span> interactions between group members. For instance, the probability of each wasp entering
         an agitated state may not be independent from other wasps. The threshold to enter
         an agitated state may, for example, decrease when neighbours become agitated. Experiments
         that evaluate individual responses in isolation versus group settings, in groups of
         various sizes, or in groups with contrasting abilities to interact will be helpful
         for demonstrating the social scale at which tipping points operate.
