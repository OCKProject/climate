      <p>Animal social groups are complex systems that are likely to exhibit tipping points—which
         are defined as drastic shifts in the dynamics of systems that arise from small changes
         in environmental conditions—yet this concept has not been carefully applied to these
         systems. Here, we summarize the concepts behind tipping points and describe instances
         in which they are likely to occur in animal societies. We also offer ways in which
         the study of social tipping points can open up new lines of inquiry in behavioural
         ecology and generate novel questions, methods, and approaches in animal behaviour
         and other fields, including community and ecosystem ecology. While some behaviours
         of living systems are hard to predict, we argue that probing tipping points across
         animal societies and across tiers of biological organization—populations, communities,
         ecosystems—may help to reveal principles that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries.
