  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual degree-day models showed that 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. 
   <span class="italic">tabaci</span> could theoretically complete one generation across most of Scotland, 1–3 generations over England and Wales, and 3–4 generations over northern France (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221057.g003" href="#pone.0221057.g003">Fig 3</a>) under current climate conditions. Accumulated warmth is therefore not currently the limiting factor for the establishment of the whitefly in the UK and northern France. When climate indices of East Anglia in the UK were compared with Mediterranean France, however, significant differences were shown that could impact on the establishment of the whitefly. All four of the indices relate to the time under which the whitefly experiences cool temperatures (or temperatures outside of its preferred temperature zone).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a poikilothermic ectotherm, 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. 
   <span class="italic">tabaci</span> is unable to regulate its own body temperature and is influenced by environmental temperature, and is therefore susceptible to chilling injury as a result of low temperature exposure [
   <a rid="pone.0221057.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref040">40</a>]. Chilling injury often involves the reduction and loss of membrane, organelle and enzyme function, and other processes, which in turn reduce the survival and performance of sub-lethal characteristics of the organism concerned [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temperatures experienced during the cold days and nights relative to Mediterranean France may be low enough to cause chilling injury to

   <span class="italic">tabaci</span>, thereby inhibiting development and preventing establishment in the UK as compared to the south of France. It is unlikely, therefore, that this pest will establish outdoors in the UK under current climate conditions. The number of consecutive cold days in summer is also greater in the UK than in the south of France (~20 days per months for the UK as compared to &lt;5 days per month for southern France; see Fig G in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221057.s001" href="#pone.0221057.s001">S1 Appendix</a>). This presents a further risk, as chilling injury is more likely to occur the longer an invertebrate is exposed to low temperatures [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Impacts of climate change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. 
   <span class="italic">tabaci</span> is unlikely to become established outdoors in the UK under current climate conditions, with continued future climate change, the risk of establishment outdoors in the UK is expected to increase. The movement of pests northward in France with climate change has already been demonstrated for the pine processionary moth (
   <span class="italic">Thaumetopoea pityocampa</span>) [
   <a rid="pone.0221057.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref045">45</a>], highlighting the increasing pest threat to the UK.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taken together, the results of the future climate indices analyses indicate that a 2°C global temperature rise above pre-industrial levels will reduce the prevalence of 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. 
   <span class="italic">tabaci</span> outdoors in Mediterranean France in July and August as conditions become sub-optimal for survival. The rise in temperature could potentially lead to a greater threat to the UK in the months of June and September and/or a shift northwards in distribution (up to and including southern UK) as conditions in the UK become more favourable. These results differ from previous studies that suggest a northward spread for 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. 
   <span class="italic">tabaci</span> across France as a result of future climate change and an increase in its range throughout southern Europe but not northern Europe [
   <a rid="pone.0221057.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref001">1</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0221057.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref015">15</a>]. However, the Gilioli study ([
   <a rid="pone.0221057.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref015">15</a>]) used a physiologically based population dynamics model to map the potential distribution of 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. 
   <span class="italic">tabaci</span> in Europe. The population of immatures and adults were constrained with a temperature dependent mortality rate function linked to a development rate function. Although the model outputs correspond closely to the known limits of 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. 
   <span class="italic">tabaci</span> distribution outdoors in Europe, by linking mortality to the suitability for development they did not take account of any other factors, such as the influence of cold weather. Furthermore, the climate data used was limited to monthly mean minimum and maximum temperatures with an interpolation routine based on geographical location and the time of sunrise used to derive hourly temperature data. Unlike the current study, which used a suite of climate model projections, the climate change scenario tested was flat (1 and 2°C were added to each hourly temperature).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study suggests that 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. 
   <span class="italic">tabaci</span> could establish outdoors in East Anglia and across southern England in the future, which would make eradication of outbreaks in future more challenging than the current situation, where outbreaks are confined to glasshouses. Given the crucial need for an early warning system against 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. tabaci, we have identified that key indices for 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. 
   <span class="italic">tabaci</span> survival and development in summer change gradually with increasing latitude (northwards from areas of France with a Mediterranean climate). This means that monitoring any possible northwards spread of 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. 
   <span class="italic">tabaci</span> populations outdoors in France should also provide an important indicator of any change in the risks of outdoor populations of this species developing in the UK.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further applications</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study has focused on the application of climate indices for assessing the risk of establishment of 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. 
   <span class="italic">tabaci</span> in northern France and the UK. Such an in-depth comparison of climatic indices between areas of pest presence and absence outdoors to identify additional factors that may be responsible for limiting the potential area of pest distribution is almost unique in the history of pest risk analysis. It was made possible by a strong collaboration between teams of experts in climatology and pest risk analysis utilising continental-wide high-resolution climate datasets. The technique has a much wider application for using climate indices and high resolution daily data to model any pests in any country where traditional degree-day models do not match the observed situation. It is therefore recommended that such methods are adopted in other situations where forecasting the risks of pest establishment are complex and challenging.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to helping clarify the limitations of phenology models, this work will provide valuable evidence for more complex species distribution models, such as CLIMEX (see: 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://climatemodel.net/climex.htm" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://climatemodel.net/climex.htm</span>), which include stress indices based on species responses to cold, hot, wet and dry conditions. CLIMEX generates an ecoclimatic index that represents the year-round suitability for establishment. Factors, such as cold stress, are parameterised to reflect the likelihood of overwintering survival rather than the extent to which cool periods in summer can also limit the area of establishment. In addition to parameterisation based on published climatic responses, a key advantage of CLIMEX is the ability to infer parameters from the distribution of a pest. For species such as 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. 
   <span class="italic">tabaci</span>, which is a complex of 28 cryptic species, the distribution of each member of the complex is poorly known making it difficult to apply this CLIMEX attribute. In this situation, phenology models, such as the ones used in this project, based primarily on climate response thresholds, are of greater utility.
