  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref032">32</a>]. The high resolution climate model used was HadGEM3; the Met Office’s high resolution global climate model [

  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref034">34</a>]. To reduce computation time, the model was run in atmosphere-only mode rather than fully coupled atmosphere-ocean mode. This was achieved by using fixed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea-ice concentrations (SICs) from different driving models run at a lower resolution as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP-5; [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref035">35</a>]) initiative. In order to incorporate the uncertainty from the climate projections, a total of 6 of the 35 CMIP-5 models were used to drive HadGEM3 (
  <a rid="pone.0221057.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0221057.t003">Table 3</a>), chosen in the HELIX project as representative of the full model projections spread. The climate model data has been bias-corrected relative to the Princeton Global Forcings V2 reanalysis data product [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref036">36</a>] according to the ISI-MIP bias correction protocol [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref037">37</a>]. The CMIP-5 models were forced with the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 greenhouse gas emissions scenario from 1979–2100. This scenario is consistent with ongoing high emissions and hence features a rapid rate of warming.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The future time periods considered are identified by Global Warming Levels (GWLs)—identified as mitigation targets in the Paris Agreement—which are set at a global annual mean rise of 1.5, 2 and 4°C relative to the pre-industrial climate (1861–1880). The central year of GWL1.5, GWL2 and GWL4 for each ensemble member is defined as the year in which the 20-year running mean of the global annual mean temperature anomaly first passes the specific temperatures of 1.5, 2, and 4°C respectively. The temperature anomaly is calculated relative to the pre-industrial period: defined as the mean of 1861–1880. The bias-corrected central GWL years are calculated assuming the observed warming from the pre-industrial period to the bias correction reference period (1861–1880 mean to 1981–2010 mean) is 0.61°C [
