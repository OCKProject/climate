 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study has focused on the application of climate indices for assessing the risk of establishment of 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tabaci</span> in northern France and the UK. Such an in-depth comparison of climatic indices between areas of pest presence and absence outdoors to identify additional factors that may be responsible for limiting the potential area of pest distribution is almost unique in the history of pest risk analysis. It was made possible by a strong collaboration between teams of experts in climatology and pest risk analysis utilising continental-wide high-resolution climate datasets. The technique has a much wider application for using climate indices and high resolution daily data to model any pests in any country where traditional degree-day models do not match the observed situation. It is therefore recommended that such methods are adopted in other situations where forecasting the risks of pest establishment are complex and challenging.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to helping clarify the limitations of phenology models, this work will provide valuable evidence for more complex species distribution models, such as CLIMEX (see: 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://climatemodel.net/climex.htm" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://climatemodel.net/climex.htm</span>), which include stress indices based on species responses to cold, hot, wet and dry conditions. CLIMEX generates an ecoclimatic index that represents the year-round suitability for establishment. Factors, such as cold stress, are parameterised to reflect the likelihood of overwintering survival rather than the extent to which cool periods in summer can also limit the area of establishment. In addition to parameterisation based on published climatic responses, a key advantage of CLIMEX is the ability to infer parameters from the distribution of a pest. For species such as 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tabaci</span>, which is a complex of 28 cryptic species, the distribution of each member of the complex is poorly known making it difficult to apply this CLIMEX attribute. In this situation, phenology models, such as the ones used in this project, based primarily on climate response thresholds, are of greater utility.
