  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">E-Obs was developed for the purpose of regional climate model evaluation. E-Obs version 14.0 provides daily gridded precipitation, temperature and sea level pressure data for land areas only, covering the period January 1950 to August 2016. The data are generated by interpolating monthly values using a thin-plate spline method and then interpolating the daily anomalies of the 11348 stations’ data using a global kriging method. Station coverage is denser in the UK than France for both precipitation and temperature. Annual average standard error for mean temperature across all of Europe over the period of this present study is ~0.69°C for years prior to 2000, rising to over 0.7°C subsequently due to a marked drop off in the number of stations [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">JRC-MARS (Joint Research Center-Monitoring Agricultural ResourceS) data was developed by AGRI4CAST to provide crop production information to the European Commission [
   <a rid="pone.0221057.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref029">29</a>]. For this reason, the data are designed to be representative depictions of the weather in a typical agricultural holding within each grid cell, and therefore the median altitude of the non-irrigated arable land within the grid cell is chosen. JRC-MARS version 1.0 provides daily gridded temperature, wind speed, vapour pressure, precipitation, potential evaporation and evapotranspiration, radiation and snow depth data for land areas only, covering the period 1975 to present. Most of the data are generated by calculating the average of the daily data from up to the four most suitable weather stations for each grid cell from the ~9450 total stations; precipitation is taken directly from the single most suitable station identified. Suitable stations are identified according to a similarity score based on the distance, altitude difference, distance to coast and distance to uniform weather regions between the station and the grid cell centre. For the 7 weather stations most similar to the grid cell centre, a set score for all possible combinations of 1 up to 4 of these weather stations is determined, and the highest scoring set used in the interpolation. For temperature and vapour pressure parameters, the data are then corrected for altitude differences between the station and the grid cell centre using a moist adiabatic lapse rate of -0.006°Cm

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the purpose of the present study, the JRC-MARS data were translated onto the same grid as the E-Obs data by using the nearest grid cell. As the two datasets are generated using different methodologies, a simple student’s t-test comparison between the two was performed (where the variables were provided for both datasets). This comparison identified that there were some months where the maximum of the daily minimum temperatures, the mean of the daily minimum temperatures, the maximum of the daily mean temperature, the maximum of the daily precipitation amounts and sum of the daily total precipitation were statistically different between E-Obs and JRC-MARS. For this reason, all of the analyses conducted in this study use both datasets to enable common features to be assessed for their relevance to pest survival. Data are taken for the period 1986–2015.</p>

To reduce computation time, the model was run in atmosphere-only mode rather than fully coupled atmosphere-ocean mode.

   <a rid="pone.0221057.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref035">35</a>]) initiative. In order to incorporate the uncertainty from the climate projections, a total of 6 of the 35 CMIP-5 models were used to drive HadGEM3 (

The CMIP-5 models were forced with the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 greenhouse gas emissions scenario from 1979–2100. This scenario is consistent with ongoing high emissions and hence features a rapid rate of warming.
