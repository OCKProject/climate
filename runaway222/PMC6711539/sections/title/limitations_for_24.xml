 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual degree-day models showed that 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tabaci</span> could theoretically complete one generation across most of Scotland, 1–3 generations over England and Wales, and 3–4 generations over northern France (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221057.g003" href="#pone.0221057.g003">Fig 3</a>) under current climate conditions. Accumulated warmth is therefore not currently the limiting factor for the establishment of the whitefly in the UK and northern France. When climate indices of East Anglia in the UK were compared with Mediterranean France, however, significant differences were shown that could impact on the establishment of the whitefly. All four of the indices relate to the time under which the whitefly experiences cool temperatures (or temperatures outside of its preferred temperature zone).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a poikilothermic ectotherm, 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tabaci</span> is unable to regulate its own body temperature and is influenced by environmental temperature, and is therefore susceptible to chilling injury as a result of low temperature exposure [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref040">40</a>]. Chilling injury often involves the reduction and loss of membrane, organelle and enzyme function, and other processes, which in turn reduce the survival and performance of sub-lethal characteristics of the organism concerned [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temperatures experienced during the cold days and nights relative to Mediterranean France may be low enough to cause chilling injury to 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tabaci</span>, thereby inhibiting development and preventing establishment in the UK as compared to the south of France. It is unlikely, therefore, that this pest will establish outdoors in the UK under current climate conditions. The number of consecutive cold days in summer is also greater in the UK than in the south of France (~20 days per months for the UK as compared to &lt;5 days per month for southern France; see Fig G in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221057.s001" href="#pone.0221057.s001">S1 Appendix</a>). This presents a further risk, as chilling injury is more likely to occur the longer an invertebrate is exposed to low temperatures [
