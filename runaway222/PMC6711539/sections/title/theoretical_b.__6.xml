  <span class="italic">B</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tabaci</span> in the UK and France, a degree-day model was used based on a modified formula [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref011">11</a>]. This formula was slightly amended to account for the situation where the daily mean temperature equals the development threshold. The degree-day model was run with daily maximum and minimum temperatures interpolated to a 25 km grid obtained from JRC-MARS climate datasets for 1986–2015 (see next section). The higher of the two MED degree-day parameters was chosen, i.e. the 10.2°C and 400 degree days [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref012">12</a>], in order to depict the UK as less favourable for development. The ideal approach is to use data from populations close to the study areas. However, MEAM1 is an invasive species, and as the studies are some years old, the present composition of the populations in southern France is unknown. Therefore, the decision was taken to use data for the MEAM1 species as a whole, and investigate the range of reported values with two different scenarios. The first scenario depicts the UK as most favourable (8.7°C and 404 accumulated degree days) [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref013">13</a>]. We chose 404 from the range cited in 
  <a rid="pone.0221057.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0221057.t001">Table 1</a> because data collected for the PRATIQUE project give 8.7°C and 404 accumulated degree days for the egg-adult development. The second scenario depicts the UK as least favourable (11.5°C and 307 accumulated degree days) [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref014">14</a>]. These two scenarios illustrate the potential variation in published work. These three models were run and the predicted mean number of generations that could be completed successfully in a year was calculated and mapped.
