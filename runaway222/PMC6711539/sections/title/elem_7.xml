 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate indices are a way of characterizing the more extreme aspects of climate and climate variability. In order to characterize the climate of the region where 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. tabaci has been found outdoors, all 27 indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref023">23</a>] were used, together with additional relevant indices defined by the European Climate Assessment &amp; Dataset [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref024">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first step in our approach was to determine an appropriate gridded daily dataset upon which to carry out the quantitative comparison. The use of station data was ruled out because of the localised nature of the data and difficulties in identifying truly comparable stations. Two datasets are available that cover the UK and France at a resolution of ~25km: E-Obs [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref025">25</a>] and JRC-MARS [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref026">26</a>], as described in the next section.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As well as the standard set of indices, additional pest-relevant indices were developed which include specific biological thresholds and functions. These were identified through expert knowledge from Defra’s Plant Health Risk and Horizon Scanning Team, and are detailed in 
  <a rid="pone.0221057.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0221057.t002">Table 2</a>. All indices have been calculated for each month of each year and the results are presented as the mean index value across the 30-year climatology period.
