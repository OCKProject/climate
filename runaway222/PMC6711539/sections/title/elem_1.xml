  <span class="italic">Bemisia tabaci</span> (tobacco whitefly) is an important agricultural pest with a worldwide distribution, but is currently non-native to the UK. It is able to transmit upwards of 121 viruses, many of which can cause significant damage to food crops [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref001">1</a>]. As a result, non-European populations of the whitefly are included in Annex IAI of the EU Plant Health Directive 2000/29/EC, which prohibits their introduction and spread within EU member states, and requires that their host plants are subject to targeted monitoring by plant health inspectors at the border. The UK also has a Protected Zone for European populations of the whitefly, and is therefore subject to a heightened level of surveillance and management against

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Committee on Climate Change Adaptation Sub-Committee [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref002">2</a>] has identified new and emerging animal and plant pests and diseases as one of the principal climate change risks and key research priorities for the UK. This is because future climate change may allow pests and pathogens to survive better over winter in the UK and extend their current range, and once a pest or pathogen has established, they become difficult to eradicate [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref002">2</a>]. Risk management strategies therefore rely on early warning systems and surveillance to identify these pests and pathogens as soon as possible.

  <span class="italic">Bemisia tabaci</span> has been defined as a complex of a possible 28 morphologically indistinguishable “cryptic” species, however, it has been demonstrated that there is even greater complexity [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref003">3</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref004">4</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Bemisia tabaci</span> consists of a sibling species group and haplotypes based on mitochondrial DNA and some of the well-known haplotypes, MEAM1 (Middle East-Asia Minor 1 species) and MED (Mediterranean species), showing moderate to high levels of genetic diversity. The two species (or biotypes) of concern found in France are:

   </p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In China and the Mediterranean region, including southern France, MED is more widespread and is displacing MEAM1, probably because it has greater resistance to insecticides [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref005">5</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref006">6</a>]. In the UK, 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tabaci</span> findings are not regularly identified to biotype, but it has been noted that both MEAM1 and MED 
  <span class="italic">Bemisia</span> biotypes are frequently intercepted at the border, especially on poinsettia cuttings [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref007">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2017 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tabaci</span> was identified in 448 samples sent in by inspectors from England and Wales (including interceptions at airports, etc.) (Fera Science Ltd., unpublished data). Any findings of this pest in the UK are subject to eradication by the destruction of infested plants and/or a treatment programme. However, eradication is not straightforward and from 1998–2015 there were between 7 and 35 outbreaks per year [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref008">8</a>]. Currently, these outbreaks are restricted to glasshouses, with no records of establishment outdoors during the summer, despite the opportunity for 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tabaci</span> to escape from glasshouses. The records of the whitefly from neighbouring France are also predominantly from glasshouses, except for a small number of records in the south (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221057.g001" href="#pone.0221057.g001">Fig 1</a>). This is despite the opportunity for 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tabaci</span> to escape from glasshouses and move onto plants outdoors. 
  <span class="italic">Bemisia tabaci</span> can feed on more than 800 plants species [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref009">9</a>], many of which are present in the UK and France during the summer. Broccoli, cauliflower, squash and carrot, for example, are grown outdoors in both countries and have been shown to be some of the most preferred hosts for

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explain the inability of 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tabaci</span> to establish outdoors in the UK and the north of France during the summer, various hypotheses were tested. One explanation is that the whitefly does not experience enough accumulated warmth to complete its life cycle. Accumulated degree-day models can be used to determine whether there are sufficient degree-days above a minimum threshold for the development of the insect to complete its lifecycle [
  <a rid="pone.0221057.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221057.ref011">11</a>]. Outputs of these models were mapped to show the locations where the whitefly could complete its lifecycle and the number of generations that could be completed. Alternatively, a second explanation is that other climate indices, such as climate variability and temperature extremes, may impact the whitefly, and these climate indices were compared between the UK and southern France.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand how the values of these climatic indices will alter under climate change, and to identify potential changes in the risk of future outbreaks of 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. tabaci, these indices were projected forward based on rises of 1.5, 2 and 4°C above pre-industrial levels (1861–1880).
