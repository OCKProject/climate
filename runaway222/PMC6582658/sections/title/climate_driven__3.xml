  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span> is estimated by season, based on climate variability alone (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>; Model A). After introducing a small female adult population in the warmest season of the year in 1999, vector populations at each stage were simulated up to the end of 2009. The potential abundance of the female adult population was summarized for each season (December–February; March–May; June–August; September–November) and then averaged over one decade (2000–2009). The highest potential abundance of the female adult vector is estimated along the equator, in south Asia, mid - Africa, Central America, and most of South America (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). Among the four seasons, the summer and autumn—which correspond to June to November in the northern hemisphere, or December to May in the southern hemisphere—have the highest potential for vector abundance. This postdiction (Model A) showed high agreement when validated to a rich dataset of vector occurrence records (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Supplementary Material S5</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, we compare the potential for global distribution and abundance of 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span> over the past century. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2</a> shows the yearly averaged abundance (total female adults per larval site) over the three decades at the beginning of the last century (1902–1931; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2A</a>) and at the turn of this century (1987–2016; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2B</a>), and the difference between the two (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2C</a>). Changes are observed along the tropical belt, and increased potential for abundance (red) is postdicted in Central and South America, especially in Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela and parts of Brazil (north, northeast, southeast coastal states from Rio de Janeiro, San Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul); in central Africa around the Uganda and Kenya area; in South Asia including Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Decreased potential for vector abundance is postdicted in only a few areas (green), including scattered small areas in the west and east part of South America, in north Africa, and in a smaller strip from Nepal to the west coast of Myanmar.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3</a> for two RCPs and is based on the average of 5 global-circulation model (GCM; CMIP5) at the 0.5 ×0.5 arc degree global grid scale. Here the change means the difference in total female adults per larval site per year between 2090–2099 and 1987–2016. We have chosen the global abundance value during 1987–2016 as the baseline to see the changes in the end of this century relative to the beginning of this century. This is plotted with red representing for increase and blue for decrease.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under RCP2.6, compared to under RCP8.5 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figures 3A,B</a>) there is a stark contrast in the potential abundance of the vector. The low-emission scenario pathway, RCP2.6, indicates positive changes in Asia such as in China, and central and West Africa, and Latin America, but reductions in India and Australia. The high-emission scenario, RCP8.5, shows big increased potential in Southeast Asia, China, Japan, East Australia, and Africa (with the exception of the Sahel area). In the Americas, the change is the greatest in highly populated areas of Brazil, Mexico and the US, with drops in the abundance potential in central South America, north Africa, southwest Asia, and North Australia.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The change in global average intensity of the potential abundance per decade was estimated over two centuries (1905–2099), as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4</a>. During the past 110 years (1905–2014), the global abundance potential has increased about 9.5% as the global temperature has risen about 1.2°C. The largest increase (8.2%) occurred over the last two decades as a response to a rapid increase in temperature.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the future under RCP2.6—the lowest carbon emission scenario—the potential vector abundance is projected to increase by at least the same amount as over the past 110 years, but during only a 20-year period, by 2030. After that, the potential of vector abundance levels off, following the temperature trend. The total vector abundance change over the two centuries is more than 20% and the temperature rise is about 2.6°C. The average increase per degree in this scenario is 8.2%.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the highest carbon emission scenario of RCP8.5, the change in the potential of vector abundance rises another 20% by the 2070s and then slightly decreases. The total change in vector abundance over the two centuries is more than 30%, and the temperature rise is about 5.8°C (1910–2070). The average increase per degree in this scenario is 5.0%. This is less than that under RCP2.6, due to saturation from temperatures that will be over the optimal value for vector development and survival. Therefore, two different future trajectories in the potential of vector abundance are observed under two carbon emission scenarios, with an average of 6.1% increase per degree. The potential abundance follows closely the temperature change for the same period with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 under RCP2.6 and 0.89 under RCP8.5.</p>
