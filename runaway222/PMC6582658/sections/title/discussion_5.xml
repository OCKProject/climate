 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study uses a process-based mathematical vector model based on the lifecycle of 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span> to delineate the global distribution of vector potential abundance in space and time. We present two models: Model A postdicts and predicts potential abundance based on climate as the only driving force, and is built on an existing validated model structure (
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>) with improvements in model parametrization; Model B tests the sensitivity of the realized abundance of the vector to multiple driving forces consisting of both climate and socio-economic parameters, to account for human and economic influences on vector abundance. Using both models, we estimate vector population dynamics globally and present the change over the last and the current century.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study illustrates not only the global distribution of 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span>, but also the relative abundance, both geographically and temporally. Not surprisingly, seasons with the highest vector abundance are summer and fall, and the lowest are spring and winter. Over the past 110 years, the potential for vector abundance based on climate alone is estimated to have increased with about 9.5%. The largest increase (8.2%) has occurred since 1990, which indicates that a possible tipping point was reached in the global abundance of 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span>. In the future, as climate is projected to warm further, the potential for global distribution and abundance is also predicted to increase following the temperature trend closely, up to a 20% increase under a low emission future or a 30% increase under a high-emission future resulting in potential substantial changes in the abundance across the globe. Illustrating the effect of climate mitigation, the increase tapers off slowly after 2040 under the low carbon emission scenario, in agreement with the Paris Climate accord, and after 2070 under a high carbon emission scenario.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is the first mathematical model to simulate the global abundance of 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span>. There are two distinct approaches to modeling global vector distribution: statistical models that compute the probability of presence/absence of vectors, and mathematical models, like the one presented here, that compute the vector population dynamics.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our mathematical model tested the sensitivity of the climate-driven potential abundance to the realized global vector population distribution, based on human population and GDPpc. Information on human population was also included in the recent statistical model of global distribution of 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span> (
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>). We found the socio-economic sensitivity to the abundance to be large, which was also confirmed in the prior study, where it increased the probability of this vector's presence in areas of larger human population such as the coastal areas of the USA, eastern and southern Africa, and southern Asia.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study complements the statistical estimates based on presence/absence occurrence data collected from limited monitoring sources (
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>, 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>). The most comprehensive available source for global distribution of 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span> is the recently published presence/absence occurrence data (
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>) for the period 1960â€“2014. All the models show generally similar regions but larger areas of vector presence than the vector surveillance data, especially in Africa and South Asia. This is reasonable, since the occurrence data can easily underestimate many areas of developing countries due to the underreporting of vector presence by deficient surveillance systems. There are considerable gaps in such vector surveillance. The eastern part of South America (e.g., Brazil) and the southern USA show more vector presence data, which may be due to a well-functioning surveillance system in response to frequent dengue or other epidemics, which our model captured. In addition, our model suggests more areas in Africa and Asia that, like Brazil, have even higher vector abundance but were not present in the occurrence data, possibly due to underreporting (
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The statistical model estimates of global presence of 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span> from Kraemer et al. (
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>) are very similar to the result from our climate-driven model (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Figure S5A</a> for comparison). Both used natural environmental factors, with climate as the dominant factor. However, in light of the dispersion of 
  <span class="italic">Aedes</span> vectors to new areas through global trade (
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>, 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>), and the creation of urban breeding sites owing to rapid urbanization and economic development (
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>, 
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>, 
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>), it is important to include human population and socio-economic factors when estimating the realized occurrence and abundance of the vector.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first mathematical model to study vector abundance on a global scale. Compared with climate-based models, this new model (Model B) should provide a complementary estimate of the distribution and a novel estimate of the abundance of 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nonetheless, as with all modeling approaches, this study has limitations as well. Two such are the absence of capturing how irrigation, which is used to compensate for low rain levels, can exacerbate vector reproduction, and the use of air conditioning, which can lower vector survival and reproduction. These factors describing local variation are not included in this study on global vector population, although they are important to include for modeling a specific local area, as was done in some prior studies. For example, human-contributed semi-permanent water containers were included in the mathematical modeling for dengue transmission in San Juan, PR (
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another limitation is the lack of granularity of the climate data to sufficiently describe micro-climates, specifically urban heat islands (
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>), which may considerably increase the suitability of vectors in the fringe zones of vector abundance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the original vector model has been validated in Campinas, Brazil against vector field data and dengue transmission data over a few decades (
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>), the vector field data is always limited and dengue transmission is indirect. Certain assumptions must be taken into account, especially for all the rainfall-dependent parameters, such as carrying capacity, hatching fraction, and mortality rates for underwater stages. In addition, without an egg stage, the fraction of eggs laid were assumed to transfer to the larval population instantaneously, which is unlikely. However, our time span for abundance estimation was at least 6 months after the introduction of the female adults. The transition of eggs to larvae has already occurred to a large extent, if breeding sites were available. According to an egg modeling study by Yang et al. (
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>), the eggs of 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span> have shown very complicated biological traits in hatching; indeed, eight compartments were used to model hatching alone. Therefore, it is doubtful that a four-stage model including eggs will enhance the results over the three-compartment model used here.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study would have benefited more from vector population data to validate the model estimates, parameters, and to test for other possible relationships between model parameters, such as breeding site and climate/socio-economic variables. However, only very limited vector data from field measurement exist describing larval dynamics on a relative scale. Yang et al. set a fixed number of breeding sites of 1,000,000 for larva carrying capacity of 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span>. Other modeling studies of 
  <span class="italic">A. albopictus</span> used 250,000 (
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>, 
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>). Due to a lack of vector population data to validate our model, except for limited vector presence areas, the values in vector abundance may be viewed as a relative measure of potential abundance driven by the factor incorporated in the models, rather than an absolute number.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Needless to say, vector abundance models are very sensitive to the parameters used in the models and the input climate dataset. Although model parameters were chosen carefully to validate a number of places where the vector were known to be present, caution must be taken when using these parameters for other datasets in the future. Finally, the equation for breeding sites may overestimate the human contribution and downplay the role of natural water bodies such as those in rainforests, in Model B. However, 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span> are anthropophilic mosquitoes and depend on humans for reproduction.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With all the limitations, the process-based mathematical model in this study has helped us to understand better the dependence of global 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span> distribution and abundance on the contribution of climate and socio-economic factors. This model may be used to disentangle other interactive effects among the climate factors and other factors (e.g., environmental) as well.
