      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite remote sensing provides global soil moisture information over a large spatial
         view. CCI provides the longest time series of global satellite soil moisture from
         1979–2013, which is used in this study. The data are combined by active and passive
         microwave satellite observations. The active data sets are generated by the University
         of Vienna and are based on observations from the C-band scatterometer of the European
         Remote Sensing satellites (ERS-1 and ERS-2) and the Meteorological Operational Satellite
         (MetOp-A). The passive data sets are based on observations from the Scanning Multichannel
         Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), the Tropical
         Rainfall Measuring Mission microwave imager (TRMM TMI) and the Advanced Microwave
         Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The accuracy of the CCI data
         is acceptable when validated using global ground-based observations, and the mean
         correlation coefficient (
         <span>r</span>) and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.46 and 0.04 cm
         <span>3</span>/cm
         <span>−3</span>, respectively
         <span><a>52</a></span>.
