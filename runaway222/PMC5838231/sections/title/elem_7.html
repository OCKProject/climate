      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global water cycle has intensified in recent decades. We select data from 1982–2011
         to capture global water and climate change. Data sets of satellite remote sensing
         and ground observations are used to investigate the SM-P feedback in this study. Global
         soil moisture data from the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) and global precipitation
         data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) are adopted to identify
         the feedback. The evapotranspiration data from FLUXNET and near-surface temperature
         from the University of Delaware Air Temperature &amp; Precipitation data set are used
         to estimate the physical mechanism and the climate conditions associated with the
         feedback. To analyze the spatial patterns, we evaluate the feedback in different climate
         zones. The zones are defined using the updated classification of Koppen-Geiger
         <span><a>46</a>,
            <a>51</a></span> and then classified as humid, arid or transitional zones
         <span><a>14</a></span>. The data sets are introduced as follows.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite remote sensing provides global soil moisture information over a large spatial
            view. CCI provides the longest time series of global satellite soil moisture from
            1979–2013, which is used in this study. The data are combined by active and passive
            microwave satellite observations. The active data sets are generated by the University
            of Vienna and are based on observations from the C-band scatterometer of the European
            Remote Sensing satellites (ERS-1 and ERS-2) and the Meteorological Operational Satellite
            (MetOp-A). The passive data sets are based on observations from the Scanning Multichannel
            Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), the Tropical
            Rainfall Measuring Mission microwave imager (TRMM TMI) and the Advanced Microwave
            Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The accuracy of the CCI data
            is acceptable when validated using global ground-based observations, and the mean
            correlation coefficient (
            <span>r</span>) and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.46 and 0.04 cm

            Wetterdienst of Germany’s National Meteorological Service. The data include precipitation
            climatology for global land areas based on objective analyses of climatological norms,
            and the database includes information from approximately 67,200 rain gauge stations
            <span><a>35</a></span>. The relative sampling error of gridded monthly precipitation ranges from ± 7–40%
            of the true mean. The Full Data Reanalysis V.7 (1901–2013) data set is adopted in
            this study. The spatial resolution was resampled to 25 km to match the soil moisture
            data used in this study.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global surface temperature data are used to understand the climate condition of the
            SM-P feedback. The University of Delaware Air Temperature &amp; Precipitation data are
            used in this study (
            <span>http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/</span>). To investigate the spatial pattern of the feedback, the climate zones are classified
            based on the work of Koppen-Geiger. The classification defines the zones based on
            a combination of precipitation and air temperature. Peel

            <span><a>46</a></span> updated the classification based on long-term monthly data sets of precipitation
            and temperature. Polar regions cover large areas of ice and snow, which are excluded
            from our study. Meanwhile, we re-classify arid regions as defined by Peel 
            <span>et al</span>.
            <span><a>46</a></span>. Humid regions are zones without a dry season, and transitional regions are the final
            type of climate zone
            <span><a>20</a></span>. The three climate regions (arid, humid and transitional) cover 30.39%, 42.83% and
