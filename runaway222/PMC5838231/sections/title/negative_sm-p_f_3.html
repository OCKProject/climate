      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Positive SM-P feedback has been widely observed in past studies, while negative feedback
         has been given less attention. Thus, we further investigate the physical mechanism
         of negative feedback in dry and wet regions and estimate the SM-E and E-P correlations
         in areas with negative SM-P feedback. As shown in Fig. 
         <a>6(a)</a>, the negative SM-E correlation accounts for approximately half (42.77%) of the negative
         SM-P feedback in dry regions, while the positive SM-E correlation only accounts for
         9.33% of the feedback area. However, the negative E-P correlation occurs in only 0.75%
         of the negative SM-P feedback area, while the positive E-P correlation accounts for
         71.01% of the area. This result further confirms that the negative SM-E correlation
         accounts for the negative SM-P feedback. We further examine the water change in the
         areas of negative SM-P feedback in dry regions (Fig. 
         <a>6(b)</a>). We found that soil moisture decreases in 37.98% of the feedback area and increases
         in only 2.66% of the area. However, evapotranspiration changes in a relatively small
         area, represented by a decrease in 12.81% and increase in 17.08% of the feedback area.
         This finding demonstrates that the negative SM-E correlation in the dry region mainly
         causes the decrease in soil moisture. This is consistent with the results of a previous
         study, which found that global soil moisture change adheres to the “drier in dry”
         paradigm
         <span><a>20</a></span>. The minor change in evapotranspiration might be attributed to the soil moisture-limited
         conditions in the dry region
         <span><a>11</a></span>. The statistics show that the relative changes in soil moisture and evapotranspiration
         are 0.54% and 0.18%, respectively, in the negative SM-P feedback area in the dry region.
         Thus, the negative SM-P feedback is ultimately observed due to the combination of
         negative SM-E and positive E-P correlations.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The negative feedback over humid zones implies that limited precipitation occurs over
         these wet regions. Wei 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>36</a></span> attributed the feedback to the combined effects of the temporal autocorrelation of
         precipitation and the soil moisture memory. However, it is difficult to understand
         the spatial heterogeneity of the feedback. Thus, we investigate this mechanism based
         on Koster’s framework. As shown in Fig. 
         <a>7(a)</a>, the negative SM-E and positive E-P correlations cover 91.65% and 89.27% of the negative
         SM-P feedback area in wet regions, respectively. This result indicates that the SM-E
         correlation plays a more important role in negative SM-P feedback in wet regions than
         it does in dry regions. Figure 
         <a>7(b)</a> presents the water changes in the negative SM-P feedback area in wet regions. The
         soil moisture decreases insignificantly, decreasing in 11.38% of the feedback area
         and increasing in 10.97% of the area. However, evapotranspiration increases over a
         larger area (40.64% of the feedback area) but only decreases in 12.37% of the area.
         This finding indicates that the increasing evapotranspiration dominates the negative
         SM-E correlation in wet regions, potentially because of the variability in the near-surface
         temperature. It was previously reported that 80% of the overall near-surface temperature
         is associated with soil moisture change
         <span><a>37</a></span>. The near-surface temperature is 9.67 °C in the negative SM-P feedback area and −1.70 °C
         in the positive feedback area. According to Seneviratne
         <span><a>11</a></span>, the evapotranspiration change is energy limited in wet regions. Therefore, the high
         temperature tends to enhance the vapor pressure deficit and evaporative demand, which
         increases evapotranspiration. The increased evapotranspiration further enhances precipitation,
         which results in negative SM-P feedback under the condition of increasing soil moisture.
