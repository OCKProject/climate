      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global surface temperature data are used to understand the climate condition of the
         SM-P feedback. The University of Delaware Air Temperature &amp; Precipitation data are
         used in this study (
         <span>http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/</span>). To investigate the spatial pattern of the feedback, the climate zones are classified
         based on the work of Koppen-Geiger. The classification defines the zones based on
         a combination of precipitation and air temperature. Peel 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>46</a></span> updated the classification based on long-term monthly data sets of precipitation
         and temperature. Polar regions cover large areas of ice and snow, which are excluded
         from our study. Meanwhile, we re-classify arid regions as defined by Peel 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>46</a></span>. Humid regions are zones without a dry season, and transitional regions are the final
         type of climate zone
         <span><a>20</a></span>. The three climate regions (arid, humid and transitional) cover 30.39%, 42.83% and
         26.78% of the global land area, respectively.
