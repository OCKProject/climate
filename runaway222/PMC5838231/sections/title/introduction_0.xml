 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil moisture is a critical state variable in Earth systems and plays a significant role in land-atmosphere interactions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. The spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture depend on the variability of precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Soil moisture is also a feedback mechanism for other hydrological variables
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. The interactions between soil moisture and the hydrological variables are essential for understanding the physical mechanisms of global water and climate change. Therefore, clarification of the interactions has become a hotspot in global change studies. However, the complexity of the interactions and the scarcity of observations available to characterize the relevant processes have become increasingly apparent, resulting in considerable uncertainty in related studies

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil moisture-precipitation (SM-P) feedback is a central issue in studies of land-atmosphere interactions. It has the potential to propagate hydrological conditions and improve the predictability of the land-atmosphere system
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Identifying such regions of strong coupling is critical for improving the accuracy of climate prediction. It is also important for water monitoring in regions with strong SM-P coupling
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Due to the complex interactions between other hydrological and climatic factors, SM-P feedback varies in signal and strength. Most previous studies found positive correlations between soil moisture and precipitation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. This process can be interpreted by the water and energy cycles. Based on the water balance, wet soil results in high evapotranspiration, which provides abundant vapor for forming precipitation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. From the viewpoint of an energy balance, wet soil enhances the net solar and terrestrial radiation by the decreasing surface albedo and Bowen ratio, leading to a larger total flux of heat from the surface to the boundary layer. These effects then increase moist static energy, local convective storms, and, ultimately, precipitation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. However, the opposite phenomenon has been observed in recent studies, which observed that more precipitation fell over dry soil due to the enhanced convective system
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. This phenomenon was further confirmed by studies of global water change, which revealed an overestimation trend based on the paradigm of “dry gets drier, wet gets wetter”
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. The studies were controversial and generated considerable uncertainty regarding SM-P feedback.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several reasons account for the complexity of SM-P feedback. Most researchers attribute the complexity to the variability associated with different temporal
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> and spatial scales
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. Hohenegger 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> observed positive feedback in a 25-km simulation and predominantly negative feedback in a 2.2-km simulation. Ford 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span> observed positive and negative feedbacks simultaneously in Oklahoma during 19 temporal events, and the probability of afternoon precipitation over wet or dry soils depended on the absence of the low-level jet. Guillod 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> noted that precipitation is more likely to occur in wetter conditions temporally and drier conditions spatially. Recently, several researchers noted that both positive and negative feedbacks exist, even at the same spatial and temporal scales. For example, Findell and Eltahir
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> identified positive feedbacks in much of the eastern United States and negative feedbacks in the arid southwest, which has a dryline and monsoon season. Tuttle and Salvucci
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> also found positive and negative feedbacks across the United Sates, although their patterns were different compared to the results of Findell and Eltahir
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. The results suggest that in addition to the spatial and temporal scales, other factors affect the sign of SM-P feedback. However, the physical mechanism remains unclear and requires further investigation.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The introduction above suggests that SM-P feedback is crucial in land-atmosphere interactions. However, there is significant debate regarding the sign of the feedback and the physical mechanism that controls it, leaving a large gap in climate and hydrology research. This study aims to identify the feedback and evaluate the cause. Section 2 describes the patterns of the SM-P feedback and discusses the physical mechanism. Section 3 provides conclusions and discussion. Section 4 presents the study materials and methods. The study improves the understanding of the physical mechanism of SM-P feedback and supports the effective management of water resources in the context of climatic and anthropogenic change.</p>
