To investigate the spatial pattern of the feedback, the climate zones are classified based on the work of Koppen-Geiger. The classification defines the zones based on a combination of precipitation and air temperature. Peel

  </span> updated the classification based on long-term monthly data sets of precipitation and temperature. Polar regions cover large areas of ice and snow, which are excluded from our study. Meanwhile, we re-classify arid regions as defined by Peel 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.

  </span>. The three climate regions (arid, humid and transitional) cover 30.39%, 42.83% and 26.78% of the global land area, respectively.
