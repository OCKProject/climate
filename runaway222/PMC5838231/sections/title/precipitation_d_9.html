      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GPCC precipitation data are used in this study and were obtained from the Deutscher
         Wetterdienst of Germany’s National Meteorological Service. The data include precipitation
         climatology for global land areas based on objective analyses of climatological norms,
         and the database includes information from approximately 67,200 rain gauge stations
         <span><a>35</a></span>. The relative sampling error of gridded monthly precipitation ranges from ± 7–40%
         of the true mean. The Full Data Reanalysis V.7 (1901–2013) data set is adopted in
         this study. The spatial resolution was resampled to 25 km to match the soil moisture
         data used in this study.
