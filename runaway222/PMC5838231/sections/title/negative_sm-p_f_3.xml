 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Positive SM-P feedback has been widely observed in past studies, while negative feedback has been given less attention. Thus, we further investigate the physical mechanism of negative feedback in dry and wet regions and estimate the SM-E and E-P correlations in areas with negative SM-P feedback. As shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6(a)</a>, the negative SM-E correlation accounts for approximately half (42.77%) of the negative SM-P feedback in dry regions, while the positive SM-E correlation only accounts for 9.33% of the feedback area. However, the negative E-P correlation occurs in only 0.75% of the negative SM-P feedback area, while the positive E-P correlation accounts for 71.01% of the area. This result further confirms that the negative SM-E correlation accounts for the negative SM-P feedback. We further examine the water change in the areas of negative SM-P feedback in dry regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6(b)</a>). We found that soil moisture decreases in 37.98% of the feedback area and increases in only 2.66% of the area. However, evapotranspiration changes in a relatively small area, represented by a decrease in 12.81% and increase in 17.08% of the feedback area. This finding demonstrates that the negative SM-E correlation in the dry region mainly causes the decrease in soil moisture. This is consistent with the results of a previous study, which found that global soil moisture change adheres to the “drier in dry” paradigm
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. The minor change in evapotranspiration might be attributed to the soil moisture-limited conditions in the dry region
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. The statistics show that the relative changes in soil moisture and evapotranspiration are 0.54% and 0.18%, respectively, in the negative SM-P feedback area in the dry region. Thus, the negative SM-P feedback is ultimately observed due to the combination of negative SM-E and positive E-P correlations.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The negative feedback over humid zones implies that limited precipitation occurs over these wet regions. Wei 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span> attributed the feedback to the combined effects of the temporal autocorrelation of precipitation and the soil moisture memory. However, it is difficult to understand the spatial heterogeneity of the feedback. Thus, we investigate this mechanism based on Koster’s framework. As shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7(a)</a>, the negative SM-E and positive E-P correlations cover 91.65% and 89.27% of the negative SM-P feedback area in wet regions, respectively. This result indicates that the SM-E correlation plays a more important role in negative SM-P feedback in wet regions than it does in dry regions. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7(b)</a> presents the water changes in the negative SM-P feedback area in wet regions. The soil moisture decreases insignificantly, decreasing in 11.38% of the feedback area and increasing in 10.97% of the area. However, evapotranspiration increases over a larger area (40.64% of the feedback area) but only decreases in 12.37% of the area. This finding indicates that the increasing evapotranspiration dominates the negative SM-E correlation in wet regions, potentially because of the variability in the near-surface temperature. It was previously reported that 80% of the overall near-surface temperature is associated with soil moisture change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. The near-surface temperature is 9.67 °C in the negative SM-P feedback area and −1.70 °C in the positive feedback area. According to Seneviratne
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, the evapotranspiration change is energy limited in wet regions. Therefore, the high temperature tends to enhance the vapor pressure deficit and evaporative demand, which increases evapotranspiration. The increased evapotranspiration further enhances precipitation, which results in negative SM-P feedback under the condition of increasing soil moisture.
