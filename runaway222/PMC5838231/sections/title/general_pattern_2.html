      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial variability in hydrological variables (soil moisture, precipitation and
         evapotranspiration) results in significant complexity regarding SM-P feedback. Global
         average statistics, although useful, result in overestimation in some regions and
         underestimation in others. Since SM-P feedback is a local process
         <span><a>27</a></span>, we evaluate the feedback in at the pixel scale spatially. The correlation analysis
         shows that significant SM-P feedback occurs in 47.10% of the total land area (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). As expected, a positive correlation dominates the feedback. However, non-negligible
         negative feedback also exists in some areas. Statistically, 87.09% of the feedback
         is positive, and 12.91% is negative. Spatially, the positive feedback is mainly located
         in central and southern Africa and southwestern and northern Asia. By contrast, the
         hotspots of negative feedback are located in southern South America, northern Africa,
         western Europe, and eastern Asia.

         zones. As shown in Fig.

         <span>3</span>/cm
         <span>3</span>) soils. At the climate zone scale (Fig. 
         <a>4(b)</a>), 27.73%, 37.49% and 34.78% of the positive feedbacks occur in arid, humid and transitional
         zones, respectively, and cover 45.16%, 43.31% and 65.43% area of each climate zone.
         The negative feedbacks are mainly located in arid and humid zones, which account for
         43.75% and 40.16% of all negative feedback, respectively, and cover 10.73% and 6.99%
         of the climate zones. Previous studies have provided numerous examples of positive
         SM-P feedback in transitional zones
         <span><a>14</a>–
            <a>16</a>,
            <a>29</a></span>. The results of this study demonstrate that negative feedback can occur in dry and
         wet regions, which could clarify the climate conditions associated with the feedback
         sign.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Koster’s framework is then used to explore the physical mechanism of SM-P feedback.
         According to the framework, one or three negative correlations of P-E, SM-E and E-P
         would result in negative SM-P feedback, and positive P-SM correlation has been observed
         in previous studies
         <span><a>30</a>–
            <a>34</a></span>. It is also upstream of the SM-P feedback loop. Therefore, only the SM-E and E-P
         correlations are adopted to estimate the physical mechanism of SM-P feedback (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). The positive and negative SM-E correlations cover 50.77% and 24.74% of the total
         land area (Fig. 
         <a>5(a)</a>). Seneviratne 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>35</a></span> presented probable reasons for the complex SM-E correlation. In transitional climate
         zones, evapotranspiration exhibits an approximately linear relationship with soil
         moisture. However, the correlation is weakened in dry soil because of high soil suction
         (soil moisture limited) and in wet soil because of potential evapotranspiration (energy
         limited). Spatially, the negative SM-E correlation covers 72.81% area of the negative
         SM-P feedback, which is concentrated in southern North America, northern South America
         and western Asia. According to Koster’s framework, the spatial inconsistence between
         the SM-E and E-P correlations generates the negative SM-P feedback. Since the positive
         E-P correlation is observed over land (84.38% of the total land area) (Fig. 
         <a>5(b)</a>), the negative SM-E correlation might be the dominant force associated with negative
         SM-P feedback.
