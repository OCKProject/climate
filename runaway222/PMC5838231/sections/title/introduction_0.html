      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil moisture is a critical state variable in Earth systems and plays a significant
         role in land-atmosphere interactions
         <span><a>1</a>–
            <a>3</a></span>. The spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture depend on the variability of
         precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff
         <span><a>4</a>,
            <a>5</a></span>. Soil moisture is also a feedback mechanism for other hydrological variables
         <span><a>6</a>–
            <a>8</a></span>. The interactions between soil moisture and the hydrological variables are essential
         for understanding the physical mechanisms of global water and climate change. Therefore,
         clarification of the interactions has become a hotspot in global change studies. However,
         the complexity of the interactions and the scarcity of observations available to characterize
         the relevant processes have become increasingly apparent, resulting in considerable
         uncertainty in related studies
         <span><a>9</a>–
            <a>11</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil moisture-precipitation (SM-P) feedback is a central issue in studies of land-atmosphere
         interactions. It has the potential to propagate hydrological conditions and improve
         the predictability of the land-atmosphere system
         <span><a>12</a></span>. Identifying such regions of strong coupling is critical for improving the accuracy
         of climate prediction. It is also important for water monitoring in regions with strong
         SM-P coupling
         <span><a>13</a></span>. Due to the complex interactions between other hydrological and climatic factors,
         SM-P feedback varies in signal and strength. Most previous studies found positive
         correlations between soil moisture and precipitation
         <span><a>14</a>–
            <a>16</a></span>. This process can be interpreted by the water and energy cycles. Based on the water
         balance, wet soil results in high evapotranspiration, which provides abundant vapor
         for forming precipitation
         <span><a>11</a></span>. From the viewpoint of an energy balance, wet soil enhances the net solar and terrestrial
         radiation by the decreasing surface albedo and Bowen ratio, leading to a larger total
         flux of heat from the surface to the boundary layer. These effects then increase moist
         static energy, local convective storms, and, ultimately, precipitation
         <span><a>16</a></span>. However, the opposite phenomenon has been observed in recent studies, which observed
         that more precipitation fell over dry soil due to the enhanced convective system
         <span><a>17</a>,
            <a>18</a></span>. This phenomenon was further confirmed by studies of global water change, which revealed
         an overestimation trend based on the paradigm of “dry gets drier, wet gets wetter”
         <span><a>19</a>,
            <a>20</a></span>. The studies were controversial and generated considerable uncertainty regarding
         SM-P feedback.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several reasons account for the complexity of SM-P feedback. Most researchers attribute
         the complexity to the variability associated with different temporal
         <span><a>12</a></span> and spatial scales
         <span><a>21</a></span>. Hohenegger 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>22</a></span> observed positive feedback in a 25-km simulation and predominantly negative feedback
         in a 2.2-km simulation. Ford 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>23</a>,
            <a>24</a></span> observed positive and negative feedbacks simultaneously in Oklahoma during 19 temporal
         events, and the probability of afternoon precipitation over wet or dry soils depended
         on the absence of the low-level jet. Guillod 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>18</a></span> noted that precipitation is more likely to occur in wetter conditions temporally
         and drier conditions spatially. Recently, several researchers noted that both positive
         and negative feedbacks exist, even at the same spatial and temporal scales. For example,
         Findell and Eltahir
         <span><a>25</a></span> identified positive feedbacks in much of the eastern United States and negative feedbacks
         in the arid southwest, which has a dryline and monsoon season. Tuttle and Salvucci
         <span><a>26</a></span> also found positive and negative feedbacks across the United Sates, although their
         patterns were different compared to the results of Findell and Eltahir
         <span><a>25</a></span>. The results suggest that in addition to the spatial and temporal scales, other factors
         affect the sign of SM-P feedback. However, the physical mechanism remains unclear
         and requires further investigation.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The introduction above suggests that SM-P feedback is crucial in land-atmosphere interactions.
         However, there is significant debate regarding the sign of the feedback and the physical
         mechanism that controls it, leaving a large gap in climate and hydrology research.
         This study aims to identify the feedback and evaluate the cause. Section 2 describes
         the patterns of the SM-P feedback and discusses the physical mechanism. Section 3
         provides conclusions and discussion. Section 4 presents the study materials and methods.
         The study improves the understanding of the physical mechanism of SM-P feedback and
         supports the effective management of water resources in the context of climatic and
         anthropogenic change.
