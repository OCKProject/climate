 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall trends of global water change. In the past 30 years (1982–2011), the global water balance has changed profoundly due to natural and anthropogenic influences. Figure

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1(b,e)</a>), the multi-year mean is 711.45 mm, which decreases from the equator to the poles spatially. Meanwhile, temporal global precipitation exhibited a significant increase over the past 30 year (

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate is one of the dominant factors that affects global water change. Therefore, we analyze the spatial variability in soil moisture, precipitation and evapotranspiration at the climate zone scale. Thus, the hydrological responses to different climate conditions can be easily estimated. As shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, soil moisture and precipitation are highest in the humid zone (0.275 cm
  <span class="sup">3</span>/cm
  <span class="sup">3</span> and 1057.60 mm), followed by the transitional zone (0.240 cm
  <span class="sup">3</span>/cm
  <span class="sup">3</span> and 882.64 mm) and arid zone (0.150 cm
  <span class="sup">3</span>/cm
  <span class="sup">3</span> and 306.94 mm). Although precipitation and soil moisture are high in the humid zone, the corresponding evapotranspiration (550.22 mm) is lower than that in the transitional zone (562.85 mm). This inconsistency suggests that complex interactions exist between the three variables. Further analysis shows that the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation (E/P) is 0.98, 0.59 and 0.67 in arid, humid and transitional zones, respectively. This result implies that almost all precipitation in arid zones returns to the atmosphere via evaporation from the soil. However, in humid zones, a limited portion of the water evaporates, even from wet soil.

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial variability in hydrological variables (soil moisture, precipitation and evapotranspiration) results in significant complexity regarding SM-P feedback. Global average statistics, although useful, result in overestimation in some regions and underestimation in others. Since SM-P feedback is a local process
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
   </span>, we evaluate the feedback in at the pixel scale spatially. The correlation analysis shows that significant SM-P feedback occurs in 47.10% of the total land area (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). As expected, a positive correlation dominates the feedback. However, non-negligible negative feedback also exists in some areas. Statistically, 87.09% of the feedback is positive, and 12.91% is negative. Spatially, the positive feedback is mainly located in central and southern Africa and southwestern and northern Asia. By contrast, the hotspots of negative feedback are located in southern South America, northern Africa, western Europe, and eastern Asia.

The negative feedbacks are mainly located in arid and humid zones, which account for 43.75% and 40.16% of all negative feedback, respectively, and cover 10.73% and 6.99% of the climate zones.

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Koster’s framework is then used to explore the physical mechanism of SM-P feedback. According to the framework, one or three negative correlations of P-E, SM-E and E-P would result in negative SM-P feedback, and positive P-SM correlation has been observed in previous studies

   </span>. It is also upstream of the SM-P feedback loop. Therefore, only the SM-E and E-P correlations are adopted to estimate the physical mechanism of SM-P feedback (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). The positive and negative SM-E correlations cover 50.77% and 24.74% of the total land area (Fig.

   </span> presented probable reasons for the complex SM-E correlation. In transitional climate zones, evapotranspiration exhibits an approximately linear relationship with soil moisture. However, the correlation is weakened in dry soil because of high soil suction (soil moisture limited) and in wet soil because of potential evapotranspiration (energy limited). Spatially, the negative SM-E correlation covers 72.81% area of the negative SM-P feedback, which is concentrated in southern North America, northern South America and western Asia. According to Koster’s framework, the spatial inconsistence between the SM-E and E-P correlations generates the negative SM-P feedback. Since the positive E-P correlation is observed over land (84.38% of the total land area) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5(b)</a>), the negative SM-E correlation might be the dominant force associated with negative SM-P feedback.

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Positive SM-P feedback has been widely observed in past studies, while negative feedback has been given less attention. Thus, we further investigate the physical mechanism of negative feedback in dry and wet regions and estimate the SM-E and E-P correlations in areas with negative SM-P feedback. As shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6(a)</a>, the negative SM-E correlation accounts for approximately half (42.77%) of the negative SM-P feedback in dry regions, while the positive SM-E correlation only accounts for 9.33% of the feedback area. However, the negative E-P correlation occurs in only 0.75% of the negative SM-P feedback area, while the positive E-P correlation accounts for 71.01% of the area. This result further confirms that the negative SM-E correlation accounts for the negative SM-P feedback. We further examine the water change in the areas of negative SM-P feedback in dry regions (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6(b)</a>). We found that soil moisture decreases in 37.98% of the feedback area and increases in only 2.66% of the area. However, evapotranspiration changes in a relatively small area, represented by a decrease in 12.81% and increase in 17.08% of the feedback area. This finding demonstrates that the negative SM-E correlation in the dry region mainly causes the decrease in soil moisture. This is consistent with the results of a previous study, which found that global soil moisture change adheres to the “drier in dry” paradigm
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
   </span>. The minor change in evapotranspiration might be attributed to the soil moisture-limited conditions in the dry region
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
   </span>. The statistics show that the relative changes in soil moisture and evapotranspiration are 0.54% and 0.18%, respectively, in the negative SM-P feedback area in the dry region. Thus, the negative SM-P feedback is ultimately observed due to the combination of negative SM-E and positive E-P correlations.

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
   </span> attributed the feedback to the combined effects of the temporal autocorrelation of precipitation and the soil moisture memory. However, it is difficult to understand the spatial heterogeneity of the feedback. Thus, we investigate this mechanism based on Koster’s framework. As shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7(a)</a>, the negative SM-E and positive E-P correlations cover 91.65% and 89.27% of the negative SM-P feedback area in wet regions, respectively. This result indicates that the SM-E correlation plays a more important role in negative SM-P feedback in wet regions than it does in dry regions. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7(b)</a> presents the water changes in the negative SM-P feedback area in wet regions. The soil moisture decreases insignificantly, decreasing in 11.38% of the feedback area and increasing in 10.97% of the area. However, evapotranspiration increases over a larger area (40.64% of the feedback area) but only decreases in 12.37% of the area. This finding indicates that the increasing evapotranspiration dominates the negative SM-E correlation in wet regions, potentially because of the variability in the near-surface temperature. It was previously reported that 80% of the overall near-surface temperature is associated with soil moisture change
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span>. The near-surface temperature is 9.67 °C in the negative SM-P feedback area and −1.70 °C in the positive feedback area. According to Seneviratne
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
   </span>, the evapotranspiration change is energy limited in wet regions. Therefore, the high temperature tends to enhance the vapor pressure deficit and evaporative demand, which increases evapotranspiration. The increased evapotranspiration further enhances precipitation, which results in negative SM-P feedback under the condition of increasing soil moisture.
