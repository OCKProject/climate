         convective system and boundary layer are investigated using land-atmosphere models.
         Although the method addresses land surface-atmosphere interactions, it contains uncertainty
         because of the complex interactions of the variables, weakening the reliability of
         the results
         <span><a>26</a></span>. Therefore, we investigate the feedback based on a statistical analysis. The coefficient
         of correlation (
         <span>r</span>) is adopted to identify the sign of SM-P feedback
         <span><a>15</a>,
            <a>36</a></span>. Considering the time lag effect of soil moisture on precipitation, we evaluate the
         correlation between monthly soil moisture and precipitation in the next month

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is difficult to evaluate the physical mechanism of SM-P interaction using soil
         moisture and precipitation information because the latter variable has a direct impact
         on the former, and their causal relationship cannot be easily identified
         <span><a>46</a></span>. Evapotranspiration links the surface water and energy balances, which affect the
         feedback
         <span><a>32</a>,
            <a>34</a>,
            <a>47</a>–
            <a>50</a></span>. Therefore, we estimate the feedback by introducing evapotranspiration into the feedback
         loop. Koster 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>48</a></span> proposed a feedback framework based on the concept of water balance. It sub-divided
         the feedback as the coupling of the wetting soil by precipitation (P-SM), enhancement
         evapotranspiration by the wetted soil (SM-E), and enhancement precipitation by the
         high evapotranspiration (E-P) (Fig. 
         <a>8</a>). From this framework, the sign of the feedback can be easily identified. According
         to the feedback loop, negative SM-P feedback occurs when one or three of the sub-divisions
         is/are negative.
