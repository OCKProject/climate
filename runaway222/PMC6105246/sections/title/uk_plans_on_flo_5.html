      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the UK, the use of adaptation pathways was pioneered by the Thames Estuary 2100
         (TE2100) project which produced a plan for managing tidal flood risk in the Thames
         estuary and London for the twenty-first century. TE2100 was one of the first major
         infrastructure projects to explicitly recognize and address the issue of the deep
         uncertainty in climate projections throughout the planning process (Ranger et al.
         
         <a>2013</a>). The plan as a result has the uncertainties surrounding climate change impacts at
         its core.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A critical component in the development of the TE2100 Plan was a risk assessment,
         which included identifying existing levels of vulnerability, collating and generating
         climate information, assessing the sensitivity of existing flood risk management approaches
         to future climate, identifying thresholds relevant to decision-making (e.g., values
         for mean sea level) that trigger the need to modify existing flood defenses), and
         identifying and appraising the effectiveness of potential adaptation actions (Ranger
         et al. 
         <a>2013</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The development of the TE2100 Plan included appraising adaptation portfolios using
         multi-criteria assessment and prioritization of preferred pathways (Ranger et al.
         
         <a>2013</a>). The TE2100 plan has a set of options based on adaptation pathways which can cope
         with increases in maximum water levels from those experienced at the start of the
         century through to a worst case of 2.7 m by 2100 (Environment Agency UK 
         <a>2012a</a>). The preferred pathway identified includes staged long-term modification of the
         Thames Barrier and the management of fluvial and pluvial flooding through local measures
         including making space for water, local flood defenses, building resilience measures,
         flood forecasting, and emergency planning (Environment Agency UK 
         <a>2012a</a>). The project also explored potential limits of adaptation,
         <a>2</a> which are anticipated if sea level rise exceeds 5 m.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
         <a>2</a> shows how options can be combined to achieve a plan where investment in a barrage
         is delayed until it is needed. An “Option” is a number of portfolios which, when implemented
         in sequence, provide a complete flood risk management solution for the next 100 years.
         A “Portfolio” of responses is a number of responses which, when combined together,
         provide a complete flood risk management solution for a particular increase in sea
         level and/or fluvial flow. A “Response” is an individual flood risk management measure,
         for example, a barrier, a length of raised defense, or an emergency plan for a community
         (Environment Agency UK 
         <a>2012b</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the TE2100 Project, socio-economic scenarios were used to compare the effectiveness
         of differing adaptation pathways. The plan needed to consider not only growing hazards
         due to climate change and aging infrastructure, but also the rising economic value
         at risk and population at risk throughout the Estuary. The plan needed to meet a range
         of environmental and social objectives (Environment Agency UK 
         <a>2012a</a>) and value/cost benefit was a key part of the decision-making process (Penning-Rowsell
         et al. 
         <a>2013</a>). There was an extensive strategic environmental assessment (Environment Agency UK
         
         <a>2012b</a>) and MCDA (Penning-Rowsell et al. 
         <a>2013</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plan has been approved by government and has set out a program of measures including
         a possible date for a new barrier (2070) assuming a 90-cm increase in water levels
         by 2100. The plan sets out how the timing of the measures may need to change depending
         on the monitoring of key indicators including sea level rise, river flow, and erosion
         rates. The outputs from the monitoring program will inform the scheduled review and
         re-appraisal of the TE2100 Plan every 10 years, with a mid-term monitoring review
         to be undertaken every 5 years. The first 10-year program of work has been approved
         with a £350 million budget. TE2100 sets a long-term strategic vision of how London
         can adapt and establishes the potential need for transformational change in the long
         term.
