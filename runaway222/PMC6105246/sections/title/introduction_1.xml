 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is now clear that climate change and socio-economic growth lead to a growing need for considering the robustness and flexibility of structures, systems, and plans (Milly et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2008</a>; Hallegatte 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2009</a>; Hallegatte et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2012</a>; Kalra et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2014</a>; Walker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2013</a>; Petersen and Bloemen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The editorial of the Global Environmental Change special edition that looked at the growing body of literature on adaptation to climate change (Maru and Smith 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2014</a>, p.322) concluded
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par4">“These efforts have been important in the progression of this area of research, improving understanding of climate-change adaptation related problems, and informing adaptation planning. However, it is widely reported that these efforts have not yet had a large impact on the implementation of adaptation plans (reviewed in Wise et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2014</a>).”
   </p>
  </div>An important aspect of climate change adaptation is managing the deep uncertainties related to future changes in climatic and social economic conditions in the development of strategies and the design of measures (Walker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2001</a>; Werners et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">2015</a>; Bloemen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As summarized by Kwakkel et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2016</a>),
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par6">“Deep uncertainty means that the various parties to a decision do not know or cannot agree on the system and its boundaries; the outcomes of interest and their relative importance; the prior probability distribution for uncertain inputs to the system (Lempert et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2003</a>; Walker et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2013</a>); or decisions are made over time in dynamic interaction with the system and cannot be considered independently (Haasnoot et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2013</a>; Hallegatte et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2012</a>).”
   </p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The notion of deep uncertainty has spurred the development of adaptive policymaking. A generic trade of adaptive policymaking is that, in contrast to static policies, it results in contingency plans and specified conditions under which the policy should be reconsidered (Walker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2001</a>). The ability to change policy practices based on new experience and insights is an important aspect of adaptive management (Pahl-Wostl 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2007</a>). Klijn et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2015</a>) state that adaptive management should rely on a sound ex-ante policy analysis which encompasses a future outlook, establishing whether policy transition is required, an assessment of alternative flood risk management strategies, and their planning in anticipation without running the risk of regret of doing too little too late or too much too early.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change adaptation is a rapidly expanding field of expertise. While the practical experience is gradually growing, the field of expertise as a whole is still dominated by science focusing on, amongst others, the development of rational approaches for dealing with uncertainty (Wise et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2014</a>). Policymakers, politicians, and other decision-makers are increasingly interested in information on the practical applicability of these approaches and scientists do try to meet this demand (Bradfield et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2016</a>; Ben-Haim 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2015</a>; Convery and Wagner 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2016</a>; Derbyshire and Wright 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2017</a>; Dewulf and Termeer 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2015</a>; Kwakkel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2016</a>; Lempert et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2016</a>; Lyons and Davidson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2016</a>; Maier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2016</a>; Whaley and Weatherhead 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the approaches that has been developed to respond to deep uncertainty is the adaptation pathways or route-map approach (Reeder and Ranger 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2011</a>; Haasnoot et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2013</a>; Wise et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2014</a>). A route map or adaptation pathway map illustrates a series of interrelated adaptation pathways. Adaptation pathways show what options make sense under what conditions and indicate in what timeframes these conditions can be expected under certain climate scenarios (Kwadijk et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2010</a>).
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par10">“It provides decision makers a way to acknowledge the inter-temporal complexities and uncertainties associated with the novel dynamics of climate change and a mechanism to manage these challenges in the local context.” (Lin et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2017</a>, p. 384) “Because of the recognized complexity of decision-making under climate change uncertainty, applications of adaptation pathways have been rapidly growing around the world in the hope and expectation that it will assist in overcoming constraints and barriers to disaster mitigation and climate adaptation.” (p. 386) “However, very little work has been done to evaluate to current use of adaptation pathways and its utility to practitioners and decision makers.” (p. 387) This paper aims to fill in exactly that gap.
   </p>
  </div>The experience with two of world’s largest real-life applications of adaptation pathways in the field of flood risk management is analyzed in order to distill lessons learned and formulate challenges for the further development of this approach. As Klein et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2017</a>) conclude in their report, “Advancing climate adaptation practices and solutions - Emerging research priorities”: “One clear opportunity for improvement is the nexus between adaptation researchers, and practitioners focused on adaptation action. There is a need to better understand how knowledge is transmitted and diffused, and the role that communication plays in policy learning. It is also increasingly recognized that effective research-practitioner engagement operates in both directions and requires true collaboration and mutual learning. By drawing on insights from a variety of perspectives and contexts, including practitioners, researchers can produce higher- quality work and build relationships that will facilitate research uptake.” (p. 13).
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The further development of the adaptation pathways approach needs, just like other complex policymaking concepts, an effective science-policy debate, by inviting scientists in the policy world and vice versa. This paper is written by action researchers and practitioners and aims to distill lessons learned from applying the adaptation pathway approach in practice in the field of flood risk management.</p>
