  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the UK, the use of adaptation pathways was pioneered by the Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100) project which produced a plan for managing tidal flood risk in the Thames estuary and London for the twenty-first century. TE2100 was one of the first major infrastructure projects to explicitly recognize and address the issue of the deep uncertainty in climate projections throughout the planning process (Ranger et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2013</a>). The plan as a result has the uncertainties surrounding climate change impacts at its core.
  </p>
  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A critical component in the development of the TE2100 Plan was a risk assessment, which included identifying existing levels of vulnerability, collating and generating climate information, assessing the sensitivity of existing flood risk management approaches to future climate, identifying thresholds relevant to decision-making (e.g., values for mean sea level) that trigger the need to modify existing flood defenses), and identifying and appraising the effectiveness of potential adaptation actions (Ranger et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The development of the TE2100 Plan included appraising adaptation portfolios using multi-criteria assessment and prioritization of preferred pathways (Ranger et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2013</a>). The TE2100 plan has a set of options based on adaptation pathways which can cope with increases in maximum water levels from those experienced at the start of the century through to a worst case of 2.7 m by 2100 (Environment Agency UK 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2012a</a>). The preferred pathway identified includes staged long-term modification of the Thames Barrier and the management of fluvial and pluvial flooding through local measures including making space for water, local flood defenses, building resilience measures, flood forecasting, and emergency planning (Environment Agency UK 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2012a</a>). The project also explored potential limits of adaptation,
   <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2" href="#Fn2">2</a> which are anticipated if sea level rise exceeds 5 m.
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows how options can be combined to achieve a plan where investment in a barrage is delayed until it is needed. An “Option” is a number of portfolios which, when implemented in sequence, provide a complete flood risk management solution for the next 100 years. A “Portfolio” of responses is a number of responses which, when combined together, provide a complete flood risk management solution for a particular increase in sea level and/or fluvial flow. A “Response” is an individual flood risk management measure, for example, a barrier, a length of raised defense, or an emergency plan for a community (Environment Agency UK 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2012b</a>).

  </p>
  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the TE2100 Project, socio-economic scenarios were used to compare the effectiveness of differing adaptation pathways. The plan needed to consider not only growing hazards due to climate change and aging infrastructure, but also the rising economic value at risk and population at risk throughout the Estuary. The plan needed to meet a range of environmental and social objectives (Environment Agency UK 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2012a</a>) and value/cost benefit was a key part of the decision-making process (Penning-Rowsell et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2013</a>). There was an extensive strategic environmental assessment (Environment Agency UK 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2012b</a>) and MCDA (Penning-Rowsell et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plan has been approved by government and has set out a program of measures including a possible date for a new barrier (2070) assuming a 90-cm increase in water levels by 2100. The plan sets out how the timing of the measures may need to change depending on the monitoring of key indicators including sea level rise, river flow, and erosion rates. The outputs from the monitoring program will inform the scheduled review and re-appraisal of the TE2100 Plan every 10 years, with a mid-term monitoring review to be undertaken every 5 years. The first 10-year program of work has been approved with a £350 million budget. TE2100 sets a long-term strategic vision of how London can adapt and establishes the potential need for transformational change in the long term.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Dutch Delta Programme</div>
  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Dutch Delta Programme, the national government, provinces, municipalities, and water boards work together on the improvement of flood risk management and on the reduction of vulnerability to water scarcity (Delta Programme Commissioner 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2011</a>; Van Alphen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2015</a>). The program follows a proactive approach to flood prevention instead of preparing for flood disasters (Schultz van Haegen and Wieriks 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">2015</a>). Reducing disaster risk is a cost-effective investment in preventing future losses (Zevenbergen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">2013</a>; Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2015</a>–2030).
  </p>
  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In countries with stringent flood safety standards like the Netherlands, there are no indications that the risk decrease resulting from a further local reduction in the probability of a flooding is nullified by a risk increase due to higher consequences of a flooding resulting from an accelerated growth in population and investments.</p>
  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Involving social organizations and the business community, the public authorities prepared the five so-called “Delta Decisions.” These over-arching decisions form the basis of the work that the Netherlands will perform over the next 35 years (with a planning horizon of 2100). The decisions concern new water safety standards, sustainable fresh water provision, climate-resilient design and construction of urban and rural areas across the Netherlands, and structuring choices for flood risk management and freshwater supply in the IJsselmeer region and the Rhine-Meuse delta. Six regional strategies were developed iteratively, consisting of goals, measures, and a tentative timeline. These regional strategies were developed in the regional sub-program of the Delta Programme, in which provinces, municipalities, and water boards work together, involving the scientific community, NGOs and the private sector.</p>
  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four so-called “Delta Scenarios” were developed to guide the process of formulating the Delta Decisions and constructing the regional strategies. These scenarios cover the two main uncertainties: climate change and socio-economic conditions. A rough indicative analysis of the reasons for investing in improving the protection system against flooding shows that approximately 40% can be assigned to climate change and land subsidence and 60% to a backlog in maintenance of the present protection system in combination with outdated flood safety standards. These standards were based on the size of the population and value of investments in the early 1960s of the last century. The new standards, which came into effect on January 1, 2017, take into consideration the “high end” of the four Delta Scenarios. For 2050, the date on which the new protection level has to be realized, they assume considerable climate change (average temperature up 2°, sea level rise of 35 cm, winter precipitation up 14%) and an increase in population (20 million people) and value of investments (ongoing economic growth of 2.5% a year).</p>
  <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Delta Plan on flood risk management and the Delta Plan on freshwater, both financed from the Delta Fund, comprise the measures from the regional strategies. The “Delta Decisions,” regional strategies, and two Delta Plans formed the central elements of the proposal sent to parliament in September 2014. The proposal contains a total of 14 pathways, developed with a planning horizon until 2100. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> illustrates the pathway developed for the Rotterdam area. The proposal was accepted and the necessary budget until 2028, €17 billion, has been allocated (Delta Programme Commissioner 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2014</a>).

  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A “Signal Group Delta Programme” has been assigned the task to inform about developments and possible tipping points. Authoritative knowledge institutes in the field of water, spatial planning, and climate are represented in the Signal Group. The group reports on developments in three categories: “knowledge and innovation,” “climate change and socio-economic developments,” and “societal preferences.”</p>
  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows which measures (dark blue boxes) are considered in the three consecutive time periods: 2015–2030, 2030–2050, and 2050–2100. The horizontal trajectories visualize the strategies that will be implemented simultaneously. Light blue boxes indicate long-term options, like the modification of the discharge distribution among the Rhine branches. The orange diamonds indicate preparatory actions. Examples are spatial reservations, especially necessary for river widening, and research on the costs, benefits, and technical feasibility of modifying the discharge distribution among the Rhine branches. Green arrows highlight measures that heavily influence the effectiveness of other measures. If for instance the research on the possibilities of modifying the discharge distribution leads to a decree that this measure will be implemented in the future, then dike strengthening projects will need to include the effects of this modification in their planning and design.
