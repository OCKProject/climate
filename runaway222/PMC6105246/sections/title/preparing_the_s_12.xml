 <p id="Par69" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While in theory, the pathways approach is “neutral” to the choice of the type and order of measures, practice shows that the selected pathway or the preferred strategy often contains incremental measures in the short-term, firmer measures in the mid-term and (options for) system-changing interventions or transformational measures in the long term. The rationale behind it seems obvious: the longer the time-horizon, the larger the climatic challenges, thus the heavier the interventions.</p>
 <p id="Par70" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of course, the distinction between these categories is gradual and depends on the geographical and timescale that is considered. Using a geographical scale of several hundreds of kilometers and a timescale of several decades, concrete measures can be used to typify the three categories. Incremental measures are for instance series of local dike strengthening projects. Firm measures constitute a more robust approach, designed to meet upfront the more challenging of plausible futures. An example is the construction of regional bypasses in a river system to reduce the risk of flooding. Transformational measures drastically change the present system, preparing it to counter the most extreme situations. A typical example would be the construction of a new dam in an otherwise open estuary.</p>
 <p id="Par71" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Incremental measures are “protective” in the sense that they can be considered as investments in a further gradual improvement of the resilience of the present system. Flipside is that this may increase the transfer costs to a new or significantly modified system. Increasing the resilience of the present system may also lead to an increase of sunk costs, further heightening the threshold for switching from an incremental strategy to a transformational strategy. Research on ancient societies has shown that sunk-cost effects can increase the vulnerability of a society (Scheffer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">2003</a>; Janssen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2003</a>; Scheffer and Westley 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">2007</a>). This is one of several psychological barriers that limit both climate change mitigation and adaptation (Gifford 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Continuing on the path of incremental measures may enlarge path dependency. Useful information on this effect might be generated by comparing alternative adaptation pathways using a cost-benefit analysis that covers the complete period of the adaptation pathways (several decades, a century) and takes into consideration the issues of sunk costs and transfer costs. Specific attention is needed for dealing with the fact that discounting may blur the picture at the long-term end of the trajectory.</p>
 <p id="Par73" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is often stated that there are many plans for transformational measures, but that these measures are implemented only as a reaction to extreme events. Comparable to the TE 2100 Plan, the Delta Programme aims “to stay ahead of major floodings.” Due to climate change, transformational measures are inevitable in the long term. So at some point in time, the transition from incremental strategies to transformational strategies will have to be made. Though several authors have addressed the difficulty of making a 
  <span class="italic">planned</span> shift to transformational strategies (Folke et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2010</a>; de Haan et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2014</a>; Kates et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2012</a>; Lonsdale et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2015</a>; Rijke et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">2013</a>), it has not been tackled yet adequately.
 </p>
 <p id="Par74" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From this analysis, it also follows that middle-term investments in the resilience of the present system should be re-evaluated in the light of a possible future transition to a significantly modified system. Options are to adopt shorter depreciation periods, or to consider alternative measures that are specifically designed for relatively short periods.</p>
 <p id="Par75" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A challenge for the adaptation pathways approach is to visualize (increases in) the path dependency of a strategy and (in) the transfer costs related to switching from one strategy to another (within an adaptation pathway or between two different ones).</p>
 <p id="Par76" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These observations and suggestions implicitly assume that decision-making is a more or less rational, scientific data driven process. Real-life decision-making is often blurred by institutional and political considerations.</p>
 <p id="Par77" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eriksen et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2015</a>) argue that “adaptation is a social-political process that mediates how individuals and collectives deal with multiple and concurrent environmental and social changes” (p. 523). The adaptation pathways approach, like other approaches developed for rationalizing decision-making in the face of uncertainty, does not automatically address the political aspects of decision-making. They argue for “reframing adaptation to take account of how the exercise of power is always present within climate change responses. (…) Our concern is to (…) hold in view how any transformational adaptation pathway will inevitably be plagued by contradictory outcomes” (p. 524).
 </p>
 <p id="Par78" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of their research, Van Buuren et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2016</a>) conclude that “specific mechanisms of path dependency, for example, the existing power asymmetries between competing coalitions and the intricate complexity of flood policies, prevent institutional change, but cannot prevent ideas about resilience slowly gaining more impact.” (p. 41). This implies that conservative powers may block or slow down necessary transformations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par79" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hermans et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2017</a>) have studied the adaptation pathways constructed in the Dutch Delta Programme and conclude that “different types of signposts exist. Technical signposts, in particular, need to be distinguished from political ones, and require different learning processes with different types of actors.”(p. 29). This improves—and complicates—the analysis.
 </p>
 <p id="Par80" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Van der Brugge and Roosjen (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">2015</a>) point out that the different strategies making up an adaptation map or route map may require different institutional and sociocultural conditions. Climatological and social economic scenarios that favor a certain strategy may not automatically also favor the necessary conditions. They also signal challenges with regard to the governance needed to keep options open for future, an important aspect of the way adaptation pathways were developed in the Dutch Delta Programme. Especially in the case of transfer options that require larger, transitional changes, the institutional and social cultural conditions are important constraint factors (Grin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2010</a>). Van der Brugge and Roosjen (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">2015</a>) also warn that the resistance to change in the existing social technical regimes should not be underestimated. The governance challenges have remained implicit in adaptation pathway approach—and are considerable.
