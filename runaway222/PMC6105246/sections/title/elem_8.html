      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of an analysis of the practical experiences in the two water management
         programs, the results of discussing these experiences in national and international
         conferences, and the online survey on the applicability of the adaptation pathways
         approach in the Dutch Delta Programme, the following challenges were formulated for
         the further development of this approach.
      </p>
      <div class="sec" title="sec">
         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determining tipping points in the absence of precise policy goals, for intrinsically
            flexible strategies and in situations with large natural variability
         </div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An implicit assumption of the adaptation pathway approach is that some physical parameter,
            be it climatic conditions influencing probabilities of a flood, or socio-economic
            developments influencing possible consequences of a flooding, changes gradually, thus
            slowly but surely forcing society to react and ultimately switch to a different strategy.
            This approach seems to work best in the case of gradual-trend-dominated developments
            like sea level rise, forcing a clear-cut decision on for instance the upgrade or replacement
            of a flood surge barrier.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determining tipping points proved challenging in other contexts. Attempts to operationalize
            the adaptation pathways developed for freshwater availability in terms of defining
            when the next generation of measures should be implemented have temporarily been put
            on hold, as it has become clear that the policy objectives in that field were not
            precise enough to determine an approximate timing of the tipping points under the
            different climatologic and socio-economic scenarios (Knikpunten in zicht, Deltares
            2017, in Dutch). The strategy chosen in the Delta Programme for the threats of flooding
            from the sea is “beach nourishment.” In this strategy, sand is supplied in the sea
            close to the coast, thus reducing wave erosion. This strategy is intrinsically flexible:
            every year, the volume of sand supplied can be enlarged or decreased depending on
            the rate of observed sea level rise. In that case, it is not possible—and not necessary—to
            determine tipping points.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The monitoring of the changes in the frequency of storms, droughts, and heat waves
            remains difficult, due to the lack of observations of extreme events, which are by
            definition rare. In the case of climate change-induced changes in peaks of river discharge,
            research combining monitoring data with model calculations shows that the natural
            variability in river discharge is so high that even when rapid (but not extreme) climate
            change is assumed, it can take 3 to 4 decades before the climate change signal can
            actually be distilled in a statistically sound way from monitoring data of river discharge
            (Diermanse et al. 
            <a>2010</a>; Klijn et al. 
            <a>2012</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a practical point of view, research is needed to find alternative approaches
            and/or parameters for distilling the climate change signals from river discharge measurements.
            This could be achieved through combining data-based detection of changes in observed
            events and exploration of possible future events through scenarios and modeling (Hall
            et al. 
            <a>2014</a>). Accordingly, Haasnoot et al. (
            <a>2015</a>) have identified a possible signaling role for decreasing summer river discharge
            as an indicator for changes in peak river discharge in the River Rhine. Dakos et al.
            (
            <a>2015</a>) point at the possibility of detecting early warning signals of a nearby tipping
            points by monitoring indicators of “critically slowing down.” Alternatively, large
            ensemble climate experiments (currently used for event attribution) may provide an
            alternate approach to better quantify the changing probability of extreme events (Kay
            et al. 
            <a>2011</a>; Pall et al. 
            <a>2011</a>). Such an approach could be used, for example, to probabilistically model the magnitude
            of the current 1 in 100-year heat wave event and compare this to the historic 1 in
            100-year heat wave event. This could be updated every 10 years and thus becomes a
            useful tool in monitoring changing climate risk over extended timescales. Nevertheless,
            for a comprehensive approach for distilling climate signals from highly variable river
            discharge measurements is not yet readily available for policymaking purposes.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unraveling the relations between parallel strategies implemented simultaneously</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The previously mentioned online survey that was performed to gain insight into the
            experience of applying adaptation pathways in practice (Rijke 
            <a>2014</a>) indicated that the most difficult to apply was the determination of tipping points
            (as described under point A) and unraveling the interdependence of measures in different
            fields and different parts of the catchment area.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In theory, adaptation pathways typically consist of several parallel trajectories
            and possibilities for switching from one trajectory to another when conditions indicate
            it might be wise to do so. In a given period, developments and measures follow one
            of these trajectories—depending on the context, actual conditions, and expectations
            about the future. The experience in the Dutch Delta Programme is that often, a 
            <span>combination</span> of trajectories is chosen in the regional strategies. Parallel trajectories, reflecting
            different approaches and associated trajectories of action, are followed simultaneously.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of flood safety, these parallel trajectories would, for example, be a
            multi-decade trajectory of regular dike reinforcement projects, a program consisting
            of a series of river bypass projects and a set of pilots for innovations in multi-level
            safety (i.e., prevention of flooding, protection during flooding, and preparedness
            for future flooding). In the domain of freshwater, one could see a parallel trajectory
            focusing on increasing the availability of freshwater being complemented by a trajectory
            focusing on the reduction of water use and another on improving water purification
            and a program for developing salt resistant crops (Delta Programme Commissioner 
            <a>2014</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are clear advantages to parallel systems (Jongejan et al. 
            <a>2012</a>). A strategy composed of several parallel trajectories contributes to the system’s
            resilience as it has more fallback options in case some of the trajectories do not
            perform the way they should. This is, for example, why the city of Dordrecht is interested
            in multi-layered safety: in case the primary defense system fails, the damage and
            casualties are reduced by adjusted spatial planning and up-to-date evacuation plans
            (Gersonius et al. 
            <a>2015</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As different trajectories often address completely different actors and chances of
            successful implementation are uncertain, the interrelatedness of their outcomes is
            often given little attention. Determining the effectiveness of individual adaptation
            measures is already a complex matter (Klostermann et al. 
            <a>2015</a>); the simultaneous implementation of parallel trajectories further complicates the
            matter.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The efficiency of the complete strategy can be improved by investigating in an ex-ante
            evaluation how the different trajectories of action can both mutually strengthen each
            other, but also weaken each other, and adjust the strategy by recombining or eliminating
            the trajectories.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Practical experience in the Netherlands and the UK has shown that in the process of
            composing a strategy consisting of multiple parallel trajectories, it is useful to
            analyze ex-ante if the trajectories perform well under comparable or under contrasting
            conditions. In other words, it is recommended to analyze if the strategy as a whole
            will cover a wide spectrum of possible futures evenly, or if there is a skewness in
            the strategy for specific future conditions that should be compensated for.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maximizing broad societal commitment in situations of low predictability</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation pathways make explicit what measures can be taken in the short term and
            sketch possible future measures. Decisions about these future measures can be taken
            in due time. The fact that final decisions about the actual implementation of these
            future measures are (as long as dramatic events do not happen) often not taken before
            physical conditions (climatic, socio-economic), justifying them are actually met—or
            can be predicted with relative certainty—implying that societal anticipation to these
            measures is hindered.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For instance, as long as the decision to increase freshwater availability is not taken,
            farmers arguably will hesitate to invest heavily in expansions of their business that
            increase the dependency on abundant availability of freshwater, because that availability
            will be harder to guarantee in most climate scenarios if large-scale interventions
            are not taken. So by postponing the final decision to execute the measure, “unwanted”
            anticipation is prevented. The described anticipation is “unwanted” because the expansion
            of the business would increase the dependency of abundant freshwater, where the original
            goal of the intervention was to promote resiliency of the agricultural sector by decreasing
            this dependency.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other side, taking the final decision not to execute the measure in the short
            term has the distinct advantage that more actors are challenged to prevent an increasing
            dependence of freshwater in other ways. For instance, companies can choose to invest
            in innovative purification methods or new salt-resistant crops.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depending on the nature of the measure, on the costs and benefits for different actors
            of anticipating the measure, and on the direction the anticipation works in relation
            to the direction that was meant by the measure itself, the postponing of the final
            decision can constitute a net advanta
            <span>g</span>e or a net disadvantage.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These trade-offs should be taken in consideration in planning the moment for making
            the final decision about the actual implementation of a measure.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sec" title="sec">
         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preparing the switch from incremental to transformational strategies</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While in theory, the pathways approach is “neutral” to the choice of the type and
            order of measures, practice shows that the selected pathway or the preferred strategy
            often contains incremental measures in the short-term, firmer measures in the mid-term
            and (options for) system-changing interventions or transformational measures in the
            long term. The rationale behind it seems obvious: the longer the time-horizon, the
            larger the climatic challenges, thus the heavier the interventions.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of course, the distinction between these categories is gradual and depends on the
            geographical and timescale that is considered. Using a geographical scale of several
            hundreds of kilometers and a timescale of several decades, concrete measures can be
            used to typify the three categories. Incremental measures are for instance series
            of local dike strengthening projects. Firm measures constitute a more robust approach,
            designed to meet upfront the more challenging of plausible futures. An example is
            the construction of regional bypasses in a river system to reduce the risk of flooding.
            Transformational measures drastically change the present system, preparing it to counter
            the most extreme situations. A typical example would be the construction of a new
            dam in an otherwise open estuary.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Incremental measures are “protective” in the sense that they can be considered as
            investments in a further gradual improvement of the resilience of the present system.
            Flipside is that this may increase the transfer costs to a new or significantly modified
            system. Increasing the resilience of the present system may also lead to an increase
            of sunk costs, further heightening the threshold for switching from an incremental
            strategy to a transformational strategy. Research on ancient societies has shown that
            sunk-cost effects can increase the vulnerability of a society (Scheffer et al. 
            <a>2003</a>; Janssen et al. 
            <a>2003</a>; Scheffer and Westley 
            <a>2007</a>). This is one of several psychological barriers that limit both climate change mitigation
            and adaptation (Gifford 
            <a>2011</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Continuing on the path of incremental measures may enlarge path dependency. Useful
            information on this effect might be generated by comparing alternative adaptation
            pathways using a cost-benefit analysis that covers the complete period of the adaptation
            pathways (several decades, a century) and takes into consideration the issues of sunk
            costs and transfer costs. Specific attention is needed for dealing with the fact that
            discounting may blur the picture at the long-term end of the trajectory.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is often stated that there are many plans for transformational measures, but that
            these measures are implemented only as a reaction to extreme events. Comparable to
            the TE 2100 Plan, the Delta Programme aims “to stay ahead of major floodings.” Due
            to climate change, transformational measures are inevitable in the long term. So at
            some point in time, the transition from incremental strategies to transformational
            strategies will have to be made. Though several authors have addressed the difficulty
            of making a 
            <span>planned</span> shift to transformational strategies (Folke et al. 
            <a>2010</a>; de Haan et al. 
            <a>2014</a>; Kates et al. 
            <a>2012</a>; Lonsdale et al. 
            <a>2015</a>; Rijke et al. 
            <a>2013</a>), it has not been tackled yet adequately.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From this analysis, it also follows that middle-term investments in the resilience
            of the present system should be re-evaluated in the light of a possible future transition
            to a significantly modified system. Options are to adopt shorter depreciation periods,
            or to consider alternative measures that are specifically designed for relatively
            short periods.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A challenge for the adaptation pathways approach is to visualize (increases in) the
            path dependency of a strategy and (in) the transfer costs related to switching from
            one strategy to another (within an adaptation pathway or between two different ones).
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These observations and suggestions implicitly assume that decision-making is a more
            or less rational, scientific data driven process. Real-life decision-making is often
            blurred by institutional and political considerations.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eriksen et al. (
            <a>2015</a>) argue that “adaptation is a social-political process that mediates how individuals
            and collectives deal with multiple and concurrent environmental and social changes”
            (p. 523). The adaptation pathways approach, like other approaches developed for rationalizing
            decision-making in the face of uncertainty, does not automatically address the political
            aspects of decision-making. They argue for “reframing adaptation to take account of
            how the exercise of power is always present within climate change responses. (…) Our
            concern is to (…) hold in view how any transformational adaptation pathway will inevitably
            be plagued by contradictory outcomes” (p. 524).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of their research, Van Buuren et al. (
            <a>2016</a>) conclude that “specific mechanisms of path dependency, for example, the existing
            power asymmetries between competing coalitions and the intricate complexity of flood
            policies, prevent institutional change, but cannot prevent ideas about resilience
            slowly gaining more impact.” (p. 41). This implies that conservative powers may block
            or slow down necessary transformations.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hermans et al. (
            <a>2017</a>) have studied the adaptation pathways constructed in the Dutch Delta Programme and
            conclude that “different types of signposts exist. Technical signposts, in particular,
            need to be distinguished from political ones, and require different learning processes
            with different types of actors.”(p. 29). This improves—and complicates—the analysis.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Van der Brugge and Roosjen (
            <a>2015</a>) point out that the different strategies making up an adaptation map or route map
            may require different institutional and sociocultural conditions. Climatological and
            social economic scenarios that favor a certain strategy may not automatically also
            favor the necessary conditions. They also signal challenges with regard to the governance
            needed to keep options open for future, an important aspect of the way adaptation
            pathways were developed in the Dutch Delta Programme. Especially in the case of transfer
            options that require larger, transitional changes, the institutional and social cultural
            conditions are important constraint factors (Grin et al. 
            <a>2010</a>). Van der Brugge and Roosjen (
            <a>2015</a>) also warn that the resistance to change in the existing social technical regimes
            should not be underestimated. The governance challenges have remained implicit in
            adaptation pathway approach—and are considerable.
