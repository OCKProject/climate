         approach
      </div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a brief literature review of recent experiences of applying adaptation pathways
         in practice, the following common findings, or “threads”, were distilled.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A 
         <span>first</span> common conclusion is that the adaptation pathways approach is 
         <span>effective in informing and mobilizing decision</span>-
         <span>makers</span>. Applied in Lakes Entrance, a small community in Eastern Victoria, Australia, local
         adaptation pathways “create a socially acceptable framework that guides adaptation
         into the future. Using this approach creates a palatable narrative about adaptation
         that is time-sensitive, community-sensitive, and owned by local people.” (Barnett
         et al. 
         <a>2014</a>, p. 1107). Rosenzweig and Solecki (
         <a>2014</a>) analyzed the experience in New York with integrating a flexible adaptation pathways
         approach into the municipality’s climate action strategy and concluded that the concept
         is useful across cities, since it is size and development-stage neutral. On the basis
         of experiences in a more rural setting, in Hutt River, located in New Zealand’s lower
         North Island, Lawrence et al. (
         <a>2013</a>, p. 133) conclude that “tools to rapidly explore alternative futures can therefore
         support evaluation of a wider range of response options at exploratory stages of decision-making,
         which helps avoid planning responses that are predicated on historical experience
         and a single ‘best estimate’ scenario. This encourages responses to better reflect
         the changing nature of the risk.” On the basis of case studies in Central Australia,
         the Brazilian Amazon and the Kalahari in Botswana, Maru and Smith (
         <a>2014</a>, p. 323) show “how appropriate vulnerability-reducing and resilience-building responses
         can be combined for (potentially) better outcomes using adaptation pathways.”
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A 
         <span>second</span> “common thread” through the papers is the 
         <span>strong call for incorporatinglocal information</span> in the design of the adaptation pathways, stressing the importance of commitment
         at the local and regional level. The authors of the EPICCA 2014 study (Siebentritt
         et al. 
         <a>2014</a>, p. 3) state that “the regional stakeholders need to be directly involved in the
         development of a plan if it is to be implemented in a community.” A process of active
         regional and local engagement is considered crucial. Barnett et al. (
         <a>2014</a>, p. 1103) conclude “Developing local adaptation pathways that build on triggers of
         change that have social impacts are salient to local people, which helps build consensus
         among different constituencies.” Rosenzweig and Solecki (Rosenzweig and Solecki 
         <a>2014</a>, p. 406) similarly advice to include “co-generation of climate science by scientists
         and stakeholders”, because they found it to be “an essential element in the development
         of the flexible adaptation approach in NYC.” This point is also stressed by Smit and
         Wandel (
         <a>2006</a>). Engagement of local stakeholders is considered crucial. It contributes to the quality
         of the plans by incorporating local knowledge and to commitment for the implementation
         of the plans. It also constitutes the indispensable base for starting a long-term
         process that will need future adjustments as local conditions continue to evolve (NSOB
         
         <a>2011</a>). Lin et al. (
         <a>2017</a>) performed an ex-post analysis of eight Australian coastal zone projects on climate
         adaptation. The results of a project participation survey show that the adaptation
         pathways were “generally framed narrowly and conservatively to emphasize extant economic,
         administrative, and legal considerations over community, participatory, or exploratory
         ones.” It is concluded that adaptive learning requires a co-learning process with
         stakeholders: it is crucial to organize stakeholder participation in pathways development.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span>Thirdly</span>, it is concluded that 
         <span>coordination at a higher level</span> is needed to increase consistency. Among the lessons learned in New York (Rosenzweig
         and Solecki 
         <a>2014</a>, p. 406) is “that the flexible adaptation strategies need to be locally appropriate
         yet regionally coordinated.” In the case of New York, this regional coordination was
         missing, resulting in a “Balkanization force” that led to large local differences
         in approaches for rebuilding and resilience (“a patchwork rather than regional fabric
         for resiliency”).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This point is also made by Kuklicke and Demeritt (
         <a>2016</a>). In their research, they compare two ways to incorporate climate change in flood
         safety measures: a “one size fits all” approach used for the river system, prescribing
         that a 20% increase in peak flood flows should be taken into account, with a more
         adaptive approach for sea level rise that allows for iterative updates in guidance
         with the very latest scientific advances. Where the first approach was being regarded
         by experts as, at best, a makeshift estimate, it proved quite effective in adjusting
         operational-level plans for fluvial flooding. The scientifically more sophisticated
         approach used for protection against sea level rise amplified institutional anxieties
         about whether and how to adapt flood and coastal erosion risk management schemes to
         climate change and thus worked less well.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A 
         <span>fourth</span> element that is distilled is the call for 
         <span>periodic updates</span> of the adaptation pathways. Drafting the regional climate change adaptation plan
         for the Eyre Peninsula, eight sectoral pathways have been developed. Drawing on these
         pathways, a cross-regional emerging pathway map has been developed. In the spirit
         of adaptive management, a final action in the plan is to reconsider it periodically,
         for instance, every 2 to 3 years. (Siebentritt et al. 
         <a>2014</a>). The concept of flexible adaptation pathways as an approach to responding to climate
         change was laid out by the New York City Panel on Climate Change in 2010. The NPCC
         emphasized the flexible adaptation pathways are not fixed; adaptations are defined
         in terms of acceptable risk levels and are re-evaluated over time, rather than using
         an approach that sets inflexible standards for adaptation early in the process (Rosenzweig
         and Solecki 
         <a>2014</a>)
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A 
         <span>fifth</span> common point is that the authors agree on the need to 
         <span>switch</span>, at some time in the future, 
         <span>from incremental to transformational strategies</span>—but that there is little reflection on how this switch can be made. As analyzed by
         Lonsdale et al. (
         <a>2015</a>), there is a multitude of options for distinguishing transformational from incremental
         strategies. For the purpose of this practice-oriented analysis, we have used the following
         rather straightforward descriptions. Where incremental strategies consist of series
         of small measures, enough to keep pace with more or less predictable changes in external
         conditions, transformational strategies are composed of more drastic interventions,
         altering the system in a more fundamental way, anticipating possible more abrupt and
         larger changes in external conditions.

            <p>“In the short term, many sectors are likely to continue with current best practices
               that will help to prepare for climate change through incremental change. Within two
               or three decades, more of the regions adaptation actions will need to focus on protecting
               assets and starting to transform some sectors. In the long term, adaptation may require
               retreat and further transformation within sectors. Notably, planning work for many
               of these medium and long-term action needs to commence now.” (Siebentritt et al. 
               <a>2014</a>, p. 50)
               
            </p>
         </div>In this study, adaptation measures are necessarily incremental in the beginning and
         necessarily transformational in the longer term—but what needs to be done to prepare
         for this shift is not described.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The research of Barnett et al. (
         <a>2014</a>, p. 1103) shows that “adaptation pathways are feasible at the local scale, offering
         a low-risk, low-cost way to begin the long process of adaptation to sea level rise.”
         The authors seem to focus the application of adaptation pathways on a gradual, smooth
         start of the adaptation process.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rosenzweig and Solecki (
         <a>2014</a>, p. 406) conclude “Prior to hurricane Sandy, incremental adaptation strategies were
         envisioned so as to avoid disruptions of current systems. (…) After Sandy it has become
         clear that (…) transformation at full regional scale is required.” Sustaining that
         transformative trajectory is considered a challenge. “A broad knowledgebase should
         enable the incorporation of transformative action into flexible adaptation pathways
         and risk management paradigms throughout the entire region.” So they see possibilities
         for adaptation pathways to pave the way for transformative interventions.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The same goes for Wise et al. (
         <a>2014</a>, p. 325) who observe that, although the need to adapt to climate change is now widely
         recognized, efforts to actually adapt “have not led to substantial rates of implementation
         of adaptation actions despite substantial investments in adaptation science. Moreover,
         implemented actions have been mostly incremental and focused on proximate causes;
         there are far fewer reports of more systematic or transformative actions.”
