      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The previously mentioned online survey that was performed to gain insight into the
         experience of applying adaptation pathways in practice (Rijke 
         <a>2014</a>) indicated that the most difficult to apply was the determination of tipping points
         (as described under point A) and unraveling the interdependence of measures in different
         fields and different parts of the catchment area.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In theory, adaptation pathways typically consist of several parallel trajectories
         and possibilities for switching from one trajectory to another when conditions indicate
         it might be wise to do so. In a given period, developments and measures follow one
         of these trajectories—depending on the context, actual conditions, and expectations
         about the future. The experience in the Dutch Delta Programme is that often, a 
         <span>combination</span> of trajectories is chosen in the regional strategies. Parallel trajectories, reflecting
         different approaches and associated trajectories of action, are followed simultaneously.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of flood safety, these parallel trajectories would, for example, be a
         multi-decade trajectory of regular dike reinforcement projects, a program consisting
         of a series of river bypass projects and a set of pilots for innovations in multi-level
         safety (i.e., prevention of flooding, protection during flooding, and preparedness
         for future flooding). In the domain of freshwater, one could see a parallel trajectory
         focusing on increasing the availability of freshwater being complemented by a trajectory
         focusing on the reduction of water use and another on improving water purification
         and a program for developing salt resistant crops (Delta Programme Commissioner 
         <a>2014</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are clear advantages to parallel systems (Jongejan et al. 
         <a>2012</a>). A strategy composed of several parallel trajectories contributes to the system’s
         resilience as it has more fallback options in case some of the trajectories do not
         perform the way they should. This is, for example, why the city of Dordrecht is interested
         in multi-layered safety: in case the primary defense system fails, the damage and
         casualties are reduced by adjusted spatial planning and up-to-date evacuation plans
         (Gersonius et al. 
         <a>2015</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As different trajectories often address completely different actors and chances of
         successful implementation are uncertain, the interrelatedness of their outcomes is
         often given little attention. Determining the effectiveness of individual adaptation
         measures is already a complex matter (Klostermann et al. 
         <a>2015</a>); the simultaneous implementation of parallel trajectories further complicates the
         matter.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The efficiency of the complete strategy can be improved by investigating in an ex-ante
         evaluation how the different trajectories of action can both mutually strengthen each
         other, but also weaken each other, and adjust the strategy by recombining or eliminating
         the trajectories.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Practical experience in the Netherlands and the UK has shown that in the process of
         composing a strategy consisting of multiple parallel trajectories, it is useful to
         analyze ex-ante if the trajectories perform well under comparable or under contrasting
         conditions. In other words, it is recommended to analyze if the strategy as a whole
         will cover a wide spectrum of possible futures evenly, or if there is a skewness in
         the strategy for specific future conditions that should be compensated for.
