 <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation pathways make explicit what measures can be taken in the short term and sketch possible future measures. Decisions about these future measures can be taken in due time. The fact that final decisions about the actual implementation of these future measures are (as long as dramatic events do not happen) often not taken before physical conditions (climatic, socio-economic), justifying them are actually met—or can be predicted with relative certainty—implying that societal anticipation to these measures is hindered.</p>
 <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For instance, as long as the decision to increase freshwater availability is not taken, farmers arguably will hesitate to invest heavily in expansions of their business that increase the dependency on abundant availability of freshwater, because that availability will be harder to guarantee in most climate scenarios if large-scale interventions are not taken. So by postponing the final decision to execute the measure, “unwanted” anticipation is prevented. The described anticipation is “unwanted” because the expansion of the business would increase the dependency of abundant freshwater, where the original goal of the intervention was to promote resiliency of the agricultural sector by decreasing this dependency.</p>
 <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other side, taking the final decision not to execute the measure in the short term has the distinct advantage that more actors are challenged to prevent an increasing dependence of freshwater in other ways. For instance, companies can choose to invest in innovative purification methods or new salt-resistant crops.</p>
 <p id="Par67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depending on the nature of the measure, on the costs and benefits for different actors of anticipating the measure, and on the direction the anticipation works in relation to the direction that was meant by the measure itself, the postponing of the final decision can constitute a net advanta
  <span class="underline">g</span>e or a net disadvantage.
 </p>
 <p id="Par68" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These trade-offs should be taken in consideration in planning the moment for making the final decision about the actual implementation of a measure.</p>
