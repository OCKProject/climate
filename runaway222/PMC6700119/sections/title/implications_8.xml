 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study indicates that focusing solely on the abiotic effects, and ignoring biotic influences, can be very misleading in understanding ecosystem functioning. This includes misrepresenting system productivity by as much as 33%, and misidentifying the most productive system. Furthermore, the biotic influences operate on a local spatial scale (few kilometers). Consequently, we suggest that characterizing ecosystem functioning based solely on large spatial scale abiotic conditions (e.g., precipitation and temperature), as commonly conducted, especially in making climate change projections, may be misleading. Furthermore, environmental changes often change species abundances, including lost and added species, so that novel biotic effects may arise
