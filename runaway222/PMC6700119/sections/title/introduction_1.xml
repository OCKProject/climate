 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Abiotic factors (e.g., precipitation and temperature) have traditionally been viewed as the main drivers of ecosystem primary production
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>, and this has been the principal basis for forecasting climate change effects on ecosystem functioning
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. However, this forecasting may be misleading if biotic effects are ignored. For example, there is mounting evidence supporting an early claim
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span> that herbivory strongly affects ecosystem primary production by modifying nutrient cycling
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. This biotic influence can create two types of positive feedbacks: (1) herbivory may enhance nutrient cycling and thereby increase primary production, or (2) herbivory may diminish nutrient cycling and thereby decrease primary production. If these biotic positive feedbacks strongly impact nutrient cycling and primary production, they will reduce the impact of abiotic processes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> that are traditionally considered all important
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Therefore, how important this biotic effect is relative to abiotic effects is crucial for forecasting climate change impacts on ecosystem functioning and needs to be addressed. A productive way to distinguish between the roles played by abiotic and biotic influences is a “common garden” experiment. Starting with a plant/herbivore system that exhibits the alternative positive feedback effects between two sites, the system’s components (soil, plants and herbivores) can be translocated between the sites and the ecosystem functioning (N and ANPP) can be compared with the site of origin.

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An appropriate plant/herbivore system for this “common garden” experiment is provided by a grassland (National Bison Range, Montana, USA). Here two sites differing by &lt;30 m in elevation and within &lt;7.5 km of each other have the same plant species (
  <span class="italic">Pascopyrum smithii</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Poa pratensis</span>) and the same most common grasshopper (
  <span class="italic">Melanoplus sanuinipes</span>: Orthopteran, Acrididae), but each exhibits one of the alternative positive feedback effects on N-cycling and ANPP
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Previous experiments indicated that if the grasshopper prefers to feed on the slower decomposing plant (
  <span class="italic">Pascopyrum smithii</span>), then N-cycling and ANPP increase (Site A: UTM 713570 E 5248100N), while preferential feeding on the faster decomposing plant (
  <span class="italic">Poa pratensis</span>) leads to N-cycling and ANPP decreasing (Site B: UTM 706453 E 5249980N)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Soils and grasses from the two sites can be translocated between the two sites creating different independent combinations (experimental ecosystems) to which the grasshopper can be added to assess the effects of microclimate, soil, and plant differences on the previously observed positive feedback effects of herbivory on N-cycling and ANPP.
