     </span>. The radiometer was positioned to measure a 0.05 m
     <span class="sup">2</span> area. Live plant biomass was computed from radiometer readings using site and date specific regressions. Each regression was based on readings from 3–5 0.1 m
     <span class="sup">2</span> plots adjacent to the grid of pots, which were selected to range from low to high plant abundances, and from the plant biomasses of these 3–5 0.1 m
     <span class="sup">2</span> plots. Green vegetation in each of these plots was clipped, dried for 48 hours at 60 °C, and weighed. Regressions averaged an r of 0.93 (±0.03 SE; range: 0.74–0.99). ANPP is the sum of all increases in green plant biomass between consecutive periods from June–Oct; however, we only report the highest values for June as they always decreased afterwards.
