  <span class="sup">2</span> analyses were conducted using ©SYSTAT 13. Data employed in GLMs and ANCOVAs were normally distributed. Data from each individual pot with and without grasshoppers were employed in GLMs and ANCOVAs for ANPP, N and soil moisture (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.1–6</a>). Insufficient litter for each pot was measured in each year to perform statistics using each pot; therefore, litter values with grasshoppers were averaged over all years (N = 4 treatments X 2 sites X 5 years = 40) for the litter production GLM (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.7</a>) and regressions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a,b</a>). Effect sizes (current ÷ prior measures) were natural log transformed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a,b</a>). For GLMs and ANCOVAs, all main effects and statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) interaction terms were presented (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Fast vs. slow plant relative abundance was examined with χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> analysis employing the sum of all point samples with grasshoppers over the five years in the treatments being compared. Finally, the ANPP responses for Site A and B plants to grasshopper density were analyzed by regression for the mean of all pots (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>).
