 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With herbivory (grasshoppers), the relative productivity of the two sites reversed; so the less productive site in the absence of herbivory had a 6% increase in ANPP but was now 15% more productive than the more productive site in the absence of herbivory, which had a 33% decline in ANPP. This occurred even though the more productive site in the absence of herbivory experienced 55% less herbivory (lower grasshopper density).</p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reversal was due to changes in litter decomposition due to herbivory. Litter decomposition rate is biotically affected by the plant species comprising the litter. 
  <span class="italic">P. pratensis</span> litter decomposes faster than 
  <span class="italic">P. smithii</span>

  </span> litter, so percent of litter remaining will decrease and N will increase as relative abundance of 
  <span class="italic">P. pratensis</span> litter increases. Grasshopper selective feeding enhanced N at the originally less productive site (A) by increasing the relative abundance of faster decomposing plants (
  <span class="italic">P. pratensis</span>), and diminished N at the originally more productive site (B) by increasing the relative abundance of slower decomposing plants (
  <span class="italic">P. smithii</span>). Preferential feeding arises because grasshoppers prefer green vegetation that is lower in water content, so 
  <span class="italic">P. pratensis</span> at Site B is preferred, while 
  <span class="italic">P. smithii</span> is preferred at Site A

  </span>.

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With herbivory, we also observed that the plant species from the different sites were locally adapted to herbivory, even though they are the same species, with the plants from the site (A) where the herbivore was consistently more abundant being able to cope better with herbivory. A number of field experiments have reported on the importance of local adaptation of plants to herbivory, e.g.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>, and at least one study has hypothesized that this might affect nutrient dynamics

  </span>.

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, grasshoppers affect ANPP through plant source, plant species composition and level of herbivory. Counter to tradition that ANPP is driven by abiotic effects, biotic effects emerge stronger, increasing ANPP at one site and decreasing it at another beyond abiotic limits. This is driven by herbivory creating positive feedbacks that affect productivity, as reported elsewhere, e.g.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. While this did not negate abiotic influences, it surpassed their effect, as hypothesized earlier
