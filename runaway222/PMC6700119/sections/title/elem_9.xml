  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The “common garden” experimental ecosystems were created in June 2004. Forty large plastic pots (0.053 m
   <span class="sup">2</span>: diameter = 26 cm, depth = 30 cm) with the bottom cut out were buried (28 cm) in the ground. Holes closely fit a pot and the soil that was removed to make the hole was saved, maintaining its profile and the surface was labelled. Pots were installed 2 m apart in a 4 × 10 grid.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Treatments</div>
  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pots were randomly assigned to 4 treatments (Site A plants – Site A soil; Site B plants – Site B soil; Site A plants - Site B soil; Site B plants - Site A soil) with 10 replicates for each. Each pot’s soil treatment was provided by soil saved from a hole cut for a pot at the appropriate site. Each pot’s plant treatment was provided by transplanting plants from the appropriate site. Based on abundance and plant size at the sites in June 2004, five 20 cm (±10%) tall individuals of each of two grass species (
   <span class="italic">Poa pratensis</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Pascopyrum smithii</span>) were planted in a pot. Plants were carefully dug up to maintain root mass (~20 cm around plant) and soil was gently washed away. To help establish plants, 0.25 L of water/pot was provided weekly from June–Sept 2004 and any other plants were removed. To exclude grasshoppers, pots were covered by a nylon insect screen bag (0.5 m tall), which was supported by wire and attached to the pot with plastic clips.
  </p>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pots had grasshoppers excluded during 2004–2005 (late June–September). Starting in late June 2006, grasshoppers (
   <span class="italic">Melanoplus sanguinipes</span>) at that year’s field density were allowed to feed in half of the pots in each treatment. This was accomplished by placing the appropriate number of grasshoppers in a pot for 1–2 days every 2 weeks, where the number of grasshoppers and length of time the grasshoppers were allowed to feed in a pot was based upon their mean field density over the preceding 2 weeks (See Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a> in Supplementary Information). The field density was determined from two (11 AM and 2 PM) weekly counts of grasshoppers in twenty-four 0.1 m

Grasshoppers were excluded from each control in years 2004–2005, using a 0.5 m high box of aluminum insect screen supported by wooden stakes and attached to garden edging by folding

      </span>. The radiometer was positioned to measure a 0.05 m

      <span class="sup">2</span> plots adjacent to the grid of pots, which were selected to range from low to high plant abundances, and from the plant biomasses of these 3–5 0.1 m
      <span class="sup">2</span> plots. Green vegetation in each of these plots was clipped, dried for 48 hours at 60 °C, and weighed. Regressions averaged an r of 0.93 (±0.03 SE; range: 0.74–0.99). ANPP is the sum of all increases in green plant biomass between consecutive periods from June–Oct; however, we only report the highest values for June as they always decreased afterwards.

   <span class="sup">2</span> analyses were conducted using ©SYSTAT 13. Data employed in GLMs and ANCOVAs were normally distributed. Data from each individual pot with and without grasshoppers were employed in GLMs and ANCOVAs for ANPP, N and soil moisture (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.1–6</a>). Insufficient litter for each pot was measured in each year to perform statistics using each pot; therefore, litter values with grasshoppers were averaged over all years (N = 4 treatments X 2 sites X 5 years = 40) for the litter production GLM (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.7</a>) and regressions (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a,b</a>). Effect sizes (current ÷ prior measures) were natural log transformed (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a,b</a>). For GLMs and ANCOVAs, all main effects and statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) interaction terms were presented (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Fast vs. slow plant relative abundance was examined with χ
   <span class="sup">2</span> analysis employing the sum of all point samples with grasshoppers over the five years in the treatments being compared. Finally, the ANPP responses for Site A and B plants to grasshopper density were analyzed by regression for the mean of all pots (Fig.
