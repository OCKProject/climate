  </span>, N cycling and ANPP were driven solely by abiotic conditions (site, year and soil) and the only available biotic factor, plant source, had no effect. One site (B) was 26% more productive due to having greater nitrogen availability, while inter-annual variability in productivity and soil effects were driven by moisture. N may limit ANPP more than moisture, as the more productive site (B) had greater N, but less moisture, than the other site (A). This is consistent with experimental supplementation of N at both sites, that found N to limit ANPP

  </span>. In summary, without herbivory (no grasshoppers), the traditional view that ANPP primarily is driven abiotically by microclimate (site), annual weather (year), and soil is supported.
