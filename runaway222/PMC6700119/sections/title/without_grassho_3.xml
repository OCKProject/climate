 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ANPP was measured in June 2005 and 2006 (before adding grasshoppers). Several patterns emerged for ANPP when pots containing that site’s soil and plants, pots containing the other site’s soil and plants, and controls were compared (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>):
  <div list-type="order" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par5">Pots reflect field ANPP, as control areas at each site did not differ from pots with the site’s soil and plants (Tukey post hoc: P &lt; 0.99 and 0.61 for A and B respectively).</p>

   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par6">Sites (B &gt; A) and years (2006 &gt; 2005) differed in ANPP (Table 
     <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.1</a>: given sample size, only 2-way interactions could be examined and none were significant), with a weaker soil source effect (B &gt; A: A = heavy clay, B = diatomaceous clay/sand).

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Abiotic effects are expected given site, year and soil responses (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.1</a>). Two common abiotic effects on ANPP are soil moisture and growing season N. Soil moisture results (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.2</a>) are Site A &gt; B (Site A has more precipitation, being closer to mountains); 2006 &gt; 2005 (prior precipitation was 32.7 cm in 2005 vs. 39.2 cm in 2006); B’s soil &gt; A’s (diatomaceous clay/sand retains water better than heavy clay). If greater soil moisture increases ANPP, then site moisture is opposite ANPP observations, but year and soil type are consistent with ANPP observations. Growing season N results (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.3</a>) are Site B &gt; A; 2005 &gt; 2006; A’s soil &gt; B’s. If greater N increases ANPP, then site N is consistent with ANPP observations, but year and soil type are opposite ANPP observations. However, separating moisture and N effects is difficult as moisture and N are negatively correlated (r = 0.34, n = 100, P &lt; 0.0004). Regardless, strong abiotic effects on ANPP are evident.

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biotic effects in the absence of grasshoppers can only emerge with plant source, but no main or interaction (Tables
