  <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ANPP was measured in June 2005 and 2006 (before adding grasshoppers). Several patterns emerged for ANPP when pots containing that site’s soil and plants, pots containing the other site’s soil and plants, and controls were compared (Fig.

  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Abiotic effects are expected given site, year and soil responses (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.1</a>). Two common abiotic effects on ANPP are soil moisture and growing season N. Soil moisture results (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.2</a>) are Site A &gt; B (Site A has more precipitation, being closer to mountains); 2006 &gt; 2005 (prior precipitation was 32.7 cm in 2005 vs. 39.2 cm in 2006); B’s soil &gt; A’s (diatomaceous clay/sand retains water better than heavy clay). If greater soil moisture increases ANPP, then site moisture is opposite ANPP observations, but year and soil type are consistent with ANPP observations. Growing season N results (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.3</a>) are Site B &gt; A; 2005 &gt; 2006; A’s soil &gt; B’s. If greater N increases ANPP, then site N is consistent with ANPP observations, but year and soil type are opposite ANPP observations. However, separating moisture and N effects is difficult as moisture and N are negatively correlated (r = 0.34, n = 100, P &lt; 0.0004). Regardless, strong abiotic effects on ANPP are evident.

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biotic effects in the absence of grasshoppers can only emerge with plant source, but no main or interaction (Tables

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ANPP was measured in June for 2007–2013. This reflects growth after prior, not current, year’s grasshopper consumption, as &gt;90% of grasshoppers in the current year hatch after ANPP is attained. ANPP responses to prior year’s grasshopper feeding intensity (% grass blades fed on) were examined in pots with the plant source from that site and controls (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>):
   <div list-type="order" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p id="Par10">As without grasshoppers, ANPP with 0% feeding intensity (intercept) was greater for Site B than Site A plants (147.6 vs. 96.4 g/m

   </div>
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore, ANPP between sites was reversed with herbivory (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> vs. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">b</a>), challenging the traditional view that abiotic factors solely set ANPP.
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Abiotic effects on ANPP, when grasshoppers were absent, appeared for soil moisture and growing season N (Tables 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>.2 and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.3</a>). Soil moisture effects with grasshoppers were unchanged (Site A &gt; B; Soil A &lt; B; annual differences; no plant source effect: Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.5</a>). Annual differences in N with grasshoppers still appear, but differences due to site or soil disappear, and now a significant effect of plant source appears. Therefore, two biotic effects, plant source and grasshoppers, affect N which is the limiting nutrient for plant growth.
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biotic effects on ANPP emerge with plant source and past amount of grasshopper feeding (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.4</a>). As in our earlier studies
   <span class="sup">

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
   </span>, ANPP with grasshoppers rises slightly for Site A’s plants at Site A (3%), but falls dramatically for Site B’s plants at Site B (41%), a 44% net change (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.4</a>). Soil moisture cannot account for this as it did not change with vs. without grasshoppers; however, N did change, and as in our prior observational studies
   <span class="sup">

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
   </span>, inter-annual changes in ANPP and N are positively correlated (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). Without grasshoppers, Site B’s N was 37% greater than A’s, but with grasshoppers, it was 16% less, a 53% net change (Tables 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>.3 and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.6</a>). With grasshoppers, plant source accounts for a portion of this change in N, as Site A plants increase N by 5% and Site B plants decrease N by 14%, a 19% net change. Grasshopper excrement and carcasses, even though highly facile, provide minimal N
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>

   </div>
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One way that N availability can be biotically affected is through plant litter decomposition rate, as inter-annual change in N decreases as percent of litter remaining (litter in Sept/prior year ANPP) increases (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). With grasshoppers, percent of litter remaining was lower at Site A, especially for Site A plants at Site A (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.7</a>). This accounts for a 26% net change in N between Site A and B, as plant N content does not differ between sites
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
   </span>. Therefore, added to a 19% net change in N due to plant source, a total net change of 45% arises which compares to the observed 42%.
  </p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Without grasshoppers, the initial equal relative abundance of the two plants did not change (
   <span class="italic">P. pratensis</span> at Site A = 42.5%: χ
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 2.40, P &lt; 0.14; at Site B = 48.9%: χ

   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.53, P &lt; 0.47). With grasshoppers, the faster decomposing 
   <span class="italic">P. pratensis</span> increased in relative abundance at both sites, but much more for plants from Site A (77%: χ
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 114.6, P &lt; 0.000001). While the faster decomposing plant relative abundance did not differ between sites for plants from Site B (P &lt; 0.99), it was 27% greater for Site A plants at A than B. Therefore, species composition of the litter changes with grasshoppers, which accounts for decomposition rate and N differences, as previously suggested
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Litter plant species composition changes between the two sites due to grasshopper selective feeding, as grasshoppers feed on average 28% more on the slower decomposing plant at Site A than at B, and this preference is 55% greater for Site A plants. Therefore, grasshoppers increase faster decomposing plant relative abundance at Site A, especially for Site A plants, and thereby increase N availability and ANPP at Site A over B, as observed.</p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A final biotic effect emerges with grasshoppers, as Site A plants do better at Site A than at Site B, and vice versa. This might be expected with local adaptation to the abiotic conditions of greater moisture and lower N at Site A than at Site B. While a response to abiotic conditions should be observed with or without grasshoppers (Tables 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.1</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2.4</a>), it was only observed with grasshoppers. This may reflect local adaptation to different levels of grasshopper herbivory. From 1995–2013, grasshopper densities at Site A were greater than at Site B (13.4/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> vs. 6.1/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>, P &lt; 0.01), so herbivory may be a stronger selection pressure at Site A. Local adaptation to herbivory can be examined by plotting relative ANPP (with ÷ without grasshoppers) vs. grasshopper density. The plot increases and then decreases as grasshopper density increases for both Site A and B plants (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). However, Site B plant relative ANPP is always &lt;1 (i.e., ANPP with grasshoppers always is less than without grasshoppers) and declines at low grasshopper densities, while Site A plant relative ANPP can be &gt;1 (ANPP with grasshoppers can be greater than without grasshoppers) and declines at high grasshopper densities.
