Traditionally, ecosystem production is considered to be abiotically controlled at large spatial scales (e.g., precipitation, temperature, etc.), which underlies forecasting climate change impacts. Using a &#x0201c;common garden&#x0201d; experiment over 10 years at two sites with the same plant and grasshopper species, we show that primary production is strongly influenced by biotic factors (herbivory and plant adaptations to it) at finer spatial scales by creating positive feedbacks, which reverse relative productivity of ecosystems expected from abiotic conditions alone. Our results without herbivory indicate that one site has 26% less annual net primary production (ANPP) than the other site. With herbivory, the sites reverse in ANPP, so the site with lower ANPP without herbivory now is 15% greater than the site with higher ANPP without herbivory, as they respectively increase by 6% and decline by 33%. This reversal is due to changing nitrogen availability (N), as N becomes 16% greater at the higher ANPP site with herbivory, respectively a 3% increase and 41% decline in N. The ANPP and N changes are observed, even though the sites are a few kilometers apart and have the same grasshopper and plant species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Community ecology</kwd><kwd>Ecosystem ecology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000155</institution-id><institution>NSF | BIO | Division of Environmental Biology (DEB)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-0415390</award-id><award-id>DEB-0918306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Belovsky</surname><given-names>Gary E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Notre Dame, no grant reference number</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Abiotic factors (e.g., precipitation and temperature) have traditionally been viewed as the main drivers of ecosystem primary production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, and this has been the principal basis for forecasting climate change effects on ecosystem functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, this forecasting may be misleading if biotic effects are ignored. For example, there is mounting evidence supporting an early claim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> that herbivory strongly affects ecosystem primary production by modifying nutrient cycling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This biotic influence can create two types of positive feedbacks: (1) herbivory may enhance nutrient cycling and thereby increase primary production, or (2) herbivory may diminish nutrient cycling and thereby decrease primary production. If these biotic positive feedbacks strongly impact nutrient cycling and primary production, they will reduce the impact of abiotic processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> that are traditionally considered all important<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, how important this biotic effect is relative to abiotic effects is crucial for forecasting climate change impacts on ecosystem functioning and needs to be addressed. A productive way to distinguish between the roles played by abiotic and biotic influences is a &#x0201c;common garden&#x0201d; experiment. Starting with a plant/herbivore system that exhibits the alternative positive feedback effects between two sites, the system&#x02019;s components (soil, plants and herbivores) can be translocated between the sites and the ecosystem functioning (N and ANPP) can be compared with the site of origin.</p><p id="Par3">An appropriate plant/herbivore system for this &#x0201c;common garden&#x0201d; experiment is provided by a grassland (National Bison Range, Montana, USA). Here two sites differing by &#x0003c;30&#x02009;m in elevation and within &#x0003c;7.5&#x02009;km of each other have the same plant species (<italic>Pascopyrum smithii</italic> and <italic>Poa pratensis</italic>) and the same most common grasshopper (<italic>Melanoplus sanuinipes</italic>: Orthopteran, Acrididae), but each exhibits one of the alternative positive feedback effects on N-cycling and ANPP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Previous experiments indicated that if the grasshopper prefers to feed on the slower decomposing plant (<italic>Pascopyrum smithii</italic>), then N-cycling and ANPP increase (Site A: UTM 713570 E 5248100N), while preferential feeding on the faster decomposing plant (<italic>Poa pratensis</italic>) leads to N-cycling and ANPP decreasing (Site B: UTM 706453 E 5249980N)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Soils and grasses from the two sites can be translocated between the two sites creating different independent combinations (experimental ecosystems) to which the grasshopper can be added to assess the effects of microclimate, soil, and plant differences on the previously observed positive feedback effects of herbivory on N-cycling and ANPP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Without grasshoppers</title><p id="Par4">ANPP was measured in June 2005 and 2006 (before adding grasshoppers).

Annual differences in N with grasshoppers still appear, but differences due to site or soil disappear, and now a significant effect of plant source appears. Therefore, two biotic effects, plant source and grasshoppers, affect N which is the limiting nutrient for plant growth.</p><p id="Par15">Biotic effects on ANPP emerge with plant source and past amount of grasshopper feeding (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2.4</xref>). As in our earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, ANPP with grasshoppers rises slightly for Site A&#x02019;s plants at Site A (3%), but falls dramatically for Site B&#x02019;s plants at Site B (41%), a 44% net change (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2.4</xref>). Soil moisture cannot account for this as it did not change with vs. without grasshoppers; however, N did change, and as in our prior observational studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, inter-annual changes in ANPP and N are positively correlated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

With grasshoppers, plant source accounts for a portion of this change in N, as Site A plants increase N by 5% and Site B plants decrease N by 14%, a 19% net change. Grasshopper excrement and carcasses, even though highly facile, provide minimal N<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, so that grasshoppers must affect N in additional ways.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The inter-annual change in ANPP (ANPP effect&#x02009;=&#x02009;current year ANPP/prior year ANPP) and the inter-annual change in growing season N (N effect&#x02009;=&#x02009;current year N/prior year N) in experimental pots, and regression statistics.

With grasshoppers, percent of litter remaining was lower at Site A, especially for Site A plants at Site A (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2.7</xref>). This accounts for a 26% net change in N between Site A and B, as plant N content does not differ between sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, added to a 19% net change in N due to plant source, a total net change of 45% arises which compares to the observed 42%.</p><p id="Par17">Without grasshoppers, the initial equal relative abundance of the two plants did not change (<italic>P. pratensis</italic> at Site A&#x02009;=&#x02009;42.5%: &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.40, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.14; at Site B&#x02009;=&#x02009;48.9%: &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.88), and the sites did not differ (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.53, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.47).

While the faster decomposing plant relative abundance did not differ between sites for plants from Site B (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.99), it was 27% greater for Site A plants at A than B. Therefore, species composition of the litter changes with grasshoppers, which accounts for decomposition rate and N differences, as previously suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Litter plant species composition changes between the two sites due to grasshopper selective feeding, as grasshoppers feed on average 28% more on the slower decomposing plant at Site A than at B, and this preference is 55% greater for Site A plants. Therefore, grasshoppers increase faster decomposing plant relative abundance at Site A, especially for Site A plants, and thereby increase N availability and ANPP at Site A over B, as observed.</p><p id="Par19">A final biotic effect emerges with grasshoppers, as Site A plants do better at Site A than at Site B, and vice versa. This might be expected with local adaptation to the abiotic conditions of greater moisture and lower N at Site A than at Site B. While a response to abiotic conditions should be observed with or without grasshoppers (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2.1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2.4</xref>), it was only observed with grasshoppers. This may reflect local adaptation to different levels of grasshopper herbivory. From 1995&#x02013;2013, grasshopper densities at Site A were greater than at Site B (13.4/m<sup>2</sup> vs. 6.1/m<sup>2</sup>, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), so herbivory may be a stronger selection pressure at Site A. Local adaptation to herbivory can be examined by plotting relative ANPP (with&#x02009;&#x000f7;&#x02009;without grasshoppers) vs. grasshopper density. The plot increases and then decreases as grasshopper density increases for both Site A and B plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Litter decomposition rate is biotically affected by the plant species comprising the litter. <italic>P. pratensis</italic> litter decomposes faster than <italic>P. smithii</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> litter, so percent of litter remaining will decrease and N will increase as relative abundance of <italic>P. pratensis</italic> litter increases. Grasshopper selective feeding enhanced N at the originally less productive site (A) by increasing the relative abundance of faster decomposing plants (<italic>P. pratensis</italic>), and diminished N at the originally more productive site (B) by increasing the relative abundance of slower decomposing plants (<italic>P. smithii</italic>). Preferential feeding arises because grasshoppers prefer green vegetation that is lower in water content, so <italic>P. pratensis</italic> at Site B is preferred, while <italic>P. smithii</italic> is preferred at Site A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">With herbivory, we also observed that the plant species from the different sites were locally adapted to herbivory, even though they are the same species, with the plants from the site (A) where the herbivore was consistently more abundant being able to cope better with herbivory. A number of field experiments have reported on the importance of local adaptation of plants to herbivory,&#x000a0;e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and at least one study has hypothesized that this might affect nutrient dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">In summary, grasshoppers affect ANPP through plant source, plant species composition and level of herbivory. Counter to tradition that ANPP is driven by abiotic effects, biotic effects emerge stronger, increasing ANPP at one site and decreasing it at another beyond abiotic limits. This is driven by herbivory creating positive feedbacks that affect productivity, as reported elsewhere, e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

This includes misrepresenting system productivity by as much as 33%, and misidentifying the most productive system. Furthermore, the biotic influences operate on a local spatial scale (few kilometers). Consequently, we suggest that characterizing ecosystem functioning based solely on large spatial scale abiotic conditions (e.g., precipitation and temperature), as commonly conducted, especially in making climate change projections, may be misleading. Furthermore, environmental changes often change species abundances, including lost and added species, so that novel biotic effects may arise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.
