         <p>Solutions of the Arctic sea ice model in dependence on the mean long-wave radiation
            balance L
            <sub>m</sub>. (
            <span>a</span>) Full range of periodic solutions between L
            <sub>m</sub> = 75 and 45 W/m
            <span>2</span>. The blue surface demarcates between sea ice (E &lt; 0) and open ocean (E &gt; 0). Panels
            b–d show the solutions for three different values of L
            <sub>m</sub> in red; green and blue lines show equilibria for fixed solar and terrestrial irradiation
            representing a certain day of year when starting from very high (green) or very low
            (blue) E. The ranges where two equilibria are possible for the same irradiation are
            shown as blue shaded areas.
