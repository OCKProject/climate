         <a>1a</a> represent this system’s equilibria (dx/dt = 0) for constant D, which we refer to
         as the equilibrium system. D is an external (prescribed) driver representing environmental
         conditions, which makes the system non-autonomous (meaning that it explicitly depends
         on time). In case the driver D changes slowly enough, the system follows a stable
         equilibrium branch which ends at a bifurcation point. After the driver passes this
         point the system switches to the remaining stable equilibrium – the case of a classical
         tipping point.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our conceptual model is hence determined by Eqs 
         <a>1</a> and 
         <a>2</a>, and is well-known as the overdamped limit of the Duffing oscillator. We integrate
         the system for different sets of the three parameters, D
         <sub>m</sub>, D
         <sub>a</sub> and T, until it reaches a stable attractor in form of a periodic oscillation. Like
         the driver, the system’s solution is periodic in time with period T (also involving
         harmonics that can arise close to a bifurcation point)
         <span><a>17</a>,
            <a>18</a></span>. Figure 
         <a>2</a> illustrates how the periodic solutions of the system can change when one of the three
         parameters is varied. Varying D
         <sub>m</sub> (Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>) is similar to the classical scenario of a tipping point, only that the stable solutions
         oscillate in time: if D
         <sub>m</sub> is increased across the bifurcation, the upper branch of stable solutions disappears
         and the system has to shift to the lower branch. Interestingly, such tipping-point
         behavior can also be obtained by increasing the driver’s period T or its amplitude
         D
         <sub>a</sub>, without any change in D
         <sub>m</sub> (Fig. 
         <a>2b–d</a>). For example, when the driver is fast (small T) the system regularly passes the
         bifurcation point of the equilibrium system but returns in time to keep the system
         close to the upper branch. Therefore, there can be two alternative periodic solutions.
         However, when the driver becomes slower, the system destabilizes and propels itself
         toward the only remaining solution around the lower branch. Figure 
         <a>2e</a> illustrates this forced transition as a blue trajectory in the phase space spanned
         by driver D and state x.

                  <sub>m</sub> (

                  and end of each transition. See Supplementary Information for details on the parameter
                  choices.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A similar result is obtained when D
         <sub>a</sub> is increased (Fig. 
         <a>2c,f</a>) because the relaxation toward the lower branch becomes too strong. A systematic
         sampling of the parameter space spanned by D
         <sub>m</sub>, D
         <sub>a</sub> and T shows that D
         <sub>a</sub> and T essentially have a very similar effect in the model (Figs 
         <a>S1</a>,
         <a>S2</a>) as they both reduce the D
         <sub>m</sub>-range in which multiple solutions occur. When both become large, the dependence on
         initial conditions is destroyed (Fig. 
         <a>S3</a>). This is due to another type of abrupt transition, which occurs at D
         <sub>a</sub> = 0.8 in Fig. 
         <a>2d</a>. At this point, the system reaches a regime where it makes a full cycle involving
         both branches of the equilibrium system, flipping up and down between the branches
         (Fig. 
         <a>2g</a>). As the system’s response becomes very slow at the bifurcation point of the equilibrium
         system, the transition to the alternative state occurs after the bifurcation point
         is reached
         <span><a>19</a></span>. Nonetheless, if the driver’s amplitude is large enough, two abrupt shifts occur
         within each full cycle of the system under constant parameter conditions. When this
         regime becomes active, the amplitude of the solution increases rapidly with D
         <sub>a</sub>. In contrast to the bifurcations mentioned previously, such sudden amplitude change
         is reversible: for intermediate D
         <sub>a</sub> in Fig. 
         <a>2d</a>, there are no multiple solutions because all movement occurs along one continuous
         stable branch far from the second one above. When D
         <sub>a</sub> increases, the driver suddenly encloses both bifurcation points. During a cycle,
         the system now switches to the upper branch, but falls down again later on the other
         side. It should be noted that the amplitude change is only a sharp transition if T
         is sufficiently large (compare Fig. 
         <a>2c</a> with 
         <a>2d</a>). Otherwise, the time is too short for the system to get close to the alternative
         branch to which it is suddenly attracted in a short period during each cycle.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This reminds us that Fig. 
         <a>2a–d</a> displays only asymptotic solutions where the system ends up after an infinite time.
         In similarity to tipping points in an equilibrium system, the time it takes do make
         a transition from one to the other solution (blue trajectories in Fig. 
         <a>2e–g</a>), depends on the response time of the system. This response time can be idealized
         as a single relaxation time 
         <span>τ</span>. For example, in the equilibrium system given by Eq. 
         <a>1</a> and constant D, the relaxation time can be shown to be

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ratio between τ and the driver’s period T determines the abruptness of every one
         of the transitions discussed above. Three regimes can be distinguished: when 
         <span>T</span> ≫ 
         <span>τ</span>, the system closely follows the stable state of the equilibrium system. This limit
         case is usually addressed with the classical tipping point concept. When 
         <span>T</span> ≪ 
         <span>τ</span>, the system cannot follow the rapid forcing at all and remains static. It can then
         be described with an equivalent time-independent system. In the intermediate regime,
         where the time scales of the system and driver are similar, irreversible amplitude
         or timescale-induced shifts can occur.
