 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To conceptualise the link between abrupt monsoon transitions on different time scales we use the simple model of Levermann, 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> which describes an idealized summer monsoon that can switch between an “on” and “off” state (see Supplementary Information). The mechanism responsible for the abrupt behavior in the model is the moisture-advection feedback. It has recently been challenged that this feedback would be strong enough to support such nonlinearity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span>. While the underlying mechanism is hence uncertain, it is clear that abrupt monsoon switches both in the seasonal cycle and in response to orbital forcing do occur. By applying the tipping point framework we speculate that a common mechanism is behind the jumps within the annual cycle and the abrupt transitions on millennial time scales. While the Levermann model suggests the moisture-advection feedback as the cause, any other positive feedback would essentially yield the same qualitative behaviour.

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most important parameters that determine the model’s state are the atmospheric humidity over the ocean q
  <sub>o</sub> and the radiative balance of the atmospheric column over land R. Without any alterations to the model we generalize R here to also include the sensible heat flux at the Earth’s surface and call the resulting quantity R*. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> shows the precipitation P associated with the summer monsoon as a result of q
  <sub>o</sub> and R*. The threshold that separates the “on” and “off” states can be seen as a sharp boundary between the blue area (no monsoon rainfall) and other colors (monsoon rainfall of different magnitude).

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We now impose an annual cycle on the parameters q
  <sub>o</sub> and R*. The model is only valid for summer conditions and cannot describe any precipitation not associated with the summer monsoon. We therefore set P to zero in other seasons, knowing that no monsoon rainfall occurs during that time. In order to obtain an asymmetric annual cycle with an abrupt onset like in observations, we apply two strategies:
  <div list-type="order" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par23">We follow the approach by
     <span class="sup">
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
     </span> by introducing a small bistable regime at the critical threshold (the shaded region with a width of 0.5 g/kg at the boundary).
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par24">We introduce a phase lag of one month between the two cyclic drivers, making oceanic moisture q
     <sub>o</sub> lag the seasonal cycle in R*. This approach may be justified by the different memories of ocean and atmosphere: while the atmosphere can adjust to the solar insolation within days, the oceanic temperature which controls specific humidity lags the insolation cycle by many weeks. The resulting annual cycle of q
     <sub>o</sub> and R* is shown as a red orbit in the parameter plane of Fig. 
     <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, rotating counter-clockwise.

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual cycle of rainfall that results from the trajectory of q
  <sub>o</sub> and R* is shown in the inset of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>. As soon as the “off” state disappears in early summer at the right border of the shaded bistable region, an abrupt monsoon onset occurs. Later in the summer, R* and q
  <sub>o</sub> decline and rainfall decreases with them, until it drops to zero when the “on” state disappears at the left border of the shaded bistable region. An alternative situation with a different mean of q
  <sub>o</sub> and R* is shown by the dashed orbit and dashed annual precipitation cycle, where precipitation is zero during the whole year. The transition from the regime where a monsoon circulation establishes each year to the regime where it does not establish constitutes a generalized tipping point. The monsoon collapse occurs when the threshold value of q
  <sub>o</sub> and R* is not reached anymore in summer.
