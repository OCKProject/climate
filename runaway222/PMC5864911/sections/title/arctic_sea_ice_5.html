      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been hypothesized whether global warming can cause abrupt and irreversible
         sea-ice loss in the Arctic
         <span><a>61</a></span>. The most important argument for this idea is the positive feedback between surface
         albedo and sea-ice loss (ice-albedo feedback). It has been found that the existence
         of bifurcations in sea ice models depends on the description of spatial differences
         and the seasonal cycle
         <span><a>62</a>,
            <a>63</a></span>. While future ice loss is reversible in comprehensive models, these models also indicate
         that Arctic winter sea ice can be very sensitive to warming
         <span><a>64</a></span>. Moreover, a comprehensive model shows three alternative stable sea-ice states on
         a completely land-free Earth
         <span><a>65</a>,
            <a>66</a></span>. One of these states is a globally ice-covered planet, resembling the “snowball”
         conditions that occurred during the Neoproterozoic. This state also occurs in at least
         one other complex model under present-day boundary conditions
         <span><a>67</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence, it is plausible that tipping points in sea ice have occurred in the Earth’s
         past, triggered by changes in the continental configuration, Milankovitch forcing,
         or the seasonal insolation cycle. In this regard, Eisenman
         <span><a>68</a></span> provides an insightful parameter analysis of a simple Arctic sea ice model that is
         driven by the annual cycle of solar and terrestrial radiation. Small variations in
         these fluxes can lead to abrupt changes in the annual cycle of sea ice. Compared to
         the previous systems, Arctic sea ice and the surface ocean constitute a slow system
         that is not in equilibrium with the annual cycle of insolation. This can be seen from
         the fact that the annual cycle of Arctic sea ice volume lags the insolation cycle
         by approx. three months. The analysis by Eisenman
         <span><a>68</a></span> was performed with a model that already included the annual cycle of short- and long-wave
         insolation. The concept of tipping points in periodically forced systems suggests
         that the bifurcations in the model originate from multiple states under certain fixed
         values of insolation, as the following model results show.
