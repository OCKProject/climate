      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Toward a more general view on tipping points</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the sake of simplicity, our example models are a very idealized representation
         of reality. For example, alternative equilibria are arguably less likely or at least
         harder to find in more complex models
         <span><a>88</a></span>. Also, low-order models can often be misleading when spatial dimensions come into
         play. Taking space into account can often suppress multiple equilibria, but can also
         lead to new critical phenomena like pattern formation
         <span><a>35</a></span>. Despite the relevance of abrupt shifts in the Earth system, the connection between
         regime transitions in spatially extended systems (like the onset of turbulence in
         fluids)
         <span><a>24</a></span> and bifurcations in ordinary differential equations is not straightforward
         <span><a>25</a></span>, and neither is such theoretical knowledge well applied to the specific physical
         systems mentioned above. Nonetheless, nonlinearities and critical thresholds are arguably
         present in all Earth system components, providing a basis for abrupt shifts. At the
         same time, other yet unrecognized tipping points could exist in the Earth system.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In more realistic systems the drivers also have a more continuous spectrum. In models,
         the fast time scales in such spectra are often described by stochastic terms. The
         amplitude and period of the periodic oscillations we assumed above can be seen as
         an analogy for the typical magnitude and duration of random external fluctuations.
         Small changes in these statistical properties can lead to large and sometimes counter-intuitive
         changes in the distribution of a system’s state
         <span><a>89</a>,
            <a>90</a></span>. In this regard, the concept of tipping points triggered by changes in periodic forcings
         is one representation of the fundamental question how vulnerable components of the
         Earth system are to environmental change. Theoretical progress has been made in recent
         decades to generalise concepts from bifurcation theory, for example by defining pullback
         attractors for deterministic non-autonomous systems
         <span><a>91</a></span>, and random attractors for stochastic systems
         <span><a>92</a>,
            <a>93</a></span>. Unfortunately, such theoretical insights do not always feed back to our knowledge
         on tipping points in the Earth system.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One particular challenge in this regard is to investigate the applicability of statistical
         stability indicators that could provide an early warning of abrupt change. In climate
         research, this concept has mostly been explored in the static context of classical
         tipping points
         <span><a>94</a>–
            <a>96</a></span>. In the case of the systems above, classical indicators like rising variance and
         autocorrelation are not necessarily the most useful approach
         <span><a>18</a>,
            <a>97</a></span>. It is therefore important to explore alternative approaches to early warnings of
         abrupt change. Although conceptual models cannot replace studies based on observations
         and process-based modelling, they can help raise questions for future research. For
         example, it may be beneficial to compare abrupt monsoon changes on different time
         scales and in different regions: Are there common mechanisms behind the abrupt onsets
         in different monsoon systems on the planet? Are these mechanisms also responsible
         for abrupt monsoon shifts in palaeorecords? Is the expectation to see early warning
         signals before the occurrence of a certain shift supported by current process understanding?
         Will stronger El Niño events have irreversible consequences for tropical forest and
         savannah ecosystems? Was sea ice involved in a tipping point in the Earth’s history,
         and what was the role of periodic forcings? To explore such questions, it would be
         beneficial to further develop models of low to intermediate complexity in addition
         to existing Earth system models. Such a model hierarchy is most established in the
         case of sea ice models, but patchy in the case of ecosystems, and lacking in the case
         of monsoons. A suite of models that are easy to use would also better connect research
         attempts to understand different monsoon systems.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On top of that, studies on isolated tipping elements may even not be sufficient, as
         different Earth system components are linked in their stability behaviour and thus
         do not act in isolation. For example, sea-ice loss and the meridional ocean circulation
         affect each other
         <span><a>65</a>,
            <a>66</a>,
            <a>98</a></span>, and transitions between vegetation states depend on the global background climate
         involving the ice sheets
         <span><a>84</a></span> and the Atlantic overturning circulation
         <span><a>84</a>,
            <a>99</a></span>. In light of the large uncertainties, the candidates and suspected mechanisms of
         tipping points will certainly evolve with new knowledge. As the Earth system is interspersed
         with feedbacks and natural thresholds, and features oscillations and environmental
         fluctuations on a vast range of time scales, it seems plausible that non-equilibrium
         tipping points have already occurred in the past and could occur again in the future.
