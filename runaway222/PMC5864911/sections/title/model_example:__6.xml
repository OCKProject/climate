  </span> calculates an energy balance for a well-mixed box of ocean water, covered with ice of a single thickness (see Supplementary Information). When ice is present, the enthalpy E is negative and proportional to the ice thickness. In the absence of ice, E is positive and proportional to the ocean temperature. The bifurcation parameter L
  <sub>m</sub> represents the annual mean outgoing long-wave radiation budget at the surface (not including temperature feedbacks) and becomes smaller when the climate warms. For values of L
  <sub>m</sub> between approx. 65 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> (which roughly represents the present-day climate) and 50 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, two stable solutions can be found: a seasonally ice-covered ocean and an ice-free ocean (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>).

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The solutions in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> are periodic in time because of the prescribed annual cycle in the long-wave budget L, and downwelling short-wave radiation, S. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b–d</a> again displays the annual cycle for three distinct values of L
  <sub>m</sub> (red lines). In addition, we show to what state the sea-ice system would evolve if there was no annual cycle (green and blue lines). To this end, we fix S and L to the values corresponding to a particular day in a year and integrate the model forward in time, starting from large positive and negative E. For most days in the year, only one asymptotic solution exists. For example, under permanent summer conditions, all ice melts away and the ocean becomes so warm that the outgoing long-wave radiation balances the absorbed radiation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, green line). Under permanent winter conditions, the ice grows to an infinite thickness, because there is no negative feedback in the model to limit the ice growth. In such cases of failed convergence we artificially set the enthalpy to −7 GJ/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> (corresponding to a thickness of approx. 23 m). As the ice-ocean system cannot fully adjust to the fast insolation changes in the course of a year, the amplitude of its annual cycle is very small compared to the difference of its steady state solutions. The solutions overlap only during a short period in spring and an even shorter period in autumn, in the rest of the year only one solution exists. Nonetheless, the existence of multiple solutions still carries over to the periodically forced system for a certain parameter regime.

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bifurcations in this default model (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>) can thus be understood from the change of the asymptotic solutions with L
  <sub>m</sub>. In a cold climate, the summer is too short and insolation is too low to melt enough ice within one summer; a perennial ice cover is therefore the only solution of the periodically forced system. Under global warming (decreasing L
  <sub>m</sub>), the asymptotic solution moves to larger E and the melting season becomes longer (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>); this is where the periodically forced system has multiple solutions, balancing between the cold and warm attractors. Finally, the winter becomes too short for the formation of sea ice thick enough to survive the following summer, and the ice-free solution is the only one that remains (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the fact that a certain comprehensive model does not show multiple solutions under the same external conditions does not automatically suggest that tipping points are not possible. This has two reasons: First, tipping points can remain hidden in a parameter range related to periodic forces that is not explored when varying one parameter (such as CO
  <sub>2</sub>) alone. As Eisenman’s single column model above shows, the existence of multiple equilibria under fixed seasonal conditions in a model is a ‘smoking gun’ pointing to a strong positive feedback. Such a feedback indicates that the system is prone to tipping points even if the multistability is not apparent in the seasonally forced (non-autonomous) system. Changes in the insolation forcing (for instance due to changes in the annual cycle of cloud cover) can hence bring the system into a regime where abrupt changes are possible. The same can occur due to changes in the intrinsic relaxation time of the system, for instance related to the fact that the growth rate of sea ice depends on its thickness and hence the background climate

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>
  </span>. Second, abrupt shifts can also occur in systems without multiple states. Specifically, the freezing point of water acts as a natural threshold for the formation of sea ice, making ice cover very sensitive on temperature in a certain regime and prone to reversible abrupt shifts

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span>. The quasi-periodic changes in insolation related to Milankovitch forcing might therefore switch the Arctic back and forth between an ice-free and a seasonal ice regime (in analogy to the monsoon switches outlined above). A similar switch-mechanism determining the growth and melt of ice sheets has also been discussed as an explanation of ice ages during the Pleistocene
