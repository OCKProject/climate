 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The black lines in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> represent this system’s equilibria (dx/dt = 0) for constant D, which we refer to as the equilibrium system. D is an external (prescribed) driver representing environmental conditions, which makes the system non-autonomous (meaning that it explicitly depends on time). In case the driver D changes slowly enough, the system follows a stable equilibrium branch which ends at a bifurcation point. After the driver passes this point the system switches to the remaining stable equilibrium – the case of a classical tipping point.

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our conceptual model is hence determined by Eqs 
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Equ2" ref-type="" href="#Equ2">2</a>, and is well-known as the overdamped limit of the Duffing oscillator. We integrate the system for different sets of the three parameters, D
  <sub>m</sub>, D
  <sub>a</sub> and T, until it reaches a stable attractor in form of a periodic oscillation. Like the driver, the system’s solution is periodic in time with period T (also involving harmonics that can arise close to a bifurcation point)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> illustrates how the periodic solutions of the system can change when one of the three parameters is varied. Varying D
  <sub>m</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>) is similar to the classical scenario of a tipping point, only that the stable solutions oscillate in time: if D
  <sub>m</sub> is increased across the bifurcation, the upper branch of stable solutions disappears and the system has to shift to the lower branch. Interestingly, such tipping-point behavior can also be obtained by increasing the driver’s period T or its amplitude D
  <sub>a</sub>, without any change in D
  <sub>m</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b–d</a>). For example, when the driver is fast (small T) the system regularly passes the bifurcation point of the equilibrium system but returns in time to keep the system close to the upper branch. Therefore, there can be two alternative periodic solutions. However, when the driver becomes slower, the system destabilizes and propels itself toward the only remaining solution around the lower branch. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a> illustrates this forced transition as a blue trajectory in the phase space spanned by driver D and state x.

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A similar result is obtained when D
  <sub>a</sub> is increased (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c,f</a>) because the relaxation toward the lower branch becomes too strong. A systematic sampling of the parameter space spanned by D
  <sub>m</sub>, D
  <sub>a</sub> and T shows that D
  <sub>a</sub> and T essentially have a very similar effect in the model (Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>,
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>) as they both reduce the D
  <sub>m</sub>-range in which multiple solutions occur. When both become large, the dependence on initial conditions is destroyed (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). This is due to another type of abrupt transition, which occurs at D
  <sub>a</sub> = 0.8 in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>. At this point, the system reaches a regime where it makes a full cycle involving both branches of the equilibrium system, flipping up and down between the branches (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2g</a>). As the system’s response becomes very slow at the bifurcation point of the equilibrium system, the transition to the alternative state occurs after the bifurcation point is reached
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Nonetheless, if the driver’s amplitude is large enough, two abrupt shifts occur within each full cycle of the system under constant parameter conditions. When this regime becomes active, the amplitude of the solution increases rapidly with D
  <sub>a</sub>. In contrast to the bifurcations mentioned previously, such sudden amplitude change is reversible: for intermediate D
  <sub>a</sub> in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>, there are no multiple solutions because all movement occurs along one continuous stable branch far from the second one above. When D
  <sub>a</sub> increases, the driver suddenly encloses both bifurcation points. During a cycle, the system now switches to the upper branch, but falls down again later on the other side. It should be noted that the amplitude change is only a sharp transition if T is sufficiently large (compare Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a> with 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). Otherwise, the time is too short for the system to get close to the alternative branch to which it is suddenly attracted in a short period during each cycle.

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This reminds us that Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a–d</a> displays only asymptotic solutions where the system ends up after an infinite time. In similarity to tipping points in an equilibrium system, the time it takes do make a transition from one to the other solution (blue trajectories in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e–g</a>), depends on the response time of the system. This response time can be idealized as a single relaxation time
