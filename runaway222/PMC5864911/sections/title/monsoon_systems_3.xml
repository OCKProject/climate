 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monsoon systems cover a large part of the subtropical land areas and supply many people with water. The most important monsoons occur in India, East Asia, West Africa, Australia and North and South America. The classical view of monsoon systems is that subtropical heat lows in summer induce a low-level circulation from the tropical ocean towards higher latitudes that supplies the subtropical land with moisture
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. Due to geographical differences between the monsoon regions, each monsoon system is usually studied on its own. However, observations from several monsoon systems show an intriguing asymmetry in the annual cycle of precipitation: while the onset of the monsoon rainfall in spring tends to occur rather abruptly, its retreat in autumn occurs much more gradually. Abrupt monsoon onsets have been observed in West Africa
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>, the southwest Indian coast
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>, and in East Asia, where several abrupt stages of monsoon onset have been identified
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. This behavior stands in contrast to the gradual and symmetric annual cycle of solar isolation that drives the monsoon evolution.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are many potential reasons for abrupt monsoon onsets. First, meteorological theory predicts that switches from a zonal to a meridional flow can occur due to hydrodynamic instabilities when the atmosphere is sufficiently heated away from the equator
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. In particular, the mechanism has been found to operate in a regional model of West African monsoon climate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span> and is supported by observations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. Second, air-sea interactions involving wind, evaporation, clouds and moisture advection can provide positive feedbacks which can rapidly enhance the monsoon after its onset
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>. One important positive feedback results from the advection of moisture by the low-level monsoon flow. When this moisture condenses over land, the latent heat release further enhances the circulation. This feedback is at the heart of the monsoon model by
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span> that produces abrupt monsoon shifts, and whose simplified version
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> we will apply below. Third, the distribution of land surface properties such as albedo and orography modulate the monsoon onset
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span>. Fourth, the seasonal cycle is superimposed by faster oscillations, causing periods of rapid change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>. Such oscillations can make the monsoon onset more abrupt because they tend to be phase-locked to the annual cycle
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the complexity and geographical differences between the monsoon systems, the widespread existence of sudden monsoon onsets invites describing them within the common concept of tipping points. In addition, the annual cycle of solar insolation is a cyclic driver of these systems. One could therefore speculate that monsoons are periodically driven bistable systems. As the monsoon circulation adjusts very quickly to its boundary conditions it would be best described as a system with a very small ratio 
  <span class="italic">τ</span>/
  <span class="italic">T</span>, similar to the example system in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d and g</a>. One could therefore think of a typical annual cycle as a complete loop over both branches of the bistable system (the large amplitude solutions in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). It then follows that a small shift in external conditions could bring the system into a regime where the bifurcation point of the monsoon onset is not reached anymore in a particular year. Indeed, past abrupt transitions between episodes of strong and weakened (“failed”) East Asian monsoon have been identified in Chinese cave records
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. These switches occur due to the oscillations of the Earth’s orbit that modulate summer insolation on the northern hemisphere. In this regard, the behavior of monsoons within a year and on timescales of hundred thousands of years is remarkably similar.
