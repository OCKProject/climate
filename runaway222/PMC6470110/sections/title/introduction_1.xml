 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At present, over half of the world population lives in cities. The urban population is expected to increase to 66% by 2050, where 6.3 billion people will reside in urban areas. Together with Africa, Asia will have the most rapid urbanisation and, as a result, 52% of the global urban population will be concentrated in Asia in 2050 (UNDESA 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">2014</a>). By 2030, the world will have an estimated 40% freshwater shortage (UN Water 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2018</a>). Many Asian cities depend largely on groundwater. Unsustainable use of groundwater results in land subsidence as observed in Bangkok, Bandung, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and Tokyo (Erkens et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2015</a>; WWAP 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">2015</a>). Cities also generate vast amounts of solid waste. In developing Asian cities, the largest portion of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) ends in landfills that often lack proper sealing to prevent leaching (Guerrero et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>; Gupta et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>). Without appropriate treatment, solid waste releases hazardous substances that potentially pollute groundwater, surface water and oceans (Jambeck et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2015</a>; Zarfl et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">2011</a>). Discharge of untreated sewage, combined sewer overflows and polluted stormwater runoff, increasingly pollutes Asia’s surface waters. Nutrient emissions in Asia and Africa are projected to double or triple within 40 years, causing serious eutrophication leading to biodiversity loss, and threatening drinking water quality, fisheries, aquaculture and tourism (e.g., Dai et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2017</a>; Ligtvoet et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2014</a>; OECD Korea Development Institute 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2017</a>). Particularly urban areas, including almost all megacities around the world, are vulnerable to both water-related threats and large sources of pollution as well (Ligtvoet et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2014</a>). Water pollution affects urban citizen’s health and limits urban economic growth (OECD 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2015a</a>; Ligtvoet et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2014</a>). Finally, the recovery and reuse of freshwater, energy and materials from wastewater and solid waste are important for realising a circular economy that can address the increasing scarcity of sparse materials, nutrients, freshwater and energy resources (EC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2014</a>; Henckens et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2014</a>; Van Leeuwen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2018</a>). Hence, the urban water cycle is crucial for sustainable urban development (Van Leeuwen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2018</a>), which is clearly reflected in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6 and 11 (UN 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2018a</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Governance institutions are faced with a variety of barriers when trying to address above long-term water challenges, which may be summarised as a combination of management fragmentation, technological lock-in, institutional inertia and the challenge of reorienting professional and organisational expertise (Brown and Farrelly 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2009</a>; Koop et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2017</a>; OECD 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2015a</a>; Sydow et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2009</a>). These barriers also lead to limited awareness, ill-defined water challenges and a lack of cohesion between short-term targets and long-term goals, as well as inconsistencies between sectors, policies and political agendas (OECD 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2015b</a>). Often, water-related measures are taken in an uncoordinated haphazard manner whereby quick fixes are applied, neglecting the co-benefits with other water-related and other sectorial challenges in cities (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> and Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> in Koop and Van Leeuwen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2017</a>). Measures should be taken after a thorough diagnosis (baseline assessment) in order to find the most cost-effective and efficient approach. Although an integrated and inclusive approach is often emphasised, there are only few studies that assess urban water management in a consistent and intelligible way (OECD 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2015b</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2018</a>). Hence, such an approach is much needed in order to accumulate knowledge and facilitate active engagement of citizens, private stakeholders, professionals and policy makers (Koop and Van Leeuwen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The City Blueprint
  <span class="sup">®</span> Approach is a diagnosis tool, i.e., the first step in the interactive and strategic planning process of cities to address the challenges of water, waste and climate change (Koop and Van Leeuwen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2015a</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">b</a>). The approach has been developed as one of the actions of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on water, as well as of the Watershare community (EC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2018</a>; Watershare 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2017a</a>). It provides an overview of the main components of the urban water cycle by means of 25 performance indicators. At present, 70 cities in more than 35 countries have been analysed based on the approach and a number of publications have been published, presenting the results for the city of Amsterdam (Van Leeuwen and Sjerps 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">2015</a>), Ahmedabad (Aartsen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2017</a>), Dar es Salaam (Van Leeuwen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">2012</a>), Istanbul (Van Leeuwen and Sjerps 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">2016</a>), Hamburg (Van Leeuwen and Bertram 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">2013</a>), HCMC (Van Leeuwen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">2015</a>), Melbourne (Van Leeuwen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">2017</a>), Quito (Scheurs et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2018</a>), New York City (Feingold et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2018</a>), Seoul (Kim et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2018</a>) and Bandung (Rahmasary 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2017</a>). Moreover, the European Commission has published the ‘Urban Water Atlas for Europe’ which includes 46 City Blueprints and illustrates the role of water in European cities. The atlas is a novel approach to encourage citizens to understand the relevance of water by combining the work of scientists, artists, politicians and municipal stakeholders with work done by schoolchildren and teachers (Gawlik et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2017</a>). Based on this extensive empirical database, key insights have been obtained about the various stages of transformation that cities go through in improving their Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) as shown in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. IWRM is defined as a process that promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems and the environment (Global Water Partnership 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2000</a>).

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand how cities can leapfrog through this transformation process, it is pivotal to analyse the main conditions that enable or impede good water governance. In the literature on environmental governance, a plethora of social factors and conditions have been identified that may influence the ability to adapt and respond proactively to the existing and emerging challenges (e.g., Biesbroek et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2013</a>; Eisenack et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2014</a>). However, despite this rich literature, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes that enhance or limit the water governance capacity of cities is largely missing. Governance, transformation and adaptation processes are often not transparent. First, most identified conditions are based on theoretical and conceptual rationales that are not fully validated by empirical data (Biesbroek et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2013</a>; Kersberger and Waarden 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2004</a>). Second, existing empirical studies are predominantly descriptive or focus on specific case studies that limit their usefulness and learning value beyond the individual context (Measham et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2011</a>). Third, concepts, definitions, measurements and methodologies are often inconsistent and not specific (Eisenack et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we study the priorities, barriers and enablers of Asian cities to develop their governance capacity necessary for the transformation to address their current and future challenges related to water, waste and climate change (Koop and Van Leeuwen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2017</a>). Section 2 explains the methodologies we apply for our empirical, comparative case study approach. Results are provided in section 3. First, we identify the key challenges in urban water cycle management in 11 Asian cities in order to distinguish management priorities and obtain a thorough understanding of the challenges. Second, we analyse the governance capacity to address these challenges of water, waste and climate change in three Asian cities, Ahmedabad (India), Bandung (Indonesia) and Taipei (Taiwan). This paper focusses primarily on flood risk management as the detailed assessments of other water-related challenges in the city of Ahmedabad, Bandung and Seoul are published elsewhere (Aartsen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2017</a>; Rahmasary 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2017</a>; Kim et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2018</a>). In section 4, we discuss the value and limitations of our study and embed the results in the literature on urban development and water management in Asia. In section 5, we conclude with identifying the main priorities, barriers and enablers to develop governance capacity to address the challenges in Asian cities.
