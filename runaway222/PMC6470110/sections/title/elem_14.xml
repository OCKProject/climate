  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">City-level data are scarce globally. This limited availability also has its effects on the accuracy of the TPF and CBF indicators because, for some of the CBF indicators, national-level data are used for the calculations (Koop and Van Leeuwen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2015b</a>). Because the method aims to enhance city-to-city learning worldwide, the framework also includes only those indicators for which data can be obtained relatively easily. Hence, additional city-specific features can be added and included in the City Blueprint reports. For the GCF, it can be argued that a lack of knowledge or experience of an interviewee will affect the assessment validity. Therefore, the desk study is of critical importance to check statements of interviewees. Moreover, the stakeholder analysis is also crucial to ensure inclusion of all key stakeholders and select adequate interviewees. To make sure this study is reproducible and reliable, GCF analyses in each city are supported by a justification report with detailed substantiation for each indicator score based on desk studies, interviews and feedback from the interviewees. The interviewees are anonymous to avoid socially desired answers. Finally, the TPF, CBF and GCF provide only an overview (snapshot) of the current conditions. A repetition of the analyses over time using these assessments is advised to monitor the indicators and to capture their trends over time.
  </p>
  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the CBA provides a good starting point to improve IWRM for cities and simultaneously allows for standardisation and reproducibility of the results. The overall scores of the TPF and CBF assessments in cities provide a unique frame to analyse global patterns of urban water management, such as the categorisation of IWRM (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Moreover, correlations with other indicators can be explored in order to identify patterns and possible causalities that need to be validated through more advanced methods. For example, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> provides interesting correlations of the overall BCI score in 70 cities with TPI (r = −0.79), the climate readiness index (r = 0.80), governance effectiveness index (r = 0.80) and GDP per capita (r = 0.70), respectively.

      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2017</a>). The correlation coefficients are, respectively, −0.79, 0.80, 0.80 and 0.70

   </div>
  </p>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cities with high pressures (high TPIs) usually have low BCIs, most probably because they face more constraints and challenges in attaining good water management, which is in line with earlier observations (Koop and Van Leeuwen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2015a</a>). The climate readiness index measures the ability to absorb and mobilise financial support for climate change adaptation. Its high correlation with the BCI means that cities with good IWRM performance are also climate-ready (Koop and Van Leeuwen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2015b</a>). Governance capacities may also be low in developing cities, due to their high social and financial pressures. Unfortunately, the current number of cities (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 15) analysed by the GCF is insufficient to calculate valid correlation coefficients. The BCI correlates well with the GDP per capita of a country (r = 0.70), which makes sense as there are more financial resources to invest in urban water management. However, the BCI correlates better with The World Bank’s indicator 
   <span class="italic">governance effectiveness</span> of countries. The differences in BCI between cities within a country can be rather substantial, meaning that these correlation coefficients have limited empirical value, but they still do provide one of the most accurate indications available for developments in urban IWRM.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Transformation Trajectory of Asian’s Urban Water Management</div>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most cities—HCMC (BCI 2.4), Bandung (BCI 2.6), Bangkok (BCI 2.6), Manila (BCI 2.6) and Ahmedabad (BCI 3.0)— are classified as ‘
   <span class="italic">wasteful</span>' according to the IWRM categorisation shown in Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. Indeed, these cities often face substantial flood risks, poor WWT and solid waste treatment that all lead to large scale pollution. Drinking water leakage is relatively high due to insufficient investments in the refurbishment or replacement of existing infrastructure. The classification as shown in Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> is largely based on wasteful cities in Eastern Europe. The six Asian cities show similar features. However, there is also a large difference: cities in Eastern Europe have stable or decreasing populations, whereas Asian cities are rapidly growing. In contrast to cities in Eastern Europe, access to basic water services, such as access to improved sanitation and drinking water, is not ensured in the informal settlements that emerge due to rapid urban expansion. In addition, drinking water consumption in many of these Asian cities was low due to limited piped water supply, whereas this does not apply to Eastern European cities. It is therefore necessary to reassess the categorisation proposed by Koop and Van Leeuwen (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2015b</a>; Table 1) that was largely developed with data biased towards Europe. The cities of Tianjin, Taipei (BCI 3.9) and Hohhot (BCI 5.0) comply well with the category ‘
   <span class="italic">water efficient city</span>’ as they apply well-known, centralised technological solutions to increase water efficiency and to control pollution. The cities of Seoul (7.3) and Singapore (8.1) apply advanced techniques to reduce climate vulnerability, recover resources and conserve water. In particular, Singapore has already implemented effective holistic urban planning and has almost transformed itself to be a ‘
   <span class="italic">water wise city</span>’.
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The challenge of flood risk intertwines strongly with other issues, such as solid waste management, wastewater treatment and water scarcity. Uncollected solid waste clogs drainage systems leading to flooding and water pollution. Poor wastewater treatment also leads to water pollution, threatening human health, fish populations and clean water availability as such. IWRM is of critical importance in these rapidly expanding Asian cities and a proper understanding of the actual risks and effectiveness of measures is key. Accordingly, the governance capacity of cities to transform their water management can be considered as a key area of research (e.g., Koop and Van Leeuwen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2017</a>; OECD 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2015a</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2015b</a>). In the comparative analysis of the capacity to govern flood risk in the city of Ahmedabad, Bandung and Taipei, some priorities have been identified that may also apply to other cities in Asia. In particular, the evaluation process of existing policy and practices is a key point to improve as it is a precondition for learning and improved implementing capacity. All three cities face issues of statutory compliance which can be understood in light of the many social, environmental and financial pressures they face, especially with rapid urban expansion. The GCF findings indicate that national governments in Asian cities largely use top–down approaches in decision-making processes of the water management sector. This practice can be improved by combining top–down and bottom-up approaches. It creates a consultative state using a two-way flow of advice to combine expert and local personal experience, also to ensure that community needs are identified and addressed (Kobayashi and Porter 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2012</a>). Nowadays, more cities are exploring a combined approach by providing offline and online platforms that allow citizens to be involved in urban planning activities. This transition to a cross-stakeholder water governance approach helps local governments to receive broader support and acceptance in their decision-making process (Perreault 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2014</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Municipal Solid Waste and Wastewater Challenges</div>
  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Major improvements are needed in developing cities with respect to MSW management and WWT. A change in public behaviour is required, as many citizens often dispose their solid waste and wastewater directly on streets, in poorly maintained landfills and rivers. Industrial activities are also known as a major source of water pollution for many urban rivers in China, India and Indonesia (Fulazzaky 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2014</a>; Herricks and Suen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2003</a>; Maheshwari 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2016</a>). Cities with sufficient financial resources often do collect, separate and process their MSW. South Korea changed their landfilling practices and promoted recycling and incineration. In 2010, 60.5% of their MSW was recycled and 21.6% was incinerated (Min and Rhee 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2014</a>). Singapore also cuts their landfilling practice due to limited space. At present, 21% of Singapore’s MSW is recycled and 69% is incinerated (NEA 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2016</a>). Still, the largest percentage of MSW in developing Asian cities ends up in landfills. However, most landfills are not properly designed as a sanitary landfill (e.g., lacking of durable plastic or clay-lined layers to prevent leaching) (Guerrero et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>; Gupta et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>). The practice of solid waste separation for composting and recycling has risen in Asian cities with average MSW composition of 40–60% organic waste. Cities in India treat their organic MSW by composting, vermi-composting (using worms) and anaerobic digestion (producing methane and manure; Gupta et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>). In Indonesia, waste banks increase the public willingness to dispose of their MSW separately, using financial incentives. These banks pay for people’s valuable waste (i.e., plastic, metal, paper) to be recycled (Dhokhikah et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2015</a>). South Korea uses regulations on the restricted use of disposable products, i.e., a volume-based waste fee system (VBWFS) and food waste recycling. The introduction of VBWFS led to 17.8% reduction in MSW generation and a 26% increase in recyclable wastes in the first year of 1995, and overall reduction of MSW generation by 14% per year during the period of 1994 to 2004 (Kim and Kim 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2012</a>). The government also issued Extended Producer Responsibility that invokes producers to reduce their products’ packaging (Min and Rhee 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wastewater disposal and treatment systems in developing cities are underdeveloped. They often include aerated lagoons, septic tanks and latrines (Varis 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">2006</a>). The number of wastewater treatment plants is increasing globally, but this development is unable to keep up with the rapid population growth and urbanisation observed in many cities in Asia. This off-site centralised treatment is preferable to improve public health and to reduce environmental contamination. However, local regulations, land availability and a lack of financial resources to build sewer infrastructure are reoccurring constraining factors (Kerstens et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2015</a>). The slow progress in developing centralised treatment plants results in more attention for the ‘community as users’ principal, e.g., community-based sanitation (CBS) and decentralised wastewater treatment system programmes (DEWATS; Prihandrijanti and Firdayati 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2011</a>; Sofyan et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2016</a>). CBS and DEWATS programmes are demand-driven approaches with high community involvement. They require less extensive infrastructural investments. Still, continuous supervision and improvements are needed to ensure the quality of the treatment units since they are known to have comparably low removal efficiencies (Kerstens et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2015</a>). It is also important to provide local communities with regular assistance in using and maintenancing these services.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Role of Community Movements in Alleviating Basic Water Services in Slums</div>
  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Citizens living in informal settlements (slums) constitute a significant percentage of the urban population. A recent estimate states that 32.7% of the world’s population in developing regions is living in slums (UN-HABITAT 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2011</a>). There were more slum dwellers in 2012 than in 2000, a trend that will likely continue in the future (WWAP 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2017</a>). Slum dwellers frequently rely on unsewered communal toilets, use open spaces or dispose of faeces in polythene bags. The inequality in sanitary services is significant. For instance, in India 56% of the population in the top 20% (household-income groups) has access to piped water, compared with 6% of the bottom 20% (World Bank 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2017</a>). Rapid urban expansion aggravates these challenges and the people are also disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate hazards (Jamil 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2013</a>; UN-HABITAT 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2013</a>; Varis 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">2006</a>; WWAP 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2017</a>). The proportion of the urban population living in slums in China, India, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand is, respectively, 25, 24, 22, 38 and 25% (UN 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2018b</a>). Furthermore, groundwater dependency is high in Asia, especially throughout South Asia and China. Approximately one-third of Asia’s population (some 1 billion to 1.2 billion people) is reliant on groundwater (Hirji et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2017</a>; WWAP 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2018</a>). The provision of basic water services (drinking water and sanitation and wastewater treatment) in informal settlements faces an even greater challenge (WWAP 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2017</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2018</a>). Figure

  </p>
  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the highest percentage of populations living in slums are in cities that are categorised as cities 
   <span class="italic">‘lacking basic water services’</span>, followed by cities belonging to the category 
   <span class="italic">‘wasteful cities’</span> (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). These cities include Belem (Brazil), Kilamba Kiaxi (Angola), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Quito (Ecuador), Jakarta (Indonesia), (Bulgaria), HCMC (Vietnam), Bandung (Indonesia), Bangkok (Thailand), Manila (the Philippines), Varna (Bulgaria) and Ahmedabad (India). These results emphasise the need of alleviating the slum’s provision to attain better water and wastewater services. These are also major global goals embedded in the UN SDGs (UN 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2018a</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Special budgets from governments are often available for slum alleviation programmes, next to available local resources, since slum populations in developing countries often comprise the largest part of the informal sector in urban economic development (Jamil 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2013</a>). However, despite available programmes such as relocation, affordable flats, CBS and other incentives, the local community is often reluctant to change their current living situation (Jamil 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2013</a>). To address this situation, local authorities should understand the characteristics of local slums (UN-HABITAT 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2011</a>). For example, engaging slum dwellers early on in local decision-making increases their ‘
   <span class="italic">sense of belonging’</span> and willingness to cooperate. A continuous commitment is required to realise proper implementation of these programmes (Mol 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2009</a>; Suharko 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2015</a>). These local community movements generally aim for smaller and more accurate targets. Importantly, they represent the interests and core values of the marginalised communities and play the role of a mediator for the government (Suharko 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2015</a>). For example, Bandung’s civil society organisations are very collaborative by expanding public engagement using social media platforms to raise awareness in slums (Rahmasary 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2017</a>).
