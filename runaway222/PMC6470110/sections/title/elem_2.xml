  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to study Asia’s urban water management, 11 cities were selected that represent the rapid transformation of Asian cities, including a diversity of cities at different stages of this transformation (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The selection of cities for this study was not random. It was made based on existing collaborative research networks of the University of Utrecht and KWR Watercycle Research Institute, e.g., Watershare
   <span class="sup">®</span> (Watershare 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2017</a>a, b), where we tried to include a representative selection of cities in a variety of Asian countries. All the selected cities (Tables 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> and 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) are rapidly expanding. Most of them are located along the coast (e.g., Bangkok and Jakarta), islands (e.g., Singapore and Taipei) and some are inland (e.g., Ahmedabad and Hohhot). The differences in geographical setting and level of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reflect the diversity in the continent and allows for the identification of priorities, barriers and enablers to develop the capacity to transform water management in Asian cities.

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TPF consists of 12 descriptive indicators to summarise the exogenous social, environmental and financial conditions within which water managers have to operate (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Each indicator is scaled from 0 to 4 points, where a higher score represents a higher urban pressure or concern (Koop and Van Leeuwen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2015a</a>). Most scores of the indicators are based on national quantitative data from, for example, the World Bank, World Health Organisation and the Food and Agricultural Organisation. Most indicator scores are determined using the ranking of the city amongst all available country scores and the average of all indicators is called the Trends and Pressures Index (TPI). It provides an indication of the urban pressures with respect to global trends. Detailed information on the scoring methods is provided by Koop and Van Leeuwen (

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CBF consists of 25 indicators divided into seven categories: (1) water quality, (2) solid waste treatment, (3) basic water services, (4) wastewater treatment, (5) infrastructure, (6) climate robustness, and (7) governance. Each indicator is scored from 0 (much room for improvement) to 10 (best practice), where their geometric mean is called the Blue City Index (BCI). The CBF uses scientific articles, websites and official reports at the city level as its source for calculating or assigning a score for each indicator. Detailed information about data sources, calculation methods, scaling methods and limitations of the CBF are provided by Koop and Van Leeuwen (

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GCF analyses the governance capacity of a city to address a specific common water challenge (Koop et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2017</a>; Watershare 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2017b</a>). The GCF provides information on how well different organisations can work together and to what extent capacities are institutionalised. In this way, governance capacity is understood as the result of human skills and expertise. In its more recent extension, the GCF has been applied in 15 cities where the publications of Quito (Scheurs et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2018</a>), New York City (Feingold et al.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2018</a>) are available online. The GCF consists of three dimensions and nine conditions (Table 
   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). Each condition has three indicators that are scored using a Likert scale ranging from very encouraging (++) to very limiting (− −) the overall governance capacity to address a water challenge. A detailed description of the Likert scale for each of the 27 indicators is available (EC 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2018</a>). Water governance is assessed with respect to five challenges: (1) flood risk, (2) water scarcity, (3) solid waste treatment, (4) wastewater treatment and (5) urban heat islands (UHI). The indicator scoring was done through a triangular approach to validate findings by different sources in three consecutive steps:

Stakeholders in each city were analysed and categorised to ensure the representativeness of interviewees and the diversity of water managers. This paper categorised the stakeholders based on their importance/influence, functionality or power/interest. Multiple interviewees from identified stakeholders were selected for in-depth interviews to collect information, score the indicators and ask follow-up questions for clarification or a better overall understanding. To minimise the risk of bias and assure diversity amongst interviewees, they were selected according to their roles, expertise and responsibilities. Based on the interviews, the preliminary indicator scores were updated.</p>
