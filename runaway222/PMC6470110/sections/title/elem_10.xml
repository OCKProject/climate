 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to understand the main barriers and enablers that Asian cities experience in their transformation trajectory, we have analysed the water governance capacity of three transforming cities: Ahmedabad, Bandung and Taipei. In this section, we only provide a short overview and mainly limit ourselves to the governance capacity to deal with the risk of flooding. Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a> displays a graphic view of the governance capacity profile in these three cities.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ahmedabad</div>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Ahmedabad, visionary agents (ind. 6.3) within the government use their authority (ind. 7.3) to set ambitious goals (ind. 5.1). However, insufficient statutory compliance (ind. 9.2) and poor use of policy instruments (ind. 9.1) limit the implementation of these goals. In particular, insufficient monitoring (ind. 3.1) and policy evaluation (ind. 3.2) hinder learning for better implementation practices. Awareness and financial viability (conditions 1 and 8) are found to encourage governance capacity. On the other hand, continuous learning and implementing capacity (conditions 3 and 9) reduce the governance capacity needed to address flood risks. Interestingly, Ahmedabad’s Governance capacity to address heat risks was found to be rather encouraging (Aartsen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2017</a>). This can be seen from the success case of Ahmedabad’s Heat Adaptation Plan. During the 2010 heat wave, an excess of 1,344 additional deaths in Ahmedabad were reported, i.e., an increase of 43.1% compared with the previous years (Shah et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2014</a>). It sets an example for the city to improve its governance capacity to address other challenges of water, waste and climate change.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bandung</div>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Flooding in Bandung has increased in frequency where during the worst seasonal flood, it can be stagnant for 2–4 weeks and causes temporary evacuation. Flooding is the main reason for increased traffic congestion contributing to the city’s air pollution. Inappropriate solid waste collection and treatment causes clogs in drainage channels, which exacerbate flooding events even further (Rahmasary 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2017</a>). Bandung can improve its smart monitoring and evaluation process (condition 3). The city’s statutory compliance (ind. 9.2) to existing legislation, policies and agreements can be considered a priority for improvement. In addition, sharing knowledge and practice can be improved by endorsing collaboration among engaged stakeholders and multi-level networking (condition 4). Agents of change (condition 6) play a critical role in raising public awareness and realising behavioural change (condition 1) especially in solid waste and wastewater treatment challenges (Rahmasary 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2017</a>). Additional support from the regional and national government can be used more effectively to address the city’s strongly interrelated water challenges.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taipei</div>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Taipei, public awareness of flood risk (ind. 2.1) and smart monitoring (ind. 3.1) is relatively high. Equitable financial support for climate protection (condition 8) is largely provided. Taipei has learned from past disasters. Monitoring systems are further developed and improved, and companies and citizens comply with taxes to further reduce flood risks. However, these measures are merely focussed on short-term flood risks. To further improve the long-term governance capacity for Taipei, the city needs to elaborate detailed long-term urban planning (ind. 5.1) and support visionary agents (6.3). The agents of change, such as the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Taiwan Youth Climate Coalition, private companies and universities, should explore opportunities that go beyond technical solutions and the government and the private sector should provide financial resources to support these entrepreneurial activities. This broader approach may contribute and further improve the city’s preparedness. In particular, capacity development may need to focus on:
