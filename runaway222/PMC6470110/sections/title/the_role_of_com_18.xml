 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Citizens living in informal settlements (slums) constitute a significant percentage of the urban population. A recent estimate states that 32.7% of the world’s population in developing regions is living in slums (UN-HABITAT 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2011</a>). There were more slum dwellers in 2012 than in 2000, a trend that will likely continue in the future (WWAP 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2017</a>). Slum dwellers frequently rely on unsewered communal toilets, use open spaces or dispose of faeces in polythene bags. The inequality in sanitary services is significant. For instance, in India 56% of the population in the top 20% (household-income groups) has access to piped water, compared with 6% of the bottom 20% (World Bank 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2017</a>). Rapid urban expansion aggravates these challenges and the people are also disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate hazards (Jamil 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2013</a>; UN-HABITAT 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2013</a>; Varis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">2006</a>; WWAP 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2017</a>). The proportion of the urban population living in slums in China, India, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand is, respectively, 25, 24, 22, 38 and 25% (UN 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2018b</a>). Furthermore, groundwater dependency is high in Asia, especially throughout South Asia and China. Approximately one-third of Asia’s population (some 1 billion to 1.2 billion people) is reliant on groundwater (Hirji et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2017</a>; WWAP 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2018</a>). The provision of basic water services (drinking water and sanitation and wastewater treatment) in informal settlements faces an even greater challenge (WWAP 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2017</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2018</a>). Figure 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> shows the relation between population living in slums with access to improved sanitation and improved water sources.

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the highest percentage of populations living in slums are in cities that are categorised as cities 
  <span class="italic">‘lacking basic water services’</span>, followed by cities belonging to the category 
  <span class="italic">‘wasteful cities’</span> (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). These cities include Belem (Brazil), Kilamba Kiaxi (Angola), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Quito (Ecuador), Jakarta (Indonesia), (Bulgaria), HCMC (Vietnam), Bandung (Indonesia), Bangkok (Thailand), Manila (the Philippines), Varna (Bulgaria) and Ahmedabad (India). These results emphasise the need of alleviating the slum’s provision to attain better water and wastewater services. These are also major global goals embedded in the UN SDGs (UN 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2018a</a>).

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Special budgets from governments are often available for slum alleviation programmes, next to available local resources, since slum populations in developing countries often comprise the largest part of the informal sector in urban economic development (Jamil 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2013</a>). However, despite available programmes such as relocation, affordable flats, CBS and other incentives, the local community is often reluctant to change their current living situation (Jamil 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2013</a>). To address this situation, local authorities should understand the characteristics of local slums (UN-HABITAT 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2011</a>). For example, engaging slum dwellers early on in local decision-making increases their ‘
  <span class="italic">sense of belonging’</span> and willingness to cooperate. A continuous commitment is required to realise proper implementation of these programmes (Mol 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2009</a>; Suharko 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2015</a>). These local community movements generally aim for smaller and more accurate targets. Importantly, they represent the interests and core values of the marginalised communities and play the role of a mediator for the government (Suharko 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2015</a>). For example, Bandung’s civil society organisations are very collaborative by expanding public engagement using social media platforms to raise awareness in slums (Rahmasary 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2017</a>).
