 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Asia’s coasts urbanise at a staggering rate. In fact, 11 of the world’s 17 largest cities are coastal Asian cities, such as Bangkok, Jakarta or Manila (Tibbetts 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2002</a>). Economic growth is lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and a rapidly growing urban middle class accounts for about two billion people at present. However, Asian cities also include the world’s largest urban slum populations and the largest population living below the poverty line in areas vulnerable to environmental risks, such as floods, landslides and the effects of pollutions (UN-HABITAT and ESCAP 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2015</a>). The variety in social, environmental and financial contexts of these cities is reflected in the pressures that these cities experience (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>).

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, many cities in Asia, especially those with low average GDP and high inflation, face social pressure, particularly coming from high urbanisation rates, environmental pressure from water scarcity, pollution, flooding and heat risk, as well as financial pressure. During several decades, the expansion of the global market in Asia transformed its large cities into population magnets with relatively high economic and urban growth (Douglass 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2010</a>; Firman 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2009</a>). Coastal cities like HCMC, Jakarta and Bangkok are recurrently used as case studies of sinking cities with an average land subsidence rate of 20–100 mm/year (Erkens et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2015</a>). Uncontrolled groundwater abstraction in Bandung and Taipei aggravates their land subsidence to 80 mm/year (Abidin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2013</a>; Hwang et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2016</a>). The two least pressured cities, Seoul and Singapore, face freshwater scarcity. Nevertheless, both cities secure their drinking water supply using advanced technology. Seoul’s water works authority purifies 3.19 million m
  <span class="sup">3</span> drinking water from the Han River, while Singapore is known for its four national taps of imported water, local rainwater harvesting, NEWater (reclaimed water) and desalinated water (SMG 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2014</a>; PUB 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2017</a>). Many cities in Asia face heat risks. With the most recent heat-wave temperatures of 48 °C in 2016, Ahmedabad’s inhabitants faced an ever-growing heat risk (Aartsen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2017</a>). Overall, cities with high social pressures, such as Jakarta and Manila, tend to have high financial pressures. In fact, the city’s overall social, environmental and financial pressures reflected in the TPI has been found to correlate negatively with the IWRM performance reflected in the BCI (Koop and Van Leeuwen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2015b</a>).
