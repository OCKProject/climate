 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Major improvements are needed in developing cities with respect to MSW management and WWT. A change in public behaviour is required, as many citizens often dispose their solid waste and wastewater directly on streets, in poorly maintained landfills and rivers. Industrial activities are also known as a major source of water pollution for many urban rivers in China, India and Indonesia (Fulazzaky

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2016</a>). Cities with sufficient financial resources often do collect, separate and process their MSW. South Korea changed their landfilling practices and promoted recycling and incineration. In 2010, 60.5% of their MSW was recycled and 21.6% was incinerated (Min and Rhee 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2014</a>). Singapore also cuts their landfilling practice due to limited space. At present, 21% of Singapore’s MSW is recycled and 69% is incinerated (NEA 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2016</a>). Still, the largest percentage of MSW in developing Asian cities ends up in landfills. However, most landfills are not properly designed as a sanitary landfill (e.g., lacking of durable plastic or clay-lined layers to prevent leaching) (Guerrero et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>; Gupta et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>). The practice of solid waste separation for composting and recycling has risen in Asian cities with average MSW composition of 40–60% organic waste. Cities in India treat their organic MSW by composting, vermi-composting (using worms) and anaerobic digestion (producing methane and manure; Gupta et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>). In Indonesia, waste banks increase the public willingness to dispose of their MSW separately, using financial incentives. These banks pay for people’s valuable waste (i.e., plastic, metal, paper) to be recycled (Dhokhikah et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2015</a>). South Korea uses regulations on the restricted use of disposable products, i.e., a volume-based waste fee system (VBWFS) and food waste recycling. The introduction of VBWFS led to 17.8% reduction in MSW generation and a 26% increase in recyclable wastes in the first year of 1995, and overall reduction of MSW generation by 14% per year during the period of 1994 to 2004 (Kim and Kim 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2012</a>). The government also issued Extended Producer Responsibility that invokes producers to reduce their products’ packaging (Min and Rhee 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2014</a>).

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wastewater disposal and treatment systems in developing cities are underdeveloped. They often include aerated lagoons, septic tanks and latrines (Varis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">2006</a>). The number of wastewater treatment plants is increasing globally, but this development is unable to keep up with the rapid population growth and urbanisation observed in many cities in Asia. This off-site centralised treatment is preferable to improve public health and to reduce environmental contamination. However, local regulations, land availability and a lack of financial resources to build sewer infrastructure are reoccurring constraining factors (Kerstens et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2015</a>). The slow progress in developing centralised treatment plants results in more attention for the ‘community as users’ principal, e.g., community-based sanitation (CBS) and decentralised wastewater treatment system programmes (DEWATS; Prihandrijanti and Firdayati 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2011</a>; Sofyan et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2016</a>). CBS and DEWATS programmes are demand-driven approaches with high community involvement. They require less extensive infrastructural investments. Still, continuous supervision and improvements are needed to ensure the quality of the treatment units since they are known to have comparably low removal efficiencies (Kerstens et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2015</a>). It is also important to provide local communities with regular assistance in using and maintenancing these services.
