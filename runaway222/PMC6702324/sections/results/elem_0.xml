 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most prevalent crop quality parameters in the literature addressing the study question were total phenolic concentration, catechin content [including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin (EGC), and catechin gallate (CG)], and antioxidant activity. Other prevalent quality parameters include caffeine, theaflavin, thearubigin, tannins, carotenoids, terpene alcohols (i.e., linalool and geraniol) and other aromatic volatiles, fatty acid composition, chlorophyll, glycoside precursors, proanthocyanidin, and lipoxygenase and glycosidase enzymatic activities. Overall, increases in the aforementioned secondary metabolites is associated with increased crop quality until a specific threshold for human flavor preference when a further increase is no longer considered desirable. Total color, brightness, and flavor of brewed tea were measured as organoleptic quality parameters linked to secondary metabolite concentrations. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and colorimetric spectrophotometry assays were the most prevalent methods for analyzing tea quality.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reviewed studies were carried out in a range of tea producing and consuming countries (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). In addition, the studies included a wide range of different tea cultivars of the 
  <span class="italic">assamica</span> and 
  <span class="italic">sinensis</span> varieties of 
  <span class="italic">Camellia sinensis</span> including AC-259, T-78, B-157, B-777, S-449, UPASI-9, UP-2, UP-3, UP-8, BSS-2, TV-23, TV-25, TV-26, ZC108, ZC302, LJ 43, Derepazari 7, Fener, Yulan, and Fudingdaba. However, many of studies did not specify the variety, cultivar, or landrace of the tea examined. The lack of information on the variety of tea as well as the broad range of cultivars examined prevented analysis of the response of tea plants to environmental variables on the basis of tea variety and cultivar.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One-fifth (18 of 86) of the studies reviewed assessed the effects of seasonality factors on tea quality including change of harvest season between spring, summer, autumn, and winter harvest seasons or shifts between dry and wet seasons as well as bud burst (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2</a>; 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" href="#SM2">Supplementary Table 2</a>). The main seasonality factor examined was comparing the spring harvest to either the summer, monsoon, autumn, and winter, with a comparison between the spring and monsoon season being the most prevalent seasonal comparator. The spring tea harvest season is generally the first harvest season that follows winter dormancy in direct response to increased temperatures (Ahmed and Stepp, 
   <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">2012</a>). The main quality parameters measured in reviewed studies on seasonality were phenolic secondary metabolites (including individual catechin compounds) and / or antioxidant activity (14 studies), followed by volatile metabolites (4 studies), and caffeine (a methylxanthine compound; 4 studies).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fourteen seasonality studies demonstrated that concentrations of individual catechins, phenolic secondary metabolites, and / or antioxidant activity decreased with a seasonal shift from the spring and/or first tea harvest to other seasons, particularly the monsoon season (Sud and Baru,

   <a rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" href="#B105">2014</a>). Phenolic catechin compounds are generally associated with high tea quality; however, relatively high concentrations of particular phenolics are linked to a bitter or astringent taste that is generally less desired by consumers (Ahmed et al., 
   <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2014b</a>). Two seasonal studies showed that while some phenolic secondary metabolites, and/or antioxidant activity decreased with a seasonal shift from the spring and / or first tea harvest to other seasons, other secondary metabolites and / or antioxidant activity increased. Ahmed et al. (
   <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2014b</a>) demonstrated that concentrations of desirable phenolic catechins were up to 50% lower during the beginning of the monsoon season compared to the spring, while total phenolic concentrations and antioxidant activity increased.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The four seasonality studies measuring tea volatiles demonstrated that some volatile compounds increased with the seasonal transition from the spring and/or first tea harvest and that other compounds decreased (Saikia and Mahanta,

   <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">2014</a>) demonstrated that the number and concentration of over 300 volatile compounds from 18 chemical families either increased, decreased, or stayed the same with the onset of the monsoon from the spring season. This study showed that in general the spring season has a greater number and higher concentration of volatiles associated with high tea quality (Kowalsick et al., 
   <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">2014</a>). Three studies showed that caffeine concentrations decreased with a transition from the spring season to the summer monsoon season (Akhlas, 
   <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">2003</a>; Ansari et al., 
   <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">2011</a>; Ahmed et al., 
   <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2014b</a>) and one study found caffeine to increase during the summer (Saito et al., 
   <a rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94">2007</a>). One study provided evidence of an increase in amino acids with the transition from the spring to the summer monsoon (Saikia and Mahanta, 
   <a rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" href="#B93">2002</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Six of the 14 seasonality studies provided evidence that while some quality parameters decreased with a shift in season, other measures of quality increased (Saikia and Mahanta,

   <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">2008</a>) found that total content of glycosidic bound flavor compounds was highest during early growth flush (April—mid June), declined during rains (mid June—September), and exhibited recovery during the backend flush (mid September—November). The authors further found an increase in the terpene index and a decrease in terpenoid/non-terpenoid ratio during the rains due to a marked decrease in terpenoid compounds (mainly aromatic geraniol). Jayasekera et al. (
   <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">2011</a>) found that variation of tea quality on the basis of season was further dependent on geographic location with some plantations having higher quality during the dry season and others having higher quality during the monsoon.

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" href="#SM3">Supplementary Table 3</a>). Five of these studies showed an increase in phenolic compounds and/or antioxidant activity with drought stress (Hernández et al.,

   <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">2006</a>) found that phenolics (including epicatechin and epigallocatechin gallate) accumulated in drought-stressed tea plants. Cheruiyot et al. (
   <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">2007</a>) found that declining soil water content over a 12-week period significantly reduced growth and total polyphenolic concentrations in tea shoots depending on cultivar type. Chakraborty et al. (
   <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">2002</a>) highlight that while phenolic secondary metabolites initially increase with drought stress, they decrease during extended drought stress.

   <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">2011</a>) observed that different forms of Mg had differential effects on catechin and carotenoid content of tea leaves. Increasing the supply of available N in soil was found to increased amino acid content of tea leaves (Venkatesan et al., 
   <a rid="B113" ref-type="bibr" href="#B113">2005</a>; Ruan et al.,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While this review did not retrieve any studies on the effects of carbon dioxide on tea quality, we summarize one recent study outside of the time frame of our review. Li et al. (
   <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">2017</a>) found that there was a significant increase in concentrations of total catechins and other polyphenols along with theanine and free amino acids with elevated carbon dioxide. Concurrently, levels of caffeine decreased (Li et al., 
   <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">2017</a>). These chemical findings are in sync with expression levels of biosynthetic genes for catechins and theanine that were up-regulated in tea leaves under elevated carbon dioxide levels while levels of biosynthetic genes for caffeine were down-regulated.
