 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA; Moher et al., 
  <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">2009</a>) and the Guidelines for Systematic Review and Environmental Synthesis in Environmental Management (Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, 
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">2013</a>) were applied to design a systematic review protocol to collect evidence on the following closed-frame study question: 
  <span class="italic">What are effects of environmental variation related to climate change on tea quality?</span> We used the PICO (Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparator, Outcome) framework elements (Schardt et al., 
  <a rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" href="#B96">2007</a>) to structure our systematic review.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The biological population/study unit is tea (
  <span class="italic">Camellia sinensis</span> L.; Theaceae). The intervention/exposure that we examined is environmental variability linked to climate change, which includes variables including temperature, precipitation, elevation, seasonality, location, herbivory, soil, and solar radiation. As we found a lack of published studies directly examining climate effects on tea quality based on our preliminary review, we included environmental factors that vary with global change in systematic review search protocol. The comparator assessed in our review was variation in a specific environmental variable from a baseline evaluation or other comparison. The outcomes that we examined were impacts on the biochemical parameter of tea quality including secondary metabolite chemistry that consists of phenolic catechins, methylxanthines (including caffeine), amino acids (including theanine), and a range of volatile compounds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A multidisciplinary team of subject experts and a review methodology expert collaboratively designed the systematic review protocol. Specifically, the multidisciplinary team of subject experts included scientists with expertise in the fields of plant biology, chemistry, soil science, herbivory, phytochemistry, biochemistry, agronomy, food science, tea science, and climate change. Establishment of the review protocol involved preliminary scoping of search terms to test the search strategy for indication of the volume of relevant literature. Search terms were identified and revised during an iterative process after examining relevant articles from the search and refining search terms to meet both evidence needs as well as feasibility for a systematic review. Following are the key components of the final search terms that included a combination of tea, environmental factor linked to climate change, and quality parameter: “tea OR camellia sinensis” AND “climate change OR global warming OR season OR solar radiation OR precipitation OR geographic area OR temperature OR soil OR wind OR annual bud burst OR carbon dioxide” AND “antioxidant OR caffeine OR phytochemical OR catechin OR theaflavin OR flavonol OR polyphenol OR secondary metabolite.” 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Supplementary Table 1</a> lists the final search terms used in this systematic review. The final search terms were tested with a set of known relevant articles.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of five publication databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO GreenFILE, Scopus, and, Agricola. Databases were selected that are commonly used to search for articles in the areas of food systems, agriculture, climate change, secondary metabolite chemistry, and human health. Inclusion criteria were restricted to peer-review articles published in the English language from 2000 to 2015. The software program Covidence was used to manage articles identified within the publication databases and was further used for screening of articles. Following the search, the retrieved articles were screened by a review panel of three reviewers (KS, MH, and SA) to minimize reviewer bias in identifying articles for their relevance to the review question using 
  <span class="italic">a-priori</span> inclusion criteria. Two reviewers from the review panel screened each article. Decision discrepancies (inclusion or exclusion) were discussed by the entire panel for resolution. The final set of articles was critically appraised for their design on focusing on environmental effects on tea quality.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The final set of articles in the study was read by a separate data extraction review panel (DK, DS, and AL). Appropriate data from each of these articles were extracted by one of three members of the data extraction panel and placed into a table highlighting specific study parameters including environmental factor, variety and cultivar of tea, quality indicator, method(s) of analysis, and outcomes. A second member on the data extraction panel reviewed extracted data in the table to verify that appropriate data was extracted.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The final search resulted in the retrieval of 9,750 articles including 1,754 duplicates for a total of 7,996 articles (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10" href="#SM10">Supplementary Figure 1</a>). From this, 93 articles were identified by the review panel for inclusion in the review. These articles were relevant to the review question using our 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> inclusion criteria. Nine of these articles were removed from the search because it was not possible to retrieve the full text of these papers, resulting in a total of 84 articles that were included in the synthesis of our systematic review.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each article included in the study was grouped on the basis of which environmental factor(s) were assessed in the study, and then placed in a corresponding table of the most prevalent environmental factors that emerged from the systematic review. Articles were placed in multiple tables if they examine multiple environmental variables. For each environmental factor table, we applied a coding framework to quantify the number of articles that demonstrated directional changes (increase, decrease, or no change) of specific tea quality parameters. Specifically, we quantified the following quality parameters: (1) increase, decrease, or no change in catechins and other phenolic compounds with an increase in [environmental factor, i.e., temperature], (2) increase, decrease, or no change in catechins and other phenolic compounds with a decrease in [environmental factor, i.e., temperature], (3) increase, decrease, or no change in caffeine with an increase in [environmental factor, i.e., temperature], (4) increase, decrease, or no change in caffeine with a decrease in [environmental factor, i.e., temperature], (5) increase, decrease, or no change in terpenoids and other volatiles with an increase in [environmental factor, i.e., temperature], (6) increase, decrease, or no change in terpenoids and other volatiles with a decrease in [environmental factor, i.e., temperature], (7) increase, decrease, or no change in amino acids with an increase in [environmental factor, i.e., temperature] and, (8) increase, decrease, or no change in amino acids with a decrease in [environmental factor, i.e., temperature]. Unfortunately, as the studies used different measures of crop quality and variable experimental designs, we were unable to quantitatively compare between studies. Three reviewers (DS, DK, and SA) coded the outcomes for each article to ensure there were no discrepancies. The resulting data were summarized into a narrative synthesis and a quantitative synthesis.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some environmental factors were merged together due to their relatedness and presentation in the literature. Geographic area was separated from altitude as it was presented separately in the literature. While the systematic review did not identify a study on carbon dioxide effects on tea quality, we summarize a recent study outside of the time frame as this is a critical abiotic stressor associated with climate change. Those studies that included multiple variables were analyzed individually for all relevant environmental factors.</p>
