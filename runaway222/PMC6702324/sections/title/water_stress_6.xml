 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 10 studies examined responses of tea plants to low water availability, including drought stress and soil moisture content (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3</a>; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" href="#SM3">Supplementary Table 3</a>). Five of these studies showed an increase in phenolic compounds and/or antioxidant activity with drought stress (Hernández et al., 
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">2006</a>; Upadhyaya et al., 
  <a rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109">2011</a>, 
  <a rid="B107" ref-type="bibr" href="#B107">2013</a>; Ahmed et al., 
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">2013</a>; Bhattacharya et al., 
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">2014</a>) while two studies showed a decrease in these compounds (Cheruiyot et al., 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">2007</a>, 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">2008</a>) and two other studies showed both an increase and decrease in these compounds with drought stress (Chakraborty et al., 
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">2002</a>; Upadhyaya and Panda, 
  <a rid="B108" ref-type="bibr" href="#B108">2004</a>). Hernández et al. (
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">2006</a>) found that phenolics (including epicatechin and epigallocatechin gallate) accumulated in drought-stressed tea plants. Cheruiyot et al. (
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">2007</a>) found that declining soil water content over a 12-week period significantly reduced growth and total polyphenolic concentrations in tea shoots depending on cultivar type. Chakraborty et al. (
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">2002</a>) highlight that while phenolic secondary metabolites initially increase with drought stress, they decrease during extended drought stress.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One water stress study examined the effect of drought stress on levels of volatile compounds (Cao et al., 
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">2007</a>). Cao et al. (
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">2007</a>) showed that the number of aromatic constituents in fresh tea leaves was highest under a soil water content of 54% (relative to field capacity) and lowest under a soil relative water content of 100%. None of the water stress studies examined the effects of water stress on caffeine levels in tea.
