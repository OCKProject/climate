  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F8" href="#F8">Figure 8</a>; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM8" href="#SM8">Supplementary Table 8</a>) found an inverse relationship between temperature and tea quality on the basis of catechins, phenolic secondary metabolites, and antioxidant compounds/activity (Lee et al., 
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">2010</a>; Wang et al., 
  <a rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116">2011</a>; Wei et al., 
  <a rid="B117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B117">2011</a>) while one study showed that increased temperature resulted in increased catechin compounds (Yao et al., 
  <a rid="B123" ref-type="bibr" href="#B123">2005</a>). Wei et al. (
  <a rid="B117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B117">2011</a>) showed that higher catechin content was related to lower temperatures (same as higher elevation). Yao et al. (
  <a rid="B123" ref-type="bibr" href="#B123">2005</a>) showed that tea quality as determined by key catechin compounds [(-)-epigallocatechin gallate, (-)-epicatechin gallate, and catechin gallate] was higher during warm months and lower during cool months. Wang et al. (
  <a rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116">2011</a>) showed that increased temperatures were associated with an increase in (-)-epigallocatechin, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epicatechin gallate, and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate while catechin (C) decreased. Only one temperature study examined caffeine levels in tea (Lee et al., 
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">2010</a>). Lee et al. (
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">2010</a>) showed that green tea samples grown at high temperature had lower levels of caffeine and catechin compounds compared to those at lower temperature.
