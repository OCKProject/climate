 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies demonstrate that higher elevation is generally associated with higher tea quality as measured by higher levels of catechins and other polyphenols as well as caffeine (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6</a>; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6" href="#SM6">Supplementary Table 6</a>). Four studies found that tea catechins and other polyphenols increased with elevation (associated with cooler temperatures and higher oxidative stress) (Akhlas, 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">2003</a>; Abeywickrama et al., 
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">2010</a>, 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2011</a>; Ohno et al., 
  <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">2011</a>) and one study found lower catechin levels with higher elevation (Chen et al., 
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">2014</a>). Three studies found that caffeine was higher in tea cultivated at higher elevation as compared to lower elevation (Akhlas, 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">2003</a>; Abeywickrama et al., 
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">2010</a>; Ohno et al., 
  <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">2011</a>) and one study found lower caffeine levels with higher elevation (Abeywickrama et al., 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2011</a>). One study demonstrated that amino acid levels increase with higher elevation compared to lower elevation (Ohno et al., 
  <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">2011</a>) while one study found that amino acids were higher for lower elevation tea samples (Abeywickrama et al., 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2011</a>). One recent study (not included in this review) demonstrated an increase in favorable aromatic compounds that have sweet, floral, and honey-like notes with an increase in elevation while exhibiting a decrease in caffeine, epicatechin gallate, gallocatechin, and catechin (Kfoury et al., 
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">2018</a>).
