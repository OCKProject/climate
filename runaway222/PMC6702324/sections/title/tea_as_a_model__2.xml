 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This review article employs tea (
  <span class="italic">Camelia sinensis</span>; Theaceae) to understand how climate change impacts crop quality of a culturally-relevant beverage plant. Tea, the botanical source of all white, green, oolong, black and pu-erh tea beverages, was selected as a study system because of its prevalence in diets globally, its production in over 50 countries on five continents (FAOSTAT, 
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">2016</a>), and because it is a plant that is cultivated for its quality based on secondary metabolites (Ahmed et al., 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">2010</a>). Polyphenolic catechin, methylxanthine (i.e., caffeine), and volatile secondary metabolites, coupled with carbohydrates and amino acids, contribute to tea quality through influencing the flavor and appearance of tea (Drewnowski and Gomez-Carneros, 
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">2000</a>; Scharbert et al., 
  <a rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95">2004</a>) as well as its health claims including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, neuro-protective, cardio-protective, anti-cancer, anti-microbial, and anti-atherosclerotic activities (Trevisanato and Kim, 
  <a rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" href="#B106">2000</a>; Lin et al., 
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">2003</a>; Clement, 
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">2009</a>). Tea is further suitable as a study system to examine the effects of climate change because it is a woody perennial that experiences multiple decadal effects of climate change. Successful tea cultivation tea is dependent on climatic conditions including temperature, rainfall, humidity, and solar radiation (Wijeratne, 
  <a rid="B118" ref-type="bibr" href="#B118">1996</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marx et al. (
  <a rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74">2017</a>) identified 14 articles highlighting that shifts in rainfall and solar radiation influence tea yields and quality with implications for farmer livelihoods. For example, Biggs et al. (
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">2018</a>) demonstrate that climate change is impacting farmer livelihoods across four major tea-growing regions of Assam, India. Boehm et al. (
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">2016</a>) show that a decrease in solar radiation in the previous growing season is associated with lower tea yields. However, the literature is missing a systematic review that synthesizes the evidence of environmental effects on tea quality and, the directionality of changes in quality parameters.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study addresses the aforementioned knowledge gap through a systematic literature review that examines the following question: 
  <span class="italic">What are effects of environmental variation related to climate change on tea quality?</span> Given the lack of studies examining long-term effects of climate change on tea quality, we synthesize studies that examine the effects of environmental factors that are shifting with climate change. This review can inform future research by identifying literature gaps and new research questions while serving as a model for literature reviews on climate change effects on crop quality.
