 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Impacts of climate change on agricultural systems threaten crops with notable implications for farmer livelihoods and human health (Odada et al., 
  <a rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80">2008</a>; Pachauri et al., 
  <a rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83">2014</a>; Campbell et al., 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">2016</a>). Since the 1950s, agricultural systems have experienced gradual systematic changes in average climate conditions including unprecedented multi-decadal warming, increased inter-annual variability of the Earth's surface temperatures, changes in average precipitation, greater weather variability, and more extreme weather conditions (Pachauri et al., 
  <a rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83">2014</a>). These climatic changes have decreased agricultural productivity and shifted the geographic range of many crops (Lobell and Asner, 
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">2003</a>; Porter and Semenov, 
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">2005</a>). Concurrently, productivity of some crops has increased with a rise in temperatures (Ewert et al., 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2005</a>). Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO
  <sub>2</sub>) has decreases concentrations of micronutrients zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) as well as protein for C
  <sub>3</sub> grains and legumes (Myers et al., 
  <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">2014</a>). While the literature provides substantial evidence on the impact of climate change on crop yields (Lobell and Asner, 
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">2003</a>; Hertel et al., 
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">2010</a>; Lobell et al., 
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">2011</a>), fewer studies have focused on the effects of climate change on crop quality (Porter and Semenov, 
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">2005</a>; Ahmed and Stepp, 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2016</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crop quality is a multi-dimensional parameter that refers to the nutritional, health, and sensory attributes of crops as measured by the presence, absence, and/or concentrations of phytonutrients, minerals, and primary and secondary metabolites (i.e., bioactive food components or phytochemicals) as well as associated bioactivity, shelf life, and organoleptic properties (i.e., color, visual appeal, aroma, taste, and texture) (Mattos et al., 
  <a rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75">2014</a>; Ahmed and Stepp, 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2016</a>). Secondary metabolites are non-nutrient plant constituents that impact crop quality through an influence on flavor, appearance, stability (Tomás-Barberán and Espin, 
  <a rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" href="#B103">2001</a>) and health-promoting attributes including mitigating micronutrient deficiencies (Johns and Sthapit, 
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">2004</a>) and the risk of diet-related chronic disease including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes (Liu, 
  <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">2013</a>). Over 100,000 secondary metabolites have been identified in five chemical classes including phenolics, terpenes, alkaloids, and other nitrogen-containing compounds, phytosterols, and organosulfur compounds (Goldberg, 
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">2003</a>; Swift et al., 
  <a rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" href="#B102">2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants have evolved secondary metabolites to protect themselves from various abiotic and biotic stressors (Fraenkel, 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">1959</a>; Coley et al., 
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">1985</a>). Since the synthesis of secondary metabolites represents a metabolic cost, plants tend to produce these compounds in notable concentrations if they have the ecological cue to do so based on interactions between environmental (Lower and Orians, 
  <a rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73">2003</a>; Björkman et al., 
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">2011</a>; Kowalsick et al., 
  <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">2014</a>), agricultural (Ahmed et al., 
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">2013</a>), genetic (van-Dam and Vrieling, 
  <a rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110">1994</a>), and physiological factors (Coley et al., 
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">1985</a>; Glynn et al., 
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">2007</a>). Each crop has specific secondary metabolites that characterize crop quality while the presence of other secondary metabolites is viewed as deleterious for crop quality due to off-flavors or toxicity attributes. Climate change factors have resulted in a decrease of multiple secondary metabolites in a range of food and beverage crops including coffee (Villarreal et al., 
  <a rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" href="#B115">2009</a>), tea (Ahmed et al., 
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">2014a</a>,
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">b</a>; Kowalsick et al., 
  <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">2014</a>), grapes (Xu et al., 
  <a rid="B120" ref-type="bibr" href="#B120">2011</a>), brown rice (Britz et al., 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">2007</a>), kale (Zietz et al., 
  <a rid="B126" ref-type="bibr" href="#B126">2010</a>), tomatoes (Kacjan-Maršič et al., 
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">2010</a>), and peanuts (Casini et al., 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">2003</a>).
