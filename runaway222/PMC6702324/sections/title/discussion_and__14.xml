 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the majority of research examining the effects of climate change on food systems has focused on crop yields (Lobell and Asner, 
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">2003</a>; Hertel et al., 
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">2010</a>; Lobell et al., 
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">2011</a>), this systematic literature review highlights that multiple environmental variables linked to climate change also significantly impact crop quality as measured by secondary metabolites associated with flavor attributes and health claims for human consumers (Wolfe et al., 
  <a rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" href="#B119">2008</a>; Liu, 
  <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">2013</a>). Specifically, findings provide evidence that shifts in seasonality, water stress, geography, light factors, altitude, herbivory and microbes, temperature, and soil factors that are linked to climate change can result in both increases and decreases up to 50% in secondary metabolites. A gap was found regarding evidence on the direct effects of carbon dioxide on tea quality, highlighting a critical research area for future study. The reviewed studies provides evidence that environmental factors linked to climate change can result in changes in the following biochemical measures of tea quality: phenolic catechins (i.e., epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, and catechin gallate), total phenolic concentration, antioxidant activity, caffeine, theaflavin, thearubigin, tannins, carotenoids, terpene alcohols (i.e., linalool and geraniol) and other aromatic volatiles, fatty acids, chlorophyll, enzymes, and enzymatic activities. It is important to note that while an increase in many secondary metabolites represents an increase in crop quality, it may represent a decrease in crop quality for other secondary metabolites including those with off flavors or whose increased consumption by human consumers may result in toxicity (Kfoury et al., 
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">2018</a>). While this systematic review provides evidence that multiple environmental parameters are impacting tea quality, the directionality and magnitude of these impacts is not clear with contradictory evidence between studies. Findings build on a recent literature review highlighting the importance of understanding climate change effects on tea production (Marx et al., 
  <a rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74">2017</a>) by providing evidence on the multi-directionality of changes in crop quality in response to shifts in environmental factors that are shifting with global change. As crop quality is a key determinant of health in the food system, findings have broader implications for other culturally-relevant crops managed and used by people for food, medicinal, and aesthetic purposes including fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and beverage crops (Ahmed and Stepp, 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The environmental factors with the most consistent evidence in this systematic review were seasonality and water stress. Specifically, a total of 14 out of 18 studies (78%) demonstrated a decrease in concentrations of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with a seasonal shift from the spring and /or first tea harvest to other seasons. Seven out of ten studies (70%) showed an increase in levels of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with drought stress. However, for both seasonality and water stress, multiple studies highlighted that while some secondary metabolite compounds increase, other compounds decrease, pointing to the complexity of understanding tea quality. Based on the evidence regarding seasonality and geographic variability highlighted in this study, tea quality is likely to increase during some parts of the year in some geographic areas with climate change (i.e., during periods of drought) while decreasing at other times of the year (i.e., during extended monsoon periods). However, if drought stress exceeds moisture thresholds of tea plants in a warming world, productivity will be jeopardized.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herbivory and soil fertility were two of the variables that showed the greatest contradictory evidence with mixed impacts on tea quality. A surprising finding was that while many crop species are inhibited by high levels of soluble aluminum (Al) in the soil, we found multiple studies that demonstrated that Al not only stimulated tea growth (Mukhopadyay et al., 
  <a rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78">2012</a>), but also phytochemical concentration associated with high-quality tea (Chen et al., 
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">2011</a>; Duan et al., 
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">2012</a>; Sae-Lee et al., 
  <a rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92">2012</a>; Hajiboland et al., 
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">2013</a>). Both herbivory and soil fertility are variables which farmers have the greatest control over, pointing to the importance of agricultural management for climate mitigation and adaptation. Farmers can respond at some capacity to climate-driven shifts on crop quality at the level of individual fields or farms. However, beyond specific thresholds, adaptation would require geographic shifts in production, yet these thresholds are largely unknown for crop quality.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contradictory evidence found in this systematic review likely results from multiple confounding factors associated with each study including variation in tea variety, cultivar, specific environmental and agricultural management conditions, and differences in methods that make comparisons across studies difficult. For example, previous research indicates that different varieties and cultivars of a specific species such as tea may respond variably to the same environmental factor such as seasonality (Owuor and Chavanji, 
  <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">1986</a>). Owuor and Chavanji (
  <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">1986</a>) found that seasonal fluctuations variably impacted the caffeine content of tea plants depending on the type of clone. Controlled experiments are called for that examine the impacts of specific environmental factors on multiple tea varieties and cultivars including climate resilient cultivars. In addition, future research efforts should focus on not just understanding the implications of individual factors on specific attributes of crops, but on modeling the system-wide impacts of simultaneous changes on crop biological systems to better understand the long-term implications of climate change. This includes understanding complex interactions of crops with the environment including dynamic feedback loops in which the presence and concentrations of secondary metabolites are impacted by a cascade of abiotic and biotic conditions such as changes in precipitation, temperature, and pests (Fields and Orians, 
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">2006</a>; Schepp, 
  <a rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97">2009</a>). Research is further needed to analyze the quality of studies included in this systematic review and similar reviews regarding the effects of climate-related changes on crop quality.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The overall lack of consistency in evidence for climate-driven effects on tea quality, coupled with our inability to quantitatively compare study outcomes because of a lack of comparable measures and information on tea variety, points to the challenge of measuring crop quality and the multidimensional nature and complexity of this parameter. One way to overcome this challenge is to design more widely agreed upon international standards of crop quality for different culturally and economically relevant crops along with implementing global collaborative projects with shared experimental designs to allow for comparison of outcomes across multiple studies on crop quality through space and time.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the lack of studies examining the interplay of multiple environmental factors on tea quality highlights the need for an ecosystems approach in examining multi-trophic interactions in tea systems as well as implications for consumers and farmer livelihoods. Further research is needed to analyze the quality of studies included in this systematic review. While our synthesis contributes to elucidating the directionality of changes in tea quality in response to environmental change, we were unable to quantitatively compare study outcomes because of a lack of comparable measures. Future work to develop standardized protocols for measuring crop quality to enable monitoring of this parameter and comparisons between studies is also needed.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multiple agricultural, physiological, and molecular innovations have been identified toward the development of climate resilient tea systems (Ahmed, 
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">2018</a>). At the agricultural level, climate mitigation strategies for tea farms include agricultural diversification, tree planting and maintaining vegetative cover, management of soil organic matter and carbon sequestration, water management, controlling pests and disease, and migration and relocating agroecosystems to more suitable locations (Ahmed and Stepp, 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2016</a>; Ahmed, 
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">2018</a>). Physiological and molecular innovations for enhancing climate resilience of tea farms include: (1) cultivation of tea from seed versus from clonal propagules, (2) micropropagation, (3) traditional breeding methods of climate-smart cultivars, (4) genetically modified crops and, (5) sustainable intensification (Ahmed, 
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">2018</a>). Traditional breeding methods of climate-smart tea cultivars including those with enhanced resistance to climate variability such as extreme drought, early- maturing varieties, and biofortified crops that accumulate more minerals and vitamins (Ahmed, 
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">2018</a>). Research is needed to measure the effectiveness of these strategies for enhancing the resilience of shifts in crop quality to climate change. While farmers can respond at some capacity to climate-driven shifts on crop quality at the level of individual fields or farms, changes beyond specific ecological and physiological thresholds would require geographic shifts in production. Future research is called for to elucidate what these thresholds are for crop quality for a range of staple and nutrient-dense crops that support food security and human health.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These findings have notable implications for the sustainability and resilience of agricultural systems in the context of global environmental change. Thus, it is essential to develop and implement evidence-based adaptation strategies for growing crops in ways that are resilient to climate change and support both environmental and human well-being. Based on our reflections on lessons learnt from this systematic review, we recommend the following next steps for advancing the understanding of climate change effects on crop quality as well as for responding to this challenge:</p>
