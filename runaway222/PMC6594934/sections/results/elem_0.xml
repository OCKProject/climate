  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the temperature control of gas solubility, a future warmer ocean will, on average, dissolve less oxygen. Our numerical model employing a business-as-usual emissions scenario with the emission peak in 2100 and a linear decline of emissions to zero in year 2300 (see “Methods”), simulates a rise in global-mean ocean temperatures by 3.1 °C above pre-industrial until year 3380 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). The associated solubility changes explain an oxygen decline by 27 Pmol (or 9%), as shown by the abiotic oxygen tracer (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). This amounts to about half the simulated total oxygen loss at the time of the O
   <sub>2</sub>-inventory minimum (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) and persists until the end of our experiment.

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). Explanations for such a recovery include a shift to enhanced deep-water formation in the southern hemisphere and an associated shoaling of the overturning circulation associated with North Atlantic Deep Water by about 1000 m. This shoaling also explains the increase in globally-averaged ideal age in spite of more vigorous overturning (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). Ideal age increases by a few hundred years at mid-depth in the North Atlantic and Pacific Ocean (Fig.

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Net community production (NCP) describes the surplus of primary production over all respiratory processes in the euphotic zone, which, on annual and longer time scales and global space scales corresponds to the organic matter exported from surface water. NCP initially declines by 12% until year 2145, then recovers, and eventually exceeds pre-industrial levels by about 3% (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). The minimum in NCP occurs just when the strength of the meridional overturning circulation is at its minimum (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). Once NCP increases again, the suboxic (O
   <sub>2</sub> &lt; 5 μM) volume starts to expand almost threefold within a few centuries (black curve, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). Consequently, pelagic denitrification and, with a time lag of about 25 years, nitrogen fixation both increase and eventually level off at global rates about twice the pre-industrial rates (green and blue curves, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). At the end of the simulation, nitrogen fixation accounts for about 20% of the global NCP, compared to about 10% in year 2000.

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>. The actually modelled oxygen increase (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) can only arise from spatially inhomogeneous changes of temperature, ventilation, respiration, or other processes not yet considered. Indeed, changes in respiratory oxygen consumption via aerobic remineralisation of detritus show a systematic shift of enhanced export and subsequent remineralisation towards high latitudes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3g, h</a>) linked to more efficient nutrient utilisation via improved light conditions due to disappearing summer sea-ice and more stable stratification. Interestingly, particle export and subsequent remineralisation are also enhanced in the upper hundred metres of the subtropical gyres, while there is a general decline of respiration in less well ventilated deeper waters (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3h</a>). In the model, this results from faster—and hence shallower—remineralisation at higher temperatures, leading to enhanced nutrient recycling in the upper ocean.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Accumulation of oxygen deficits</div>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although total respiration shows a slight increase, the oceanic storage of the respiratory oxygen deficit, measured here as true oxygen utilization (TOU
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span>), is decreased considerably in the simulated future ocean. For the first few hundred years of our simulation, TOU increases ((−1)*TOU decreases, green line in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). This is because of the longer residence time of upwelled waters in the more stratified surface waters allowing for a more complete biotic utilisation of surface nutrients, and elevated oxygen consumption during subsequent remineralisation in the ocean interior. TOU decreases ((−1)*TOU increases) after year 2630 and eventually the global TOU inventory becomes lower than the pre-industrial one. The total reduction in TOU amounts to an oxygen gain of 29 Pmol by the end of the simulation. This more than compensates the warming-driven oxygen loss from solubility changes of 24 Pmol, yielding a net oxygen surplus of 4.6 Pmol. This extra oxygen must enter the ocean via air-sea exchange. Indeed, the cumulative air-sea oxygen flux into the ocean by the end of the simulation (5.1 Pmol, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>, black line) very closely matches the combined oxygen loss via warming-induced solubility change and the oxygen gain by the decrease of TOU (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>, dashed cyan line).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effects of nitrogen imbalances</div>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oxygen gained via air-sea gas exchange explains, however, only about one third of the total increase in the oceanic oxygen inventory (13.4 Pmol, i.e. 6% of today’s ocean O
   <sub>2</sub> inventory Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>, blue line). Almost two thirds of it must therefore be from an oxygen source located in the ocean interior. Interior-ocean oxygen sources are photosynthesis, specifically, the net balance of oxygenic photosynthesis minus respiration, and processes reducing the oxidation state of nitrogen and other compounds. For everything else unchanged, a switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration will cause a left-over of, and hence increase in, dissolved oxygen. Total marine oxygen may thus be saved by the utilization of an oxidant other than oxygen, like in denitrification, or it may be spent by oxidising an external source of reduced nitrogen, like in N
   <sub>2</sub>-fixation and subsequent nitrification of the newly added N. In our simulation the strong increase in pelagic denitrification together with the time-lagged increase in N
   <sub>2</sub>-fixation cause a net loss of the ocean’s fixed nitrogen (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). Any net conversion, and loss, of nitrate to N
   <sub>2</sub> via denitrification corresponds to a net gain of oxygen (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) because no oxygen is consumed in it. Anaerobic remineralization via denitrification of organic matter containing one mole of organic nitrogen avoids the consumption of 10.6 moles of oxygen while removing 7.48 moles of NO
   <sub>3</sub> (ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
   </span>). Thus, for each mole of nitrate lost, about 1.4 moles of oxygen are gained. Denitrification is hence an implicit source of oxygen to the ocean. The reverse applies to N
   <sub>2</sub>-fixation which is hence an oxygen sink for the ocean. What matters globally is the cumulative balance of denitrification and N
   <sub>2</sub>-fixation, that is the change in the global nitrate inventory. The total simulated nitrate loss of 6.2 Pmol NO
   <sub>3</sub>, i.e. about 17% of the present-day ocean’s nitrate inventory (green curve Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>), corresponds to an oxygen gain of 8.8 Pmol O
   <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>), which is about 4% of the present ocean oxygen inventory.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sulfate reduction to hydrogen sulfide, not considered in the model, would save still more oxygen in the water column. However, unless outgassing to the atmosphere, hydrogen sulfide would most likely quickly be re-oxidised in the oxic waters surrounding the respective anoxic region, cancelling the initial oxygen gain. Not resolving the marine sulfur cycle, we cannot quantify to what extent the reaction of H
   <sub>2</sub>S with NO
   <sub>3</sub>, the formation of elemental sulfur, or the burial of FeS might modify this picture. Other processes that may affect oxygen, but are not explicitly accounted for in this model configuration, are burial and denitrification in the sediments as well as the release of sedimentary phosphate and iron under expanding oxygen-deficient regions

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The enhanced loss of fixed nitrogen via denitrification can only lead to a sustained net decline in the ocean’s inventory of fixed nitrogen, because nitrogen fixation only partly compensates the nitrogen loss. This, apparently, is contrary to the geochemical view that, on long timescales, nitrogen fixation feeds back on nitrogen losses and ‘nitrate gets topped up when scarce relative to phosphate’ (ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span>). In our simulation, nitrogen fixation is performed by diazotrophs with a maximum growth rate less than half of that of ordinary phytoplankton and zero growth at temperatures lower than 15 °C, but not limited by fixed nitrogen

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). The initial delay is consistent with the time it takes for water to upwell from the oxygen minimum zones (with denitrification) to the surface

   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). Areas of enhanced denitrification, however, remain located in the tropical oceans (Fig.

   </span>) that measures the nitrate excess relative to the stoichiometric equivalent of phosphate, are simulated in regions of ongoing denitrification in the tropical oceans, whereas positive N* values are found in the surface waters of the tropical and subtropical oceans, roughly coinciding with areas of nitrogen fixation (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). Surface waters at high latitudes, particularly in the Southern Ocean, and almost all of the deep ocean waters, however, display negative N* values. This illustrates that part of the denitrification signature is upwelled in the Southern Ocean, where high nutrient levels and low surface temperatures and light levels do not present favourable conditions for nitrogen fixation. Deep-water formation south of the Southern Ocean biogeochemical divide
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
   </span> ensures that any upwelled low-N* waters can be transported into the deep ocean without supporting nitrogen fixation. It thereby acts as a loophole through which denitrification-induced nitrogen deficits can escape the surface-ocean nitrogen-fixation feedback and preserve significant oceanic nitrate deficits in the ocean interior.
