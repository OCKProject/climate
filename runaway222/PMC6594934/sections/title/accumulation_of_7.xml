 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although total respiration shows a slight increase, the oceanic storage of the respiratory oxygen deficit, measured here as true oxygen utilization (TOU
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>), is decreased considerably in the simulated future ocean. For the first few hundred years of our simulation, TOU increases ((−1)*TOU decreases, green line in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). This is because of the longer residence time of upwelled waters in the more stratified surface waters allowing for a more complete biotic utilisation of surface nutrients, and elevated oxygen consumption during subsequent remineralisation in the ocean interior. TOU decreases ((−1)*TOU increases) after year 2630 and eventually the global TOU inventory becomes lower than the pre-industrial one. The total reduction in TOU amounts to an oxygen gain of 29 Pmol by the end of the simulation. This more than compensates the warming-driven oxygen loss from solubility changes of 24 Pmol, yielding a net oxygen surplus of 4.6 Pmol. This extra oxygen must enter the ocean via air-sea exchange. Indeed, the cumulative air-sea oxygen flux into the ocean by the end of the simulation (5.1 Pmol, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>, black line) very closely matches the combined oxygen loss via warming-induced solubility change and the oxygen gain by the decrease of TOU (Fig.
