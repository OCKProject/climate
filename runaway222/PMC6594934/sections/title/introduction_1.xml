 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the effects of climate change on the ocean, deoxygenation has relatively recently been identified as a potential threat to marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, in addition to warming and acidification

Extending the simulations to timescales of millennia and longer, however, different models generate qualitatively different projections of oceanic oxygen levels in the far future: A box model predicts a continuous 10–20% decline in the oceanic oxygen inventory over the next few thousand years until it recovers to pre-industrial levels along with atmospheric CO

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Until now, the oxygen recovery has been attributed to circulation changes, in particular to a flushing of the deep ocean by enhanced deep-water formation in the Southern Ocean

  </span>. Our complete analysis accounting for all physical and biotic oxygen sources and sinks and their interlinkages with the nitrogen cycle reveals, however, that this alone cannot explain the simulated oxygen gain. We show here that most of the net oxygen gain results from a climate-driven substitution of oxygen-consuming respiration by denitrification and an incomplete compensation by nitrogen fixation, associated with a net loss of fixed nitrogen.
