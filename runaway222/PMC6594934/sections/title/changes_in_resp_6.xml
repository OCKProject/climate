 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At first sight, increases in global-mean ocean temperature (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), ideal age (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>) and NCP (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) all suggest a declining global ocean oxygen inventory, as also put forward to explain past oceanic anoxic events
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. The actually modelled oxygen increase (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) can only arise from spatially inhomogeneous changes of temperature, ventilation, respiration, or other processes not yet considered. Indeed, changes in respiratory oxygen consumption via aerobic remineralisation of detritus show a systematic shift of enhanced export and subsequent remineralisation towards high latitudes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3g, h</a>) linked to more efficient nutrient utilisation via improved light conditions due to disappearing summer sea-ice and more stable stratification. Interestingly, particle export and subsequent remineralisation are also enhanced in the upper hundred metres of the subtropical gyres, while there is a general decline of respiration in less well ventilated deeper waters (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3h</a>). In the model, this results from faster—and hence shallower—remineralisation at higher temperatures, leading to enhanced nutrient recycling in the upper ocean.
