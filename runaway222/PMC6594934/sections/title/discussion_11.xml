 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our modelling study of global-warming effects over millennia suggests expanding ocean anoxia (and the associated switch from aerobic respiration to denitrification) to eventually result in a counterintuitive net increase of marine oxygen levels. For each mole nitrate consumed via denitrification, about 1.4 moles of O
  <sub>2</sub> are saved. The same amount of oxygen is consumed when organic nitrogen stemming from nitrogen fixation is oxidised to nitrate. For a net oxygen gain it is essential that the commonly assumed feedback between nitrogen fixation and denitrification operates only with a temporal lag. The imbalance between nitrogen fixation and denitrification lasts for about 3000 years in our model simulation (Fig.Â 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). In our model this is by the entrainment of nitrate-deficient waters into deep-water formation regions, particularly in the Southern Ocean. Via this loophole, nitrate deficits can escape the topping-up action of nitrogen fixation and instead remain stored in the deep ocean, effecting a net oxygen gain. A major uncertainty (and on the agenda for future research) are the environmental controls of nitrogen fixation. Sensitivity experiments performed with a mechanistically different model of nitrogen fixation that includes the ability to access dissolved organic phosphorus and also allows diazotrophs to grow at low temperatures

  </span>, yield similar results regarding the temporal lag of the nitrogen fixation, but with only about half the simulated total loss of nitrate and associated gain of oxygen. If current assumptions about the environmental controls of nitrogen fixation are correct and properties of deep ocean waters can be set relatively unaffected by nitrogen fixation, the process modelled here leading to a net oceanic oxygen gain for a long-term global warming scenario may well have operated also during the development of whole-ocean anoxic events, e.g. in the Cretaceous. It seems to be more difficult to develop marine anoxia than thought until now.
