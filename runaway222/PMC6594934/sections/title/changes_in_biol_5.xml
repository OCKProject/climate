 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Net community production (NCP) describes the surplus of primary production over all respiratory processes in the euphotic zone, which, on annual and longer time scales and global space scales corresponds to the organic matter exported from surface water. NCP initially declines by 12% until year 2145, then recovers, and eventually exceeds pre-industrial levels by about 3% (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). The minimum in NCP occurs just when the strength of the meridional overturning circulation is at its minimum (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). Once NCP increases again, the suboxic (O
  <sub>2</sub> &lt; 5 μM) volume starts to expand almost threefold within a few centuries (black curve, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). Consequently, pelagic denitrification and, with a time lag of about 25 years, nitrogen fixation both increase and eventually level off at global rates about twice the pre-industrial rates (green and blue curves, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). At the end of the simulation, nitrogen fixation accounts for about 20% of the global NCP, compared to about 10% in year 2000.
