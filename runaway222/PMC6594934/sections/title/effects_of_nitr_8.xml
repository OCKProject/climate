 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oxygen gained via air-sea gas exchange explains, however, only about one third of the total increase in the oceanic oxygen inventory (13.4 Pmol, i.e. 6% of today’s ocean O
  <sub>2</sub> inventory Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>, blue line). Almost two thirds of it must therefore be from an oxygen source located in the ocean interior. Interior-ocean oxygen sources are photosynthesis, specifically, the net balance of oxygenic photosynthesis minus respiration, and processes reducing the oxidation state of nitrogen and other compounds. For everything else unchanged, a switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration will cause a left-over of, and hence increase in, dissolved oxygen. Total marine oxygen may thus be saved by the utilization of an oxidant other than oxygen, like in denitrification, or it may be spent by oxidising an external source of reduced nitrogen, like in N
  <sub>2</sub>-fixation and subsequent nitrification of the newly added N. In our simulation the strong increase in pelagic denitrification together with the time-lagged increase in N
  <sub>2</sub>-fixation cause a net loss of the ocean’s fixed nitrogen (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). Any net conversion, and loss, of nitrate to N
  <sub>2</sub> via denitrification corresponds to a net gain of oxygen (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) because no oxygen is consumed in it. Anaerobic remineralization via denitrification of organic matter containing one mole of organic nitrogen avoids the consumption of 10.6 moles of oxygen while removing 7.48 moles of NO
  <sub>3</sub> (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>). Thus, for each mole of nitrate lost, about 1.4 moles of oxygen are gained. Denitrification is hence an implicit source of oxygen to the ocean. The reverse applies to N
  <sub>2</sub>-fixation which is hence an oxygen sink for the ocean. What matters globally is the cumulative balance of denitrification and N
  <sub>2</sub>-fixation, that is the change in the global nitrate inventory. The total simulated nitrate loss of 6.2 Pmol NO
  <sub>3</sub>, i.e. about 17% of the present-day ocean’s nitrate inventory (green curve Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>), corresponds to an oxygen gain of 8.8 Pmol O
  <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>), which is about 4% of the present ocean oxygen inventory.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sulfate reduction to hydrogen sulfide, not considered in the model, would save still more oxygen in the water column. However, unless outgassing to the atmosphere, hydrogen sulfide would most likely quickly be re-oxidised in the oxic waters surrounding the respective anoxic region, cancelling the initial oxygen gain. Not resolving the marine sulfur cycle, we cannot quantify to what extent the reaction of H
  <sub>2</sub>S with NO
  <sub>3</sub>, the formation of elemental sulfur, or the burial of FeS might modify this picture. Other processes that may affect oxygen, but are not explicitly accounted for in this model configuration, are burial and denitrification in the sediments as well as the release of sedimentary phosphate and iron under expanding oxygen-deficient regions
