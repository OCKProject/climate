 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a spin-up of more than 10,000 years under pre-industrial atmospheric and astronomical boundary conditions, the model is run under historical conditions from year 1850 to 2000 using fossil-fuel and land-use carbon emissions as well as solar, volcanic and anthropogenic aerosol forcings. From year 2000 to 2100, the model is forced by CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions following the Special Report on Emissions A2 non-intervention scenario
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span> reaching maximum emissions of about 29 PgC/year in the year 2100. Thereafter, CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions decrease linearly to zero in year 2300. In this simulation, 2200 GtC are emitted until year 2100 and a total of 5100 GtC until year 2300. Model simulations are continued with zero CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions after year 2300 until year 8000.
