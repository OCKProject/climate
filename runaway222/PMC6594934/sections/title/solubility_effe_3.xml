 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the temperature control of gas solubility, a future warmer ocean will, on average, dissolve less oxygen. Our numerical model employing a business-as-usual emissions scenario with the emission peak in 2100 and a linear decline of emissions to zero in year 2300 (see “Methods”), simulates a rise in global-mean ocean temperatures by 3.1 °C above pre-industrial until year 3380 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). The associated solubility changes explain an oxygen decline by 27 Pmol (or 9%), as shown by the abiotic oxygen tracer (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). This amounts to about half the simulated total oxygen loss at the time of the O
  <sub>2</sub>-inventory minimum (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) and persists until the end of our experiment.
