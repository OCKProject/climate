 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An interesting finding is that global NCP is essentially unchanged and even shows a slight increase (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) despite a 17% decline in the ocean’s nitrate inventory (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). This decoupling of global NCP and nutrient inventory can be explained by the spatial pattern of the accumulated nitrate deficit, which very closely corresponds to the pattern of N* (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c, d</a>): Nitrate concentrations are lowered predominantly in the deep ocean and in high-latitude surface waters, whereas nitrate concentrations do not change significantly or even increase in the tropical and subtropical surface layers where phytoplankton growth is typically limited by nitrogen
