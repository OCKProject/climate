  <p>Spatial patterns of climate-driven change in projected species richness (number of species) for the year 2080 compared with 1995 assuming no dispersal. Results are shown for the two emission scenarios: RCP2.6 (
   <span class="italic">A</span>) and RCP6.0 (
   <span class="italic">B</span>). Barcharts to the left and to the top indicate the change in projected species richness per latitudinal and longitudinal band of 0.5°, separated for the three different vertebrate taxa. Change in species richness was calculated as the difference between 1995 and 2080 in stacked probabilities of occurrence obtained from climate-based SDMs and averaged across two model types and four different GCMs. For a basic dispersal scenario, see
