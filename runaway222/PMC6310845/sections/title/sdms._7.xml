 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained species distribution data for amphibians, mammals, and from refs.

  <a rid="r56" ref-type="bibr" href="#r56">56</a>. Climatic data were obtained from the ISIMIP project (

  </span> for further details on all data used). We used two types of SDMs, generalized boosted regression models (GBM) and generalized additive models (GAM), to model the relationship between the bioclimatic variables and current species’ distributions. These two widely used models were selected due to their good performance compared with other modeling approaches (

  <a rid="r60" ref-type="bibr" href="#r60">60</a>) and to provide a contrast between an additive model (GAM) and a classification and regression tree-based modeling approach (GBM) (see

Projections of species current and future probabilities of occurrence varied between the different SDM/GCM combinations. To document this variation, we calculated the coefficient of variation among the eight different estimates of projected species richness, based on summed probabilities of occurrence, for each grid cell (
