 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, a slightly larger number of species, of 15,448 species included in the SDM analyses, will potentially be affected by climate threat alone under RCP6.0 [14,989 ± 142 (SD)] than under RCP2.6 (14,855 ± 129), while a much larger number of species will potentially be affected by bioenergy cropland changes alone under RCP2.6 (10,346 ± 370) than under RCP6.0 (2,054 ± 279). Looking at the effects of climate threat and bioenergy cropland expansion (individually and combined), a slightly larger number of species will potentially be affected under RCP2.6 (15,309 ± 92) than under RCP6.0 (14,994 ± 140) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). When investigating the extent to which species distributions are projected to become exposed to different threats, the differences between the emission scenarios, mainly driven by bioenergy cropland changes, are even stronger (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). For example, many more species may become directly impacted by climate change individually across larger proportions of their ranges (≥50%) under RCP6.0 (6,063 ± 634) than under RCP2.6 (3,884 ± 575). In contrast, under RCP2.6, 1,623 (±540) species are projected to experience a threat by bioenergy cropland alone within 10% or more of their current distribution, while under RCP6.0, only 3 (±2) species are projected to experience substantial impacts from bioenergy expansion (

   <p>Mean number of species and the proportion of their distribution which is projected to become affected by climate and/or land-use threat under the two emission scenarios for 2080, assuming no dispersal. Species ranges can be affected by four different threats (BC, bioenergy cropland; CC, climate; CR, nonbioenergy cropland; PA, pastures) or a combination of multiple threats. Results are based on an ensemble mean across the two model types and the four GCMs for the projected climate change impacts, as well as an ensemble mean across the four GCMs for the projected land-use change impacts.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the small-range species, similar numbers of species are projected to become exposed to any threat at a high-intensity level under both emission scenarios [RCP2.6 = 4,396 ± 113 (SD), RCP6.0 = 4,338 ± 78] (

However, while more species (1,995 ± 130) may become potentially impacted by climate change alone under RCP6.0 than under RCP2.6 (1,269 ± 118), a much larger number of species (2,310 ± 68) occurs in areas where bioenergy cropland is projected to increase under RCP2.6 than under RCP6.0 (107 ± 22) (alone or in combination with other threats) (
