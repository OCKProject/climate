  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under a no-dispersal assumption (i.e., assuming that species will not be able to shift their distributions), areas of highest projected climate-driven changes in species richness are located in South America and on New Guinea (reaching potential losses of up to 150 species) (

   </span>). Areas with potential losses of between 20 and 70 species are scattered across all continents. The two emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP6.0) are similar regarding the geographical patterns of potential richness change. However, changes are projected to become more pronounced under the high-emission scenario (RCP 6.0). Under a basic dispersal assumption (

    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S2 and S3
   </span>). Nevertheless, with few exceptions, the geographical patterns of projected species losses are similar between the two dispersal assumptions. While there was considerable variation among the changes in species richness projected by different species distribution model (SDM) algorithms and global climate models (GCMs), the areas of high potential change in species richness showed comparatively high levels of model agreement (

    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S6

The map shows the distribution of the threats that are defined for each variable as the (global) top quartile of cells with the highest mean change across RCPs, model types, and GCMs for climate change threat and the top quartile of cells with the highest mean change across RCPs and GCMs for land-use change threat (see

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The overall area where species richness is projected to become impacted by either of the threats or any of their combinations does not differ between the low- and the high-emission scenario, except for amphibians, where the area is higher under the low-emission scenario (

    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S1
   </span>). Under RCP2.6, vertebrate species richness may become impacted by high-intensity climate and land-use change in about 36% of the world’s terrestrial area [amphibians: 35.9 ± 3.94 (SD); birds: 36.2 ± 4.45, mammals: 36.8 ± 4.97]; under RCP6.0, this figure is also projected to be about 36% (amphibians: 33.6 ± 3.05; birds: 37.4 ± 7.92, mammals: 38.1 ± 7.68) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a> and

    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S1
   </span>). The main differences between the RCP2.6 and RCP6.0 emission scenario lies in the individual extent of climate and land-use change threat. Whereas climate change threat is projected to become more extensive under the high-emission scenario, threat from land-use change may become more extensive under the low-emission scenario. This high level of land-use change threat under the low-emission scenario is mainly due to the large projected increase in bioenergy cropland. Focusing on the overlap between projected impacts from climate change and cropland change (both bioenergy and nonbioenergy), RCP2.6 shows a larger area of potential impact: for these threat combinations, about 5.2% [amphibians: 5.9 ± 0.63 (SD); birds: 4.6 ± 0.84; mammals: 5.0 ± 0.86] of the global land area is projected to become impacted under RCP2.6, but only 3.2% (amphibians: 3.1 ± 0.36; birds: 3.3 ± 0.65; mammals: 3.3 ± 0.69) under RCP 6.0 (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807745115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S1
   </span>). All of these values decline slightly when a basic dispersal of species is incorporated, but the differences remain consistent (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807745115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S8 and Table S1
   </span>). Areas where nonbioenergy cropland change is projected to overlap with direct climate change impacts are larger under RCP6.0, as are areas where projected changes to pastures overlap with climate change impacts (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a> and 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807745115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S1
   </span>). The patterns of threat overlap also vary across space, depending on the taxonomic group, the emission scenario, and the land-use type (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a> for details). Overall, most areas with high levels of projected climate and land-use change impacts coincide in the tropics. Southwestern South America (mainly the Pampas, Atlantic Forest, and Cerrado regions), Central America, large parts of tropical Africa, and also of south and southeast Asia, including Indonesia and New Guinea, are projected to become highly impacted from different threat combinations, independent of the taxon or the emission scenario.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, a slightly larger number of species, of 15,448 species included in the SDM analyses, will potentially be affected by climate threat alone under RCP6.0 [14,989 ± 142 (SD)] than under RCP2.6 (14,855 ± 129), while a much larger number of species will potentially be affected by bioenergy cropland changes alone under RCP2.6 (10,346 ± 370) than under RCP6.0 (2,054 ± 279). Looking at the effects of climate threat and bioenergy cropland expansion (individually and combined), a slightly larger number of species will potentially be affected under RCP2.6 (15,309 ± 92) than under RCP6.0 (14,994 ± 140) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). When investigating the extent to which species distributions are projected to become exposed to different threats, the differences between the emission scenarios, mainly driven by bioenergy cropland changes, are even stronger (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). For example, many more species may become directly impacted by climate change individually across larger proportions of their ranges (≥50%) under RCP6.0 (6,063 ± 634) than under RCP2.6 (3,884 ± 575). In contrast, under RCP2.6, 1,623 (±540) species are projected to experience a threat by bioenergy cropland alone within 10% or more of their current distribution, while under RCP6.0, only 3 (±2) species are projected to experience substantial impacts from bioenergy expansion (
