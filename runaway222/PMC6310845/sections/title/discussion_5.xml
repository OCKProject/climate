 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis demonstrated that the combined potential impacts of future climate and land-use change for global vertebrate species richness, measured as the area potentially impacted by either of the threats or their combinations, reach similar levels for the low- and the high-emission scenario. Furthermore, larger proportions of species distributions and more species with very small distributional ranges are likely impacted by multiple threats in the future under the low-emission scenario RCP2.6. For this scenario, a strong increase in bioenergy cropland may cause detrimental effects on biodiversity, which are not likely to be compensated by the slight reduction in direct impacts of climate change (compared with the RCP6.0 scenario). Overall, our findings suggest that a climate change mitigation strategy that largely relies on bioenergy crops may lead to impacts on biodiversity at least over similar geographical extents and for more of the species with the smallest geographical distributions under RCP2.6 than under RCP6.0.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The projected high impact of cropland change on biodiversity, under an extensive climate change mitigation strategy, is in line with numerous studies investigating local conflicts between biofuel expansion and biodiversity (
  <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>, 
  <a rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" href="#r44">44</a>). Areas with high potential for bioenergy crops tend to overlap with areas of high biodiversity, as well as potential future climate refugia (
  <a rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" href="#r29">29</a>, 
  <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>). Subsequently, trade-offs between the protection of wildlife habitats, biodiversity hotspots, and other areas of conservation interest and the expansion of biofuel cropland, to mitigate climate change, are frequently unavoidable (
  <a rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" href="#r46">46</a>, 
  <a rid="r47" ref-type="bibr" href="#r47">47</a>). Although the impact of biofuel cropland expansion on biodiversity depends on a variety of factors as the regional context, location, previous habitat type, as well as the type of bioenergy cropland (
  <a rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" href="#r48">48</a>), impacts have been found to be negative across a variety of locations and scales (
  <a rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" href="#r29">29</a>, 
  <a rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" href="#r35">35</a>, 
  <a rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" href="#r37">37</a>, 
  <a rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" href="#r38">38</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As we expected, the discrepancy between the low- and high-emission scenarios in the high-threat areas is mainly due to differences in land-use change, and here mainly to the projected change in bioenergy cropland (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a> and 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807745115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S6 and S7
  </span>). In fact, the maps depicting the different land-use types (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807745115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S6
  </span>) suggest a shift from pastures to bioenergy cropland in the tropics, and a switch from nonbioenergy to bioenergy cropland in temperate regions and eastern Asia. While we cannot precisely identify the areas where pastures or natural areas are turned into bioenergy cropland, we assume that a potential shift from pastures (which also include extensively used rangeland) to bioenergy cropland (for which we expect a higher cultivation intensity) will be particularly detrimental for biodiversity (
  <a rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" href="#r38">38</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, under the low-emission scenario, many regions with extensive bioenergy cropland expansion coincide both with global hotspots of biodiversity and areas where species richness is projected to strongly decline because of direct impacts of climate change (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>). Impacted hotspots include the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado in South America, Mesoamerica, and parts of western and eastern Africa. While projected changes in nonbioenergy cropland or pastures may also severely threaten species richness, especially under the high-emission scenario (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>), the extent of the area of any threat and of the area where different threats overlap is particularly large for the combination of bioenergy cropland and climate change (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807745115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S1
  </span>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This geographical pattern is mirrored by the species-based perspective; here the two scenarios showed the most pronounced differences in the high number of species likely becoming exposed to bioenergy cropland change across large proportions of their distributions under RCP2.6. Potentially even more worrying is the observation that under this low-emission scenario almost half of the smallest-range species (which could not be modeled using SDMs) occur in those areas where bioenergy cropland is projected to strongly increase (as single threat or as overlap with other threats). Most of these species are range-restricted amphibians occurring in Central America, the tropical Andes or the Atlantic Forest in South America, around Mount Cameroon in Africa or on Madagascar (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807745115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S14
  </span>), all of which are areas of highest conservation priority not only for amphibians. While it remains a challenge to better integrate these small-range species into SDMs (
  <a rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" href="#r49">49</a>), it is important not to ignore such species, even if the only viable approaches are simplistic. The fact that the vast majority of threatened species are also small-range species (
  <a rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" href="#r50">50</a>) makes them even more vulnerable to high intensities of land-use and climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potential decreases of species richness due to direct impacts of climate change were larger under the high-emission scenario. However, regions with significant levels of potential species loss emerge already under the low-emission scenario. The relatively small differences between the scenarios and their consistent spatial patterns are probably due to the fact that even though by 2080 the scenarios differ in the global average warming by about 1 °C (RCP2.6: +1.64°; RCP6.0: +2.6 °C; both compared with the 1995 reference period), the climatic variables used for our SDM analysis show considerable changes also under the low-emission scenario (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807745115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S12 and S13
  </span>). This appears to be sufficient to cause significant changes in species’ probabilities of occurrence and thus in projected species richness (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When comparing the patterns of changes in projected species richness between the two dispersal scenarios, direct impacts from climate change appear to decrease slightly when assuming that species can, to some degree, track areas that become climatically suitable (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807745115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S2, S3, and S8
  </span>). Even though our assumptions are simplified, the differences between the no-dispersal and a basic dispersal assumption highlight the importance of dispersal as a potential pathway to respond to climate change (
  <a rid="r51" ref-type="bibr" href="#r51">51</a>, 
  <a rid="r52" ref-type="bibr" href="#r52">52</a>). In a world of multiple interacting anthropogenic threats to biodiversity, responses via dispersal are, however, impeded by the effects of land-use change, in particular habitat fragmentation (
  <a rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" href="#r24">24</a>). Thus, identifying regions that may gain species dispersing from elsewhere or that contain potential dispersal corridors (e.g., ref. 
  <a rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" href="#r53">53</a>) and assessing to which extent these regions may be exposed to high levels of land-use change should be a high priority for global conservation efforts.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study reveals clear trends that do not appear to be subject to large effects of model uncertainty (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Figs. 1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a> and 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807745115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S6, S7, and S18
  </span>) and we invested considerable effort to account for uncertainties that potentially confound SDM results, such as pseudoabsence selection, spatial autocorrelation, or naive assumptions about unlimited dispersal (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807745115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, 
   <span class="italic">SI Materials and Methods</span>
  </span>). However, several data-related and methodological issues need to be borne in mind when interpreting our findings (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807745115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, 
   <span class="italic">SI Results and Discussion</span>
  </span>). Consequently, a study like ours can only outline broad trends by relying on simplified assumptions and has to refrain from locality- or species-specific interpretation of the results.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a world of anthropogenic global change, interactive effects among different threats can be expected, including synergies and trade-offs (
  <a rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" href="#r33">33</a>, 
  <a rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" href="#r54">54</a>). These interactions may vary under different scenarios of global warming: weaker direct impacts of climate change may be overruled by stronger effects of the mitigation efforts needed to combat global warming. Our analysis suggests that a low-emission scenario does not necessarily decrease the combined negative effects of climate and land-use change on biodiversity compared with a high-emission scenario, a finding consistent for both the geographic and the species-based perspectives (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Figs. 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">3</a>). Importantly, the strong effects under the low-emission scenario are in fact due to efforts for climate change mitigation, namely to the massive expansion of bioenergy cropland. Averaging across the four GCMs we used for the low-emission scenario (RCP2.6) results in a global mean temperature increase of approximately 1.6 °C until 2080 compared with our 1995 baseline, which corresponds to an average warming level of approximately 2.1 °C compared with preindustrial conditions (
  <a rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" href="#r1">1</a>). Keeping the warming level below 2 °C or even 1.5 °C likely requires even more mitigation efforts, such as additional expansion and intensification of bioenergy agriculture, with consequences for biodiversity that may be even more severe than those suggested by our analysis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a biodiversity perspective, the overarching goals of the Paris Agreement (
  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>) are very much worth pursuing, as climate change remains one of the largest threats for global biodiversity. However, biodiversity is likely to suffer severely if bioenergy cropland expansion continues to play a major role in climate change mitigation efforts. Our findings highlight the urgent need to carefully consider biodiversity when expanding bioenergy cropland. On a more general note, an immediate and significant reduction in energy consumption to reduce the need for fossil fuel and bioenergy production appears to be challenging (
  <a rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" href="#r34">34</a>), but the ideal strategy for both protecting biodiversity and achieving the Paris goals.
