 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed the potential threats to biodiversity from climate and land-use change from a geographical perspective (summarized for each of the three taxa amphibians, birds, and mammals) and from a species perspective.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the geographical perspective, climate threat was quantified as the change in projected species richness per taxon, calculated as the differences in summed probabilities of occurrence between 1995 and 2080 from the SDMs (

  </span>). For each time period the projected probabilities of occurrence of every species were summed, without prior thresholding and transfer to presenceâ€“absence matrices, to avoid the general overestimation of species richness (
  <a rid="r64" ref-type="bibr" href="#r64">64</a>). For each taxon, we then calculated the mean projected species richness change across the four different GCMs and the two SDMs. Land-use threat per grid cell was quantified as the mean change in percentage cover across the four GCMs between 1995 and 2080 for each of the three land-use types (bioenergy cropland, nonbioenergy cropland, pastures) (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify areas of high threat intensity from climate and land-use change for vertebrate species richness (high threat, hereafter), we used a spatial threshold approach (
  <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>). As high-threat areas, we identified the 25% of all grid cells globally with the highest loss in projected species richness (summed probability of occurrence) as obtained by the SDMs or with the highest increase in percentage cover of the respective land-use type. To allow for a better comparison between the RCPs (RCP2.6 and RCP6.0), GCMs, and model algorithms (GAM, GBM), we first pooled all values for the respective threat and for each grid cell from all these categories and then calculated one 25% cut-off value for each of the four threats and each taxon based on these pooled datasets. We stress that by applying this approach we did not consider the scenarios separately, but combined all grid cells of both scenarios and identified the 25% of cells with the highest negative threat levels for this combined dataset. For example, as the overall increase in bioenergy cropland area is extremely low in RCP6.0, but very high in RCP2.6, this leads to a much larger number of high-threat grid cells in RCP2.6. We highlighted high-threat areas separately for climate change only and land-use change only (the latter separately for bioenergy cropland, nonbioenergy cropland, and pastures), as well as for areas of threat overlap (i.e., for any combination of the four different threats) (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess future potential threats from the species perspective, we quantified the proportion of the current range of each species which is projected to overlap with any given threat (see above for the threat definition). While we excluded species with a range smaller than 10 grid cells from the SDM analysis, we still included these species in our study by assessing the spatial overlap of their ranges with areas of projected high climate and land-use change (see
