  <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Instead of an economic catastrophe triggered by global warming we first consider here a climate catastrophe which induces an abrupt increase in the climate sensitivity 
   <span class="italic">χ</span>.
   <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8" href="#Fn8">8</a> After the disaster, the carbon stock and the temperature increase and gradually erode productivity, which differs from the TFP catastrophe we have discussed so far where economic activity, fossil fuel use, emissions and eventually temperature drop after the tip (see “Appendix 5”). Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> shows the effects of a catastrophic increase in the climate sensitivity 
   <span class="italic">χ</span> from 3 to 4 with a quadratic hazard.
   <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn9" href="#Fn9">9</a> The after-calamity response requires a much higher carbon price than in the naive outcome (27 instead of 16 $/tCO2). Furthermore, before the calamity a substantial target carbon tax is needed (27 $/tCO2). This is not different from the after-calamity carbon tax, but there is a shift from marginal to raising-the-stakes damages. Once the calamity has struck, damages are higher and after-calamity welfare is lower, so that the raising-the-stakes component of the carbon tax is big. This in itself curbs carbon emissions and lessens the need for a correction of marginal damages. Moreover, before the calamity a small precautionary return is required and thus the target capital stock is a little bit higher than in the naive outcome (despite the higher carbon tax). The precautionary return is small because the shock to total factor productivity induced by the shock to climate sensitivity is not so big. Just as with the total factor productivity shocks, the carbon stock drops after the calamity. However, the after-calamity temperature is higher than for the productivity shock presented in Table

  <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> shows the effects of a hazard of a 20% destruction of the capital stock. Now there is a sizeable precautionary return (0.57% per year) and substantial capital accumulation to prepare for sudden disaster (433 instead of 378 trillion dollars). Since this induces more fossil fuel use, there is despite a somewhat higher carbon tax (18.5 instead of 15.4 $/tCO2) 
   <span class="italic">more</span> global warming than in the naive outcome (1534 GtC).
  </p>
  <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before the calamity strikes, the risk-averting components of the carbon tax are tiny as damages caused by the catastrophe are temporary. Comparing with the naive outcome, the raising-the-stakes component takes over most of the marginal-damage component of the carbon tax, as we have also seen for the shock in the climate sensitivity. There is substantial accumulation of capital before the disaster strikes for an impending capital- stock disaster but unsurprisingly hardly any for an impending carbon-stock disaster.</p>
