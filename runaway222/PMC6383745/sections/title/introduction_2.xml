 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The standard recipe in handling climate change is to call for a global tax on carbon that is equal to the present value of all future marginal damages arising from emitting one ton of carbon today (e.g., Nordhaus 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2008</a>; Stern 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2007</a>; Golosov et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2014</a>). However, climatologists emphasise that the real threats of climate change are the non-marginal effects when the climate system shifts to a system with different dominant feedbacks and different equilibria (Lenton and Ciscar 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>). The point where such a shift occurs is called a tipping point (Biggs et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2012</a>). The literature on the economics of climate change has started to incorporate tipping points in the analysis (e.g., Kopits et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2013</a>; Pindyck 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2013</a>). For example, several authors have used the DICE model—a prominent integrated assessment model for climate change (Nordhaus 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2008</a>)—to study the effect of climate tipping points (Keller et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2004</a>; Lemoine and Traeger 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2014</a>; Cai et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2015</a>; Lontzek et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper focuses first on theory, and more specifically on a potential climate shock that would lead to an adverse productivity shock in a Ramsey growth model, with uncertainty about the time, impact and type of such a climate catastrophe. The productivity shocks may arise from flooding of cities, sudden increased occurrence of storms and droughts, abrupt desertification of agricultural land, or reversal of the Gulf Stream (e.g., Alley et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2003</a>). We show that the economy needs to respond in two ways to such potential shocks. First, carbon needs to be taxed (or priced via a global market for carbon emission permits) to curb the risk of climate calamities as the hazard of a catastrophe increases in the stock of atmospheric carbon. Second, precautionary adjustment to the capital stock is needed to cope with the possibility of an abrupt jump in consumption at the tipping point. The second response follows from adjustments to the Keynes–Ramsey rule in the Ramsey growth model with tipping, which is the focus of a companion paper (van der Ploeg and de Zeeuw 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2018</a>). This paper focuses, in contrast, on the social cost of carbon or the optimal carbon tax.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to make our results comparable with early literature on integrated climate assessment, we also allow for 
  <span class="italic">gradual</span> marginal climate damages (e.g., Tol 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2002</a>; Nordhaus 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2008</a>; Stern 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2007</a>; Golosov et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2014</a>). We show that the optimal carbon tax consists of two catastrophe components and the usual component internalising marginal damages. The catastrophe components are the risk-averting part and, what we call, the raising-the-stakes part. The first component reduces the probability of tipping, whereas the second component internalises the effects on expected after-calamity welfare. We offer explicit expressions for the optimal tax on carbon and we show, in a calibrated Ramsey growth model for the world economy, how big the increase in the carbon tax is, as compared to the carbon tax that is only based on marginal damages.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we consider other types of shocks caused by climate tipping as well. A sudden acceleration of carbon emissions, because of a reduction in cooling when ice sheets such as the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet melt away (e.g., Oppenheimer 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">1998</a>),
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" href="#Fn1">1</a> or a sudden release of methane buried in sea-beds and permafrost (e.g., Dutta et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2006</a>), because of rising sea temperatures, are other tipping points. We view them as a sudden increase in the climate sensitivity, which is the temperature rise from doubling the carbon stock, and we derive the optimal response to a potential tipping point in the climate sensitivity. We also consider the implications of 
  <span class="italic">recoverable</span> catastrophes in this paper, such as a sudden rise in the carbon stock or a sudden destruction of a part of the capital stock. Furthermore, we show the effect of an increasing marginal hazard rate (as a function of the stock of atmospheric carbon), which captures the increasing marginal probability of tipping. Finally, we allow for investments in adaptation capital, as an alternative way to counter potential adverse effects of climate tipping.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper emphasises the need for an appropriate carbon tax, besides adjustments in saving, in the face of potential tipping points driven by global warming in a standard Ramsey growth model. Clarke and Reed (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">1994</a>), Tsur and Zemel (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">1996</a>) and Gjerde et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">1999</a>) also analyse catastrophes with hazard rates, but they do not have Ramsey growth and thus no need for additional adjustments in capital. Gjerde et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">1999</a>) consider carbon cycle and temperature modules with gradual and catastrophic damages and provide simulation studies of the effects of pending catastrophes on temperature and the economy, but they do not present the optimal carbon tax or the need for adjustments in saving. Smulders et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2014</a>) discuss the need for precautionary saving to deal with an impending disaster, but their analysis uses a constant hazard rate, whereas our analysis highlights the effects of endogenous hazard rates that depend on global warming (represented by the carbon stock). Engström and Gars (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2016</a>) study catastrophes within the model of Golosov et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2014</a>), but the special assumptions needed to get tractable solutions of this model remove the incentive to have adjustment in saving to cope with a pending catastrophe. Our study focuses on the theory first, in a Ramsey growth model, to highlight the need for an additional tax on carbon as well as adjustments to capital, and then presents illustrative quantitative results in a simple calibrated model of the world economy.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other studies have focused on catastrophes and extreme events but not in the context of general equilibrium models of Ramsey growth and climate change. Barro (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2013</a>) studies the optimal investment needed to curb the probability of an environmental disaster but abstracts from the precautionary adjustment of capital. Weitzman (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2007</a>) highlights the fundamental uncertainty at the upper end of the probability distribution of possible increases in temperature and corresponding damage, and shows that the policy consequences of a fat instead of a thin tail can be dramatic. Martin and Pindyck (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2015</a>) study the ‘strange’ implications for the cost–benefit analysis of a cascade of catastrophes within a partial equilibrium context. Pindyck and Wang (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2013</a>) use a general equilibrium framework to obtain a price of insurance against catastrophic risks.

  <a rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec6">4</a> allows for gradual as well as catastrophic damages from global warming and decomposes the optimal carbon tax into the usual social cost of carbon (i.e., the present value of marginal gradual damages) and the extra carbon taxes that are needed to curb the risk of climate tipping. It also discusses regime shifts with a sudden increase in climate sensitivity, and recoverable catastrophes that destroy a part of the capital stock or that lead to a sudden release of atmospheric carbon. Finally, investments in adaptation capital are discussed. Section
