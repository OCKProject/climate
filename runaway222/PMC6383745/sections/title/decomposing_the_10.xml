  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> give the after- and before-calamity steady states for both the linear and the quadratic hazard function. Comparing this with Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> shows the effects of adding marginal damages to the cost of global warming on the optimal carbon tax and macroeconomic outcomes. As a result of the marginal damages, after the calamity there is a conventional carbon tax of 11 $/tCO2 which curbs atmospheric carbon from 1502 to 1107 GtC. This slightly lowers capital and consumption after the calamity. Before the disaster strikes, there is a much bigger carbon tax for the linear hazard function (55 instead of 22 $/tCO2) than for the quadratic hazard function (71 instead of 57 $/tCO2), as compared to the situation without marginal climate damages. Adding the marginal climate damages mitigates the difference between the linear and quadratic hazard functions, because risk of tipping is not the only damage component anymore. The before-calamity carbon tax is in both cases dominated by the catastrophe components, especially the risk-averting component. The raising-the-stakes component is also high, and even higher than the after-calamity carbon tax. The aim of this carbon tax component is to keep the risk of after-calamity carbon costs low. Furthermore, as a consequence of introducing marginal climate damages, the carbon stock is much more reduced with the linear hazard function (from 1623 to 1287 GtC) than with the quadratic hazard function (from 1281 to 1161 GtC). Thus the differences between the effects of the two hazard functions become smaller.

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Internalising marginal damages as well as catastrophic damages curbs global warming and lessens the need for precautionary capital accumulation, especially for the linear hazard function (from 530 to 492 trillion dollars for the linear and from 486 to 465 trillion dollars for the quadratic hazard function). Hence, the precautionary return, largely driven by the hazard rate and carbon stock, drops by much more for the linear hazard (from 1.23 to 1.10% per annum) than for the quadratic hazard function (from 0.99 to 0.90% per annum). The convex hazard function has a lower marginal hazard rate at the target level of the carbon stock (

 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The remaining columns of Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> show the consequences of a catastrophic drop of 10% in total factor productivity. Since there is more economic activity and more carbon emissions after the calamity than for the 20% disaster, the after-calamity carbon tax increases from 11 to 13 $/tCO2. Before the shock hits, both catastrophe components of the optimal carbon tax fall relative to the outcome with a 20% calamity, but the biggest falls occur for the risk-averting components (from 35 to 12 $/tCO2 for the linear and from 52 to 24 $/tCO2 for the quadratic hazard function). Although there is now more economic activity with a 10% shock after the calamity, the capital stock in the beginning is lower because there is less precautionary capital accumulation. The precautionary return drops more or less in line with the drop in total factor productivity so that less precautionary saving occurs before the catastrophe hits. Despite the lower initial capital stock after the calamity, the lower structural drop of only 10% in total factor productivity leads to bigger carbon stocks and more global warming.
 </p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In brackets we show how the results change if the quadratic hazard rates are halved for each level of the carbon stock. This curbs precautionary saving, but it increases the carbon tax by a small amount. The marginal hazard rates are lower but the hazard rates are lower as well and the last effect dominates so that the carbon tax increases.
