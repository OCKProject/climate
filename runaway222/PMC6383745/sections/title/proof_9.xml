 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first term in Eq. (
  <a rid="Equ13" ref-type="" href="#Equ13">13</a>) represents the present value of the expected loss due to a future potential climate catastrophe. It is the same as Eq. (
  <a rid="Equ11" ref-type="" href="#Equ11">11</a>), where we only had catastrophic damages. It curbs the carbon emissions and thus the risk of a climate calamity. Therefore, we call this the 
  <span class="italic">risk</span>-
  <span class="italic">averting part</span> of the carbon tax. The second term is the usual present value of marginal climate damages, where the discount rate is equal to the rate of interest plus the decay rate of atmospheric carbon augmented with both the hazard rate of the catastrophe and the precautionary return.
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6" href="#Fn6">6</a> We call this the 
  <span class="italic">conventional part</span> of the carbon tax. The third term arises because gradual damages are still relevant after the catastrophe. It reflects the expected present value of the after-calamity social cost of carbon, and thus yields the increase in after-calamity welfare from curbing the emissions by one unit. We call this the 
  <span class="italic">raising</span>-
  <span class="italic">the</span>-
  <span class="italic">stakes part</span> of the carbon tax. We will now turn to what the extension with gradual damages implies for the numerical illustration with our calibrated model for the world economy.
