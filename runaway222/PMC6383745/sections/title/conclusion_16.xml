 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change will probably manifest itself in the future as a regime shift in the climate system resulting from a climate tipping point (Lenton and Ciscar 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>). This means that the risk of such a shock to the economy becomes an important driver of the social cost of carbon. It has also been argued that spending money now to slow down global warming should be conceptualised primarily as an issue about how much insurance to buy to offset the small chance of a ruinous catastrophe (Weitzman 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2007</a>). We have taken up this challenge by analysing the optimal reactions to a tipping point in a Ramsey growth model which becomes more imminent with global warming.
 </p>
 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most striking result in this literature is that both a carbon tax and a precautionary adjustment to capital are needed. A reduction in fossil fuel use is required to curb the risk of a catastrophe and adjustment to capital is required to smooth consumption over time. In combination with the standard Pigouvian carbon tax, this carbon tax also has a third component because the regime shift increases the marginal damage after the calamity. Higher elasticity of intertemporal substitution (or lower risk aversion c.q. lower intergenerational inequality aversion) decreases both the carbon tax and the precautionary adjustments to capital.</p>
 <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regime shifts are characterised in our analysis as structural shocks either to total factor productivity or to climate sensitivity. We show that the effects on optimal policy are much larger than in case of shocks to the capital stock or the stock of atmospheric carbon. The last two cases only set back development temporarily and do not affect the steady state of the economy, so that there is less need for the optimal policy to curb the risk of tipping.</p>
 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A constant marginal hazard rate requires a balanced package of a carbon tax and a precautionary adjustment to saving. However, for an increasing marginal hazard rate a higher carbon tax is needed, so that the stock of atmospheric carbon is kept down and precautionary adjustments to capital can be more modest.</p>
 <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results highlight the importance of a carbon tax to curb the risk of a catastrophe, and precautionary adjustments to capital to be prepared when the disaster strikes. Our illustrative calculations indicate that especially the risk-averting part of the carbon tax is substantial as compared to the carbon taxes based on only marginal damages (e.g., Nordhaus 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2008</a>; Golosov et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our conclusion is that destruction of non-recoverable factors of production by climate catastrophes requires urgent action both to mitigate the risks of such actions occurring and to be better prepared for when they occur. Our illustrative calculations suggest that conventional marginal global warming damages necessitate a global carbon tax of 15 $/tCO2.
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn12" href="#Fn12">12</a> However, an impending negative shock of 20% to total factor productivity with an expected arrival time in 40 years, falling to 15 years when the carbon stock doubles, boosts this figure to 55 or 71 $/tCO2 for a linear or quadratic hazard function, respectively. Furthermore, a precautionary return of about 1% per annum induces an additional capital accumulation of 30 and 23%, respectively. A negative shock of 10% requires a global carbon tax of 30–40 $/tCO2 and also halves the precautionary returns. Half the hazard rates for any given carbon stock hardly changes the required carbon tax, but diminishes the precautionary return considerably to 0.16% per annum. Catastrophic shocks to recoverable factors of production such as the capital stock are only temporary and thus require much less action.
 </p>
 <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Catastrophes might resonate more with policy makers to convince them of the need to implement ambitious climate policy. However, as argued by Lenton and Ciscar (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>), more research with climate scientists is needed to improve information on the different types of productivity, capital-stock, carbon-stock and climate-sensitivity catastrophes that can occur, and the different hazard and marginal hazard rates of such disasters. We also need to be precise about how long it will take before the impact of the catastrophe is fully felt (Lontzek et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>). In a companion paper (van der Ploeg and de Zeeuw 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2018</a>), we introduce a delay for the catastrophe to have its full impact. Our main result is that for a sufficiently large impact delay, the precautionary return is negative, so that less saving before the tip occurs and consumption jumps up at the tipping point.
 </p>
 <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future research is thus needed on the nature of catastrophes, on their hazard rates and their dependence on global warming, on the time it takes to have their effect, and how these insights affect the optimal policy prescriptions for dealing with climate tipping points. More thinking is also required on what kinds of abatement or mitigation investments can be made today that yield a positive return in the distant future at the time the catastrophe strikes. In other words, one needs projects that yield a negative “climate beta”. These occur if a bad climate shock is associated to higher temperature and lower economic growth, in which case there is an insurance motive to push up the optimal price of carbon (e.g., Sandsmark and Vennemo 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2007</a>; Daniel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2016</a>). However, in most integrated assessment models, damages and GDP are tied to each other and thus the “climate beta” is positive and close to one, in which case it is easier to deal with future climate shocks and climate policy can be relaxed (e.g., Dietz et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2017</a>). Another difficulty occurs from a finance perspective due to the problem of “maturity mismatch”: climate change occurs over the course of the next few centuries whereas returns on investments in physical capital might have a horizon of more like half a century. Some forms of adaptation capital might however give a return when the catastrophe hits and typically last for much longer than other types of capital.
