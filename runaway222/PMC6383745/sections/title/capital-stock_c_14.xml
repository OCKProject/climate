  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> shows the effects of a hazard of a 20% destruction of the capital stock. Now there is a sizeable precautionary return (0.57% per year) and substantial capital accumulation to prepare for sudden disaster (433 instead of 378 trillion dollars). Since this induces more fossil fuel use, there is despite a somewhat higher carbon tax (18.5 instead of 15.4 $/tCO2)

 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before the calamity strikes, the risk-averting components of the carbon tax are tiny as damages caused by the catastrophe are temporary. Comparing with the naive outcome, the raising-the-stakes component takes over most of the marginal-damage component of the carbon tax, as we have also seen for the shock in the climate sensitivity. There is substantial accumulation of capital before the disaster strikes for an impending capital- stock disaster but unsurprisingly hardly any for an impending carbon-stock disaster.</p>
