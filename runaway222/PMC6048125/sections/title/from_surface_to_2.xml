 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Below the firn line, kilometre-scale sapphire-blue lakes, fed by networks of surface streams, dot the flanks of the Greenland Ice Sheet in summer. Their disappearance is one of the most striking features in time-lapse satellite imagery, prompting questions about their role in delivering water to the ice-sheet interior. Some of these lakes drain by overtopping into downstream crevasses and moulins (vertical shafts in the ice created by flowing water). Others drain rapidly through in-situ fractures that may propagate all the way to the bed, in some cases associated with uplift and/or sliding of the ice sheet caused by distal drainage events

  </span>. Water impinging on the bed in this way has a short-lived effect on local ice flow

  </span> that may or may not be significant when the cumulative impacts of numerous lakes are considered, but does facilitate the formation of longer-lived moulins. Seasonal cycles of surface meltwater supply compete with the evolution of subglacial drainage-system efficiency, with ice-flow speeds seemingly more dependent on meltwater variability than volume

  </span>. Even negative feedbacks between surface melt and annual ice motion have been documented in multi-year studies

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Just as the melting margins of Greenland were beginning to seem like an outsized alpine glacier with its seasonal see-saw between efficient and inefficient subglacial drainage, borehole studies highlighted limits to the inland extent of an efficient drainage system

A Greenland-wide assessment revealed a regionally differentiated response, with fewer drainage events in areas experiencing the greatest dynamic mass losses
