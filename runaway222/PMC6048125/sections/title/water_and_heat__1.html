      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With most of the Greenland Ice Sheet blanketed in snow and firn (a transitional material
         between snow and ice), and melting conditions reaching further inland as observed
         during the extraordinary summer of 2012, near-surface hydrology stands to play an
         increasingly important role in connecting surface melt and sea-level rise. The discovery
         of vast stores of liquid water in the porous near-surface firn
         <span><a>3</a></span> highlights a potential feedback termed cryo-hydrologic warming
         <span><a>4</a></span>, whereby latent heat released by refreezing meltwater warms the surrounding ice,
         accelerating its deformation. There is some observational evidence for this mechanism,
         for example, in anomalously warm ice found in western Greenland. However, the effect
         of cryo-hydrologic warming is expected to be limited at least on centennial timescales,
         with the Greenland Ice Sheet being more sensitive to climate forcing and bed conditions
         than internal thermal regime
         <span><a>5</a></span>. The more significant effect of refreezing may be its role in limiting the porosity
         and permeability of the firn
         <span><a>6</a></span>. Combined with reduced firn extent, various densification processes and diminished
         cold content, the firn aquifer’s future buffering capacity of Greenland’s contribution
         to sea level stands to be compromised. The firn aquifer may also serve to concentrate
         water supplies in a manner conducive to hydrofracture, allowing water stored in the
         near-surface to reach the base of the ice-sheet.
