      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Below the firn line, kilometre-scale sapphire-blue lakes, fed by networks of surface
         streams, dot the flanks of the Greenland Ice Sheet in summer. Their disappearance
         is one of the most striking features in time-lapse satellite imagery, prompting questions
         about their role in delivering water to the ice-sheet interior. Some of these lakes
         drain by overtopping into downstream crevasses and moulins (vertical shafts in the
         ice created by flowing water). Others drain rapidly through in-situ fractures that
         may propagate all the way to the bed, in some cases associated with uplift and/or
         sliding of the ice sheet caused by distal drainage events
         <span><a>7</a></span>. Water impinging on the bed in this way has a short-lived effect on local ice flow
         <span><a>8</a></span> that may or may not be significant when the cumulative impacts of numerous lakes
         are considered, but does facilitate the formation of longer-lived moulins. Seasonal
         cycles of surface meltwater supply compete with the evolution of subglacial drainage-system
         efficiency, with ice-flow speeds seemingly more dependent on meltwater variability
         than volume
         <span><a>9</a></span>. Even negative feedbacks between surface melt and annual ice motion have been documented
         in multi-year studies
         <span><a>10</a></span>, particularly at lower elevations where a well-developed drainage system permits
         efficient evacuation of water.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Just as the melting margins of Greenland were beginning to seem like an outsized alpine
         glacier with its seasonal see-saw between efficient and inefficient subglacial drainage,
         borehole studies highlighted limits to the inland extent of an efficient drainage
         system
         <span><a>11</a></span> and the importance of hydraulically isolated regions of the bed
         <span><a>12</a></span>. While persistent surface-to-bed connections appear to have little influence on long-term
         ice flux, the wider implications of supraglacial lake drainage remain murky. A Greenland-wide
         assessment revealed a regionally differentiated response, with fewer drainage events
         in areas experiencing the greatest dynamic mass losses
         <span><a>13</a></span>. Though lakes are projected to form further inland with rising temperatures and poised
         to deliver water to increasingly sensitive areas of the bed
         <span><a>14</a></span>, whether lake drainage will be effective at these inland sites is unclear.
