 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite remote sensing is now able to provide regular ice-sheet-wide snapshots of ice-surface velocities and net mass changes (e.g. NASA MEaSUREs program), while ground-based and airborne geophysical data (e.g. through Operation IceBridge) also play an important role in spatially extended studies. But many hydrological variables remain challenging to observe, let alone predict. Supraglacial channels of several metres width are visible from space, but depths and water fluxes are difficult to obtain. Discrete injection of meltwater through moulins is a key feature of the drainage system, but predicting moulin formation can be challenging. The englacial and subglacial drainage systems are almost entirely obscured from view, directly observable only at the point-scale through labour-intensive borehole drilling or natural portals such as moulins. Models of ice-sheet hydrology, still in their infancy, tend to resolve individual conduit elements, making efficient coupling with large-scale ice-flow models still a thing of the future. They also require parameterization of metre-scale bed roughness and higher resolution bed topography than is widely available.</p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Continued progress will require sustained efforts to better image the ice-sheet interior and bed as well as coastal bathymetry, combined with data assimilation exercises such as BedMachine designed to produce seamless and self-consistent public datasets

  </span> and roughness at multiple scales would help reduce unnecessary ambiguity for models. From surface to bed to ice front, we also need to exercise creativity in upscaling process-based studies, and vigilance in the unavoidable geographical biases imposed by field logistics. Productive partnerships between disciplinary specialists will move the science forward fastest, as demonstrated in grassroots initiatives like GRISO (

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a community, we have developed a nuanced understanding of the impact of surface meltwater on the dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet, but ice sheets are more than just their net contributions to global sea level. They sculpt landscapes, deliver sediment, solutes and nutrients to the ocean, gravitationally shape our coastlines and influence global climate. Although the threat of surface meltwater to Greenlandâ€™s stability does not appear as grave as it once did, the details of how and where meltwater is stored, how it is ultimately transported through the ice sheet to the ocean, and what physical, chemical and biological effects it has along the way should be priorities for future research. There we have barely scratched the surface.</p>
