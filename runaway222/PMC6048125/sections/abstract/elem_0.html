      <p>Detection, attribution and projection of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet has
         been a central focus of the glaciological community, with surface meltwater thought
         to play a key role in feedbacks that could accelerate sea-level rise. While the prospect
         of runaway sliding has faded, much remains uncertain when it comes to the role of
         surface runoff and subglacial discharge in Greenlandâ€™s future.
