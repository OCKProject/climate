         <p>Greenland melt and mass loss, global sea level and related research. Published research
            on Greenland Ice Sheet hydrology and dynamics, broadly defined, has increased sharply
            this century (grey bars), against a backdrop of increasing surface melt (blue), ongoing
            ice-sheet mass loss (black) and rising global sea levels (orange). Publications from
            Web of Science with manual additions/deletions. Ice-sheet-wide melt anomalies from
            RACMO2.3p2, statistically downscaled from 5.5 to 1 km (unpublished data from B.P.Y.
