 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the economics, energy use is 0.14 Giga tons of carbon per trillion dollars of world GDP (initially $73T) amounting to 10 GtC of emissions. The initial cost of fossil fuel is 7% of GDP or $515/tC, and we assume cost rises at 0.1% per year to capture higher costs as less fossil fuel reserves remain. The unit cost of fossil fuel is constant (resulting in a constant energy share in the absence of climate policy) while the unit cost of renewable increases as their share in the energy mix rises. The corresponding price elasticity is 0.55 and the rate of technical progress in carbon-free energy is 1.25% per year. Sequestration is not captured explicitly in the DICE model. We assume that the cost of sequestration is initially quite high, namely 20% of GDP (or $2936/tC), and declines at the same rate of technical progress as renewables (at a rate of 1.25% per year). We set the cost of global warming at 1.9% of world GDP (measured in trillions of dollars) for every trillion ton of carbon.

 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We adopt the geophysics from the model of Golosov et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2014</a>) and assume that 20% of carbon emissions remain forever in the atmosphere and the remainder returns back to the surface of the oceans and the earth at a speed of 0.23% per year. We add a mean lag of 10 years between the rise in temperature and the change in the stock of atmospheric carbon. Following Allen (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2016</a>), we let the transient climate response to cumulative emissions be 2 °C per trillion tons of carbon.
 </p>
 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the ethics and the costs and benefits of climate policies in the near and very distant future are open for debate and to a much lesser extent the geophysics too, the assumptions in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> are to a certain extent subjective. Our framework, however, allows us to investigate the effects of changing these assumptions on optimal climate policies in a transparent, straightforward way (see Sects. 
  <a rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec6">6</a>–
  <a rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec13">9</a>).

 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given our benchmark calibration in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, the solid black and short-dashed blue lines in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> are the outcomes under the optimal climate policies and under business as usual (BAU) where the carbon price is zero, respectively. Our simple rule for the optimal carbon price starts at $44/tC (or $12/tCO
  <sub>2</sub>) and then grows in line with the trend rate of economic growth at 2% per year—see the top panel. The black solid line in the bottom panel shows that the mitigation rate starts at 16% and then rises to 100% in 86 years, growing on average at 2% per year. Pricing carbon leads to 1.5% of the remaining fossil fuel emissions being sequestrated initially (see the red dotted line in the bottom panel of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Following (2), sequestration increases at a progress-adjusted growth rate of 3.25% per year. By the end of the carbon ear, a total of 784 GtC have been emitted, inducing peak warming of 2.9 °C early in the next century due to the 10-year average lag in the climate system.

    <p>Optimal climate policy under hyperbolic discounting. 
     <span class="italic">Key</span> Under hyperbolic discounting without commitment (green dashed-dotted lines) climate policy is more ambitious than under exponential discounting (black lines), where less weight is placed on future generations’ welfare. Even in the absence of a carbon price (blue short-dashed lines) fossil fuels are slowly phased out due to the advance of carbon-free technologies. Carbon prices can be compared to the less plausible case of hyperbolic discounting with pre-commitment (brown long-dashed lines). (Color figure online)

Without the carbon price stick, no sequestration efforts will be undertaken, increasing emissions further. If no additional policy measures are imposed (such as fuel standards, renewable subsidies, a moratorium on coal, etc.), BAU leads to cumulative emissions of 1778 GtC and peak warming of 4.9 °C. Positive mitigation levels under BAU are solely driven by the gradual improvements in the cost competitiveness of renewable energy.

 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite its simplicity, our IAM compare well with the fully-fledged DICE-2013R model to which we have calibrated our model parameters. In the absence of population growth, DICE reports an initial carbon price of $48/tC and mitigation rate of 17%. The rates of growth of the carbon price and mitigation are, however, significantly slower and cumulative emissions higher due to DICE’s long temperature lag of more than 100 years. In our simulations we have also verified that the approximation of a constant consumption share, used in our simple rule (7), is reasonable for our chosen calibration. Along the policy paths shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, this ratio varies between 93% and 90% over time, since energy and damages constitutes only a modest share of GDP along an optimal path where climate damages are limited.
