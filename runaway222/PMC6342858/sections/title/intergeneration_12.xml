 <p id="Par69" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The top part of Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> also indicates that higher intergenerational inequality aversion within our benchmark model with (benchmark) exponential discounting makes climate policy more lacklustre, given continued economic growth. By increasing 
  <span class="italic">IIA</span> from 1.45 to 2, the interest rate increases from 4.4% to 5.5% per year and consumption of current generations is judged as more valuable. Less stringent climate policy is enacted. The carbon price falls to $28/tC and the carbon budget and peak warming increase to 966 GtC and 3.2 °C, respectively.
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn14" href="#Fn14">14</a> Note that the effect of 
  <span class="italic">IIA</span> is stronger if the trend rate of economic growth is higher and future generations are relatively more affluent.
