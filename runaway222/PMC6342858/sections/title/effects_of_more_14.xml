 <p id="Par72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A slowdown in global economic growth to 
  <span class="italic">g</span> = 1% per year makes future generations less affluent relative to current generations and thus makes current generations more willing to make sacrifices to curb future global warming as is evident from the decrease in the 
  <span class="italic">SDR</span> especially if the 
  <span class="italic">IIA</span> is high. The initial carbon price increases to $55/tC. There is an offsetting effect since a lower growth rate of the economy also means a lower growth rate of damages from global warming, which pushes down the 
  <span class="italic">SDR</span> and depresses carbon pricing. The former effect dominates, since our benchmark calibration has 
  <span class="italic">IIA</span> &gt; 1. A lower rate of economic growth also reduces the growth rate of the carbon price. Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> shows that for our benchmark calibration the initial increase outweighs the slower growth of the optimal carbon price. As a result, carbon emissions and global warming are curbed by 155 GtC or 0.3 °C.
