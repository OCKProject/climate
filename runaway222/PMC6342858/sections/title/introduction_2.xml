 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our aim is to present a back-on-the-envelope integrated assessment framework that can be used to derive optimal climate policies in a transparent and intuitive way. Climate policy has to deal with several intertemporal, geophysical, and interregional aspects.</p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To discuss these issues, we use a framework consisting of an economic part (to describe the use of fossil fuel use and its substitute renewable energy, carbon sequestration with trend growth and sector-specific rates of technical progress, global damages to economic production) and a climate part (to describe the dynamics of atmospheric carbon and global mean temperature). This framework allows us to derive welfare-maximising climate policies as simples rules for the optimal carbon price (equal to the social cost of carbon), the rate at which renewable energies are substituted for fossil fuel, the fraction of fossil that is abated by carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), the optimal timing of the transition to the carbon-free era, the maximum cumulative emissions (or the carbon budget for short) and the maximum warming level, and the amount of fossil fuel locked up forever in the crust of the earth. The geophysical, ethical and economic drivers of climate policy can thus clearly be identified.</p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We highlight various features. Regarding the ethics of climate policy, we allow discount rates to decline with the horizon at which costs and benefits are evaluated. Since the costs of global warming occur many decades or even centuries into the future, this has important implications for policy. This feature is known as hyperbolic discounting and has been put forward by Laibson (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">1997</a>). Following von Below (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2012</a>), Schmitt (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2014</a>), Belfiori (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2017</a>), and Barrage (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2018</a>) we also allow policy makers to have a lower ethical discount rate than the market. Both these features allow us to take a stance between the low discount rate used by Stern (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2007</a>) and the high discount rate used by Nordhaus (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2008</a>): policy makers use lower discount rates for long-run than for short-run appraisal of costs and benefits 
  <span class="italic">and</span> may be more farsighted than the market. Both features generally lead to time inconsistency. Given simplifying assumptions, problems of commitment do not arise in our model.
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" href="#Fn1">1</a> Regarding the geophysical drivers of climate policy, apart from our benchmark of simple linear carbon and temperature dynamics used by atmospheric physicists (e.g., Joos et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2013</a>; Allen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2016</a>; Aengenheyster et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2018</a>) and economists (e.g., Hassler and Krusell 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2012</a>; Golosov et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2014</a>; van den Bijgaart et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2016</a>; Rezai and van der Ploeg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2016</a>; Gerlagh and Liski 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2018</a>), we also allow for a model of carbon dynamics with the positive feedback loop that get unleashed as the capacity of the oceans to absorb carbon diminishes (Millar et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">2017</a>). Finally, regarding the political drivers of climate policy, we extend our simple rules to allow for non-cooperative decision making to illustrate the point of international free riding and the less ambitious climate policies that result from this (Barrett 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2003</a>). This addresses the problem of free riding and is relevant as long as there are no international climate deals with appropriate international transfers to ensure that the global carbon price indeed gets implemented throughout the world economy.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our objective is not to present any novel theoretical results, but to present a simple framework that is consistent with a large and sometimes hard to comprehend integrated assessment literature. We have used our framework for undergraduate and graduate teaching and in discussions with policy makers and interested lay persons. We have found it useful to highlight the drivers on climate policy and to illustrate various assumptions regarding the ethics, economics, geophysics and politics underlying climate policy.
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2" href="#Fn2">2</a>
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our contribution ties in with the emerging literature on simple and robust rules for the optimal carbon price (e.g., Nordhaus 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">1991</a>; Golosov et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2014</a>; Rezai and van der Ploeg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2016</a>; van den Bijgaart et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2016</a>; Allen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2016</a>; Dietz and Venmans 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2018</a>; van der Ploeg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2018</a>; van den Bremer and van der Ploeg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2018</a>). We also offer simple rules for the optimal transition time to the carbon-free era and the amount of locked up fossil fuel. These simple rules take advantage of the much faster convergence of Ramsey economic growth dynamics than that of the carbon cycle, thus greatly simplifying the complexity of the underlying system. The resulting rules are easy to understand, calculate, explain, and communicate. Furthermore, being simple feedback rules, they appear robust to different model specifications as they perform well in a wide variety of integrated assessment models (Rezai and van der Ploeg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2016</a>; van den Bijgaart et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2016</a>; Barrage 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A multitude of very large and detailed Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) of the economy and the climate are able to generate numerical simulations of the optimal global price of carbon, the implied optimal substitution rates of renewable energies for fossil fuel, and the optimal sequestration rates. Although such IAMs give careful suggestions for climate policies, the key determinants of these are difficult to understand. Furthermore, it has been argued that in providing exact numbers they appear more precise than the underlying science would permit and misrepresent the deep uncertainties surrounding global warming damages and the social cost of carbon (e.g., Pindyck 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2013</a>; Wagner and Weitzman 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2015</a>; Stern 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2016</a>). We therefore prefer a clear and transparent approach in which all the drivers of climate policy are immediately apparent. To our benefit, recent insights in atmospheric science suggest that global warming is well explained by cumulative carbon emissions rather than the stock of carbon in the atmosphere (e.g., Allen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2016</a>), even though large-scale IAMs have sophisticated and high-dimensional models to describe the carbon cycle and temperature responses to emission impulses.
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our back-on-the-envelope IAM is adapted from the most widely-used IAM, i.e., DICE (Dynamic integrated model of climate and the economy; Nordhaus 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2008</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2014</a>). In this IAM economic activity requires energy in production which in turn is generated using a continuum of technologies and energy sources. The energy mix with the lowest unit costs use fossil energy use only and have the largest amount of carbon emission per unit of energy. As more renewable energies are substituted for fossil fuel, the cost per unit of energy becomes more expensive whilst the carbon emissions per unit of energy fall. This substitution is driven by a spectrum of carbon-free technologies, ranging from energy-saving to renewable energy generation in combination with gas-fired power plants. The most expensive fuel mix is fully carbon-free and is referred to as the “backstop” technology. Given our current technological knowledge, one can think of this backstop as CCS which takes carbon directly out of the atmosphere when using fossil fuel and then stores it underground as the most carbon-persistent production processes (such as metallurgical ones or air travel) cannot be decarbonised at current capabilities. We thus make explicit the difference between 
  <span class="italic">substitution of less carbon</span>-
  <span class="italic">intensive fuel in the energy mix</span>
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3" href="#Fn3">3</a> and 
  <span class="italic">carbon capture and sequestration</span>. This distinction is important as both instruments differ in their long-term effects: renewable energy create a legacy of unused fossil fuel deposits which can become economically lucrative if future policy becomes less ambitious while CCS bear the risk of leakage (Belfiori and Iverson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Like DICE, our benchmark IAM computes cumulative carbon use and does not speak to the issue of stranded carbon assets directly. However, we include an extension where the cost of extracting fossil fuel rises as less reserves are left in situ, which allows the economic analysis of stranded carbon assets too. We also give extensions to allow for research and development in renewable energy production and for CCS becoming more expensive as available CO
  <sub>2</sub> reservoirs are being used up.
