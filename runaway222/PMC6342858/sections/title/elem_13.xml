  <p id="Par72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A slowdown in global economic growth to 
   <span class="italic">g</span> = 1% per year makes future generations less affluent relative to current generations and thus makes current generations more willing to make sacrifices to curb future global warming as is evident from the decrease in the 
   <span class="italic">SDR</span> especially if the 
   <span class="italic">IIA</span> is high. The initial carbon price increases to $55/tC. There is an offsetting effect since a lower growth rate of the economy also means a lower growth rate of damages from global warming, which pushes down the 
   <span class="italic">SDR</span> and depresses carbon pricing. The former effect dominates, since our benchmark calibration has 
   <span class="italic">IIA</span> &gt; 1. A lower rate of economic growth also reduces the growth rate of the carbon price. Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> shows that for our benchmark calibration the initial increase outweighs the slower growth of the optimal carbon price. As a result, carbon emissions and global warming are curbed by 155 GtC or 0.3 °C.

  <p id="Par73" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DICE calibration used in our benchmark calibration is arguably too pessimistic about the potential of carbon-free technologies. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and the bottom part of Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> therefore show the effects of doubling the speed of technological progress in carbon-free technologies (
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">R</span>
   </sub> = 2.5% per year) and of a breakthrough in sequestration technology, lowering the initial cost of full sequestration to that of renewable energies (
   <span class="italic">A</span>
   <sub>1</sub> = 822 $/tC). Note from Result 1 that these cost variations leave the carbon price unchanged, but do affect the deployment of renewables and sequestration technologies and thereby the carbon budget and peak warming.
  </p>
  <p id="Par74" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Doubling the speed in renewable innovation, 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">R</span>
   </sub>, ramps up the adoption rate of renewables in the energy mix which reaches complete decarbonisation 16 years earlier than under the DICE-calibrated baseline. The carbon budget is reduced to 315 GtC and peak warming curbed to 2.2 °C. A technological breakthrough in sequestration, lowering the cost of decarbonisation under complete sequestration to that of full decarbonisation, has little effect on the statistics reported in Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>. The cost reduction in sequestration relative to renewables lowers initial substitution efforts in the energy mix slightly while tripling sequestration. The cheap availability of sequestration leads to less emissions left unabated but pushes back the carbon-free era by over a decade. The carbon budget falls by 114 GtC and peak warming to 2.6 °C.
  </p>
  <p id="Par75" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given a strategy to price carbon, energy mix mitigation and sequestration policies can take on the two regimes discussed in Sect. 
   <a rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec4">4</a>. While regime I with partial sequestration dominates in most simulations, regime II with full sequestration occurs under the sequestration breakthrough scenario. After a long phase 1 with partial sequestration, full sequestration (phase 2) occurs briefly at the end of century before all fossil fuel is removed from the energy mix shortly after. Allen (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2016</a>) assumes that, while getting rid of all fossil fuel is never cost-effective, the share of renewables in the energy mix rises steadily with temperature over time and sequestrated emissions grow exponentially with sequestration continuing indefinitely. Our framework demonstrates important interactions between both policy instruments: once all emissions are sequestrated in phase 2, the replacement of fossil fuel by renewables stalls and rises more slowly as the pressure to limit climate change has been alleviated and relative cost considerations are the only determinants of the optimal policy mix between sequestration and substitution. In general, calibrated simulations show that bringing more renewable in the energy mix is the most important lever to avoid climate change with sequestration lowering transitions during the transition to the carbon-free era.
