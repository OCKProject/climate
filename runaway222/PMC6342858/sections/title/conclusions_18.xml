 <p id="Par92" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The central questions of climate policy are how much and how fast to replace fossil fuel with renewable energies in the energy mix; how much and how fast to sequestrate emissions from using fossil fuel; and how to set the initial and future prices of carbon both under non-cooperative and cooperative decision making in the global economy to achieve these goals. Much of the academic debate in climate change economics has focused on the difference of various estimates for the optimal carbon price, perhaps most prominently in the debate between Nordhaus and Stern about discount rates. We present a simple framework with which these questions can be meaningfully addressed without resorting to one of the large-scale numerical Integrated Assessment Models. Our back-of-the-envelope Integrated Assessment Model provides simple rules for the optimal price of carbon and for optimal share of renewables in the energy mix and sequestration policies and allows translation of these into climate objectives such as carbon budgets and peak warming. Our framework calculates the welfare-maximising carbon price but also pays attention to the dynamics of the technological capabilities available at different points of time. The carbon price and relative cost competitiveness determine the adoption and diffusion rate of carbon-free technologies. We see our analysis as complementary to more detailed, often numerical, simulations as we focus on the key drivers and ignore potential cross-interactions between capital accumulation and climate policy. Our aim was to develop a simple and easy-to-understand framework that brings together various aspects of climate change economics and can be used for teaching and for communication to policy makers to illustrate four key messages.</p>
 <p id="Par93" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, the optimal price of carbon and the ambition of climate policy are crucially driven by ethical considerations such as the discount rate and relative intergenerational inequality aversion on how to trade off the welfare of future and current generations. In a DICE-based calibration with a constant rate of time preference of 1.5% per year the current carbon price is $44/tC (or $12/tCO
  <sub>2</sub>) which increases to $146/tC if one adopts the discount rate of the Stern Review. We have shown how the standard framework with exponential discounting can be extended to allow for high discount rates at short horizons and much lower discount rates at long horizons by adopting a hyperbolic discounting approach. This hybrid case, which is our preferred estimate, respects the criticism of Nordhaus and Stern of each other’s approach and significantly boosts the optimal price of carbon to $92/tC (or $25/tCO
  <sub>2</sub>) and the speed at which fossil fuel is removed from the energy mix and emissions are sequestered to limit peak warming to 2.3 °C. Our framework takes into account that future policymakers might not want to respect the past climate pledges; our solution does not assume commitment. If future policymakers could commit to announcements about future policies, climate policy is more ambitious but time-inconsistent. The ability to commit, however, has minor implications for the carbon budget and peak warming.

 <p id="Par94" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, the qualitative nature of climate policy depends on how the economic and global warming costs of renewable and fossil energies and sequestration develop with time. If technical progress in renewable energy production is fast compared with that in developing sequestration technology, the economy replaces all fossil fuel by renewable energies (100% mitigation) before all fossil fuel is fully sequestrated. If technological progress in sequestration is relatively fast or if there is a breakthrough in sequestration technology, there will be an intermediate regime where all fossil fuel is fully sequestered before the economy finally transitions to using only renewable energies. During this intermediate phase of full sequestration, the urgency of climate policy recedes and the share of renewables in energy generation stalls. Due to current cost conditions and the ugly dynamics of NIMBY politics and running out of holes to put sequestrated carbon in, this second regime appears unlikely.</p>
 <p id="Par95" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, as far as the geophysics is concerned, using a 4-box instead of a 2-box model of the carbon does not affect the optimal carbon price much. But allowing for the capacity of the oceans to absorb CO
  <sub>2</sub> to diminish as oceans heat up, pushes up the optimal carbon price somewhat in order to avoid such positive feedback loops being set in motion.
 </p>
 <p id="Par96" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fourth, lack of international climate deals implies that carbon pricing and thus climate policies are nationally determined and lacklustre with the result that the necessary transition to the carbon-free era is much delayed and peak warming increases by an additional 1.1 °C. Part of the problem is failure of the rich countries to compensate the poor countries adequately for implementing an ambitious carbon price. This is why it is crucial to start with a club of countries who implement ambitious climate policies and generate mechanisms to get as many countries to join. A relatively low penalty trade tariff on countries outside the club of 5%, waived once they join, can lead to large and stable coalitions of countries and overcome free-riding in international climate policy (Nordhaus

 </p>
 <p id="Par97" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is straightforward to extend these back-of-the-envelope calculations to allow for more convex damages, stock-dependent fossil fuel extraction costs, sequestration costs that increase with the stock of sequestrated carbon, and learning by doing in renewables production (see “Appendix 
  <a rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec19">5</a>”). Since there is mounting evidence that climate policy shapes technological progress and research &amp; development and that directed technical change and path dependence matters (e.g., Acemoglu et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2016</a>; Aghion et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2016</a>), it is important to allow for such endogenous feedbacks.
 </p>
 <p id="Par98" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis solely considered climate-related damages to the economy without considering other non-climate implications of carbon-based processes. According to some estimates, such costs to health and well-being are of the same magnitude as the climate-related damages and might be important drivers of climate policy in certain regions (West et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">2012</a>; Ščasný, et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2015</a>). E.g., while our regional analysis suggests that China should adopt few efforts to eliminate fossil fuel from the energy mix in the absence of a climate deal, non-climate co-benefits have been the key motivation for decarbonisation of industrial processes and fast ramping-up of renewable energy sources in this region. Our simple rules could be easily extended to include such additional costs of fossil fuels by adjusting the damage coefficients and thus the carbon price upwards.
 </p>
 <p id="Par99" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our simple framework may give too cautious answers as more convex global warming damages, damages to the growth rate of the economy and the risk of a cascade of catastrophic events which are more likely to occur at higher temperatures lead to a more aggressive climate policy (Dietz and Stern 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>; Rezai and van der Ploeg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2016</a>; Lemoine and Traeger 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2016</a>; Cai et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2016</a>), but can be extended to allow for such factors. If future climate policy turns out to be not ambitious enough and takes too long to materialise, there will be no other option than to attempt to curb negative carbon emissions via bio-energy with CCS, direct air capture or enhanced weathering as these forms of “negative emissions” may be needed to bridge the gap between cuts to meet global mitigation targets and current emissions trends (e.g., Fuss, et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, as can be seen from Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>, the usual DICE damages lead to peak global warming higher than 2 °C (unless one uses the very low discount rate of the Stern Review or the very low long-run discount rates that prevail under hyperbolic discounting with commitment). This contradicts the aims of the 2016 Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2 °C and to aim to for peak warming of 1.5 °C. The Paris caps on peak global warming are, on the one hand, scientifically motivated as higher temperatures would lead to intolerably high risks of tipping points, and, on the other hand, politically motivated to keep small island states that are at risk of flooding aboard. One approach is to revise the damages from global warming upwards to ensure that peak global warming remains below 2 °C or 1.5 °C. The integrated assessment literature, in contrast, ignores damages from global warming altogether and minimises the present discounted value of costs subject to the constraint that peak warming cannot exceed 2 °C or 1.5 °C or alternatively that cumulative carbon emissions stay within the safe carbon budget corresponding to the cap on global warming. The resulting price of carbon must rise more rapidly to reflect that carbon gets scarcer as the carbon budget approaches exhaustion. In fact, the carbon price follows a Hotelling path and thus rises more rapidly at a rate equal to the rate of interest instead of the rate of economic growth (e.g., Nordhaus 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">1982</a>; Tol 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2013</a>; Bauer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2015</a>).
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn21" href="#Fn21">21</a> One way of integrating the welfare maximisation approach based on estimates of global warming and the cost minimisation approach based on a cap on global warming or cumulative emissions is to maximise welfare net of global warming subject to the cap on peak warming or cumulative emissions. This gives a cost-minimising price of carbon that is higher than under unconstrained welfare maximization and that grows at a rate somewhere in between the interest rate and the rate of economic growth (van der Ploeg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2018</a>; Dietz and Venmans 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2018</a>).
