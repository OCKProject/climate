The rate of directed technical change of rate of 1.3% per year is chosen to match the cost of 1.6% of GDP for full decarbonisation in 100 years, again based on DICE. The cost of carbon-based energy increases by 0.1% per year to capture resource scarcity and match baseline emissions scenarios of the EMF-22 (Nordhaus

The cost of full sequestration is calibrated to initial 20% of GDP, falls at the rate of non-carbon technologies, and decreases to 5.7% of GDP in 100 years. Given that there is large uncertainty around the technological prospects of CCS and other abatement technologies, we conduct sensitivity analyses around them in Sect.
