  <p>
   <span class="italic">Key</span> With exponential discounting there is a constant discount rate of 1.5% per year. Hyperbolic discounting starts with the same initial discount rate which then drops off over time to 0.1% per year in a century’s time. This leads to a much more ambitious climate policy with higher carbon taxes, higher sequestration and mitigation rates, lower carbon budgets and a quicker end of the fossil era. As a result, peak warming is less than with exponential discounting and much less than under business as usual. If commitment to future climate policies is feasible, carbon is initially taxed the same but then it grows at a faster rate so that climate policy is more ambitious. The value of commitment is small as it lowers the carbon budget by mere 52 GtC and peak warming by 0.1 °C. Under business as usual no carbon price is imposed and relative cost advances in renewable energy are the sole driver of decarbonisation. Here, the carbon era ends in the 22nd century with an excessive carbon budget and extreme levels of warming
