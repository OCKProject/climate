  <p>Non-cooperative regional climate policies. 
   <span class="italic">Key</span> Failure to reach a global climate deal increases emissions. Each country tries to avoid its own damages but ignores those inflicted on others.

Europe with high levels of exposure and income decarbonises first; China with low exposure and income takes longest to drive emissions to zero. (Color figure online)
