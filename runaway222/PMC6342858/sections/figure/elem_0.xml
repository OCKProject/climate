  <p>Optimal climate policy under hyperbolic discounting. 
   <span class="italic">Key</span> Under hyperbolic discounting without commitment (green dashed-dotted lines) climate policy is more ambitious than under exponential discounting (black lines), where less weight is placed on future generations’ welfare. Even in the absence of a carbon price (blue short-dashed lines) fossil fuels are slowly phased out due to the advance of carbon-free technologies. Carbon prices can be compared to the less plausible case of hyperbolic discounting with pre-commitment (brown long-dashed lines). (Color figure online)
