 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simulated snow conditions for each day are associated to every pixel within the gravitational envelope of a given ski resort based on its main geographical features: elevation, slope angle, slope aspect and whether the pixel is within the snowmaking envelope. A daily snow reliability index (%) is then defined as the fraction of the surface area of the gravitational envelope with a minimum quantity of snow for skiing (100 kg m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, corresponding to 20 cm of snow at 500 kg m
  <span class="sup">−3</span> typical density on ski slopes). The snow reliability index of a ski resort is derived from the means of daily indices of Christmas (20 December to 5 January) and February (5 February to 5 March) holidays, with a 17% weight on the Christmas period and 83% weight on the February period. The use of these time periods and this partitioning between Christmas and February was found to maximize the statistical relationship between the obtained snow reliability index and ski lift tickets sales at the scale of the French Alps

  </span>. Based on the snow reliability index computed with the SAFRAN reanalysis over the historical period (1958–2016) for groomed snow conditions (no snowmaking), a snow scarcity threshold was defined as the percentile 20% of annual values (Q20). A bootstrap method was applied (n = 10 000 re-sampling of snow reliability index values) to provide a 90% confidence interval for the Q20. The lower boundary of the 90% confidence interval was defined as the snow scarcity threshold Q20 so as to be sure to isolate snow seasons with marked snow scarcity. The frequency of seasons with snow reliability index lower than the Q20 were computed based on climate model experiments and further referred to as the frequency of snow-scarce seasons. The annual water volume for snowmaking was computed for every ski resort based on the simulated amount of machine-made snow for every pixel within the snowmaking envelope, depending on the snowmaking coverage (15%, 30% and 45%). The annual French Alps water volume for snowmaking is the sum of all ski resorts water volume, expressed in millions of cubic meters (Mm
  <span class="sup">3</span>). For every winter season beyond 1985, we assumed a linear evolution of the snowmaking coverage between 1985 (0%) and 2005 (15%), between 2005 (15%) and 2015 (30%), and between 2015 (30%) and 2025 (45%). Beyond 2025, we considered that the snowmaking coverage would no longer increase (45%). For any given winter season, the snow reliability index, the frequency of snow-scarce seasons and the water volume were computed based on the simulated data for 15, 30 and 45% snowmaking coverage and on the value for this specific winter season (linear interpolation).
