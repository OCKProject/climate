  <span class="italic">“Services Techniques de Remontées Mécaniques et Transports Guidés”</span> (STRMTG) manages an exhaustive database of cable transportation equipments in France, which includes technical characteristics of each ski lift. This includes the ski lift power (SLP) of each ski lift, which is defined as the product of the elevation difference between the bottom and the top of a ski lift (in km) and its flow of persons per hour (pers h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). It is expressed in pers km h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. These data are completed with geographical information from the database BDTOPO (25 m of resolution) developed by the French Geographical Institute (IGN). We used the representation of ski slopes named gravitational envelopes
  <span class="sup">

  </span>, derived from ski-lift locations and defined as the ensemble of points which can be reached from both the bottom and the top of a ski lift. We considered three different snowmaking coverage of ski areas: 15%, 30% and 45%, corresponding to the actual value in 2003

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>, respectively. Their spatial distribution of snowmaking units is inferred from the altitudinal and geospatial structure of ski resorts, allowing to compute a snowmaking envelop for each value of the snowmaking coverage
