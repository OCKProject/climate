 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The time evolution of the snow-related indicators (fractional snow reliability index, frequency of seasons below the Q20, water volume for snowmaking) was computed for groomed snow conditions with and without snowmaking, for historical and future climate scenarios. The 15-yr multi-model percentiles of annual values (5%, 17%, 50%, 83% and 95%, respectively referred to as the Q5, Q17, Q50, Q83 and Q95) were computed and are displayed in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>. This illustrates not only the long-term trend but also the interannual variability. The mean and standard deviation of multi model 15-yr averages were also computed (displayed on Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), thereby suppressing most of the effects of the interannual variability. This focuses on long-term trends and uncertainty on the climate modeling

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> based on 20-year periods (1986–2005, 2030–2050 and 2080–2100). Relationships between snow-related indicators and global warming level were computed as 20-year averages for the reference period (1986–2005) and for three 30-year periods for the beginning of century (2011–2040), middle of century (2041–2070), and end of century (2071–2100), for all available GCM/RCM pairs and RCPs. For each GCM–RCM pair and a given RCP and period, the global surface air temperature change was computed with respect to the pre-industrial period (1851–1880) from the corresponding GCM run for the given RCP. The computed values of snow-related indicators were binned according to the corresponding global temperature changes (±0.25 °C): +1.5 °C, +2 °C, +3 °C, +4 °C, +5 °C.
