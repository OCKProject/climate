   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span> allows taking into account the grooming and snowmaking effects on snow properties so as to provide simulations of snow conditions on ski slopes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. The model explicitly simulates physical processes within the snowpack (e.g. snow metamorphism, compaction, heat conduction, melt/freeze and liquid water percolation) and at its boundaries with the overlying atmosphere (full surface energy and mass balance) and underlying ground. The natural snow version of Crocus (without snow management) performed well in a recent snowpack model intercomparison exercise
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. The physical impacts of grooming are simulated (enhanced densification and mixing of layers) and machine-made snow can be added to the snowpack specifying the production rate and conditions for triggering the production (wet-bulb temperature threshold, target quantity or target snow depth), with management rules depending on the periods of the winter season, accordingly to current snowmaking practices in ski resorts

Between December 15 and February 28, snow is produced if meteorologically possible so as to maintain a total snow depth of 60 cm. After March 1, no more snow is produced. The snowmaking instantaneous production rate was set to 1.2 10
