 <div class="caption">
  <p>Relationship to global warming level of (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) the snow reliability index, (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) the frequency of snow seasons below the snow scarcity threshold (Q20) and (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) water demand associated to the production of snow, accounting for grooming only (0% snowmaking coverage) and a 45% snowmaking coverage. The global surface air temperature change was computed with respect to the pre-industrial period (1851â€“1880). The mean value, standard deviation (error bars) and outliers are shown (see Methods). n is the number of GCM/RCM pairs within a given temperature bin.
