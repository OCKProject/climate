  <p>Evolution of the snow reliability index (%) and water volume (Mm
   <span class="sup">3</span>) for snowmaking of French Alps ski resorts for the reference period 1986–2005, near future (2030–2050) and end of century (2080–2100), depending on the RCP scenario and the snowmaking coverage (in % of total ski slopes surface area). Snow reliability values below the snow scarcity threshold (Q20) are highlighted in orange. Water volumes over three times the 95% percentile value (Q95) of the reference period are highlighted in blue. Note that years contributing to a given quantile for the snow reliability index do not necessarily contribute to the same quantile in terms of water volume for snowmaking.
