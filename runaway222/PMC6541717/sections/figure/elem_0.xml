  <p>Mean and standard deviation across multiple model estimates of 20-yr averages of the fractional snow reliability index for groomed snow conditions (top) and groomed snow conditions plus a 45% snowmaking coverage (bottom), for the reference period (1986–2005), the near future (2030–2050, RCP 8.5) and the end of century (2080–2100, RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6, surrounded by red dashed lines) for the 23 massifs of the French Alps. Pie diagrams display the 20 year multi-model massif-scale snow reliability index, the diameter being proportional to the total ski-lift power within each massif. Background colors display the standard deviation around the mean. Situation of the 129 ski resorts covered in the present study and of the main cities in the French Alps (lower left).</p>
