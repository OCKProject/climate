Snow management, and in particular grooming and artificial snowmaking, has become a routine component of ski resort operations, holding potential for counteracting the detrimental effect of natural snow decline. However, conventional snowmaking can only operate under specific meteorological conditions. Whether snowmaking is a relevant adaptation measure under future climate change is a widely debated issue in mountainous regions, with major implications on the supply side of this tourism industry. This often lacks comprehensive scientific studies for informing public and private decisions in this sector. Here we show how climate change influences the operating conditions of one of the main ski tourism markets worldwide, the French Alps. Our study addresses snow reliability in 129 ski resorts in the French Alps in the 21st century, using a dedicated snowpack model explicitly accounting for grooming and snowmaking driven by a large ensemble of adjusted and downscaled regional climate projections, and using a geospatial model of ski resorts organization. A 45% snowmaking fractional coverage, representative of the infrastructures in the early 2020s, is projected to improve snow reliability over grooming-only snow conditions, both during the reference period 1986&#x02013;2005 and below 2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C global warming since pre-industrial. Beyond 3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C of global warming, with 45% snowmaking coverage, snow conditions would become frequently unreliable and induce higher water requirements.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Cryospheric science</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Minist&#x00026;amp;#x00E8;re de la Transition Ecologique et Solidaire, programme GICC (ADAMONT).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Grooming and snowmaking are standard snow management components in ski resorts, used to reduce the impact of the interannual variability of natural snow conditions, but are also increasingly regarded as methods to adapt to observed and projected decline of natural snow conditions in mountainous areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

While, on the demand side, behavioural research studies have demonstrated the importance of natural snow conditions on skier participation and visitation in North America and Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, assessing snow reliability on the supply side needs to account for snow management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Because snowmaking intrinsically depends on meteorological conditions (wet-bulb temperature and wind speed) and on the availability of water resources used to produce snow, it is itself climate sensitive. There is a growing number of studies addressing climate change impacts on ski resorts operations accounting for snowmaking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, although several limits need to be considered. On the technical side, the models used to simulate snow, with or without snowmaking, generally represent snow processes in a very simple way and rely on empirical temperature-based relationship to compute the melt rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. They also ignore the key role of grooming in densifying and mixing snow layers (including natural and machine-made snow layers), with implications for the physical behaviour of snow on ski slopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Natural snow conditions and machine made snow production time are often handled independently, although snow conditions on ski slopes are a joint product of these two components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Last, in-depth studies have been performed, but they operate at the local scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> without easy upscaling at the regional level. Conversely, large-scale studies often address snow reliability in ski resorts using a very limited number of locations (often only one, either at the base or in the middle of the elevation range) characterizing their geographic position and elevation, with potentially strong biases due to the imperfect representation of ski resorts spatial organization and elevation, aspect and slope of the ski slopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. It is thus needed to develop and implement methods, which represent snow management in a detailed, consistent and integrative way, but can still operate at the regional scale and be applied to a large number of ski resorts.</p><p id="Par3">The climate sensitivity of French winter tourism has only recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> received specific attention although France is a major ski destination. Indeed, the European Alps represent 43% of worldwide skier visits mainly shared between France and Austria which are both in the top 3 ski destinations in the world with more than 50&#x02009;millions of skier visits each year (51.1&#x02009;millions for the snow season 2016&#x02013;2017, more than 15% of the worldwide skier visits)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The French Alps are the main ski area&#x000a0;in France with 84% of national ski-lift facilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Tourism services support a large part of direct or indirect employment in mountain communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Far-reaching&#x000a0;political decisions have been made over the past decades in terms of the support offered by public authorities to this economic sector. As an example, subsidies for ski resorts considered at too low elevation to be sustainable in the long term were cut in the past<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and&#x000a0;massive support of snowmaking equipment regardless of an assessment of&#x000a0;the long-term climatic feasibility was implemented after a change of regional political orientation. This policy has recently been criticized by the French Court of Auditors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, on the basis of natural snow depth records and climate projections. This illustrates the conundrum faced by public and private decision makers at national, regional and local levels in part&#x000a0;due to the lack of appropriate information.</p><p id="Par4">In order to quantify the snow conditions in French Alps ski resorts under present and future climate conditions we used state-of-the-art climate reanalysis and projections adapted to the mountain environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> to drive a dedicated snowpack model explicitly accounting for grooming and/or snowmaking on ski slopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

We defined and computed a snow reliability index for every single ski resort for Christmas and February school break holidays i.e. two key periods for winter sports (see Methods). When aggregated at the scale of the entire French Alps (129 ski resorts sample, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), our method covers 96% of the French Alps ski-lift infrastructures.

Over the reference period (1986&#x02013;2005), four seasons show snow reliability index lower than the Q20 threshold: 1988&#x02013;1989, 1989&#x02013;1990, 1992&#x02013;1993 and 2001&#x02013;2002. The three first ones are often referred to as the &#x0201c;early 1990&#x02019;s snow-scarce seasons&#x0201d;. They revealed for the first time the dependency of Alpine winter tourism to natural snow conditions and climate variability, and played a large role for the inception and development of snowmaking in the French Alps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Snow-scarce winter seasons occurred before,&#x000a0;in 1963&#x02013;1964 and 1972&#x02013;1973, without the same impact on this emerging economic sector at the time. Since 2005, two additional snow seasons showed snow reliability index lower than the Q20 threshold: 2006&#x02013;2007 and 2016&#x02013;2017. Using a time variable snowmaking coverage value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> (Methods) and reanalysis driving data from 2001 to 2016, the annual snow reliability index and ski-lift ticket sales are significantly correlated, with correlation coefficients of 0.91, 0.89 and 0.87 for natural snow, grooming-only and managed snow conditions, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The slope of the relationship, i.e. the percentage increase in normalized skier days for a 1% increase of the reliability index amounts 0.57%, 0.68% and 1.02%, respectively. Although the correlation is slightly better between natural snow conditions and ski-lifts tickets sales than accounting for snow management, the quantitative relationship between the two, also referred to as the elasticity, is more consistent in the case where grooming and snowmaking are taken into account.

Based on climate model outputs from the historical experiments (HIST) during the reference period 1986&#x02013;2005, the median annual reliability index would increase by 10%, from 80% under no snowmaking to 90% under 45% snowmaking coverage. Figures are even more compelling for the scarcest snow seasons (Q5), showing a 50% reliability index without snowmaking, rising with snowmaking to 59% (15% snowmaking coverage) up to 74% (45% snowmaking coverage). The latter value corresponds almost to the Q20 threshold, computed without snowmaking (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Snowmaking does not make a significant difference for years with abundant snow conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Median water requirements for snowmaking with 15% snowmaking coverage amount 13&#x02009;Mm<sup>3</sup>, ranging from 10&#x02009;Mm<sup>3</sup> (Q5) to 17&#x02009;Mm<sup>3</sup> (Q95, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Water requirements are primarily driven by increases in snowmaking coverage for the period from 1985 to 2025 (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). During the time period of overlap, the results obtained from reanalysis data and for multi-model mean and deviation of historical climate model experiments (HIST) exhibit some differences. The latter shows lower snow reliability, higher frequency of snow-scarce seasons, and higher water requirements, although individual meteorological variables were bias-adjusted over the historical period. Discrepancies might therefore be related to potential biases of the multivariate distribution of the meteorological variables produced by the adjustment and downscaling method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This might result in potential nonlinear effects due to multiple dependencies especially on temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and wind-speed. A second reason might be that the reanalysis data describe one of the many possible realizations of the climate system, several of which are also probed by the ensemble of GCM/RCM pairs (only forced by greenhouse gases emissions), in a manner which does not guarantee perfect overlap between the two due to climate internal variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, comparing reanalysis and climate modeling experiments provides context for the latter and does not affect the analysis of the future climate trends.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Evolution of the snow reliability index (%) and water volume (Mm<sup>3</sup>) for snowmaking of French Alps ski resorts for the reference period 1986&#x02013;2005, near future (2030&#x02013;2050) and end of century (2080&#x02013;2100), depending on the RCP scenario and the snowmaking coverage (in % of total ski slopes surface area). Snow reliability values below the snow scarcity threshold (Q20) are highlighted in orange. Water volumes over three times the 95% percentile value (Q95) of the reference period are highlighted in blue. Note that years contributing to a given quantile for the snow reliability index do not necessarily contribute to the same quantile in terms of water volume for snowmaking.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_44068_Fig3_HTML" id="d29e510"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">Without snowmaking, the frequency of challenging snow seasons is projected to rise significantly in the near future (2030&#x02013;2050), regardless of the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The median reliability index would stand below the Q20 threshold computed over the historical period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Challenging seasons encountered once every five years in the reference period would then occur once every two years, which has strong implications for ski resort operations. At the projected snowmaking coverage of 45%, however, the 2030&#x02013;2050 median snow reliability under RCP 8.5 would equate the figure for groomed-only snow during the reference period 1986&#x02013;2005. Compared to the situation with 45% snowmaking coverage during the reference period, the snow reliability is projected to decrease for all percentiles of the annual reliability values (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This may be related to the decrease of natural snow conditions at all elevations combined to the higher occurrence of snow-scarce seasons with low production at lower elevations related to the lack of suitable meteorological conditions for snowmaking. Because of both increased requirements for snowmaking due to reduced natural snow conditions, and increasing snowmaking coverage, water requirements are projected to increase, with median requirements under a 45% snowmaking coverage rising from 35 to 42&#x02009;Mm<sup>3</sup> from 1986&#x02013;2005 to 2030&#x02013;2050 (RCP8.5), and from 47 to 54&#x02009;Mm<sup>3</sup> (Q95). Increased natural snow scarcity accounts for an additional 10 to 20% snowmaking requirements if considering a constant snowmaking coverage between the reference period and the near future. Most of the changes in water requirements for snowmaking may thus remain highly dependent on the evolution of the snowmaking coverage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">For the end of the century (2080&#x02013;2100), the evolution of snow conditions is projected to be highly dependent on the RCP (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Compared to 2030&#x02013;2050, the groomed snow reliability index is projected to remain steady (RCP 2.6), slightly decrease and stabilize (RCP 4.5) or continuously decrease (RCP 8.5). The reliability index of the most abundant snow seasons (Q95) is projected to reach values of 88% and 67% for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively, which spans the range between the Q17 and Q83 without snowmaking for the reference period 1986&#x02013;2005. Assuming a 45% snowmaking coverage, the median snow reliability index under RCP 4.5 would correspond to the median reliability index of groomed-only snow during the reference period. Under RCP 8.5, the median snow reliability index with a 45% snowmaking coverage would correspond to the Q17% of the reliability index of groomed-only snow during the reference period.</p><p id="Par10">The median, and higher percentile (Q95), of water consumption for snowmaking would amount 44 and 59&#x02009;Mm<sup>3</sup> for RCP 4.5, respectively, and 54 and 66&#x02009;Mm<sup>3</sup> for RCP 8.5, respectively. At the scale of the entire study area, the increasing occurrence of scarce snow seasons with low production due to the lack of suitable meteorological conditions is compensated by the increasing requirements at higher elevations. Hypothetically, if snowmaking coverage keeps increasing until 100% by the end of the century, the snow reliability index would range between 84% (Q5) and 98% (Q95), i.e., higher than median groomed-only snow reliability for the reference period, corresponding to annual water consumptions ranging between 88&#x02009;Mm<sup>3</sup> (Q5) and 143&#x02009;Mm<sup>3</sup> (Q95) with a median of 115&#x02009;Mm<sup>3</sup>. This would correspond to a factor 9 increase of water consumption compared to median requirements for a 15% snowmaking coverage over the reference period 1986&#x02013;2005. Similar to the current and future situation with 45% snowmaking coverage, detailed studies at the local scale are required to assess whether water could be available to fulfill this specific demand.</p><p id="Par11">Our analysis focuses on the snow reliability on ski slopes and corresponding water requirements for snowmaking at the scale of the entire French Alps, and provides critical information on the future operating capability of the French Alps ski tourism sector as an integrated production facility. However, impacts of climate change on ski resort operating conditions are heterogeneous in space (location, elevation). By design, our approach encompasses most geospatial characteristics of ski resorts, which need to be considered to aggregate information from the entire skiable area into the ski resort itself (elevation, aspect, slope, location of snowmaking facilities, location of ski lifts along with their transportation capacities etc.; see Methods). Because the location and geospatial characteristics of ski resorts in the French Alps is heterogeneous, this overall strength, in terms of realism at the resort level, makes it more difficult to draw general conclusions than methods focusing on snow reliability elevations regardless of the locations and spatial characteristics of ski resorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, several key findings can be summarized at the sub-regional level. Firstly, under current climate conditions, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> indicates that the snow reliability of French Alps ski resorts is highly heterogeneous, with higher reliability, with or without snowmaking, in the North-East of the French Alps, mostly due to the fact that the large ski resorts in such areas are at typical higher elevation, than in the West and South. Under RCP8.5 at the end of the century, the heterogeneity remains, with snow reliability index values still above 50% on average without snowmaking in the same high-elevation large ski resort area in the North East, while the snow reliability index is largely lower than 50% for most other areas. A similar contrast is visible with 45% snowmaking coverage. In terms of the trend within each sub-region and elevation range, the pattern is generally similar, due to the fact that the trend analysis is performed on an indicator (frequency of seasons below the Q20 threshold) which is normalized to the snow reliability under the current climate. Even ski resorts with a mean elevation above 2,000&#x02009;m above sea level undergo a similar increasing trend of water requirements and decreasing trend of snow reliability, compared to the reference situation under current climate. However, the choice of using a Q20 reliability index does not preclude whether situations above this threshold value are fully appropriate for skiing. It may be the case, especially in low elevation ski resorts, that the Q20 value is already lower that the threshold for minimum operating conditions. Detailed assessments analyzing results for individual ski resorts are required for such deeper exploitation of the data set used in this study.</p><p id="Par12">At the scale of the entire French Alps, our results can be analyzed&#x000a0;as a function of the level of&#x000a0;global warming since the pre-industrial period, in complement to future scenarios. Using a multi-scenario time sampling approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> provides critical information that is policy-relevant in a context of climate change adaptation&#x000a0;and mitigation, including&#x000a0;for an analysis of the impact of a warming of 1.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and&#x000a0;2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Compared to the reference period 1986&#x02013;2005, which corresponds to about 0.62&#x02009;&#x000b0;C global warming, 1.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C global warming translate approximately into the same consequences in terms of groomed-only or 45% snowmaking snow reliability in the French Alps. At 1.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C global warming, a 45% snowmaking coverage provides generally higher snow reliability than the groomed-only reference period situation. At 3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C global warming and beyond, groomed-only reliability is projected to drop markedly with a mean frequency of snow-scarce seasons (i.e. below Q20 threshold) reaching 80% of years and beyond. This global warming level marks a turning point for snowmaking too: in this case, the frequency of occurrence of snow-scarce seasons becomes higher than the groomed-only reference period, and this frequency increases markedly for further degrees of warming. Our analysis of the regional warming level shows an&#x000a0;enhancement factor, for the time period from December to April, on the order of 1.10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C of regional warming per &#x000b0;C of global warming (computed over similar 30-years time periods). At 1500&#x02009;m elevation, global warming levels of 1.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C since pre-industrial time correspond to local warming with respect to the reference period 1986&#x02013;2005 of 0.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 1.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 3.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, respectively.

The lower boundary of the 90% confidence interval was defined as the snow scarcity threshold Q20 so as to be sure to isolate snow seasons with marked snow scarcity. The frequency of seasons with snow reliability index lower than the Q20 were computed based on climate model experiments and further referred to as the frequency of snow-scarce seasons. The annual water volume for snowmaking was computed for every ski resort based on the simulated amount of machine-made snow for every pixel within the snowmaking envelope, depending on the snowmaking coverage (15%, 30% and 45%). The annual French Alps water volume for snowmaking is the sum of all ski resorts water volume, expressed in millions of cubic meters (Mm<sup>3</sup>).
