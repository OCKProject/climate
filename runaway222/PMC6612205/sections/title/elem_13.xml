  <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forty-two paediatric residents were invited to participate with a 97% response rate (one refused to participate); 75% of respondents were female. The distribution of responding residents over years 1, 2 and 3 was 15 (36%), 14 (33%) and 12 (29%) respectively (Fig.

  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MBI questionnaire identified 7 residents (17%) perceiving high emotional exhaustion, five (12%) showed high depersonalization and 12 (29%) perceived low personal achievement. None of the residents experienced burnout with high levels of both emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and a low level of personal achievement. However, residents who met 2 of 3 criteria of burnout were able to provide information related to burnout.</p>
  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environmental Measure (PHEEM) revealed that most of the residents (88%) had a positive perception of their role autonomy. For the perception of teaching, 51% gave scores for teaching between 31 and 45 indicating that the teaching activities might need some improvement. For the social support dimension, 85% thought that there were more pros than cons. The average score of PHEEM was 112.7 (SD = 11.2, range 79–134), indicating a rather positive educational environment, but with room for improvement.</p>
  <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only 5 (out of 41participants, 12%) reported a good quality of life, while the majority of residents (88%) reported a moderate level of overall work-related quality of life. About 10% of residents reported a low level of employee engagement, poor home-work interface and low general well-being. More than 50% (56%) of residents experienced moderate levels of stress at work and 68% had a negative work-family interface. Also, 54% of the residents were fully satisfied with the work conditions.</p>

  <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were no statistically significant association between any burnout subscales and age, gender, marital status age, gender, year of training, marital status, responsibility for the family’s or own financial burden, sleep hours per night, study time hours per week and non-academic leisure time hours per week (data not shown). Work-related quality of life had a moderate correlation with emotional exhaustion (
   <span class="italic">r </span>= 0.401, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.009). Emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment were not associated with the overall educational climate or residents’ perception of social support, teaching and autonomy. Total work-related quality of life had a significant small negative correlation with emotional exhaustion (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = − 0.401, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.009) and with depersonalization (r = − 0.332, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.034). Analysis of the association between the subscales of MBI and the work-related quality of life indicated a slight to moderate negative relationship between the home-work interface, general well-being, working conditions and emotional exhaustion. In addition, employee engagement, general well-being and working conditions had a slightly negative correlation with depersonalization. Also, general well-being had a moderate positive association with personal accomplishment.

  <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Six out of the seven residents who met the inclusion criteria of scores on burnout subscales participated in the interviews. Three were first year residents and one was a third-year resident; one participant was male. Factors in educational climate and work-related quality of life were explored in depth to find a relationship with risk of burnout. The following themes which residents perceived to relate to risk of burnout emerged from the qualitative data analysis of the individual interviews:

  <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Constructive feedback from teachers is crucial for learners to achieve personal or teaching programme-related objectives.
