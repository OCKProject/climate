 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was conducted in the Paediatric Department, Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand in 2016. An exploratory mixed-methods approach was employed, consisting of sequentially collecting and respectively analyzing quantitative and qualitative data (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The choice for a mixed methods approach was based on its ability to provide more comprehensive and in depth details to answer the research questions.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantitative phase, surveys</div>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first phase employed a quantitative cross-sectional survey which included background variables, measurements of burnout, the perceived learning environment, and work-related quality of life. The following background-characteristics were measured: age, gender, year of training, marital status, responsibility for the family’s or own financial burden, sleep hours/night, study time hours/week, non-academic leisure time hours/week.</p>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Burnout was measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) - Health service survey, an internationally acknowledged and validated instrument [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. The MBI is a standard 22-item questionnaire (7-point Likert scale). The instrument consists of three sections which measures levels of a) emotional exhaustion, b) depersonalisation and c) personal accomplishment [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. The MBI has previously been translated into Thai and tested for reliability. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for the sections were 0.92, 0.66 and 0.65, respectively [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Learning environment was measured with the Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environmental Measure (PHEEM) questionnaire. This questionnaire consists of 40 items, divided into three sections: a) autonomy, b) teaching, and c) social support (5-point Likert scale, ranging from 4 = strongly agree to 0 = strongly disagree). The original instrument, tested in the UK, had a Cronbach’s alpha reliability of 0.91 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. Translation into the Thai language was done by an experienced translator in the medical field and then back-translated to English by another experienced translator, leading to further refinement into the Thai language. The original English questionnaire was then analyzed for degree of agreement with the back-translation and rated by three faculty medical instructors from the paediatric department. Kappa’s agreement scores ranged between 0.61–0.80 and were confirmed as substantial at 80–95% of agreement.
  </p>
  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Work-related Quality of life was measured with the Work-Related Quality of Life scale (WRQoL), a 23-item psychometric scale divided into six subscales of factors contributing to quality of life: Job and Career Satisfaction (JCS), General Well-Being (GWB), Stress at Work (SAW), Control at Work (CAW), Home-Work Interface (HWI) and Working Conditions (WCS). The questionnaire is composed of 5-point Likert scale items (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). Its reliability (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.75–0.86) were verified among medical personnel in the United Kingdom [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. We used the Thai-translated and validated 34item WRQoL version 2 with 7 sub-scales (Job and Career Satisfaction (JCS), General Well-Being (GWB), Stress at Work (SAW), Control at Work (CAW), Home-Work Interface (HWI) and Working Conditions (WCS) and employee engagement (EET)), which had a content validity index of the scale of 0.97. Overall Cronbach’s alpha was 0.93 with good test-retest reliabilityof0.892 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three surveys (110 items) were distributed in written format among all 42 pediatric residents across all years of training, also inviting them to later participate in interviews.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Qualitative phase, individual interviews</div>
  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Purposeful sampling was used, participation was voluntary and withdrawal was possible at any given moment. Residents in all 3 years with a high score in at least two of the three subscales of the MBI questionnaire, and with varying scores on the other questionnaires, were invited (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 7) in order to further explore the perceived influence of educational climate and its relation to burnout. Six residents responded positively and were interviewed individually. The interviews were conducted by PT, who is a supervising physician and the conversations were audio-taped. The interview was semi-structured around general open-ended questions concerning two main topics: a) characteristics in the medical educational environment related to burnout risk, and b) What could be improved in the medical educational environment to reduce the risk of burnout.

   <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The association between categorical data of burnout level and baseline characteristics was calculated using Phi coefficient. To identify the relations between levels of burnout, PHEEM, work-related quality of life and other variables, hierarchical single regression analyses were conducted. Pearson zero-order and Spearman rank-order correlations were used to identify the relation between PHEEM (and subscales) and work-related quality of life.</p>

   <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Literal transcripts from the interviews were analyzed by two researchers independently. The researchers familiarized with the data by listening to the audio-tapes and reading the full data sets several times. The interviews were coded using an inductive approach. The main findings were verified with the participants in a process of member checking. Any discrepancies in coding were discussed in the research team until consensus was reached [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. Thematic analysis was done by hand and then translated into English. Themes emerged from the independently iterative analysis and then presented as results.

All participants were informed, both verbally and in writing and consented to complete the questionnaire and interview. Since burnout is a sensitive issue, participants had the option to terminate project participation at any stage.</p>
