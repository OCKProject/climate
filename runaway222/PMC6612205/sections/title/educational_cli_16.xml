 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The educational climate and work-related quality of life were strongly related (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.678, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). The analysis of the correlations between the subscales of educational environment and work-related quality of life showed significance for multiple subscales. Perception of role autonomy had a large effect on employee engagement (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.611, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), general well-being (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.593,

  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.617,

  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.38, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.014). Perception of teaching showed a strong relationship with employee engagement (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.713, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) and had moderate effect on control at work, general well-being, job and career satisfaction and working conditions. Perception of social support showed a significant correlation with all the subscales of work-related quality of life, except stress at work. This could indicate that QOL was affected by social support Table
