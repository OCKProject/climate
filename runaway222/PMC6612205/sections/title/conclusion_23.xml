 <p id="Par85" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although a relation was found between subscales of burnout, quality of life and educational climate, this mixed methods study did not show substantial burnout among pediatric residents in the Thai context.</p>
 <p id="Par86" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The factors of the educational environment that were perceived to require improvement in order to reduce the risk of burnout were: minimization of unnecessary or duplicated workloads, time schedule arrangements to avoid extension of regular duty hours, and the clarity of role expectations, work allocation, perceptions of teacher roles, institution of a faculty development programme, and improvement of the facilities and the infra-structure such as accommodation. These factors should consequently be considered and addressed in the curriculum and clinical workplace of pediatric residents in training
