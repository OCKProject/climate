  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The association between categorical data of burnout level and baseline characteristics was calculated using Phi coefficient. To identify the relations between levels of burnout, PHEEM, work-related quality of life and other variables, hierarchical single regression analyses were conducted. Pearson zero-order and Spearman rank-order correlations were used to identify the relation between PHEEM (and subscales) and work-related quality of life.</p>

  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Literal transcripts from the interviews were analyzed by two researchers independently. The researchers familiarized with the data by listening to the audio-tapes and reading the full data sets several times. The interviews were coded using an inductive approach. The main findings were verified with the participants in a process of member checking. Any discrepancies in coding were discussed in the research team until consensus was reached [
