 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were no statistically significant association between any burnout subscales and age, gender, marital status age, gender, year of training, marital status, responsibility for the family’s or own financial burden, sleep hours per night, study time hours per week and non-academic leisure time hours per week (data not shown). Work-related quality of life had a moderate correlation with emotional exhaustion (
  <span class="italic">r </span>= 0.401, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.009). Emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment were not associated with the overall educational climate or residents’ perception of social support, teaching and autonomy. Total work-related quality of life had a significant small negative correlation with emotional exhaustion (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = − 0.401, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.009) and with depersonalization (r = − 0.332, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.034). Analysis of the association between the subscales of MBI and the work-related quality of life indicated a slight to moderate negative relationship between the home-work interface, general well-being, working conditions and emotional exhaustion. In addition, employee engagement, general well-being and working conditions had a slightly negative correlation with depersonalization. Also, general well-being had a moderate positive association with personal accomplishment.
