 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Burnout is a psychological condition presenting a response to chronic interpersonal stressors on the job. Burnout, as defined by Maslach (1993), is a triad of high exhaustion, high depersonalization and lack of personal accomplishment [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Research among physicians revealed differences in burnout prevalence across (sub) specialties. A periodic survey of American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) members (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1616; response rate 63%), showed that 22% of the respondents indicated to be experiencing burnout, while 45% had experienced burnout in the past [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. From 2011 to 2014, general pediatrics in U.S. was found to be one of the ten subspecialties that experienced a more than 10% increase in burnout (35% vs. 46%) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Burnout, highly prevalent among pediatricians, has been identified as a problem among pediatric residents and could ultimately have consequences for patient care. A study among 258 pediatric residents of 11 New England Pediatric Residency Consortium programs in U.S. revealed that residents experiencing burnout had significantly greater odds of displaying suboptimal patient care attitudes and behaviors, leading to maltreatment or medical errors, or ignoring the social impact of illness [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">High levels of burnout amongst residents across cultures and countries have uniformly been described, although some differences between countries can be observed. In Brazil, 53% of pediatric residents experienced burnout [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>], a percentage similar reported in a survey in Canada, where Nolan et al. found 42% of pediatric residents met criteria of burnout [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. In North America, Simpkin et al. reported that 31% of pediatric residents had burnout and determined high levels of stress from uncertainty and low levels of resilience as factors strongly related to burnout [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. A longitudinal prospective study of pediatric residents in North America showed that the prevalence of burnout increased from 2 to 24% between the start of residency and mid-intern year, without significant change over a 2-year period [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. In the U.S., Olson et al. showed that approximately 40% of first year pediatric residents experienced burnout. Self-compassion and mindfulness were factors inversely associated with burnout [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. In summary, the prevalence of burnout among residents thus varies across countries and factors related to it might at least partly originate from the workplace.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Work-related quality of life is more or less similar to employee well-being and includes work-based factors such as job satisfaction, as well as broader non-work factors such as general life satisfaction, feelings of well-being [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>] and work-related stress [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. A study done in the U.S., showed that factors contributing to first year pediatric resident burnout included time demands, lack of control, difficulties in work planning and work organization, difficult job situations and interpersonal relationship problems [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. A separate study on burnout, showed a negative correlation between job satisfaction and burnout levels among Turkish pediatric residents [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. In summary, factors such as job satisfaction, stress and control at work, working condition, home-work interface have been associated with the incidence of burnout in pediatric residents in Western countries [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. In non-Western countries such as Japan for example, factors contributing to burnout include high workload, stress intolerance, interpersonal difficulties, and generation gaps regarding work-life balance [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. In Thailand, Srikamet et al. conducted a survey on job burnout and related factors among residents in all years across subspecialties. They reported that residents trained in 
  <span class="italic">larger</span> subspecialties (such as pediatrics, internal medicine, surgery) had a significantly higher prevalence of burnout, compared to residents in 
  <span class="italic">smaller</span> subspecialties (such as ear-nose-throat, ophthalmology). The differences between the larger and smaller subspecialties that might be related to burnout were higher workloads, longer working/duty hours and specific characteristic of the learning environment of  
  <span class="italic">larger</span> subspecialties [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. Summarizing, findings in the literature suggest that learning in an environment that is considered to be demanding is associated with higher levels of burnout. This finding aligns with the conceptual framework of the job demands-resources model (JD-R model, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). “Job demand” is a physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspect of the job that requires effort, while “resources” are aspects of the job that are functional in achieving work goals; decrease job demands or stimulate individual growth, learning, and development [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. High levels of job demand with lack of resources therefore lead to a decrease in work engagement [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>].

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The educational climate is a crucial factor for residents and tends to impact learning achievement as well as residents wellness. The educational climate has a significant correlation with residents burnout [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>], especially in an intensely demanding workplace where a higher number of work shifts has been associated with a higher level of burnout [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>].

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, burnout is a highly prevalent problem among pediatric residents worldwide, with adverse consequences for patient care. Main factors related to burnout in Western countries were job satisfaction, stress at work, control at work, as well as the educational climate. However, as far as we know, factors related to pediatric residents burnout especially regarding educational climate and work quality of life have not yet been studied in non-Western contexts. Therefore, this study explored the prevalence of burnout among pediatric residents, and factors related to burnout in the Thai context, in particular aspects of the educational climate, and work related quality of life. The study addresses the following research questions (Fig.
