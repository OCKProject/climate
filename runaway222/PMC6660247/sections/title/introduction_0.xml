 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change involves a significant change in weather patterns around the world due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere mostly driven by human activities over the last 50 years (
  <a rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref18">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014</a>). The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has recently exceeded a mole fraction of 400 parts per million, higher than any century in the past 420,000 years (
  <a rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref40">Petit et al., 1999</a>; 
  <a rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref34">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2018a</a>,
  <a rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref35">b</a>). Because of the high concentration of CO
  <sub>2</sub>, global mean surface temperature increased by 0.87°C in the last decade compared to the average temperature from 1850 to 1900, and it is projected to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 (

  <a rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref35">b</a>). The significant changes in CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration and global temperature pose a significant threat to humanity because of their severe, extensive, adverse impacts on human and natural systems. Studies have shown that climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events (

  <a rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref53">Wuebbles et al., 2017</a>), impairs global food production (
  <a rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref29">Lobell et al., 2008</a>), shrinks ice volume and snow cover (
  <a rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref45">Robinson et al., 2014</a>), causes sea levels to rise (
  <a rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref26">Kniveton, 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref36">Nerem et al., 2018</a>), and leads to forest disturbances (
  <a rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref7">Dale et al., 2001</a>; 
  <a rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref47">Seidl et al., 2017</a>) and deterioration of terrestrial and marine ecosystems (
  <a rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref46">Rosenzweig et al., 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref14">Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref28">Levitus et al., 2017</a>). In fact, the combined value of damages across agriculture, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor sectors costs roughly 1.2% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average in the United States (
  <a rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref16">Hsiang et al., 2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scientific evidence for climate change has been unequivocal (
  <a rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref18">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014</a>). In fact, 97% of actively publishing climate scientists agree that human activities are causing global warming (
  <a rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref5">Cook et al., 2013</a>, 
  <a rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref6">2016</a>). However, some people still remain skeptical about climate change despite the scientific consensus (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref17">Hulme, 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref44">Poortinga et al., 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref51">Weber and Stern, 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref15">Hornsey et al., 2016</a>). Within the United States, public views on climate change tend to polarize along party lines (
  <a rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref32">McCright and Dunlap, 2011</a>). According to a recent Gallup Poll, 86% of democrats vs. 42% of republicans agree most scientists believe global warming is occurring; 4% of democrats vs. 69% of republicans think the seriousness of global warming is generally exaggerated; 89% of democrats vs. 35% of republicans believe global warming is caused by human activities; and 91% of democrats vs. 33% of republicans worry about global warming (
  <a rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref4">Brenan and Saad, 2018</a>). This partisan divide has not only endured, but widened over time. A poll from Pew Research Center shows that in 2006, 79% of democrats vs. 59% of republicans said there is solid evidence that the average temperature on Earth has been getting warmer, but in 2017, 92% of democrats vs. 52% of republicans said so (
  <a rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref42">Pew Research Center, 2017</a>). There is also a growing divide in policy priorities: in 1994, 66% of democrats vs. 58% of republicans said stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost, but in 2017, 77% of democrats vs. 36% of republicans said so (
  <a rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref42">Pew Research Center, 2017</a>); in 2008, 47% of democrats vs. 15% of republicans said climate change is a top priority for the president and congress, but in 2018, 68% of democrats vs. 18% of republicans said so (
  <a rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref43">Pew Research Center, 2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explain public skepticism on climate change, traditional accounts have adopted an information deficit model that attributes disbelief to a lack of knowledge or understanding (
  <a rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref30">Lorenzoni et al., 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref48">Shi et al., 2016</a>), a lack of affect (
  <a rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref27">Leiserowitz, 2006</a>), or insufficient awareness about the issue (
  <a rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref39">Norton and Leaman, 2004</a>; 
  <a rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref31">Lorenzoni and Pidgeon, 2006</a>). However, these accounts have failed to explain the partisan polarization over the years when an increasing volume of information and evidence on climate change has been presented to the public. Another conundrum is that individuals with high science literacy and technical reasoning skills are not the most concerned about climate change, but rather, they are the ones among whom polarization is the greatest (
  <a rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref22">Kahan, 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">Drummond and Fischhoff, 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">Kahan et al., 2017</a>). This suggests that the public divide on climate change is not solely driven by a lack of understanding or knowledge, and the mere presentation of climate change evidence is likely insufficient to convince the public.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent efforts to explain group polarization have relied on a motivated reasoning approach that traces back to studies on motivated social cognition in the early 1950’s. In a pioneering study, 
  <a rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref13">Hastorf and Cantril (1954)</a> demonstrated that after watching the same football game between Princeton and Dartmouth teams, Princeton and Dartmouth students drew distinct conclusions about the game, where they largely disagreed on the number of infractions made by each team, the reasons behind these infractions, the roughness of the game, and who started the rough play. This study suggests that the same sensory input is interpreted in vastly different ways depending on the viewer’s social affiliations, predispositions, and motivations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the same logic, recent theories focus on identity-based polarization, where perceptions of controversial topics such as climate change are driven by socio-political motivations and beliefs (
  <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">Drummond and Fischhoff, 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">Kahan et al., 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">Bail et al., 2018</a>; 
  <a rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref9">Ehret et al., 2018</a>). Specifically, the cultural cognition thesis posits that people form perceptions of risks or controversial topics in a way that coheres with values characteristic of the groups with which they identify (
  <a rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref23">Kahan et al., 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref22">Kahan, 2012</a>). One explanation underlying this thesis is that people selectively expose themselves to information from news media that is consistent with their existing motivations and beliefs (
  <a rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref10">Feldman et al., 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref37">Newman et al., 2018</a>). Similarly, the identity-protective cognition thesis argues that people high on numeracy skills use their quantitative-reasoning capacity to selectively interpret the data to conform to their cultural and political values (
  <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">Kahan et al., 2017</a>). Another account suggests that people automatically obey in-group norms and oppose out-group norms, but critically, they exaggerate the extent of opposition from out-group members, creating a false sense of cultural norm on climate change (
  <a rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref49">Van Boven et al., 2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although many studies have suggested social motivations and ideologies determine the interpretation of quantitative evidence, it is currently unknown 
  <span class="italic">how</span> motivations and ideologies shape perception and judgment. To specifically examine how this process occurs, here we propose a motivated attention framework to offer an attentional mechanism to explain the political polarization on climate change. Specifically, socio-political motivations shape visual attention to climate change evidence, altering the perception of the evidence and subsequent actions to mitigate climate change. The altered perception and actions can further reinforce prior beliefs and motivations, thus creating a positive feedback loop (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). This framework is supported by our previous work that demonstrates that liberals who are concerned about climate change attend more readily to climate-related words over neutral words, but conservatives who are not concerned about climate change do not show an attentional priority of climate-related words over neutral words, suggesting that political orientations are associated with different attentional priorities of climate change (
  <a rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref52">Whitman et al., 2018</a>).

 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the motivated attention framework, we define political motivation as political orientation, and we predict that liberals and conservatives attend to the same climate change evidence (i.e., a graph of global temperature) in ways that are consistent with their political norms. Attention is measured by eye gaze dwell time on the graph. We define perception of climate evidence as the estimation of global temperature from the graph, and actions to mitigate climate change as the likelihood to sign climate petitions or donate to an environmental organization. To seek evidence for this framework, we conducted three experiments to examine how people with different political orientations perceive the same global temperature graph and whether the perceptual differences can be explained by different attentional priorities (Experiment 1), how these attentional biases alter actions to mitigate climate change (Experiment 2), and how drawing attention to motivationally consistent evidence influences climate actions (Experiment 3).</p>
