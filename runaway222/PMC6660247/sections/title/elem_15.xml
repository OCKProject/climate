 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The previous two experiments were correlational by nature. To seek causal evidence for the motivated attention framework, we manipulated attention by coloring different parts of the temperature curve to deliberately bias attention to stronger or weaker evidence of climate change. In other words, we aimed to examine how drawing attention to motivationally consistent evidence influences subsequent actions.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the slight increase in temperature from 1930 to 1945 on the land and ocean graph in Experiment 2 may diminish any attentional bias to the rising phase, the stimulus used in the current experiment was the same global temperature graph used in Experiment 1, generated from estimates based on land data only

   </a> provided by NASA, except that we converted the unit of global temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit to facilitate the comprehension of temperature for United States participants, and we also updated the graph from 2013 to 2017. To manipulate attention, we highlighted the rising phase from 1950 to 2017 in red in the “rising red” condition (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 105, 
   <a rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#fig6">Figure 6A</a>), or highlighted the flat phase from 1880 to 1949 in red in the “flat red” condition (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 84, 
   <a rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#fig6">Figure 6B</a>), or did not highlight the curve in the control condition (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 89, 
   <a rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#fig6">Figure 6C</a>). In the rising red condition, the mean rating on the political orientation scale was −1.10 (60 liberals and 26 conservatives). In the flat red condition, the mean rating on the political orientation scale was −1.23 (42 liberals and 25 conservatives). Attention was again tracked using BubbleView as in Experiment 2. After viewing the graph, participants were asked whether they were willing to sign a climate-related petition and whether they were willing to donate to an environmental organization, as in Experiment 2.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a manipulation check, we examined attention allocation in different phases of the curve in each condition. Participants in the rising red condition paid more attention to the rising phase (AOI fixation = 28.6%) compared to that in the flat red condition (AOI fixation = 25.3%) and control condition (AOI fixation = 24.6%) [
    <span class="italic">F</span>(2,275) = 4.86,

This suggests our manipulation of attention was successful, specifically, highlighting the rising phase in red drew more attention to the rising phase, and highlighting the flat phase in red drew more attention to the flat phase.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first conducted log linear analyses on petition signing in the three-way contingency table. We found a significant three-way interaction among condition (rising vs. flat), political orientation (liberals vs. conservatives), and signing (yes vs. no) [
    <span class="italic">G</span>
    <span class="sup">2</span>(4) = 13.31, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.01]. This interaction suggests that more liberals than conservatives signed the petition when the rising phase was highlighted, but not when the flat phase was highlighted. To probe this interaction further, we conducted separate chi-square tests for the rising red condition and the flat red condition. Liberals were more likely to sign the petition than conservatives when the rising phase was highlighted (
    <span class="italic">X</span>
    <span class="sup">2</span> = 8.80, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.003). When the flat phase was highlighted, there was no significant difference between liberals and conservatives (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results collectively suggest that drawing attention to more salient evidence of climate change encouraged actions in liberals.

In sum, these results provide initial evidence that drawing attention to motivationally consistent evidence can increase actions.</p>
