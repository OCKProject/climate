 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first conducted log linear analyses on petition signing in the three-way contingency table. We found a significant three-way interaction among condition (rising vs. flat), political orientation (liberals vs. conservatives), and signing (yes vs. no) [
  <span class="italic">G</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>(4) = 13.31, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.01]. This interaction suggests that more liberals than conservatives signed the petition when the rising phase was highlighted, but not when the flat phase was highlighted. To probe this interaction further, we conducted separate chi-square tests for the rising red condition and the flat red condition. Liberals were more likely to sign the petition than conservatives when the rising phase was highlighted (
  <span class="italic">X</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 8.80, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.003). When the flat phase was highlighted, there was no significant difference between liberals and conservatives (
  <span class="italic">X</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.66, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.42) (
  <a rid="tab2" ref-type="table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). This suggests that liberals were more likely to sign the petition when the rising phase was highlighted than when the flat phase was highlighted.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For willingness to donate, we again found a significant three-way interaction [
  <span class="italic">G</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>(4) = 20.00, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001]. Moreover, liberals were more willing to donate than conservatives when the rising phase was highlighted (
  <span class="italic">X</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 13.03, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), but there was no significant difference between liberals and conservatives when the flat phase was highlighted (
  <span class="italic">X</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.53, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.47). This again suggests that liberals were more willing to donate when the rising phase was highlighted than when the flat phase was highlighted.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results collectively suggest that drawing attention to more salient evidence of climate change encouraged actions in liberals. Although there was no significant difference between the two groups when the flat phase was highlighted, there was a numerical increase in both petition signing and donation willingness for conservatives when the flat phase was highlighted than when the rising phase was highlighted. In sum, these results provide initial evidence that drawing attention to motivationally consistent evidence can increase actions.</p>
