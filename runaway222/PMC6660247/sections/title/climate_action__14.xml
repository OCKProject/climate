 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the final analysis, we examined the relationship between attention and the likelihood to sign the petition (we did not consider the donation results as they were insignificant in the previous section). In the temperature condition, greater attention to the flat phase relative to the rising phase was associated with a higher likelihood of signing the petition for liberals [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(45) = −0.32, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.03]. However, greater attention to the rising phase relative to the flat phase was marginally associated with a higher likelihood of signing the petition for conservatives [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(27) = 0.33, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.08]. In the neutral condition, there was no correlation between attention and willingness to sign for liberals [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(30) = 0.21, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.25] or conservatives [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(37) = −0.23, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.15]. This suggests that attention guides climate actions in different ways for liberals and conservatives.
