   <p>A heatmap showing the average duration of dwell time on the temperature curve for liberals (left, 
    <span class="italic">N</span> = 69) and conservatives (right,

Participants whose ratings on the political orientation scale were below 0 were grouped as liberals and whose ratings on the political orientation scale were above 0 were grouped as conservatives. Warmer colors represent higher average duration of dwell time.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 
  <a rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>, it is evident that both liberals and conservatives looked more at the relatively flat phase of the curve from 1940 to 1980 and the rising phase of the curve from 1990 to 2013. We therefore defined two areas of interest (AOIs) on the curve: the flat phase (1940 to 1980, subtending 5.7° of visual angle in width, 187 pixels, and 1.8° in height, 59 pixels) which we interpret as weaker evidence of climate change, and the rising phase (1990 to 2013, subtending 3.4° of visual angle in width, 112 pixels, and 3.0° in height, 98 pixels) which we interpret as stronger evidence of climate change
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="fn002" href="#fn002">
   <span class="sup">2</span>
  </a>. To measure visual attention, we calculated dwell time in each AOI. Since participants spent different amounts of time on the graph, we calculated the proportional gaze dwell time for each participant, which was defined as the dwell time spent in each AOI divided by the total dwell time on the graph.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine the overall relationship between participants’ political motivation and their visual attention on the graph, we correlated political orientation and the difference in proportional dwell time between the rising phase and the flat phase (rising − flat). There was no significant correlation between political orientation and the difference in proportional dwell time between the rising phase and the flat phase in the temperature condition [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(102) = −0.15, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.13] or the neutral condition [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(101) = −0.02, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.86]. However, relative to the neutral condition, in the temperature condition, more liberalism tended to be associated with greater proportional dwell time on the rising phase relative to the flat phase. These results point to a possibility that the more liberal the participants, the more attention they paid to the rising phase relative to the flat phase of the temperature curve. We further divided the participants into a liberal group and a conservative group. In the temperature condition, we did not find any correlation between attention on the graph and the degree of liberalism [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(67) = −0.14, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.26] or conservatism [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(19) = 0.08, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.74]. In the neutral condition, we did not find any correlation between attention on the graph and the degree of liberalism [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(69) = −0.05, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.70] or conservatism [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(19) = −0.32, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.17].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then examined the relationship between visual attention and estimation. In the temperature condition, proportional dwell time on the rising phase relative to the flat phase was positively correlated with estimates of temperature change [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(102) = 0.33, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001], but not in neutral condition [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(101) = 0.05, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.60]. This suggests that more attention to the rising phase relative to the flat phase of the curve (i.e., more attention to stronger evidence of climate change) was associated with higher estimations of temperature change. We further divided the participants into a liberal group and a conservative group. In the temperature condition, we found that liberals who focused more on the rising phase of the curve relative to the flat phase provided higher estimates of temperature change [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(67) = 0.30, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.01], and for conservatives, there was a marginal correlation [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(19) = 0.38, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.09]. We note that although the value of 
  <span class="italic">p</span> was marginal, the correlation coefficient was larger for conservatives than for liberals. This may be due to the smaller sample size of conservatives. The correlation coefficient may change if the sample size of conservatives increased. In the neutral condition, no correlation was found for liberals [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(67) = 0.09, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.46] or conservatives [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(19) = −0.01, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.95]. In sum, these results provide initial evidence suggesting that political orientation could be associated with attentional biases which alter the perception of the same evidence.
