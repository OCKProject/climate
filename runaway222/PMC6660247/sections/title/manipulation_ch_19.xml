 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a manipulation check, we examined attention allocation in different phases of the curve in each condition. Participants in the rising red condition paid more attention to the rising phase (AOI fixation = 28.6%) compared to that in the flat red condition (AOI fixation = 25.3%) and control condition (AOI fixation = 24.6%) [
  <span class="italic">F</span>(2,275) = 4.86, 
  <span class="italic">p=</span> 0.008, 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <div id="M1" class="math">
    <div class="msubsup">
     <span class="mi">η</span>
     <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">p</span>
     <span class="mn">2</span>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div> = 0.03]. Participants in the flat red condition paid marginally more attention to the flat phase (AOI fixation = 23.4%) compared to that in the rising red condition (AOI fixation = 22.3%) and control condition (AOI fixation = 20.2%) [
  <span class="italic">F</span>(2,275) = 2.65, 
  <span class="italic">p =</span> 0.07,

     <span class="mn">2</span>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div> = 0.03]. This suggests our manipulation of attention was successful, specifically, highlighting the rising phase in red drew more attention to the rising phase, and highlighting the flat phase in red drew more attention to the flat phase. The heatmaps of the average density of mouse location on the graph in each condition are shown in
