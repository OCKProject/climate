 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the slight increase in temperature from 1930 to 1945 on the land and ocean graph in Experiment 2 may diminish any attentional bias to the rising phase, the stimulus used in the current experiment was the same global temperature graph used in Experiment 1, generated from estimates based on land data only

  </a> provided by NASA, except that we converted the unit of global temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit to facilitate the comprehension of temperature for United States participants, and we also updated the graph from 2013 to 2017. To manipulate attention, we highlighted the rising phase from 1950 to 2017 in red in the “rising red” condition (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 105, 
  <a rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#fig6">Figure 6A</a>), or highlighted the flat phase from 1880 to 1949 in red in the “flat red” condition (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 84, 
  <a rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#fig6">Figure 6B</a>), or did not highlight the curve in the control condition (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 89, 
  <a rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#fig6">Figure 6C</a>). In the rising red condition, the mean rating on the political orientation scale was −1.10 (60 liberals and 26 conservatives). In the flat red condition, the mean rating on the political orientation scale was −1.23 (42 liberals and 25 conservatives). Attention was again tracked using BubbleView as in Experiment 2. After viewing the graph, participants were asked whether they were willing to sign a climate-related petition and whether they were willing to donate to an environmental organization, as in Experiment 2.

A heatmap representing the distribution of the average density of mouse location on the graph is shown on the right side in each condition. Warmer colors represent higher average density of mouse location.
