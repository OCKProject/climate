 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The objective average change in the graph was 0.01, and participants in both conditions over-estimated the average value change (mean estimated change = 0.52 in the temperature condition, mean estimated change = 0.43 in the neutral condition, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). Participants in the temperature condition estimated the change as numerically larger than those in the neutral condition [
  <span class="italic">t</span>(205) = 1.49, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.14, 
  <span class="italic">d</span> = 0.20].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The goal of this experiment was to examine how people with different political orientations perceive the same global temperature graph. In the temperature condition, we found that more liberalism was weakly correlated with higher estimates of the temperature change [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(102) = âˆ’0.19, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.055], suggesting liberals tended to perceive a higher temperature change than conservatives. However in the neutral condition, no correlation was found between political orientation and estimation of temperature change [
  <span class="italic">r</span>(101) = 0.02, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.83]. These results suggest that political orientation is associated with different perceptions of the same evidence when the graph is framed as global temperature, but not when the graph is under a neutral frame (i.e., when the evidence is not motivationally relevant).
