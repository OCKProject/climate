  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This experiment aimed to replicate the attentional results from Experiment 1 using the BubbleView technique. To measure attention, we calculated the number of mouse locations in each AOI (defined below). Since there was no time limit for participants to view the graph, we used the proportional number of mouse location, which was calculated as the number of mouse locations in each AOI divided by the total number of mouse locations on the graph.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to Experiment 1, we defined two AOIs on the temperature curve, one on the flat phase from 1880 to 1948 (subtending 8.3° of visual angle in width, 274 pixels, and 3.6° in height, 120 pixels), another on the rising phase from 1949 to 2017 (subtending 7.7° of visual angle in width, 254 pixels, and 5.2° in height, 170 pixels). We adjusted the AOIs from Experiment 1 because this graph was slightly different from the graph in Experiment 1, as it contained both land and ocean data, whereas the one in Experiment 1 contained only land data. This means that there was a small peak of global temperature around 1945 in the current graph, whereas the curve in Experiment 1 was relatively flat before 1980. For this reason, we tried to divide the curve into two halves (with the year 1949 being the mid-point), and the second half of the temperature curve was defined as the rising phase, which was steeper than the first half of the curve defined as the flat phase.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first examined the relationship between political orientation and attention. This time, we did not find a correlation between political orientation and the proportional number of mouse location in the rising phase relative to the flat phase in the temperature condition [
   <span class="italic">r</span>(85) = 0.07, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.49] or in the neutral condition [
   <span class="italic">r</span>(88) = −0.03, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.81]. This did not replicate the numerical trend in Experiment 1. We further divided the participants into a liberal group and a conservative group. In the temperature condition, same as in Experiment 1, we did not find any correlation between attention on the graph and the degree of liberalism [
   <span class="italic">r</span>(45) = 0.12, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.44] or conservatism [
   <span class="italic">r</span>(27) = 0.09, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.64]. In the neutral condition, we did not find any correlation between attention on the graph and the degree of liberalism [
   <span class="italic">r</span>(30) = −0.10, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.58] or conservatism [
   <span class="italic">r</span>(37) = 0.20, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.22].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then examined the relationship between attention and temperature estimation. In the temperature condition, we found that greater proportional number of mouse location in the rising phase relative to the flat phase was positively correlated with higher estimate of temperature [
   <span class="italic">r</span>(85) = 0.34, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001], but no correlation was found in the neutral condition [
   <span class="italic">r</span>(88) = −0.10, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.37]. This result replicated the findings in Experiment 2, suggesting that more attention to the rising phase relative to the flat phase of the temperature curve (i.e., more salient evidence of climate change) was associated with higher estimations of global temperature.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The heatmaps of the average density of mouse location on the graph for liberals and conservatives are shown in 
   <a rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>. The heatmap of the average dwell time for independents (whose ratings on the political orientation scale were 0) in the temperature condition is shown in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" href="#SM2">Section B of Supplementary Materials</a>. In the temperature condition, liberals who focused more on the rising phase relative to the flat phase provided marginally higher estimates of temperature [
   <span class="italic">r</span>(45) = 0.28, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.054], and the same marginal correlation was found for conservatives [
   <span class="italic">r</span>(27) = 0.35, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.06]. In the neutral condition, no correlation was found for liberals [
   <span class="italic">r</span>(30) = 0.10, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.59] or conservatives [
   <span class="italic">r</span>(37) = −0.25, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.13]. These results suggest that both liberals and conservatives who focused more on the rising phase relative to the flat phase tended to provide a higher estimation of global temperature, which partially replicated Experiment 1 in which we found that liberals who focused more on the rising phase showed significantly higher perceived temperature, but this correlation was only marginal for conservatives.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A more important goal of this experiment was to examine how attentional biases were related to actions to mitigate climate change. We first conducted log linear analyses on petition signing in the three-way contingency table. We found a significant three-way interaction [
   <span class="italic">G</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>(4) = 21.50, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001]. We then conducted separate chi-square tests for the temperature condition and the neutral condition. We found that more liberals signed the climate-related petition than conservatives did in the temperature condition (
   <span class="italic">X</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 10.19, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001), but not in the neutral condition (
   <span class="italic">X</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 1.74, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.19) (
   <a rid="tab1" ref-type="table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). This suggests that when the evidence was motivationally relevant, people were more likely to behave in ways that were consistent with their political orientations.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the final analysis, we examined the relationship between attention and the likelihood to sign the petition (we did not consider the donation results as they were insignificant in the previous section). In the temperature condition, greater attention to the flat phase relative to the rising phase was associated with a higher likelihood of signing the petition for liberals [
   <span class="italic">r</span>(45) = −0.32,
