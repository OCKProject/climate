 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The goal of the current study was to examine how political motivations (i.e., political orientation) shape visual attention to climate information and how these attentional biases alter the perception of climate evidence and influence subsequent actions to mitigate climate change. We propose a motivated attention framework that offers a cognitive pathway underlying the partisan divide on climate change (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Specifically, the framework suggests that socio-political motivations shape attention to climate information, altering perception of climate evidence and subsequent actions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In three experiments, we provided initial preliminary evidence to support the motivated attention framework. In Experiment 1, we found that liberals tended to attend more to the rising phase of the temperature curve than the flat phase of the curve and give a higher estimate of global temperature change than conservatives did. In addition, liberals who attended more to the rising phase of the curve relative to the flat phase gave a higher estimate of temperature change, but this effect was weaker in conservatives. However, this result was not found in the neutral condition. Thus, attending more to the rising phase of the temperature curve may induce concerns in liberals, leading to a bias in their estimation of the global temperature change, but attending more to the rising phase of the neutral curve does not alter the perception of the evidence because of a lack of prior motivations. These results suggest that political orientation can bias visual attention to climate change evidence, which alters the perception of the evidence.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Experiment 2, we partially replicated the findings in Experiment 1 with a larger sample in the United States using the BubbleView technique to track attention online. The lack of a correlation between political orientation and attention on the rising phase in Experiment 2 could be driven by the fact that the flat phase was indeed less flat than that in Experiment 1. Since the global temperature graph contained both land and ocean data, there was a slight increase from 1930 to 1945. This increase may have made the flat phase and the rising phase more similar, therefore diminishing any attentional bias to the rising phase.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A more important finding in Experiment 2 was that the attentional difference between the rising phase and the flat phase was negatively correlated with the likelihood of signing the petition for liberals, but positively correlated for conservatives. One explanation is that liberals were equally sensitive to the increase in global temperature from 1930 to 1945 in the flat phase and from 1949 to 2017 in the rising phase, so focusing on both phases equally was associated with a higher likelihood of signing the petition. Another explanation is that liberals who were inherently more likely to sign the petition attended to the increases in temperature in both phases equally. For conservatives, however, the relationship was reversed. There were two possible interpretations of the correlation: those who attended more to the rising phase than the flat phase became more concerned with climate change and therefore were more likely to sign the petition; or, those who are more likely to sign a petition generally attend to the rising temperature as evidence for their action. Since the relationship was only correlational, we cannot identify the directionality. Nonetheless, the results from Experiment 2 suggest that attention guides climate actions in different ways for liberals and conservatives.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experiment 3 examined the causality between attention and climate action by drawing attention to the rising phase or the flat phase. We found that liberals were more likely to sign the petition or donate to an environmental organization when the rising phase (their motivationally consistent evidence) was highlighted. However, conservatives were more likely to sign or donate when the flat phase (their motivationally consistent evidence) was highlighted. These results suggest that drawing attention to motivationally consistent evidence increases actions for both liberals and conservatives. Critically, the evidence is different for liberals and conservatives depending on their motivations. This also suggests that the same approach that works for liberals may not work for conservatives.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important limitation of the current study is that it does not provide evidence on how altered perceptions and actions reinforce prior motivations. This is a promising avenue for future studies that can examine this positive feedback loop between actions and motivations. For interventions, future studies can also investigate ways to break the feedback loop to prevent further polarization. For example, since conservatives were more likely to act when they voluntarily attended to stronger evidence of climate change, but not when their attention was deliberately drawn to the evidence, one solution is to implicitly bias conservatives’ visual attention to stronger climate change evidence, such as framing the evidence in a way that is consistent with their values and beliefs (
  <a rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref2">Bain et al., 2012</a>). In the current study, we tested people’s civic actions in the public sphere by asking them to sign a petition and donate to an environmental organization. Future studies can generalize the findings to behaviors in the private sphere, such as how likely they are to drive or fly less.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current study suggests that ideologically driven motivations can influence basic perceptual processes. It reveals an attentional pathway underlying motivated reasoning, which helps explain group polarization. For example, students from different schools may attend to different players in the same game, which led to different perceptions of the game (
  <a rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref13">Hastorf and Cantril, 1954</a>). Liberals and conservatives may attend to different numbers in the same table, which led to different perceptions of risk (
  <a rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref23">Kahan et al., 2011</a>). People with greater science literacy or high numeracy skills may be better able to selectively attend to different sources of evidence, which can lead to greater group polarization (
  <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">Drummond and Fischhoff, 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">Kahan et al., 2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beyond group polarization, the current study provides an attentional account to several well-established phenomena in social psychology. For example, cognitive dissonance is triggered when the evidence presented is inconsistent with a person’s beliefs, which can motivate the person to try to reduce dissonance (
  <a rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref11">Festinger, 1962</a>). One way to reduce dissonance is to avoid focusing attention on situations or information which will likely increase dissonance, and pay greater attention to information which will help to achieve consonance. Another example is confirmation bias where a person seeks or interprets evidence in ways that confirm existing beliefs, expectations, or a hypothesis in mind (
  <a rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref38">Nickerson, 1998</a>). The person may increase his/her attention to evidence that confirms their prior beliefs and suppress attention to evidence that disconfirms their beliefs. A third example is the central and peripheral route to persuasion, where the former involves a deliberate analysis of the content of the message, and the latter uses simple cues in the context (
  <a rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref41">Petty and Cacioppo, 1986</a>). The central route is employed when a person is motivated and has the ability to process the arguments in the message. Otherwise, the peripheral route takes place. When the evidence is consistent with people’s motivations, they may pay more attention to the evidence to deliberately analyze the information, which follows the central route. When the evidence is inconsistent with their motivations, they may pay less attention to the evidence and instead to the peripheral cues, which follows the peripheral route. As shown in one of the past studies, when a message is framed consistently with one’s value, it is more likely to be processed deliberately, and the strength of the argument influenced one’s attitude (
  <a rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref50">von Borgstede et al., 2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to theoretical implications, the current findings have potential practical implications for climate communication that uses data visualization to engage the public and policymakers (
  <a rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref12">Harold et al., 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref3">Bosetti et al., 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref54">Zhao, 2017</a>). First, the current study suggests that providing climate change evidence alone is likely to be insufficient since people may pay attention differently depending on their motivations. Second, the study suggests that we cannot use the same communication strategy for liberals and conservatives. For example, in Experiment 3, we found that drawing attention to more convincing evidence of climate change encouraged more liberals to act, but discouraged conservatives. Third, climate communication needs to align with ideological motivations to capture people’s attention. One approach is to frame climate change consistently with people’s values, such as framing mitigation efforts as promoting a warmer society and economic or technological development (
  <a rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref2">Bain et al., 2012</a>). Another approach is to provide information on peer group norms to shift attention, since people may have incorrect beliefs of how their peers view a controversial issue (
  <a rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref49">Van Boven et al., 2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current study is significant in several ways. First, it provides an attentional mechanism to understand group polarization on climate change. Specifically, our results provide initial preliminary evidence for the motivated attention framework, suggesting an attentional divide between liberals and conservatives. Second, the current study has implications for theories of ideologically motivated reasoning, demonstrating their influence on basic perceptual processes. Third, we offer a free new tool, BubbleView, to track attention online, which is more cost-effective compared to a conventional eyetracker. Finally, our findings have implications for climate communication and the design of behavioral interventions to mobilize actions on climate change in different socio-political groups.</p>
