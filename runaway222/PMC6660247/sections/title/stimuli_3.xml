  </a> provided by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The y-axis was the temperature change relative to a baseline period from 1951 to 1980, a reference period used by NASA. Specifically, the temperature change was the difference between the global mean surface air temperature in each year and the mean temperature from 1951 to 1980 (baseline period). The graph subtended 27.2째 of visual angle in width (916 pixels) and 15.9째 of visual angle in height (527 pixels).
