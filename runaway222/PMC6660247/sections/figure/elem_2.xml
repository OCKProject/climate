  <p>A heatmap showing the average duration of dwell time on the temperature curve for liberals (left, 
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 69) and conservatives (right, 
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 21) in the temperature condition. Participants whose ratings on the political orientation scale were below 0 were grouped as liberals and whose ratings on the political orientation scale were above 0 were grouped as conservatives. Warmer colors represent higher average duration of dwell time.
