 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From an evolutionary psychology perspective, the mind can be seen as a collection of evolved adaptations; people think and behave the way they do because it has given them advantages in the process of natural selection. It is assumed that the human brain structure has been shaped by evolution, which in turn influences human cognition. One such example is hemispheric lateralization, whereby it is easier for most people to perceive speech that enters the right ear (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The evolutionary perspective also assumes that evolution has shaped specific, recurring thought-patterns or mental heuristics within the human mind. A heuristic is a mental tool or guiding rule, designed to solve a specific goal (
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Gigerenzer, 2001</a>). An example of such an adaptive heuristic is “availability” (
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">Tversky and Kahneman, 1974</a>); the tendency to think that an occurrence (e.g., a natural disaster) is more likely to happen when the memory of such an occurrence is easily accessible (as after recent reports of an earthquake on the news). Another example is “anchoring”; the tendency for estimates (e.g., of future global temperatures) to fall relatively close to available anchor points (e.g., a proposed future global temperature suggested by someone else; 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">Joireman et al., 2010</a>). Heuristics make information processing and decision-making fast, frugal and computationally inexpensive. They are also largely successful when applied to the type of problem they are supposed to solve. When the human brain confronts a task it is not well adapted to, however, it applies heuristics designed for other purposes. This mismatch often results in erroneous thinking (
