 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed evolution of the Arctic sea-ice cover is inconsistent with the possible existence of a tipping point arising from self-amplification of the ice cover. First, the evolution has remained linearly linked to the long-term rise in global-mean temperature as outlined above. Second, the 1-year lag autocorrelation of year-to-year changes in summer sea-ice coverage is negative (around âˆ’ 0.5, see also [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]), implying that after a summer with a particularly strong ice loss, the ice cover usually recovers somewhat in the following year. If indeed self-amplification played a significant role in the observed evolution of the ice cover, one would expect both an increasing failure of the linear relationship with rising temperature and an even more substantial ice loss after a year with a substantial ice loss.

 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several stabilizing feedbacks during winter contribute to the lack of self-amplification even in light of the ice-albedo feedback [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>]: First, any ice-free parts of the Arctic Ocean more effectively lose their heat to the atmosphere than those parts that remained ice-covered during winter [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>]. Second, thin ice grows much faster than thick ice in response to the same external forcing, allowing for some recovery of total sea-ice volume after any record ice loss during summer [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. And third, the later the ice cover forms, the thinner will be its isolating snow cover during winter [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that all these stabilizing feedbacks are only active during winter. Throughout summer of a given year, any small perturbation of the ice cover will be effectively amplified. For example, the observed progressively earlier melt onset translates directly to more absorption of solar heat, and thus to a more substantial ice loss during summer and a later onset of autumn freeze-up. This behavior has been found in the observational record [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>] and can be used to estimate the timing of freeze onset at the end of the summer [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed lack of self-amplification of the ongoing ice loss is consistent with the behaviour of the Arctic sea-ice cover in large-scale climate models. In contrast, simplified models of the sea-ice cover often show instabilities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>]. This behavior has been explained by the lack of meridional heat transport and a lack of a seasonal cycle in these simplified models [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>].
