 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this review, we have demonstrated the consistency of existing observation-based studies with existing modeling-based studies regarding the future evolution of sea ice. In particular, we have demonstrated how we can use observational records to reproduce many recent quantitative estimates from primarily model-based studies. The quantitative link between models and observations is established as the agreement with the observed sensitivity has become a litmus test for any model-based estimate of the future evolution of the Arctic sea-ice cover. Where the observed sensitivity is not reproduced by a model, bias correction is applied to obtain reliable model-based estimates of the future evolution of the sea-ice cover. This also implies that often, the best estimate of the future evolution of the Arctic sea-ice cover is obtained by establishing robust relationships in models and observations, and to then extrapolate the quantitative manifestation of such robust relationships from the observational record into the future. The major uncertainty then derives from the quantification of the true sensitivity of the ice cover to changes in the external forcing.</p>
 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on this approach, we identify the following statements to be very likely true for the future evolution of the Arctic sea-ice cover: 
  <div list-type="order" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par52">The Arctic sea-ice cover has been and will remain linearly related to global-mean air temperature in all months. Global-mean air temperature can hence be interpreted as the most important control variable on future Arctic sea-ice evolution.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par53">The observed linear relationship between Arctic sea-ice coverage and global-mean air temperature suggests Arctic sea-ice coverage to drop below 1 million km
     <span class="sup">2</span> in more than 50% of all years for a global warming of less than 2 
     <span class="sup">∘</span>C compared to pre-industrial levels.

   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par54">The observed linear relationship between Arctic sea-ice coverage and cumulative anthropogenic emissions of CO
     <sub>2</sub> suggests Arctic sea-ice coverage to below 1 million km
     <span class="sup">2</span> for more than 50% of all years for total future anthropogenic CO
     <sub>2</sub> emissions of less than 800 Gt.

   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par55">From internal variability, September sea-ice coverage can vary by a maximum of ± 1 million km
     <span class="sup">2</span> for a given global-mean air temperature.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par56">This year-to-year fluctuation can directly be translated into an uncertainty of ± 0.2 to 0.4 
     <span class="sup">∘</span>C for the global warming at which the Arctic Ocean loses its summer sea ice for the first time. For CO
     <sub>2</sub> emissions, the uncertainty is about ± 300 Gt CO
     <sub>2</sub> emissions. Hence, the Arctic Ocean can be expected to be nearly ice-free in 5% of all years for 500-Gt future CO
     <sub>2</sub> emissions and in 95% of all years for 1100-Gt future CO
     <sub>2</sub> emissions.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par57">As the observed linear relationship between Arctic sea-ice coverage and global-mean temperature currently hold for all months, they allow us to estimate the future seasonal cycle directly from the observational record. This is also true for the observed linear relationship between Arctic sea-ice coverage and cumulative CO
     <sub>2</sub> emissions.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on current emission rates of about 40-Gt CO
  <sub>2</sub> per year, these findings imply a substantial likelihood of an ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer before mid-century. The time window to prevent the loss of the Arctic summer sea-ice cover hence closes very rapidly.
