 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Internal variability will remain superimposed on any externally forced trend. Hence, for a given year, the expected ice coverage can be calculated as the expected externally forced ice coverage based on the mean global air temperature plus/minus a specific ice coverage given by internal variability. Given the estimated 95% likelihood interval of at maximum ± 1 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in sea coverage, we can use the observed sensitivity to translate the internal variability of sea-ice coverage to likelihood ranges for any given linear driver of sea-ice evolution. By dividing 1 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> through the observed sensitivities summarized in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, we find that the temperature at which the Arctic first becomes ice free will have a 95% uncertainty range from internal variability of ± 0.2 to 0.4 
  <span class="sup">∘</span>C. These values are in line with results from large-ensemble model simulations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. Combined with the temperature threshold of less than + 2 
  <span class="sup">∘</span>C for a near ice-free ocean during summer, this then implies low, but above zero chances for a near-ice free Arctic ocean at + 1.5 
  <span class="sup">∘</span>C global warming. Again, this is in line with existing recent studies [

 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed relationship between Arctic sea-ice loss and cumulative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions allows us to translate the observed internal variability of the sea-ice cover to an uncertainty range of cumulative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions at which Arctic sea ice will be lost during summer. Dividing the 95% likelihood interval of Arctic sea-ice area of ± 1 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> by the observed sensitivity of − 3 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>/(1000 Gt) directly gives an uncertainty range of ± 330 Gt of cumulative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions for the estimate of the occurrence of an ice free Arctic Ocean during summer. Hence, the 95% uncertainty range for cumulative future emissions of CO
  <sub>2</sub> leading to an ice free Arctic Ocean during summer becomes 500 to 1100 Gt based on the average value of 800 Gt established above. For a given emission per year, this uncertainty range can be translated to an uncertainty range of the year when the Arctic first becomes ice free. For today’s emission of about 40 Gt CO
  <sub>2</sub> per year, we get an uncertainty range of about 15 years, similar to the range of 20 years estimated in earlier studies based on model simulations [
