  <p id="Par1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed substantial loss of Arctic sea ice has raised prospects of a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean within the foreseeable future. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the most likely trajectory of the Arctic sea-ice cover towards this state.</p>

  <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The future trajectory of the Arctic sea-ice cover can be described through a deterministic component arising primarily from future greenhouse gas emissions, and a chaotic component arising from internal variability. The deterministic component is expected to cause a largely ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer for less than 2 
   <span class="sup">âˆ˜</span>C global warming relative to pre-industrial levels. To keep chances below 5 % that the Arctic Ocean will largely be ice free in a given year, total future CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions must remain below 500 Gt.
