 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potato plants have evolved several strategies ranging from physiological and biochemical responses to change in gene expression and metabolic activity to combat drought stress (
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). These strategies enable plants either to maintain water potential by escaping the drought or develop the adaptation mechanisms to tolerate lower water potential. These strategies, however, depend largely on cultivar, growth stage and drought severity. One of the important strategies used by potato plants to survive drought stress is improvement of WUE through reduction in leaf number, leaf area and stomatal conductance as a means to minimize transpiration water loss and conserve leaf water status (
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>) (
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">Deblonde and Ledent, 2001</a>; 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">Coleman, 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">Albiski et al., 2012</a>). However, the associated cost will be reduced leaf surface area for photosynthesis, thus negatively impacting carbohydrate synthesis. The leaves become narrower and develop leaf hair to reduce the light absorbance and prevent photooxidative damage. Some studies have suggested an increase in root to plant biomass ratio during drought stress. Potato cultivars exhibiting higher root to shoot ratio owing to extensive and large root architecture have been found to be less susceptible to drought stress as they can increase nutrient and water uptake efficiency (

  <a rid="B136" ref-type="bibr" href="#B136">Villordon et al., 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="B142" ref-type="bibr" href="#B142">Zarzynska et al., 2017</a>). 
  <a rid="B142" ref-type="bibr" href="#B142">Zarzynska et al. (2017)</a> tested five potato cultivars and reported a correlation between root length and area to tuber yield under drought stress. They concluded that potato cultivars with deeper root length and larger root systems exhibit increased drought tolerance. Acclimation of potato to mild drought stress can reduce yield losses under severe drought stress. Drought acclimation cycles followed by severe drought treatment reduced leaf wilting, induced thicker cuticular layer and more open stomata compared to plants without acclimation treatment (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drought tolerance has also been conferred to the accumulation of compatible solutes (
  <a rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110">Rontein et al., 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">Chen and Murata, 2008</a>). These solutes decrease the leaf water potential without affecting turgor pressure. This will help leaf cells draw water from the soil. Accumulation of glycine-betaine has been observed in higher plants during drought, salinity and low temperature stress (
  <a rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110">Rontein et al., 2002</a>). Using transgenic potato lines with increased betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme for glycine betaine biosynthesis, 
  <a rid="B143" ref-type="bibr" href="#B143">Zhang et al. (2011)</a> has been able to induce drought stress tolerance in potato. In another study 
  <a rid="B135" ref-type="bibr" href="#B135">Vasquez-Robinet et al. (2008)</a> revealed increased accumulation of sugar alcohol and 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Ambard-Bretteville et al. (2003)</a> found elevated proline levels in potato leaves in response to drought stress. At molecular and genomic levels, drought induces expression of numerous stress-related genes that encode proteins including transcription factors and enzymes involved in drought stress tolerance (reviewed by 
  <a rid="B118" ref-type="bibr" href="#B118">Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2007</a>). The products of drought-induced genes are involved in initial stress response and in creating cellular level stress tolerance. Drought stress stimulates the synthesis of abscisic acid (ABA), a phytohormone. ABA is a well-known signaling molecules for closing stomata and inducing expression of several stress-related genes. ABA-induced expression of stress-related genes have been confirmed through exogenous ABA application. However, there are several drought-induced genes which are insensitive to exogenous ABA application suggesting that drought-related genes are governed through both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent mechanisms. 
  <a rid="B135" ref-type="bibr" href="#B135">Vasquez-Robinet et al. (2008)</a> reported that drought tolerant cultivars upregulate the expression of chloroplast-localized antioxidant and molecular chaperones. The ability of potato plants to tolerate drought stress is believed to be governed by upregulation DREB1A (Dehydrin responsive element binding protein) regulons (
  <a rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" href="#B115">Schafleitner et al., 2007</a>). To support this, 
  <a rid="B138" ref-type="bibr" href="#B138">Watanabe et al. (2011)</a> compared AtDREB1a transgenic potato with non-transgenic ones and observed increased drought tolerance in DREB1a transgenic lines. Transgenic potato plants overexpressing 
  <span class="italic">ScCBFI</span> gene from 
  <span class="italic">Solanum commersonii</span> exhibit increased drought tolerance as indicated by improved overall plant performance and extensive root development following drought stress (
  <a rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" href="#B101">Pino et al., 2013</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the past century, intensive crop breeding has been focused on selecting drought resistant cultivars by considering yield, plant phenotype, leaf morphology, osmolyte content and leaf water content as the indicators with little efforts on the rates of either photosynthesis or respiration. Although the majority of the research suggests that enhancing photosynthetic performance under drought strongly improves plant growth, its effect on tuber yield and quality is still not well understood, Thus, future research needs to be focused on understanding the photosynthetic and respiratory regulation of tuber yield and quality during drought stress. Since potato cultivation is expanding to water limited areas and the predicted climate change may further aggravate drought severity, understanding the precise mechanism of drought tolerance at the levels of molecular, biochemical and physiological is critical to improve tuber yield.</p>
