 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plants exhibit different strategies at the physiological, morphological and molecular levels to cope with high temperature stress (see review by 
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Bita and Gerats, 2013</a>). One strategy that plants employ following heat stress is a considerable increase in activity of heat stress transcription factors (
  <span class="italic">HSFs</span>), which trigger an increase in heat shock proteins (HSPs) accumulation. 
  <span class="italic">HSFs</span> are known to involve in governing heat stress response (HSR) and acquired thermotolerance by serving as a molecular chaperones (
  <a rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" href="#B102">Pirkkala et al., 2001</a>; 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Ahn et al., 2004</a>; 
  <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">Koskull-DÃ¶ring et al., 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">Jingkang et al., 2008</a>). 
  <span class="italic">HSF</span> of higher eukaryotes is converted from an inactive monomeric to an active trimeric form following heat stress (
  <a rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95">Nover and Scharf, 1997</a>). In higher eukaryotes, 
  <span class="italic">HSF</span> trimerization is essential for their high-affinity binding to the heat shock element (HSE). In a genome-wide study of potato 
  <span class="italic">HSFs</span>, 
  <a rid="B125" ref-type="bibr" href="#B125">Tang et al. (2016)</a> identified a total of 27 
  <span class="italic">StHSFs</span> in the 
  <span class="italic">Solanum tuberosum</span> genome and their diverse regulatory roles under adverse conditions. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms on how heat stress initiates 
  <span class="italic">HSFs</span> trimerization for their activation and synthesize HSPs is still unknown. 
  <a rid="B130" ref-type="bibr" href="#B130">Trapero-Mozos et al. (2018)</a> reported an increased expression of 
  <span class="italic">HSc70</span> in Desiree potato cultivars at high temperature which resulted into improved tolerance to heat stress as indicated by increase in tuber yield.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of high temperature associated with climate change on potato crop yield is still a major area of research. There is still little information about the growth stage most critical to temperature stress (
  <a rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80">Levy and Veilleux, 2007</a>). The mechanism by which potatoes initially sense the changes in their surrounding temperature and consequently respond to this change at the physiological, biochemical and molecular levels is still not fully understood. Elucidation of such mechanism may offer new insights into the identification of specific characteristics that will be useful in breeding new cultivars aimed at sustaining or even enhancing potato crop productivity and quality in response to climate changes.
