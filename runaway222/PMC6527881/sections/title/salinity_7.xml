 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Salinity is a major threat to crop production worldwide affecting over 800 million hectares of land and representing more than 6% of the global land area (
  <a rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92">Munns and Tester, 2008</a>). Saline soils are predominant in semi-arid and arid regions. Saline soils are usually developed through irrigation of water contaminated with salts, salt water inundation and lack of precipitation to flush out salts from the soil. The accumulation of Na

  <span class="sup">-</span>, or SO

  <span class="sup">2-</span> ions in soil results in poor soil physical and chemical properties including decreased soil porosity, water permeability and soil structure. Salinity is measured in terms of electrical conductivity and osmotic potential. Climate change is predicted to raise the sea level, which may subsequently inundate agricultural soils with saline water in the coastal regions (
  <a rid="B108" ref-type="bibr" href="#B108">Rahmstorf, 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">Dasgupta et al., 2009</a>). The expected increase in drought severity and frequency may also contribute to soil salinity through upward movement of the ground water contaminated with salts. Salinity adversely affects plant growth and development through osmotic stress in the plant. Soil containing higher dissolved solutes of salt lowers the soil water potential affecting water balance in the plant-soil continuum. In order for leaves to maintain downhill water gradient, they require to lower the water potential below the soil water potential resulting water deficit in plants. Thus, the effects of salinity is similar to those of drought stress in many aspects discussed in earlier chapter. In addition, the accumulation of ions of Na

  <span class="sup">2-</span> in cytosol causes ion toxicity and needs to be stored in the vacuole (
  <a rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" href="#B104">Queir贸s et al., 2009a</a>). These ions when present in higher concentrations in the cytosol, hinder enzymatic reactions, protein synthesis and plasma membrane permeability. Salt-induced injury to plant has also been associated with nutrient imbalance and oxidative stress (
  <a rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" href="#B104">Queir贸s et al., 2009a</a>). In sensitive species, salinity retards seedling emergence, root growth and leaf water potential leading to desiccation and early senescence. Salinity also inhibits rates of photosynthesis and alter the expression of genes associated with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism (
  <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">Legay et al., 2009</a>). Plants have evolved several strategies to adapt to salt stress. Three main salinity tolerance strategies in plants have been suggested; (i) ion exclusion from shoot and leaves, (ii) tissue tolerance, and (iii) shoot ion-independent tolerance (

  <a rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" href="#B111">Roy et al., 2014</a>). Salinity tolerance in plants is accounted for by adjustment at the molecular, biochemical, physiological and morphological levels.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potato is considered to be sensitive to salinity stress. Soils that are rich in salt content are detrimental to plant growth and tuber development. The magnitude of salinity effects on potato plant, however, varies with cultivars and salt levels. Salinity hastened the onset of leaf senescence, leaf yellowing and desiccation, and reduced tuber fresh and dry weight per plant (

  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">Jaarsma et al. (2013)</a> also reported growth inhibition and early senescence in salt sensitive cultivars Mozart and Mona Lisa in response to salt treatment. Salinity inhibited the shoot growth and total fresh and dry biomass although the inhibition was more pronounced in salt sensitive cultivar, Concord, relative to tolerant cultivar, Kennebec (
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Aghaei et al., 2009</a>). The decrease in shoot growth and biomass became severe in both cultivars with increased salt dose. Salt stress decreased leaf area, relative water content, leaf stomatal conductance and transpiration rate substantially (

  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Akhtar et al., 2015</a>). Salt stress also significantly inhibited rates of photosynthesis (

  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Akhtar et al., 2015</a>). At ultrastructural level, salinity induced cell vacuolation and thylakoid swelling, and caused reduced grana stacking (

  <a rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" href="#B104">Queir贸s et al., 2009a</a>). Salinity substantially increased the callus Na+ and Cl

  <a rid="B107" ref-type="bibr" href="#B107">2011</a>). Potato plants grown under saline conditions exhibited higher sodium content in leaves, stems, and tubers (
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">Ghosh et al., 2001</a>), Salinity delayed seedling emergence, and inhibited tuber growth and dry matter content, the extent of which increased with higher salt levels (
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">Ghosh et al., 2001</a>). Salt stress reduced the total and marketable tuber yield, which was associated with lower tuber number per plant and average tuber weight (

  <a rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97">Odemis and Caliskan, 2014</a>). Salinity is suggested to increase the contents of water-soluble carbohydrates, starch and total non-structural carbohydrates in leaves (
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">Ghosh et al., 2001</a>). The decreased tuber dry matte content but increased leaf carbohydrate content may suggest that salt stress may retard carbon translocation to tuber. Salinity is also believed to increase tuber nitrogen content but decrease nitrogen reductase activity of leaf (
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">Ghosh et al., 2001</a>). Through cDNA microarray study, 
  <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">Legay et al. (2009)</a> observed that when exposed at 150 mM NaCl potato plants down-regulate expression of genes associated with photosystem (PSII) and PSI chlorophyll synthesis and Calvin cycle enzymes.
