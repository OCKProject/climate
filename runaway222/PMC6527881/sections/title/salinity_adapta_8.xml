 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potato plants employ several strategies to avoid salt injury. One of the key strategies used by potato plants to adapt to salt stress is to exclude Na
  <span class="sup">+</span> accumulation in the cytosol of leaf cells (
  <a rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" href="#B105">Queirós et al., 2009b</a>). This can be achieved by preventing salt export from shoot to the leaves. Alternatively, the ions can be transported from cytosol to vacuole (
  <a rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" href="#B105">Queirós et al., 2009b</a>), which not only maintain the enzyme activity in the cytosol but also adjust cell water potential. 
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">Jaarsma and de Boer (2018)</a> studied the gene expression, corresponding protein levels and activity associated with vacuolar proton pumps and the Na
  <span class="sup">+</span>/H
  <span class="sup">+</span> antiporters in salt tolerant (cv. Desiree and salt sensitive (cv. Mozart) potato cultivars subject to 60 mM NaCl. Their result revealed that potato plant achieve salt tolerance by accumulating ions in the vacuole through vacuolar proton pump-driven Na
  <span class="sup">+</span> transport across the tonoplast in exchange for H
  <span class="sup">+</span>. The activity of V-H
  <span class="sup">+</span>-ATPase and the V-H
  <span class="sup">+</span>-PPase, and the corresponding protein levels were inhibited in both cultivars following salt treatment (
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">Jaarsma and de Boer, 2018</a>). However, upon salt treatment, the V-H
  <span class="sup">+</span>-PPase activity and protein amount were higher in resistant versus sensitive cultivars, which is likely to confer salt tolerance in Desiree. Furthermore, these cultivars responded differentially to H
  <span class="sup">+</span> pump activity such that the decline in H
  <span class="sup">+</span> pump activity was less pronounced in the salt tolerant Desiree relative to sensitive Mozart. This was reflected to higher Na
  <span class="sup">+</span>/H
  <span class="sup">+</span> exchange activity and increased Na
  <span class="sup">+</span> affinity in Desiree than in Mozart. The authors suggest that the higher capacity for Na
  <span class="sup">+</span>/H
  <span class="sup">+</span> exchange and affinity for Na
  <span class="sup">+</span> uptake confers salt tolerance in Desiree. These results were consistent with previous study, which revealed that salt tolerance in potato is associated with Na
  <span class="sup">+</span> sequestration into vacuole through increase Na
  <span class="sup">+</span>/H
  <span class="sup">+</span> antiport activity and pH gradient across the tonoplast (
  <a rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" href="#B105">Queirós et al., 2009b</a>). 
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">Jaarsma et al. (2013)</a> grew six potato cultivars varying in salt tolerance under hydroponic system with different NaCl levels. Their study suggest that the Na
  <span class="sup">+</span> accumulation in shoot is positively correlated with salt tolerance with tolerant cultivars capable of inhibiting Na
  <span class="sup">+</span> export from shoot to leaves.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to drought adaptation strategy potato plants adapt to salinity stress through osmotic adjustment by accumulating compatible solutes in the cytosol (
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">Fidalgo et al., 2004</a>). Salinity decreased leaf water potential leading to reduced cell turgidity, growth retardation and tuber yield loss (
  <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">Levy et al., 1988</a>). Accumulation of compatible solutes is believed to maintain cell turgor pressure without affecting cytosolic enzymatic reactions. This notion is supported by the fact that the proline, a well-known compatible solute, content of Desiree leaves increased by 3.5-fold and 11-fold at 100 and 200 mM NaCl, respectively, compared to untreated controls (
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">Fidalgo et al., 2004</a>). Similar result was obtained following short-term exposure or long-term growth under saline conditions (
  <a rid="B107" ref-type="bibr" href="#B107">Queirós et al., 2011</a>). However, recently 
  <a rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97">Odemis and Caliskan (2014)</a> reported that the foliar application of proline was not effective to minimize the effects of salinity on several physiological characteristics and yield parameters. Thus, effects of proline on salt stress tolerance needs further study. Potato plants under salinity stress adapt to osmotic stress by reducing leaf area and advancing premature leaf senescence to preventing transpirational water loss. Potato plants also avoid salt injury by shortening growth cycle such that the early-maturing exhibits lower tuber yield loss compared to late-maturing cultivars (
  <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">Levy et al., 1988</a>). 
  <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">Legay et al. (2009)</a> reported that potato plants adapt to osmotic stress through induction of transcription factors mediated by ABA-dependent or ABA-independent pathways. Salt stress induced the synthesis of ABA in both leaf and xylem sap (
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Akhtar et al., 2015</a>). ABA is a well-known signaling molecules for closing stomata and inducing expression of several genes involved in stress tolerance including salinity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another strategy used by potato plant to adapt salt stress is to activate reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging pathways. Salt stress generates ROS in the form of singlet oxygen, superoxide, peroxides, hydroxyl radical, which are detrimental to normal cell function as they cause oxidative damage to protein, nucleic acids, lipids among others. Scavenging of ROS is, therefore, critical for plants to survive salt stress. To understand the importance of ROS scavenging in potato, 
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Aghaei et al. (2009)</a> analyzed antioxidant enzyme activities and ion content in tolerant (cv. Kennebec) and sensitive (cv. Concord) cultivars subject to various salinity treatments. They observed a decrease in activity of antioxidant enzymes; ascorbate peroxidise, catalase and glutathione reductase in the shoot of salt sensitive cultivar, Concord, in response to NaCl treatment. In contrast, the activity of all these enzymes were upregulated in salt-tolerant cultivar, Kennebec, following NaCl treatment. This was reflected to higher plant biomass in Kennebec as compared to Concord under salinity stress, suggesting that increased antioxidant enzyme activity makes Kennebec tolerant to salt stress. In a similar experiment, 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">Fidalgo et al. (2004)</a> reported a significant increase in superoxide dismutase activity but decrease in catalase activity with no change in ascorbate peroxidase activity in Desiree at 100 and 200 mM NaCl treatment relative to control. 
  <a rid="B107" ref-type="bibr" href="#B107">Queirós et al. (2011)</a> also observed a decrease in catalase activity and no differences in ascorbate peroxidise activity in salt-treated versus control potato plants. Although the total superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase activities decreased following salt treatment, the amount of ascorbate and reduced glutathione increased in salt treated versus control plants (
  <a rid="B107" ref-type="bibr" href="#B107">Queirós et al., 2011</a>).
