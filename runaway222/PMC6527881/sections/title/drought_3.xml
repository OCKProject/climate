 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drought is a main abiotic stress that can strongly perturb plant performance and crop productivity mainly through inhibition of photosynthesis. Drought induced stomata closure, meant to reduce transpiration water loss and conserve plant water status, also restricts CO
  <sub>2</sub> diffusion in the leaf making the Calvin Cycle CO
  <sub>2</sub> substrate limited (

  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">Dahal et al., 2014a</a>). This may result in the accumulation of ATP and NADPH, since their rates of generation by photosynthetic electron transport chain do not match with their utilization by Calvin cycle. Consequently, there is an energy imbalance in the chloroplast level leading to oxidative stress and damage of cell components. Thus, in addition to stomatal limitation of photosynthesis, water deficit-sensitive biochemical machineries may also limit rates of photosynthesis during drought stress. However, the degree of contribution of stomatal limitation versus biochemical limitation to photosynthetic inhibition is still ambiguous (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of its shallow root system, potato is considered to be the most drought-sensitive crop species. Drought stress negatively affects physiological processes involved in the tuber formation and growth (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). Potato growth and tuber yield largely depends on rainfall, consequently, even a short period of water deficit can cause a substantial loss of tuber yield and deterioration of tuber quality (

  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">Deblonde and Ledent, 2001</a>). The extent of drought induced tuber yield loss, however, largely depends on the duration, severity and plant growth stage (
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">Evers et al., 2010</a>). Early stress is most detrimental to tuberization, bulking and tuber yield due to decreased leaf area, decreased photosynthetic rates and reduced partitioning of assimilates to tubers (
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">Evers et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" href="#B96">Obidiegwu et al., 2015</a>). If drought occurs at an early growth stage, it will substantially suppress tuber initiation, bulking and tuber yield. Drought during tuberization, causes reduction in the stolon number per stem, reflecting in lower tuber number and yield. If potato plants experience drought during tuber bulking stage, they will produce fewer and smaller sized tuber. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that stolon initiation and tuber formation are the most critical stages to drought stress. Drought-induced reduction in tuber yield is mainly associated with strong inhibition of photosynthesis due to stomatal and non-stomatal limitations (
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). Drought stress downregulates the expression of genes that code for chlorophyll 
  <span class="italic">a</span>-
  <span class="italic">b</span> binding proteins, key regulatory photosynthetic enzymes, and sucrose biosynthetic enzymes but upregulate the expression of sucrose breaking enzymes (
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">Hwang et al., 2011</a>). In addition to its impact on tuber yield, drought also considerably affects numerous tuber quality parameters making them unsuitable for processing and consumption (
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). Drought triggers tuber defects such as, tuber cracking, hollow heart, internal brown spot, secondary growth, malformations and considerably increase a-solanine and a-chaconine glycoalkaloid content that may cause several health issues including cancer (reviewed by 
  <a rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" href="#B137">Wang-Pruski and Schofield, 2012</a>). Drought is believed to induce sugar ends, a major quality disorder that causes French fries and potato chips to be dark on one end, which may lead to rejection by consumers (
  <a rid="B127" ref-type="bibr" href="#B127">Thompson et al., 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">Liu et al., 2016</a>). Sugar end tubers are characterized by increased amount of reducing sugars, such as, glucose and fructose, at one end of the tuber. Although the actual losses accounted for by this physiological disorder is still under study, sugar ends can be costly to growers as the crop is rejected by processing industries.
