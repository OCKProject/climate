  <p>A simplified model for the processes involved in the conversion of solar incident energy to final plant biomass and associated energy losses. Out of 100% solar incident energy the C
   <sub>3</sub> photosynthetic organisms are capable of converting only 4.6% to final plant biomass, suggesting a maximum theoretical energy conversion efficiency of 0.046. Most portion of solar energy is lost resulting in considerable decrease in energy conversion efficiency between the solar energy and final plant biomass. Redrawn from
