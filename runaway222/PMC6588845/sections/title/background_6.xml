 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The learning climate can be defined as the physical and psychological environment including how trainees perceive the overall teaching and learning condition and educational tone [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Studies have revealed that a positive learning climate is a key factor for effective learning in different models of clinical, workplace based learning [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. Furthermore, the learning climate as experienced in postgraduate training programs has been linked to learning and clinical outcomes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>] as well as trainees’ long-term practice patterns in terms of quality and safety of patient care [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. In order to evaluate and improve the learning climate, valid and reliable instruments are needed [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Furthermore, the multifaceted nature of the experienced learning climate necessitates the consideration of specific characteristics of each environment [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>].

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Operating Theatre (OT) is an important learning setting for many postgraduate trainees in various health professions like surgery, anesthesiology, and nurse anesthesiology. For all these trainees the OT is the main working and learning environment: all have their own learning goals and all are simultaneously trying to benefit from the various learning opportunities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. The OT as a learning environment can be considered to be especially complicated as it involves collaboration between multiple disciplines, has a diversity of sensory input, is characterized by time pressure, very high stakes and requires resource intensive work [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. All these factors combined can result in different perceptions about learning opportunities and barriers for postgraduate trainees present within the OT.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important factor that might influence the perceived learning climate in the OT, is the interprofessional teamwork that characterizes this environment. Many different professions are involved in taking care of a patient in the OT making interprofessional teamwork essential to warrant patient safety and the patient outcome [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>] which is known to cause tensions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. Recent studies revealed the increasing importance of informal interprofessional learning in the workplace to improve quality of clinical learning [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. The postgraduate trainees in the OT consequently need to collaborate with other professions and learn to work as a team.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measuring the quality of the learning climate creates the opportunity to improve the quality of trainees’ learning by redesigning the workplace curriculum and providing faculty development to improve and tailor the learning environment to student needs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. The Dutch Residency Educational Climate Test (D-RECT) is a widely used tool to measure the learning climate as experienced by residents and measures different constructs related to the integration of working and training in the clinical workplace like supervision, collaboration and feedback [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. Additionally there are two instruments specifically aimed at measuring the OT learning climate, the Surgical Theatre Educational Environment Measure (STEEM) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>] and the Anesthetic Theatre Educational Environment Measure (ATEEM) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. While the D-RECT measures the general learning environment, the STEEM and ATEEM specifically pay attention to the importance of interprofessional teamwork and the high-stakes nature of learning in the OT.
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus far measuring the clinical learning climate has been approached from a mono-professional perspective [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. However, the same learning climate could be experienced differently from the perspective of the different learners present within the same environment. This warrants an interprofessional measure of the learning climate. Therefor the aim of this study was twofold 1) design an interprofessional measure of the OT learning climate and 2) examine the different perceptions of the learning climate in the operating theater among different learners from different professions as well as identify the factors contributing to the perceived learning climate.
