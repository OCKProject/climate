  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, is a 2200-bed tertiary care center in Bangkok, Thailand, with an undergraduate medical school and postgraduate training centers for many specialties. There are 60 operating theaters, which are major training venues for surgical residents (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 70), anesthesia residents (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 70) and student registered-nurse anesthetists (

   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> for the transferability purposes of the qualitative data interpretation. Participants were all training at Siriraj Hospital at the time of this study and were recruited by a research assistant who had no professional relationship with any participants.

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A mixed-methods methodology with an explanatory sequential design was used [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. The explanatory sequential design was divided in two phases: quantitative and qualitative. For the first phase, we designed an instrument fit to evaluate the OT learning climate from the perspective of trainees from different professions. Next, all participants filled out the questionnaire about their perception of the learning climate in the OT. During the second phase mono-professional focus groups were utilized to explore the trainees’ perspectives of the survey results especially from the standpoints of different professions (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>).

   <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The learning climate is an intellectual entity which is difficult to be quantitatively measured [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Because there was no previously-available instrument suitable for the operating theater setting and understandable to three different, professional groups (surgery, anesthesiology and nursing), a new questionnaire was created, based on a combination of three instruments aimed at measuring the educational environment: 1) the Dutch Residency Educational Climate Test (D-RECT) [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>], 2) the Anesthetic Theatre Educational Environment Measure (ATEEM) [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>], and 3) the Surgical Theatre Educational Environment Measure (STEEM) [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. All three instruments have been previously validated and the permissions to reproduce all instruments were obtained. Items from each instrument were selected by comparing the three instruments to cover the main constructs of the three instruments and create a well-balanced instrument (acceptable in length, without redundancy and sufficient items per construct) that would be usable by trainees from all three professions.
   </p>
   <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This process resulted in the creation of a new questionnaire called the Operating Theater Educational Climate Test (OTECT), consisting of 46 items. Each item was assessed on a five-point Likert scale, where a score of 1 denoted ‘strongly disagree’ and a score of 5 denoted ‘strongly agree’.</p>
   <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The questionnaire was translated into Thai by two separate translators, followed by two separate retranslations back into English. The content validity of the Thai version was tested by piloting the questionnaire with surgical staff (
    <span class="italic">N</span> = 3), anesthesia staff (
    <span class="italic">N</span> = 3), nursing staff (
    <span class="italic">N</span> = 3) as well as trainees from all three groups (
    <span class="italic">N</span> = 15, 5 for each profession). Furthermore, a section was added to the questionnaire to collect demographic data from the participants (age, gender, professional department and level of study). Finally, trainees were asked to rate the overall quality of the learning climate in the operating theater, on a scale of one to five, as well as an open-ended question asking them to describe the factors they felt influenced the learning climate most.

The study goals and the purposes of the study were presented to the participants via verbal communication and a brief, written outline at the beginning of the questionnaire. A research assistant distributed and collected the questionnaire without the primary investigator being present in the room.</p>

    <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the construct validity of the newly designed questionnaire, an exploratory factor analysis was performed with Varimax rotation. The final amount of data for factor analysis was 140 (excluding missing data), providing a ratio of over three cases per variable. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was 0.896, which was above the commonly recommended value of 0.6, and Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant (
     <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). The number of factors was forced to 9 from the original version of the questionnaire that contained 9 factors [
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. Two factors were then eliminated due to them containing items with double loading. Furthermore the Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were calculated to determine the internal consistency of the scales.

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>], three mono-professional focus groups were organized during December 2014 and January 2015 to further explore and understand the findings from the quantitative phase. Participants were purposively sampled so that each group consisted of trainees situated in each department belonging to a profession were represented as well as trainees from different training levels. [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. Groups ranged in size from six to nine participants each (six surgical residents, nine anesthesia residents, and eight student registered-nurse anesthetists), and the discussions lasted from 65 to 85 min. Because a member of the teaching staff might inadvertently influence the trainees’ expression of ideas during the discussions, possible bias was reduced by having each focus group moderated by a non-teaching staff member, a female nurse, who had been previously trained in focus group facilitation.

   <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Written informed consent was also obtained from all participants before conducting the focus groups.

Analysis firstly followed principles of open coding in order to get a general appreciation of the data and its meaning. The meaningful text relevant to the research question was highlighted and coded. The codes were subsequently conceptualized and used to create themes. Axial coding was then performed to identify the relationships among the themes. Any discrepancies in the themes and codes were discussed until both researchers obtained consensus.
