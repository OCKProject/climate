 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The physical discomfort caused by room temperature and the large amount of sensory information was discussed by all groups. However, participants identified different elements of the physical environment causing discomfort. One participant from the SN group reported that the noisy environment hampered meaningful contact with her supervisor:

   <p id="Par40">“
    <span class="italic">Sometimes, the OT can be very noisy, like the sound of the drilling and hammering in orthopedic theater. I understand that it is unavoidable. But it disturbed me when I tried to elaborate on my discussion with the supervisor.</span>” (Student nurse anesthetist, first year.)

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants from the AR group did not mention the noise, but had an issue with the temperature: too cold an operating room made them feel uncomfortable. In contrast, one participant from the SR group reported that quietness was a problem that could raise the stress level of the student; as she said:
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par42">“
    <span class="italic">I would like it if my supervisor plays music during the operation, any kind of music would do. It makes the overall environment positive, including learning environment. Imagine when the room is so quiet, and a tense situation occurs, like massive bleeding, the tension in the air will be magnified when it’s too quiet.</span>” (Surgical resident, fourth year.)
