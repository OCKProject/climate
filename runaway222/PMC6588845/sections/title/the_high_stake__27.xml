 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All participants indicated that the nature of the learning environment, namely high stakes, negatively influenced the learning experience in the OT. Patient safety always came first, backgrounding their learning process. One anesthesia resident said:
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par32">“
    <span class="italic">It is a place where we put a patient between life and death. Yes, we want to learn, but the patient safety always comes first.</span>” (Anesthesia resident, third year.)

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All participants mentioned that how their supervisors dealt with critical situations heavily influenced their learning experiences and the extent to which they felt that the supervisor was a good role-model.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par34">“
    <span class="italic">Once, one of my supervisors used bad words and yelled in my face during a critical period. I know that he was stressed out because he was responsible for the patient safety. But to be honest, I was shocked; I had never expected anyone to act like this in such a tense situation.</span>” (Student nurse anesthetist, first year.)
