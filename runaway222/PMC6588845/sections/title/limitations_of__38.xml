 <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is a single-center study, which limits the transferability of the results. However, by providing a specific description of the context and participants of this study and by grounding the work in theories of workplace-based learning and the learning climate we hope to have augmented the transferability. We need to note that although the OT environment is reasonably homogeneous even in various countries, this study was conducted in Thailand, which is a relative high power distance according to Hofstede’s cultural dimensions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Future research needs to focus on how professional culture and national culture interact when it comes to learning climate.
 </p>
 <p id="Par646" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sample population is also limited in number. The construct validation process ideally requires more respondents to fully determine the validity of the questionnaire. However, from a perspective of pragmatism [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>] the newly developed OTECT was useful for the purpose of understanding how postgraduate trainees from different professions experience the same learning climate.
 </p>
 <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future research could look into the effects of an interprofessional learning environment in other clinical settings to help enhance interprofessional collaboration and improve the educational environment in order to maximize the effectiveness of workplace-based leaning for postgraduate trainees from all professions present within the same setting. The newly designed OTECT might assist program leaders in diagnosing the learning climate within their OR’s and improve the learning experiences of their trainees within the OT.</p>
