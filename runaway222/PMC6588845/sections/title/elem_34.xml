 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The influence of the learning climate on outcomes of post-graduate medical education has been widely recognized [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. By evaluating the learning climate, we can get insights in how to improve student learning but also how to (re)design the learning environment and support faculty in their teaching role [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. Traditionally the experienced learning climate has been studied ‘mono-professionally’: from the perspective of trainees within one profession. However, the OT is a learning climate for trainees of diverse professions. Therefor this study set out to understand how three groups of trainees from different professions experienced the learning climate within one working environment, the OT.
 </p>
 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To this purpose we developed the OTECT questionnaire, which was found to be a valid instrument (content and construct validity) and has therefor given us a way to evaluate the OT learning climate from the perspective of all postgraduate trainees present in that environment. Both the results of the OTECT and focus groups indicated similar perceptions of the learning climate for all groups of learners, however some differences and nuances in their perceptions and experiences were also noted. Focus group discussions provided additional depth to the OTECT findings and pointed to the importance of the high stakes nature of the OT, the supervisor, and the interdisciplinary nature of collaborating in the OT to the experienced learning climate.</p>
 <sec id="Sec27" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Positive or negative learning climate?</div>
  <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The OTECT results demonstrated that the overall learning climate in the OT was experienced as positive for all groups from different professions, which is in line with the survey results of Boor et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>] and Silkens et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>] studies. The relatively low scores on the personal wellbeing subscale from this study were comparable to the results found by Holt and Roff [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>] and may be due to the characteristic of postgraduate training programs in health professions with substantial levels of workload that can negatively effect trainees’ wellbeing [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. When looking at the separate subscales, the supervisor factors, interprofessional collaboration and independent practice were rated highest by all trainee groups, potentially implying that these factors can support learning in the OT for all groups. When comparing the OTECT results between groups, the feedback forms and presence of negative attitudes towards trainees were significantly better in the SN group. This may be due to the nature of the SN program where trainees have less responsibility in clinical work and can therefore focus more on learning than their surgery and anesthesiology colleagues. The focus group results pointed out the importance of interprofessional learning among the participants, which is in line with the questionnaire results. However, focus group results highlighted how supervisors might actually hinder trainee learning. This renders the question to what the OTECT stimulates more positive than negative answers about the supervisor role in the educational climate.
  </p>
  <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This question becomes even more pertinent when comparing the OTECT results to the focus groups: While the OTECT results pointed to a mainly positive learning climate, the focus group discussions were dominated by how the participants experienced a negative learning climate. This demonstrates the potential of a Mixed Methods Methodology to unveil different parts of the same picture [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>] and the opportunity provided by the focus groups to dive deeper into and better understand participants experience [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supervision &amp; high stakes environment</div>
  <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of the OTECT questionnaires and the focus groups both pointed to the importance of the supervisor in the OT for all three groups: Supervisors could make or break the learning climate. The key role of the supervisor in the clinical learning environment is supported by a large body of literature from different health professional contexts and levels of training [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Olmos-Vega [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>] and Marshall [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>] revealed that balancing between clinical supervision and resident autonomy according to level of training is an important factor to improve residents’ preferences, which could affect the experienced learning climate. Iwaszkiewicz et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>] explored the characteristics of supervisors who were considered good supervisors in the OT as perceived by surgical residents. Good supervisors created a favorable learning climate by being polite and respectful to their colleagues and trainees, staying calm during crisis situations, providing constructive feedback and demonstrating enthusiasm to teach. Our results add to these findings that inappropriate stress-coping mechanisms of supervisors during crisis as well as the impolite and unsafe learning climate sometimes created strongly impact the learning experiences of trainees in that environment.
  </p>
  <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The high-stakes OT environment affected supervisors and trainees from all three professional groups. Because patient care and safety are the primary goals of the OT, supervisors need to constantly weigh how to ensure patient safety while creating learning opportunities [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. Our focus groups results revealed that postgraduate trainees were very aware of the importance of patient safety and did put it ahead of their learning. However, sometimes supervisors responded to high-stakes situations by creating an unsafe learning climate by criticizing, belittling and scolding. Participants from all groups recognized that an unsafe learning climate could be generated by the verbal and nonverbal behavior of their supervisors. Both Lyon [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>] and Flott and Linden [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>] described how the high-stakes nature of the OT environment directly influenced trainees’ ability to learn there. Lyon more specifically indicated how learning in the OT requires a balance between the emotional impact of the high-stakes environment, the purpose of educational tasks in the busy OT, and the social and interprofessional relations [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. Ali et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>] and Bragard et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>] studied the stress level of emergency physicians and found high levels of stress caused by the nature of high stake environment as well as the need to supervise trainees. Dependent on the supervisor’s coping style, their expressions of emotion and stress could directly influence the postgraduate trainees. Our study demonstrated that when the supervisors had differing preferences and demanded that their personal preferences were followed, it affected the trainees by creating feelings of ambiguity and hampering their experienced learning climate. The participants in our study coped with the unsafe learning environment by making their learning secondary and being as unobtrusive as possible – they avoided critical thinking, discussing and practicing – in order to avoid worsening the atmosphere. Hoel et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>] point to the fact that it is important to consider how negative feelings caused by supervisors influence the socialization process and potentially stimulates reproduction of this behavior in trainees, producing a chain of unfriendly and negative learning atmosphere in the clinical setting.

  <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although all three student groups in our study experience the OT as an environment characterized by rushing and hurriedness, how this influenced their learning seemed to differ. The surgical residents’ views on the time constraint issue was different from other groups but consistent with previous work by Vikis et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. Surgical residents revealed that they found a balance between learning and time constraints. While the anesthesia residents and nurse trainees in our study revealed the pressure from time constraint affected their clinical learning. Also physical discomfort from the OT environment, such as cold and noise, was found to be a factor inhibiting trainees’ ability to learn. Pilcher et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>] reported the effect of the environment’s temperature on the cognitive function of trainees: being in too cold an environment impairs learning capability and student performance, and the duration of the exposure to the cold environment also has consequences for performance. By comparison, participants from this study found that both noise and quietness influenced their learning climate. The physical environment appeared to be an important and simple element that could be easily modified to make it more suitable for student learning [

  <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is a single-center study, which limits the transferability of the results. However, by providing a specific description of the context and participants of this study and by grounding the work in theories of workplace-based learning and the learning climate we hope to have augmented the transferability. We need to note that although the OT environment is reasonably homogeneous even in various countries, this study was conducted in Thailand, which is a relative high power distance according to Hofstede’s cultural dimensions [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Future research needs to focus on how professional culture and national culture interact when it comes to learning climate.
  </p>
  <p id="Par646" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sample population is also limited in number. The construct validation process ideally requires more respondents to fully determine the validity of the questionnaire. However, from a perspective of pragmatism [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>] the newly developed OTECT was useful for the purpose of understanding how postgraduate trainees from different professions experience the same learning climate.
  </p>
  <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future research could look into the effects of an interprofessional learning environment in other clinical settings to help enhance interprofessional collaboration and improve the educational environment in order to maximize the effectiveness of workplace-based leaning for postgraduate trainees from all professions present within the same setting. The newly designed OTECT might assist program leaders in diagnosing the learning climate within their OR’s and improve the learning experiences of their trainees within the OT.</p>
