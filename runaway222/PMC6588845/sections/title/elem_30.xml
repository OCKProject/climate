 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants in all three groups intensively and elaborately discussed the role of the supervisor. Particularly 1) diverse supervisor demands, and 2) the unsafe learning climate that was sometimes created by supervisors, came forward during discussion.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diverse supervisor demands</div>
  <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a result of the high-stakes environment, supervisors could be very demanding regarding upholding their own standards for patient safety. Each supervisor had his or her own techniques, which might not correspond with their colleagues’ techniques. This sometimes resulted in an atmosphere of disrespect among supervisors, which was felt to be unpleasant by the postgraduate trainees and specifically described by AR and SN participants. Participants were set on socializing within the environment and as such tried to adapt to the best of their abilities to the demands of the various supervisors.

     <span class="italic">I thought the anesthetizing style of supervisor A was great, so I used this style when I was working with supervisor B. I knew that there was nothing wrong with this technique. But it just was not supervisor B’s style, and she said… I am not that person; working with me, you have to go my way.</span>” (Anesthesia resident, third year.)

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unsafe learning climate</div>
  <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants from all groups also discussed negative behavior by supervisors and how it could influence the entire learning climate. Being scolded lowered student’s self-esteem and impacted on their long-term relationship with the supervisors. This could also lead to a feeling of fear and loss of autonomy among the trainees. The effect on student’s feelings was strong and hurtful. One surgical resident reported:
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par48">“
     <span class="italic">After being scolded in the OT, I was so stressed that I didn’t want to learn anything. I just wanted these two hours to end very quickly. I didn’t even know what the operation was all about. I just wanted to concentrate on my surgical assistant job, like cut the suture equally, hold the retractor still, to avoid being scolded again.</span>” (Surgical resident, fourth year.)

  <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An unsafe learning climate also undermined the dignity of the trainees and affected their relationship with patients. One participant from the AR group said:
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par50">“
     <span class="italic">My worst experience was when I was scolded in front of the patient. I knew I was doing something critically wrong at that moment, but it ruined my patient’s respect and trust and made me lose my self-esteem.</span>” (Anesthesia resident, first year.)
