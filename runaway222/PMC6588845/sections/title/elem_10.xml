  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The learning climate is an intellectual entity which is difficult to be quantitatively measured [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Because there was no previously-available instrument suitable for the operating theater setting and understandable to three different, professional groups (surgery, anesthesiology and nursing), a new questionnaire was created, based on a combination of three instruments aimed at measuring the educational environment: 1) the Dutch Residency Educational Climate Test (D-RECT) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>], 2) the Anesthetic Theatre Educational Environment Measure (ATEEM) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>], and 3) the Surgical Theatre Educational Environment Measure (STEEM) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. All three instruments have been previously validated and the permissions to reproduce all instruments were obtained. Items from each instrument were selected by comparing the three instruments to cover the main constructs of the three instruments and create a well-balanced instrument (acceptable in length, without redundancy and sufficient items per construct) that would be usable by trainees from all three professions.
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This process resulted in the creation of a new questionnaire called the Operating Theater Educational Climate Test (OTECT), consisting of 46 items. Each item was assessed on a five-point Likert scale, where a score of 1 denoted ‘strongly disagree’ and a score of 5 denoted ‘strongly agree’.</p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The questionnaire was translated into Thai by two separate translators, followed by two separate retranslations back into English. The content validity of the Thai version was tested by piloting the questionnaire with surgical staff (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 3), anesthesia staff (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 3), nursing staff (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 3) as well as trainees from all three groups (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 15, 5 for each profession). Furthermore, a section was added to the questionnaire to collect demographic data from the participants (age, gender, professional department and level of study). Finally, trainees were asked to rate the overall quality of the learning climate in the operating theater, on a scale of one to five, as well as an open-ended question asking them to describe the factors they felt influenced the learning climate most.

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The paper-based questionnaire was separately distributed to each group of participants during their morning conferences, topics of which ranged from a journal peer review and morbidity and mortality conferences once for each group. The study goals and the purposes of the study were presented to the participants via verbal communication and a brief, written outline at the beginning of the questionnaire. A research assistant distributed and collected the questionnaire without the primary investigator being present in the room.</p>

   <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the construct validity of the newly designed questionnaire, an exploratory factor analysis was performed with Varimax rotation. The final amount of data for factor analysis was 140 (excluding missing data), providing a ratio of over three cases per variable. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was 0.896, which was above the commonly recommended value of 0.6, and Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant (
    <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). The number of factors was forced to 9 from the original version of the questionnaire that contained 9 factors [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. Two factors were then eliminated due to them containing items with double loading. Furthermore the Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were calculated to determine the internal consistency of the scales.

The Likert-scale items were analyzed and presented as a mean and a standard deviation and analyzed per professional group. Thereafter analyses were performed on the factor level for each group. To look for differences between professional groups analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. The Bonferoni correction was then performed for post-hoc analysis to minimize the type 1 error [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. The significant difference was determined at the
