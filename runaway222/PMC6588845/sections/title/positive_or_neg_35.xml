 <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The OTECT results demonstrated that the overall learning climate in the OT was experienced as positive for all groups from different professions, which is in line with the survey results of Boor et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>] and Silkens et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>] studies. The relatively low scores on the personal wellbeing subscale from this study were comparable to the results found by Holt and Roff [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>] and may be due to the characteristic of postgraduate training programs in health professions with substantial levels of workload that can negatively effect traineesâ€™ wellbeing [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. When looking at the separate subscales, the supervisor factors, interprofessional collaboration and independent practice were rated highest by all trainee groups, potentially implying that these factors can support learning in the OT for all groups. When comparing the OTECT results between groups, the feedback forms and presence of negative attitudes towards trainees were significantly better in the SN group. This may be due to the nature of the SN program where trainees have less responsibility in clinical work and can therefore focus more on learning than their surgery and anesthesiology colleagues. The focus group results pointed out the importance of interprofessional learning among the participants, which is in line with the questionnaire results. However, focus group results highlighted how supervisors might actually hinder trainee learning. This renders the question to what the OTECT stimulates more positive than negative answers about the supervisor role in the educational climate.

 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This question becomes even more pertinent when comparing the OTECT results to the focus groups: While the OTECT results pointed to a mainly positive learning climate, the focus group discussions were dominated by how the participants experienced a negative learning climate. This demonstrates the potential of a Mixed Methods Methodology to unveil different parts of the same picture [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>] and the opportunity provided by the focus groups to dive deeper into and better understand participants experience [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>].
