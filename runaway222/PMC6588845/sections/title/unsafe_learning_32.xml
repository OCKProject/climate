 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants from all groups also discussed negative behavior by supervisors and how it could influence the entire learning climate. Being scolded lowered student’s self-esteem and impacted on their long-term relationship with the supervisors. This could also lead to a feeling of fear and loss of autonomy among the trainees. The effect on student’s feelings was strong and hurtful. One surgical resident reported:
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par48">“
    <span class="italic">After being scolded in the OT, I was so stressed that I didn’t want to learn anything. I just wanted these two hours to end very quickly. I didn’t even know what the operation was all about. I just wanted to concentrate on my surgical assistant job, like cut the suture equally, hold the retractor still, to avoid being scolded again.</span>” (Surgical resident, fourth year.)

 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An unsafe learning climate also undermined the dignity of the trainees and affected their relationship with patients. One participant from the AR group said:
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par50">“
    <span class="italic">My worst experience was when I was scolded in front of the patient. I knew I was doing something critically wrong at that moment, but it ruined my patient’s respect and trust and made me lose my self-esteem.</span>” (Anesthesia resident, first year.)
