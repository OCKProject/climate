  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2" href="#Fn2">2</a> provide places of exchange for goods such as meat, fish, dairy products, wood products or public transportation, and thus influence the supply and demand for these goods and hence the way they are produced (i.e. use of energy, land-use, industrial activities), which also impacts emissions of CO
  <sub>2</sub>. For example, global markets for fossil fuels and air transportation affect CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions directly and substantially. Many goods and services traded in markets (e.g. cement) also generate CO
  <sub>2</sub> as a by-product and thus contribute indirectly to the increasing levels of OA. While the economic literature on market failures in general is extensive, the results devoted specifically to OA are rare in this discipline, and a search for key word “ocean acidification” in the database ECONLIT (21 March 2018) returned only 18 publications, most of them focusing on impacts rather than causes, with a few exceptions (Fauville et al.

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In theory, markets with perfect competition
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3" href="#Fn3">3</a> could deliver—and allocate in time and space—the amount of OA 
  <span class="italic">optimally</span> for the long-term global well-being of human society. The level of OA would be 
  <span class="italic">optimal</span> in the sense that any other level or allocation of OA could only improve the situation for anyone if someone else was made worse off (Arrow 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">1951</a>; Arrow and Debreu 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">1954</a>). Hence, economic theory would suggest that levels of OA greater than would be 
  <span class="italic">optimal</span> for society are essentially due to multiple kinds of market failures
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4" href="#Fn4">4</a> when perfect competition cannot be achieved. Four kinds of market failure seem particularly pervasive in the case of OA. We describe them individually although they typically occur simultaneously.

  <span class="italic">Negative externality</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>a). Property rights to the seas are often ill defined (especially outside exclusive economic zones), and emissions of CO
  <sub>2</sub> have impacts far away from their sources. Hence, current CO
  <sub>2</sub>-emitting activities do not account for the true cost that these emissions generate to people not involved in the market transaction. National policies could provide incentives to internalize the cost of carbon. However, in order to account for the true costs of carbon on global warming, these must also be globally coordinated, address all sources of carbon, and account for climate change including warming 
  <span class="italic">and</span> other changes due to CO
  <sub>2</sub> including acidification effects related to carbon discussed here (Turley and Gattuso 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" href="#CR105">2012</a>; de Campos Rodrigues 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2016</a>), but also other effects like hypoxia. Sweden has already in place a substantial set of carbon taxes. Meanwhile these do not cover all emitting industries, they are not globally coordinated and do not account for OA (Sterner and Coria 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">2012</a>).

  <span class="italic">Limited information on costs</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>b). Knowledge about the impacts of OA, and—in part—the processes that influence it, is limited and consequently OA-relevant decision-making must deal with substantial uncertainty (Polasky et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">2011</a>). Armstrong et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2012</a>) identified limitations of knowledge that complicate the economic evaluation of the impacts of OA while Brander et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2014</a>) refer to knowledge gaps (see Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). However, recent development (e.g. Seung et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">2015</a>; Colt and Knapp 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2016</a>; Narita and Rehdanz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2017</a>) indicates that progress is rapidly being made in that area.

  <span class="italic">Global public good</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>c). The capacity of the oceans to buffer the effects of OA, and the ability of marine ecosystems to adapt and function under changed pH, can both be seen as global public goods, in the sense that any effort by an individual to attain such buffering automatically benefits other individuals equally. Decentralized decision-making in markets generally lead to under-provision of public goods, since the parties generating the public good do not account for the positive effects imposed on others. This dimension of the problem is particularly complex for OA because causes and impacts span the entire planet, implying that no single country can unilaterally address it. Hence regulating the limitation of OA as a public good cannot be achieved unless countries cooperate to implement the agreed upon policy. Such regulation would require lump-sum financial transfers between individuals, which are practically difficult within a nation state, and even more doubtful in an international context (Sandmo 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">2003</a>); this could, for example, imply that one country would have to compensate other countries that decrease their emissions.

  <span class="italic">Tipping points</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>d). Ecosystem responses to OA may be rapid, and at the same time influence evolutionary processes (Sunday et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">2011</a>). Hence, OA will involve both slow and fast processes, which may trigger rapid, substantial and persistent change—so-called 
  <span class="italic">regime shifts</span>—in marine ecosystems beyond some particular threshold level of OA also called tipping point (Scheffer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">2001</a>; Casini et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2009</a>; Hughes et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2013</a>). Due to unique local environments, heterogeneity, biological adaptation, etc. these tipping points will typically differ in each single location. Several international initiatives aim to identify these changes (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.regimeshifts.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.regimeshifts.org</span>;

This implies that some management choices could be irreversible and that the effects of current levels of OA could impact current and future generations very differently. For example, in Sweden, Finland or the Baltic States, OA could interfere with tipping points in the Baltic Sea that trigger eutrophication (Gustafsson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2012</a>) and changes in marine food chains (Tomczak et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" href="#CR103">2012</a>).
