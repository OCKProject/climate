 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecosystem resilience to OA can be strengthened in the short term by alleviating pressure from other stressors, e.g. by reducing the rate and magnitude of eutrophication, pollution, and fishing. Ecosystems with higher diversity are more resilient to other forms of environmental stress, including OA as available data suggests. Hence, ecological restoration may be a particularly valuable tool in maintaining/increasing diversity and thereby increasing resilience to OA (Worm et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" href="#CR109">2006</a>), implying synergies with efforts to conserve or restore biodiversity (e.g. CBD 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" href="#CR110">1992</a>). As long as ecosystems remain within critical thresholds, human activities such as fisheries and aquaculture can adapt to change. For example, the effects of OA and warming on shallow seagrass ecosystems are similar to the effects of eutrophication and increased fishing pressure (Alsterberg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2013</a>); thus, reducing eutrophication and fishing pressure may (in the short term) directly offset the effects of OA and warming. Furthermore, counteracting OA by alkalinization may be useful in hotspots such as coastal environments but seems to have very limited potential and feasibility at larger scales (e.g. Bill√© et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2013</a>; Weatherdon et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">2015</a>). In two recent publications, Osborne et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2017</a>) as well as Cooley et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2015</a>) outline further adaptation strategies.
