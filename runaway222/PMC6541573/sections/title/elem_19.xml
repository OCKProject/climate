 <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation strategies focus on treating the 
  <span class="italic">symptoms</span> of OA by adjusting natural or human systems such that damage is reduced, and/or beneficial opportunities taken advantage of (Adger et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2007</a>). Adaptation does not target the causes of the problem but rather aims to maintain social well-being in spite of OA. These types of strategy are likely to be easier to apply than mitigation strategies, especially in the short term, because symptoms of OA are problematic at local and regional levels where people can also address them (Cooley and Doney 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2009</a>). Hence adaptation usually requires less coordination effort than global mitigation policies, and those efforts are typically located at the local and regional level where relevant national institutions are usually already in place. Nonetheless, practical examples of OA adaptation remain scarce, and the barriers to negotiate are in many ways the same as those for mitigation strategies, including collective-action problems and information deficits. Three broad types of adaptation strategy can be identified, spanning structural–physical, social, and institutional adaptation. All of these require further government policies and programmes to be initiated and funded (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2014</a>). In addition to the main strategies outlined in this section, broader adaptation potential can be increased through capacity-building activities such as infrastructural improvements, increasing institutional capacity, information, and access to resources (Smit et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">2001</a>).

  <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecosystem resilience to OA can be strengthened in the short term by alleviating pressure from other stressors, e.g. by reducing the rate and magnitude of eutrophication, pollution, and fishing. Ecosystems with higher diversity are more resilient to other forms of environmental stress, including OA as available data suggests. Hence, ecological restoration may be a particularly valuable tool in maintaining/increasing diversity and thereby increasing resilience to OA (Worm et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" href="#CR109">2006</a>), implying synergies with efforts to conserve or restore biodiversity (e.g. CBD 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" href="#CR110">1992</a>). As long as ecosystems remain within critical thresholds, human activities such as fisheries and aquaculture can adapt to change. For example, the effects of OA and warming on shallow seagrass ecosystems are similar to the effects of eutrophication and increased fishing pressure (Alsterberg et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2013</a>); thus, reducing eutrophication and fishing pressure may (in the short term) directly offset the effects of OA and warming. Furthermore, counteracting OA by alkalinization may be useful in hotspots such as coastal environments but seems to have very limited potential and feasibility at larger scales (e.g. Billé et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2013</a>; Weatherdon et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">2015</a>). In two recent publications, Osborne et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2017</a>) as well as Cooley et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2015</a>) outline further adaptation strategies.

  <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The impacts of OA are likely to affect ecosystem services produced in the oceans. Turley and Gattuso (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" href="#CR105">2012</a>) list broad categories of OA impacts on these services including fisheries, aquaculture and food security, coastal protection, tourism, climate regulation, and carbon storage. OA may strengthen some services and reduce others. Negatively affected provisioning services (e.g. landings of fish for human consumption) will likely lead to price increases and impact on food security. A key question is then to what degree those fish may be substituted? For example, fish can become relatively more expensive than other sources of protein and market forces will then automatically steer the economy towards less dependence on fish. This may, however, increase production of substitutes like land animals that can generate higher release of CO
   <sub>2</sub> compared to fish, thus further adding to climate change and OA.
  </p>
  <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If such transition processes are slow and costly, progress may be accelerated by: (i) compensating losers (e.g. fishermen), (ii) providing transitional support, and/or (iii) stimulating innovation to accelerate emergence of alternatives and technical replacement solutions. However, substitutes for the goods or services damaged by OA may not always be available (e.g. loss of fisheries and tourism income due to degradation of high diversity coral reef systems; Worm et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" href="#CR109">2006</a>). Hence, societal priorities will be forced to target less-damaged (or undamaged) goods and services. In the extreme case when life-support systems are affected and no substitute is available, this could have catastrophic impacts on human well-being (although such impacts are perhaps unlikely to arise from OA). This is true even if the absence of substitutes is temporary. These types of response can be deployed either by individual countries or through multilateral cooperation.

  <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in the provision of marine ecosystem services arising from OA will likely generate redistributions of resources between user groups. For example, the different responses of two Arctic fishing communities to the disappearance of north-west Atlantic cod stocks led to two very different outcomes—one community lost substantially while the other was able to target other species and increased income (McCain et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">2016</a>). The opportunity for such responses may, however, be limited if OA has negative impacts on most fish species. Viable adaptation strategies include compensation to disadvantaged groups, and/or helping them adapt to the new situation by stimulating education, investment, etc. However, avoiding the establishment of spurious incentives that effectively reward some sections of society for not managing the change is vital, and therefore such strategies should be transitional (Dixit and Londregan 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1995</a>).
