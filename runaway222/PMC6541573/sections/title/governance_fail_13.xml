 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">OA interacts with many drivers and outcomes, including climate change, marine biodiversity, and food security, therefore its ecological and social repercussions are embedded in a highly diffuse and complex institutional setting. Several actors and international institutions act in this problem domain, where poor political, administrative, and other institutional arrangements, results in slow progress (Galaz et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2012</a>).

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous research in the environmental social sciences has demonstrated that both the type of political institutions as well as the quality of these play an important role in countries’ environmental performance (Jagers

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">2015</a>; Povitkina 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2018</a>). For example, democratic institutions tend to provide more public good than non-democratic alternatives (e.g. Lake and Baum 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2001</a>; Bueno de Mesquita 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2003</a>; Acemoglu and Robinson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2006</a>), thus democratic institutions may have better conditions to cope with OA compared to non-democratic countries. However, even democratic institutions sometimes fail to provide public goods. Politicians focusing on re-election do not always benefit the public interest (Besley and Coate 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">1998</a>; Sterner et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2006</a>), as rational, vote-maximizing politicians are unlikely to introduce policies that they fear the electorate could dislike (Page and Shapiro 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">1983</a>; Stimson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">1995</a>; Burstein 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2003</a>). Elected leaders often work with short time horizons (Haggard 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">1991</a>; Sterner et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2006</a>; Keefer 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2007</a>), while mitigation of, and adaptation to, OA is a truly long-term undertaking. In addition, government policy interventions may result from multiple goals and prioritizations, sometimes contradictory. For example, policies focusing on energy provision or decentralization may even worsen OA if they promote cheap energy or subsidize transport activities that generate more acidification (Anthoff and Hahn 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2010</a>; Helm 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2010</a>). In addition, for both democratic and non-democratic states, the quality of government (e.g. degree of transparency, impartiality, and corruption) conditions the overall environmental performance (Lægreid and Povitkina 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2018</a>). A range of studies have demonstrated the necessity of an uncorrupted state for delivering environmental public goods (Weidner and Jänicke 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" href="#CR108">2002</a>), a capable public administration in implementing environmental policies (Duit 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2016</a>), as well as the importance of rule of law (Fredriksson and Mani 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2002</a>) and the low level of corruption in securing environmental policy implementation (Pellegrini 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2011</a>; Sundström 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">2015</a>).

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the policies surrounding OA are “characterized by the absence of multilateral agreements for policy coordination among states” (Dimitrov et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2007</a>, p. 231) and the Paris Agreement (2015) barely has improved this situation, a few state actors attempt to respond and prepare for the repercussions of OA. For example, states around the Coral Triangle (in the tropical waters of Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, and others) collaborate in the region to improve food security and protect marine ecosystems at risk (Fidelman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2012</a>; Rosen and Olsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">2012</a>), in 2015 the G7 countries issued a joint statement pointing towards the risks with OA, and the EU has funded several initiatives to better understand the causes and consequences of OA (cf. Osborne et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2017</a>). In addition, several international initiatives (led by non-governmental organizations and the United Nations agencies) exist to create awareness around the problem, synthesize and disseminate scientific information, and try to influence high-level negotiation arenas such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (e.g. the Ocean Acidification International Coordination Centre: OA-ICC). Substantial outcomes from these processes, in terms of governmental action to implement concrete policies and policy tools with the capacity to generate behavioural change necessary to prevent OA in specific, are still largely unseen (Galaz et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2012</a>; Osborne et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2017</a>).
