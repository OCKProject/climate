 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> OA exhibits the characteristics of a classic collective-action problem: lack of cooperation among actors responsible for OA results in suboptimal outcomes for the collective (Olson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">1965</a>). As Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>c illustrates, limiting CO
  <sub>2</sub>, and thus OA, will rarely be provided in sufficient quantity, (if at all), because of the difficulties of aggregating all actors’ willingness to pay for it. There is an imminent risk of free-riding arising regardless of whether or not the collective willingness-to-pay for an additional limitation of CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions is large (e.g. Ostrom 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">1990</a>). Significant voluntary behavioural changes are therefore unlikely among individuals. The same holds true regarding potential appropriate responses to the negative externalities, large uncertainties, and the risk of tipping points involved in OA (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>a, b, d). Some form of intentional, third party coordination or 
  <span class="italic">governmental coercion</span> (Mansbridge 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">2014</a>) is usually necessary to address market failures and initiate cooperation, especially when the number of involved actors is very large, dispersed over vast geographical areas, and therefore mostly anonymous to each other. Such governmental coercion usually takes the form of various policy tools aimed at changing the incentive structures governing behavioural choices, either by increasing the attractiveness of preferred behaviour or by exacerbating the negative impact of an undesired behavioural choice.

 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global nature of OA creates a need for global cooperation but the lack of a supranational authority and limited enforcement mechanisms at that scale suggest that legal measures to initiate multilateral cooperation must take the form of voluntary entered into agreements and treaties. Thus, this set-up is largely dependent on the will and the ability of individual states. This can be extremely tricky to achieve (see e.g. the recent withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement), in particular agreements of how costs and benefits should be distributed across national borders, and negotiating multiple free-riding problems (cf. Barrett 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2003</a>). Although not directed towards OA specifically, several international legal regimes addressing the direct and indirect sources of OA are already in place. Global strategies for CO
  <sub>2</sub> mitigation arise from the UNFCCC and subsequent instruments, including the Kyoto Protocol and the recent Paris Agreement. Despite increasing knowledge about OA, the global climate regime contains no provisions explicitly aimed at or related to OA. This has triggered proposals for the elaboration of a specific international agreement focusing on combating OA (Kim 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2012</a>) or for at least highlighting OA as a problem separate from climate change within the present agreements (Herr et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2014</a>). These global-level agreements must be implemented in domestic (or in the case of the EU, regional) legal systems to directly affect the legal situation of individuals or companies. Implementation leaves significant discretion for individual states to choose instruments and methods that are consistent with their legal traditions and political preferences resulting in diverse rules and mechanisms subsequently employed in different jurisdictions.

 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Governments across the world, have proposed, developed, and implemented many pro-environmental policy measures in their attempts to overcome large-scale collective-action problems and, thus, to induce positive individual-level behavioural changes (Jordan 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2005</a>; Sterner and Coria 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">2012</a>; IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2014</a>). Rather than focusing on OA per se, relevant current literature is concerned with policy measures aimed at lowering CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions for the purpose of mitigating climate change.
