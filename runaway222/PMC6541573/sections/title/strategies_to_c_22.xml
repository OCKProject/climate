 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in the provision of marine ecosystem services arising from OA will likely generate redistributions of resources between user groups. For example, the different responses of two Arctic fishing communities to the disappearance of north-west Atlantic cod stocks led to two very different outcomesâ€”one community lost substantially while the other was able to target other species and increased income (McCain et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">2016</a>). The opportunity for such responses may, however, be limited if OA has negative impacts on most fish species. Viable adaptation strategies include compensation to disadvantaged groups, and/or helping them adapt to the new situation by stimulating education, investment, etc. However, avoiding the establishment of spurious incentives that effectively reward some sections of society for not managing the change is vital, and therefore such strategies should be transitional (Dixit and Londregan 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1995</a>).
