  <p>Four market failures causing excessive OA: 
   <span class="bold">a</span> the market does not account for all the cost associated with emitting CO
   <sub>2</sub>; 
   <span class="bold">b</span> there is substantial lack of information about the impacts of OA, so market cost of CO
   <sub>2</sub> + OA impacts are represented by an area of potential location of that curve; 
   <span class="bold">c</span> reducing CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions is a public good so individuals will not be willing to pay so much even though collectively they would benefit, and hence the market will not reduce emissions sufficiently if at all; 
   <span class="bold">d</span> “tipping points” may occur, such that multiple equilibria are possible for large levels of demand and the system may reach a suboptimal equilibrium. The blue curves represent market demand (marginal benefits, here downward sloping) and market supply (marginal costs, upward sloping), with or without cost of OA impacts. 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>market</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">q</span>
   <sub>market</sub> denote, respectively, the price and quantity that will occur spontaneously on the market, while 
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>optimal</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">q</span>
   <sub>optimal</sub> denote, respectively, the price and quantity that would be optimal
