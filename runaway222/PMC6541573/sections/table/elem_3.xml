     <p>• Identify the types and magnitude of 
      <span class="italic">market failures</span> relevant to OA, their consequences, quantify their relative importance and interactions among them

     <p>• Analyse the coherency and/or conflicts between the

      <span class="italic">EU</span>, 
      <span class="italic">and international legal and administrative systems</span> relevant for OA

     <p>• Further explore contradictions, overlaps, and gaps in

     <p>• Analyse whether increased 
      <span class="italic">public knowledge</span> of the causes and consequences of OA, and policy tools to address this problem, could increase public policy support
     </p>
     <p>• Understand the importance of 
      <span class="italic">political</span>–
      <span class="italic">economic context</span> for policy support, and how this interacts with 
      <span class="italic">individual</span>-

     <p>• Develop knowledge on how to foster, evaluate and implement increased 
      <span class="italic">ecosystem resilience to OA through habitat repair and protection</span>
     </p>
     <p>• Improved 
      <span class="italic">resource allocation strategies</span> (e.g. transitional compensation systems, support to new activities, etc.), and identification of winners and losers among societal groups
     </p>
     <p>• Investigate the
