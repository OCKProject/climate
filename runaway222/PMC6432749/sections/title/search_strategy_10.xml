 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preliminary searches were done in MEDLINE to identify search terms. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from inception to October 2017. These two databases were considered the most relevant for this review, and likely to cover the vast majority of determinant frameworks intended for use in health care settings. A comprehensive search strategy was developed for MEDLINE with support from a medical librarian, and subsequently adapted to the other database (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The search strategy combined search terms with medical subject headings and focused on identifying publications on determinant frameworks.

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To supplement the database search, three additional sources were used. Reference lists in publications included for full-text review were screened to identify eligible frameworks. Nine textbooks that provided comprehensive overviews of research regarding implementation science were reviewed [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. These textbooks were reviewed because they are written by influential implementation scientists and the authors of this review have them in their possession. Lastly, five comprehensive overviews of theoretical approaches in implementation science were examined [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. The authors teach implementation science theory at several Swedish universities, and are familiar with these sources as part of their teaching.
