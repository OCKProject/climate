 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the 17 frameworks do not provide specific definitions of context. Instead, they define the concept indirectly by describing a number of contextual determinants (categories and/or sub-categories) that together make up the context. Three frameworks [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>] provided a specific definition of the context concept.

 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CFIR [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>] is presented in a paper that provides a definition of context although the framework itself refers to “inner and outer setting” rather than context: “Context consists of a constellation of active intervening variables and is not just a backdrop for implementation. … For implementation research, ‘context’ is the set of circumstances or unique factors that surround a particular implementation effort … In this paper, we use the term context to connote this broad scope of circumstances and characteristics” ([
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>], p. 3).

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TDF includes one category, “environmental context and resources”, that explicitly refers to context. This category is defined as “any circumstance of a person’s situation or environment that discourages or encourages the development of skills and abilities, independence, social competence and adaptive behaviour” ([
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>], p. 14).

 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kitson et al. ([
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>], p. 150] define context in relation to PARIHS as “the environment or setting in which the proposed change is to be implemented”. The revised version of PARIHS, i-PARIHS, has a wider focus on the different layers of context, differentiating between the immediate local level, the wider organizational level and external health system level, something that was not done in the original PARIHS [
