 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contextual determinants in the 17 frameworks were categorized into 12 different context dimensions (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). The most comprehensive framework was PRISM [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>], which included contextual determinants that could be mapped to 11 context dimensions (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). It was followed by PARIHS [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,

 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 12 context dimensions pertain to different levels of aggregation, from the micro to the macro level of health care. At the micro level, patients can influence implementation. Four broader organizational determinants can be attributed to the meso level: organizational culture and climate, organizational readiness to change, organizational structures, and organizational support. The macro level consists of even broader, “outside”, influences from the wider environment. It was not possible to attribute six of the context dimensions to a single level of aggregation because they may affect both the micro and meso levels (and to some extent also the macro level): social relations and support, financial resources, leadership, time availability, feedback and physical environment.</p>
 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most common context dimensions were organizational support (included in all 17 frameworks), financial resources (16 frameworks), social relations and support (15 frameworks), leadership (14 frameworks), organizational culture and climate (12 frameworks) and organizational readiness to change (12 frameworks). The least common dimension was physical environment (2 frameworks). Patients as a contextual determinant was addressed in 11 of the frameworks.</p>
