 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This scoping review identified 17 unique frameworks in implementation science that address contextual determinants. The results show there is considerable variation with regard to the terms used to denote contextual determinants, how context is defined and conceptualized, and which contextual determinants are accounted for. Most of the frameworks were developed based on empirical studies and theories, models and frameworks used in implementation science to describe determinants of implementation outcomes. Hence, there is considerable intra-field referencing, as many researchers have developed frameworks partially based on earlier frameworks. This could potentially contribute to consolidation and convergence towards a number of core context dimensions, but it could also lead to a less inductive approach to exploring and understanding the context.</p>
 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, most of the frameworks do not actually mention or refer to “context”, instead using other terms to denote such determinants. Furthermore, few of the frameworks provide a precise definition or clarify the meaning of the concept. Instead, most frameworks define the concept indirectly, in terms of specifying a number of determinants that comprise the context. These differences notwithstanding, it is clear that context is commonly viewed as a multi-dimensional concept. The frameworks differed with regard to how many and which determinant categories were related to context (from one contextual determinant category to five) and the proportion of context categories in relation to all determinant categories. In most frameworks, context is one of several determinants and a relatively minor aspect. For instance in the TDF [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>], only three of the 14 determinant categories relate to contextual determinants. In some frameworks context is a more important aspect; in PRISM [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>], all four determinant categories relate to contextual determinants, and in the framework by Fleuren et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>], four of five determinant categories account for contextual determinants.
 </p>
 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found a large variation in the number of contextual determinants (i.e. categories and sub-categories) described in the frameworks. For example, Gurses et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>] list 10 sub-categories belonging to two categories of contextual determinants, whereas Greenhalgh et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>] provide a list of 22 sub-categories that are part of five contextual determinant categories. Frameworks such as those by Greenhalgh et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>], CFIR [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>] and TICD [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>] are quite specific and detailed concerning the contextual determinants. Some of the differences with regard to the number of contextual determinants are due to slightly different aims of the frameworks. Although all frameworks address influences on implementation, the focus varies somewhat, with some identifying determinants for behaviour change and others describing determinants pertaining to adherence to guidelines, research use or use of innovations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The frameworks broadly include two types of context dimensions: those that function as necessary conditions for implementation and those that may be viewed as active, driving forces required to achieve successful implementation. For instance, having sufficient financial resources and time availability may constitute favourable conditions for implementation, but they likely need to be combined with, for example, supportive leadership and social relations if implementation is to succeed. This means that strategies to facilitate implementation, which are usually described as a determinant category of its own [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>], overlap with some context dimensions. Implementation strategies have been defined as “methods or techniques used to enhance the adoption, implementation and sustainability of a clinical program or practice” [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. Hence, the boundary between implementation strategies and some contextual determinants on implementation is ambiguous. One of the dimensions, readiness for change, differs from the others since it is specific to the (evidence-based) practice being implemented, whereas the other context dimensions have relevance regardless of specific practices.
 </p>
 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The frameworks describe discrete contextual determinants by breaking down context into a number of constituent parts. However, the 12 context dimensions are interdependent. For instance, a lack of available staff (organizational support) and/or poor funding for the implementation (financial resources) will likely have a negative impact on the organization’s preparedness for implementation (organizational readiness to change). Therefore, it is important to view context in holistic terms because successful implementation depends on combinations of different contextual determinants. Taking an overly reductionist approach, studying the impact of different dimensions in isolation of each other neglects the fact that two or more seemingly unimportant contextual determinants may combine to create powerful effects, or potentially strong determinants may combine to generate weak effects. Stressing a holistic view, organizational behaviour theorist Johns [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>] has referred to context as a “bundle of stimuli” and talked about “deadly combinations” of otherwise effective determinants that can yield unfavourable outcomes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With regard to the most common context dimensions that emerged from the content analysis of the frameworks, most of the frameworks described contextual determinants that could be attributed to organizational support, financial resources, social relations and support, leadership and organizational culture and climate. Many of the barriers for implementation of evidence-based practices that have been identified earlier in the literature have been associated with these context dimensions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>], underscoring their importance for understanding and addressing implementation challenges.
 </p>
 <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the frameworks included some form of organizational support as a contextual determinant. This support was reflected in various types of administrative, technological and human resources that provide favourable conditions for successful implementation, e.g. planning and organization of work, availability of staff, staff training and information and decision-support systems. Organizational support has been associated with both attitudes toward EBP and EBP use in practice, and has also been shown to mediate the link between organization type (private vs. public organization) and attitudes toward EBP [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dimension of financial resources, which was identified in all but one determinant framework, was expressed in terms of funding, reimbursement, incentives, rewards and costs, i.e. available economic means to support implementation. The importance of this context dimension is supported by a recent systematic review that found lack of financial resources to be an important barrier for the implementation of mental health services integration into primary health care [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>]. Another study highlighted the importance of financial resources when implementing sustainability initiatives in health care facilities, particularily in those that are small and medium-sized [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. These are just a few examples; this context dimension is obviously paramount when it comes to enabling almost any kind of implementation of change in a health care practice.
 </p>
 <p id="Par500" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Social relations and support was also a common context dimension, being comprised of various interpersonal processes that occur when the actions of one or more individuals influence the behaviour, attitudes or beliefs of one or more other individuals. This influence was described in the determinant frameworks as communication, collaboration and learning in groups, teams and networks, identity and norms in groups, and opinion of colleagues.</p>
 <p id="Par501" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Although most frameworks specifically refer to organizational culture, it is important to recognize that health care organizations are inherently multi-cultural given the variety of professions, departments, and teams operating within them [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>]. Indeed, it has increasingly been acknowledged that organizations rarely possess a single, homogeneous culture, and many organization theorists have questioned the overemphasis on “organizational” culture [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>]. Professional cultures are particularly important in health care because professional groups differ with regard to values, norms, beliefs and behaviours [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. It has been shown that professional groups can serve as barriers to implementation of evidence-based practices. For instance, Ferlie et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>] and Fitzgerald and Dopson [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>] identified boundaries between different professional groups that inhibited the spread of new practices. Other studies have shown that professional loyalties may be stronger than those to the organization, which may impede change initiatives and implementation endeavours [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The emphasis on the organization rather than professions is likely due to implementation researchers being more influenced by organization research than the sociology of professions. Although none of the frameworks refer specifically to professional culture, several address social relations and group influences that may serve a similar function in potentially “over-ruling” individuals’ attitudes, beliefs and other behavioural predictors, e.g. “group norms” [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>], “group identity” [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>] and “culture of the network” [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. While addressing organizational culture, two of the frameworks, AIF [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>] and CFIR [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>], also refer to various aspects of organizational climate, which is understood as the surface perceptions and attitudes concerning the observable, surface-level aspects of culture at a particular point in time [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>]. Organizational climate is often defined as the employees’ perceptions of the impact of their work environment, taking into account aspects such as what is promoted, rewarded or punished in the work setting [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par505" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Most of the frameworks refer to contextual determinants in terms of leadership rather than of management. A review of 17 studies that concerned the importance of leadership for implementation found that the two concepts tend to be used interchangeably and are rarely differentiated in implementation research [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>]. However, whereas leadership is concerned with setting a direction for change and developing a vision for the future, management consists of realizing those goals through planning, budgeting and coordinating [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>]. Leadership is broader than management because it involves influence processes with a wide range of people, not just those who have a managerial role [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">75</a>]. Hence, a research challenge to account for the importance of leadership is to identify and gather information from and about those who are leaders. Informal leaders often have a critical role in health care, e.g. clinicians whose views are highly regarded and who are particularly persuasive with their colleagues. Informal leaders may lead others in resisting implementation or change proposed by others [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eleven of the 17 frameworks included patient-related determinants. The relatively low proportion is somewhat surprising in view of the growing importance of patient participation in health care policy making, practice and research [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>]. Patient participation (and related concepts such as shared decision making, patient engagement and patient involvement) has been associated with improved health outcomes and has been advocated as a means to improve the quality of care [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>]. However, implementation science thus far has not emphasized research concerning potential patient determinants on implementation outcomes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 12 context dimensions that emerged from the content analysis of the determinant frameworks belong to different levels of aggregation, suggesting a multi-layered ecological model of the context. Ecological models are used in many disciplines and fields, e.g. public health, sociology, biology, education and psychology, to describe determinants at multiple levels, from the individual to society [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>]. Several of the context dimensions that we identified are multi-level and may influence implementation at different levels. This conceptualization of the context underscores that strategies to facilitate implementation must address more than one level. In line with this ecological model of context, some of the frameworks distinguish between an inner and an outer context of implementation. The inner context is typically understood as micro- and meso-level influences, whereas the outer context refers to macro-level influences beyond the organization, e.g. national guidelines, policies or collaboration with other organizations. Still, the “line” between inner and outer context is somewhat arbitrary and not always clear [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fact that relatively few frameworks address the outer context (wider environment) indicates an emphasis on determinants that exist at organizational and lower-aggregate levels (e.g. teams or groups). Whereas “thick descriptions” of the wider circumstances of the implementation are valuable for interpreting findings, it may be difficult to capture or establish causality between the outer context and implementation outcomes. May et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>] argue that such a “whole system” approach makes it almost impossible to disentangle the complicated relationships between various determinants and to identify the causal mechanisms by which different processes and actors at multiple levels influence each other. This scepticism is relevant and points to the importance of identifying and accounting for key context dimensions in individual studies. Nevertheless, implementation scientists have focused primarily on the individual and organizational levels. While implementation science is a young field, its future development would benefit from drawing from other disciplines which have dealt more with the impact of the macro system, e.g. political science, prevention science, and complexity science.
 </p>
 <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The literature on implementation context has suggested that there are two different context conceptualizations: context as something concrete and passive, e.g. the physical environment in which implementation occurs; and context as something abstract but potentially dynamic, e.g. active support from colleagues and management [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. Most of the frameworks identified in this review emphasize the active view of context, indicating that it is widely recognized that context is not merely a passive backdrop to implementation. The view of context as a physical place implies a positivist notion of context, i.e. the context is an objective entity that can be observed, whereas the view of the context as something more intangible and active represents a more subjectivist perspective that acknowledges the complexity and multi-dimensionality of the context.
 </p>
 <p id="Par73" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Organization theorists [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">84</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>] have described context as a socially constructed phenomenon that is difficult to manipulate or manage. However, the underlying assumption of the frameworks instead is that it is possible to break down the context into its constituent parts, which can be influenced to have an impact on implementation outcomes on the premise of a cause-and-effect relationship between the context and outcomes. Furthermore, some of the frameworks have spawned instruments to measure and quantify various aspects of the context, underscoring an essentially objectivist understanding of the context in implementation science. Examples of such instruments are the Alberta Context Tool [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>] and the Context Assessment Index [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A few recently published reviews have also attempted to identify determinant frameworks, but have used different, albeit overlapping, selection criteria and research questions. Li et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>] focused on organizational contextual determinants for the implementation of evidence-based practices in health care and identified six such determinants. All six of those determinants were included among the 12 context dimensions we identified in our review. While the review by Li et al. was limited to the organizational (meso) level, our review also identified contextual determinants at both micro and macro levels, including patients and the wider environment. A review by Strifler et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>] identified 159 different theories, models and frameworks, but they did not distinguish between the different types of theoretical approaches and did not delve into whether or how context was addressed. Their focus was on the use of the theories, models and frameworks in practice and research concerning prevention and/or management of cancer or other chronic diseases.
 </p>
 <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Discussion about the meaning and relevance of context is not unique to implementation science. Researchers in quality improvement have defined context as “everything else that is not the intervention” ([
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>], p. 605). This is somewhat similar to implementation science, in that the intervention, e.g. an evidence-based practice, is not considered to be part of the context. However, researchers in implementation science typically view this “everything else” in terms of characteristics of the adopters (e.g. health care professionals) and the strategies used to support the implementation. In organizational behaviour, context is typically understood as influences that are external to and/or “above” (i.e. a higher aggregation level than) the individual, e.g. a team, professional group, department or organization [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">91</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>]. This perspective of context resembles the view conveyed in the implementation science frameworks in this review.
 </p>
 <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the learning literature, context is considered to be “multisensory, diffuse and continuously present” ([
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">93</a>], p. 418). Various forms of context have been described, including spatial context (everything we do occurs in a place), temporal context (events are often defined by their sequential properties), cognitive context (influences how information is perceived, processed and stored), and social and cultural contexts (influence how we understand the world and ourselves) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">97</a>]. The temporal aspect of context was not explicitly addressed in any of the frameworks in this review other than time being considered a limited resource (time availability). However, it seems obvious that the timing of implementation could have an impact on the outcomes. For instance, successful results seem less likely if the implementation of an evidence-based practice coincides with numerous other change initiatives or if it occurs during a time of change fatigue, i.e. feelings of stress, exhaustion and burnout among staff associated with rapid and continuous changes in the workplace [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">98</a>]. Although not explicitly mentioned in any of the frameworks, the timing of implementation may be considered an underlying influence on time availability and organizational readiness to change.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Study limitations</div>
  <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some limitations of this review should be acknowledged. We only searched two databases and we may not have identified all relevant determinant frameworks. Although our searches yielded thousands of hits, most publications were excluded because they did not describe a determinant framework according to our definition. Our focus on health care settings may have led us to miss relevant frameworks used in other fields, such as public health, community-based services, and in disciplines such as psychology, sociology, organizational theory and political science, which limits the generalizability of our findings. We did not attempt any kind of quality assessment of the included publications or frameworks. This was not considered feasible due to the variety in study design and scope of the different publications.</p>
