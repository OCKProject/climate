  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To address the study aims, a scoping review was undertaken to identify determinant frameworks that describe determinants, including those related to context, that may influence implementation outcomes, i.e. contextual determinants. Determinant frameworks are frameworks which have a descriptive purpose by pointing to factors believed or found to influence implementation outcomes. They do not specify the mechanisms of change; they are typically more like checklists of factors that influence implementation outcomes. They can be referred to as models, theories, checklists and taxonomies because the terminology is inconsistent [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A scoping review methodology was chosen because it allows for synthesis of findings across a range of study types and designs and provides a broad overview of a topic [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Unlike systematic reviews, which address precise questions (e.g. the effectiveness of a particular type of intervention), scoping reviews can be used to map and clarify key concepts underpinning a research area [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. To ensure that no published determinant framework would be missed, database searches were complemented with examination of textbooks in implementation science and studies that have presented comprehensive overviews of implementation theories, frameworks, models, checklists or taxonomies. The research questions and inclusion and exclusion criteria were established before the review was conducted. Although not always applicable, conduct and reporting of the review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. Because all data were publicly available, ethical review board approval was not necessary. The review protocol was not registered.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eligibility criteria</div>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To be included in the review, studies in the English-speaking literature were required to report a determinant framework that described different determinants for implementation outcomes, including contextual determinants, in implementation of health care practices, from primary to tertiary care. Peer-reviewed scientific articles, as well as text books, were eligible for inclusion. A generic definition of implementation context was applied in this review. Contextual determinants were considered those determinants in the determinant frameworks that were not attributed to or associated with: the practice being implemented (e.g. an evidence-based practice); individual characteristics of the adopters (e.g. health care practitioners’ attitudes, beliefs and motivation concerning this practice); or the strategies used to support the implementation.</p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determinants were defined as factors believed or empirically shown to influence implementation outcomes. Many terms are used for determinants, including barriers, hinders, obstacles, impediments, enablers, and facilitators. Implementation outcomes were defined broadly in terms of behaviours and adherence, adoption, uptake, or use concerning practices of relevance for achieving a more evidence-based health care practice [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We excluded theories which describe causal mechanisms of how various determinants may influence implementation outcomes. We also excluded theoretical approaches developed and used in fields other than implementation science, e.g. psychology, sociology, organizational theory and political science. Further, we excluded so-called process models, which describe the research-to-practice path and/or guide the implementation process rather than describe determinants of implementation outcomes [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determinant frameworks with limited generalizability were excluded; for instance, those that focused on a specific health issue (e.g. diabetes), a specific population or patient group (e.g. HIV-positive persons), a specific intervention (e.g. brief alcohol interventions), and/or were generated to describe or structure the results of a single empirical study. We also excluded studies that only described applications of frameworks, because our aim was to identify studies that focused on describing and detailing the contents of the determinant frameworks (including the contextual determinants).</p>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also excluded community, public health and school settings, governance, health care priority settings and resource allocation, public policy, occupational health, workplace settings, and implementation of models of care. No study design limitations were applied, with the exception of study protocols.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Search strategy</div>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preliminary searches were done in MEDLINE to identify search terms. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from inception to October 2017. These two databases were considered the most relevant for this review, and likely to cover the vast majority of determinant frameworks intended for use in health care settings. A comprehensive search strategy was developed for MEDLINE with support from a medical librarian, and subsequently adapted to the other database (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The search strategy combined search terms with medical subject headings and focused on identifying publications on determinant frameworks.
  </p>
  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To supplement the database search, three additional sources were used. Reference lists in publications included for full-text review were screened to identify eligible frameworks. Nine textbooks that provided comprehensive overviews of research regarding implementation science were reviewed [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. These textbooks were reviewed because they are written by influential implementation scientists and the authors of this review have them in their possession. Lastly, five comprehensive overviews of theoretical approaches in implementation science were examined [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. The authors teach implementation science theory at several Swedish universities, and are familiar with these sources as part of their teaching.

  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both authors independently screened titles and abstracts and selected studies for potential inclusion in the study, applying the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Both authors then read the full texts of these articles to assess eligibility for final inclusion. Any disagreement between the authors regarding eligibility was resolved in consensus.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data extraction</div>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected on the following study characteristics: (1) authors; (2) publication year; (3) what was the desired outcome, as described in the framework?; (4) how were the determinants identified in the framework? (i.e. how was the framework developed?); (5) which determinant categories were described in the framework; (6) which of the determinant categories were associated with contextual determinants and/or are labelled “context”?; and (7) which contextual determinant categories and sub-categories did the framework include? Data extraction was done primarily by one reviewer (PN) and verified by the other (SB).</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data analysis</div>
  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extracted data were analysed to address the four study aims. A qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach was carried out concerning how the frameworks were developed [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. Qualitative content analysis is a method of analysing written, verbal or visual communication messages [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>], with the aim of attaining a condensed and broad description of the phenomenon under study. The analytical process includes coding, creating categories and abstraction. The inductive approach means that the analysis is driven by the data and no a priori codes or categories are used. Terms that were used in the frameworks to denote contextual determinants for implementation were coded with regard to whether the framework referred explicitly to “context” or whether it used other terms to denote contextual determinants. Contextual determinants described in a framework were categorized into different context dimensions. We use the term context dimension(s) for our categorization of the contextual determinants (categories and sub-categories) described in the determinant frameworks. Conceptualization of context was analysed in relation to whether the framework provided explicit definitions of context or whether the concept was defined or understood by means of describing a number of contextual determinants.
  </p>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summary statistics (i.e. frequencies) were used to describe the number of frameworks that were developed in different ways, the number of frameworks that referred to “context”, the number of frameworks that provided explicit definitions of context, and the number of frameworks that addressed the various context dimensions that emerged from the analysis.</p>
