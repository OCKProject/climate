  <p>Relationship between economic impact of global warming and country-level temperature, GDP, and cumulative CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions. (
   <span class="italic">A</span>) The relationship between country-level mean annual temperature and median economic impact of anthropogenic forcing over the 1961–2010 period. The orange line shows the median temperature optimum reported by Burke et al. (
   <a rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" href="#r14">14</a>), and the orange envelope shows the 5–95% range. (
   <span class="italic">B</span>) The relationship between per capita GDP in 2010 and median economic impact of historical anthropogenic forcing over the 1961–2010 period. (
   <span class="italic">C</span>) The relationship between cumulative emissions over the 1961–2010 period (calculated from ref. 
   <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>) and median economic impact of historical anthropogenic forcing over the 1961–2010 period. (
   <span class="italic">A</span>–
   <span class="italic">C</span>) Gray strip plots show the density of points along the 
   <span class="italic">x</span> and 
   <span class="italic">y</span> axes. The black regression line and gray envelope show the 95% confidence interval of a locally weighted regression (“loess”).
