  <p id="Par1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shared decision-making (SDM) is a key principle in asthma management, but continues to be poorly implemented in routine care. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a SDM communication skills training for physicians treating patients with asthma on the SDM behaviors of physicians, and to analyze physician views on the training.</p>

  <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A mixed methods study with a partially mixed sequential equal status design was conducted to evaluate a 12 h SDM communication skills training for physicians treating patients with asthma. It included a short introductory talk, videotaped consultations with simulated asthma patients, video analysis in small group sessions, individual feedback, short presentations, group discussions, and practical exercises. The quantitative evaluation phase consisted of a before (t0) after (t1) comparison of SDM performance using the observer-rated OPTION
   <span class="sup">5</span>, the physician questionnaire SDM-Q-Doc, and the patient questionnaire SDM-Q-9, using dependent t-tests. The qualitative evaluation phase (t2) consisted of a content analysis of audiotaped and transcribed interviews.

  <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initially, 29 physicians participated in the study, 27 physicians provided quantitative data, and 22 physicians provided qualitative data for analysis. Quantitative results showed significantly improved performance in SDM following the training (t1) when compared with performance in SDM before the training (t0) (OPTION
   <span class="sup">5</span>: t (26) = − 5.16; 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) (SDM-Q-Doc: t (26) = − 4.39; 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) (SDM-Q-9: t (26) = − 5.86; 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). The qualitative evaluation showed that most physicians experienced a change in attitude and behavior after the training, and positively appraised the training program. Physicians considered simulated patient consultations, including feedback and video analysis, beneficial and suggested the future use of real patient consultations.

  <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SDM communication skills training for physicians treating patients with asthma has potential to improve SDM performance, but would benefit from using real patient consultations.</p>
