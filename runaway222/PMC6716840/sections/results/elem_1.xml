  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seven training sessions were conducted in 2015–2016, which took place in Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich, Germany. Out of 67 physicians who participated in the training sessions, 29 physicians agreed to participate in the study. Reasons for non-participation were unknown. Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> shows the study sample characteristics. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> displays the flow diagram of the training and study participants. As two study participants provided data for t0 or t1 only, 27 physicians were included in the quantitative data analysis. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the duration of the simulated patient consultations at t0 was 8.64 ± 2.27 min (range: 4.9–14.3 min). Simulated patient consultations at t1 occurred at a mean of 62 ± 33.14 days (range: 19–160 days) after the training, and had a mean duration of 11.09 ± 3.51 min (range: 5.55–21.78 min). Out of 29 study participants, 22 participated in the telephone coaching interviews (t2). Seven physicians did not participate due to time constraints or for unknown reasons. Telephone coaching interviews took place 149 ± 64.67 days (range: 56–272 days) after the second simulated patient consultation (t1) and with a mean duration of 35.95 ± 17.19 min (range: 8.43–86.33 min).

Some physicians detected a more patient-centered approach in their consultations since the training and found themselves paying attention to the patient’s perspective more often than before.

   <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, physicians appreciated the training and felt they benefited from participation. However, not all physicians agreed with all the SDM training contents and questioned the feasibility of some concepts. Some physicians felt that current time pressure in outpatient care prevents the communication ideals of asking open- questions. One physician recounted negative reactions to his attempts to involve patients in decision-making. Despite these critical opinions regarding the applicability of SDM in practice, most physicians expressed their approval of the training.</p>
   <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, physicians liked the short presentations and found them interesting, although a few mentioned they already knew some of the content. Above all, physicians praised the opportunity to receive supervision and multi-perspective feedback on their communication behaviors (Table 
    <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Physicians appreciated the positive and respectful feedback climate and the diverse feedback from simulated patients, colleagues, and trainers, all of them providing different points of view. Repeatedly, physicians valued the chance to learn from their peers’ simulated patient consultations. Mainly, physicians viewed the simulated patient consultations as beneficial and educational, although some of them did not feel comfortable performing an artificial consultation in front of an audience while being videotaped. However, most physicians valued video-analysis of simulated patient consultations as exciting, interesting, and helpful for self-reflection. In contrast to the overall appreciative judgment of video-analysis, a few physicians felt uncomfortable or stressed during the video-analysis, which made them think that they were undergoing a test themselves.

   <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, most physicians considered simulated patient consultations and their subsequent reflection and video-analysis the most beneficial training components. However, physicians highlighted different aspects. Some physicians especially valued the chance to see their own reactions and non-verbal communication during video-analysis or gained most from receiving diverse feedback on their communication behaviors (Table 
    <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). However, a few physicians could not pinpoint a central training component, but they experienced the succession of components as important. Other physicians gained most from the telephone coaching interviews including detailed analysis of individual learning curves.

   <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To improve the training, some physicians felt that assessing communication behaviors under real-world conditions would be better (Table 
    <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Physicians suggested performing the coaching as an audit and feedback session at the practice sites and repeatedly expressed the need to integrate real patients into the training. Other physicians wanted the simulated patient consultations to be more realistic and reflecting their hectic multi-tasking practice environments. In line with this, physicians suggested integration of more diverse and more demanding patient examples. Some physicians felt the need introduce more practical exercises in the training and to have an exemplary video that illustrates optimal physician communication behaviors. Physicians also provided organizational recommendations, for examples, to reduce time intervals between the training components, to extend the training dates, to limit small group sessions to the second day of the training, and to provide references for self-study.
