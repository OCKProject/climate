 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To improve the training, some physicians felt that assessing communication behaviors under real-world conditions would be better (TableÂ 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Physicians suggested performing the coaching as an audit and feedback session at the practice sites and repeatedly expressed the need to integrate real patients into the training. Other physicians wanted the simulated patient consultations to be more realistic and reflecting their hectic multi-tasking practice environments. In line with this, physicians suggested integration of more diverse and more demanding patient examples. Some physicians felt the need introduce more practical exercises in the training and to have an exemplary video that illustrates optimal physician communication behaviors. Physicians also provided organizational recommendations, for examples, to reduce time intervals between the training components, to extend the training dates, to limit small group sessions to the second day of the training, and to provide references for self-study.
