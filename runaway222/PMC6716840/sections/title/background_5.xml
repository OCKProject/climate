 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An essential aspect of patient-centered care is shared decision-making (SDM). SDM describes the process in which clinicians and patients make a joint treatment decision based on the best current medical evidence and patient preferences. The process of SDM requires that both the patient and physician are aware of the decision-making situation, mutually share information, and identify themselves as equal partners in negotiating clinical decisions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite strong international advocacy for SDM and increasing implementation efforts, SDM is not yet the norm in routine care [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Although SDM can be applied in most decision-making situations, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>] it is especially relevant in the treatment of chronic and potentially life-threatening diseases, where multiple evidence-based treatment options exist, and treatment decisions might have long-term consequences for the patient [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>].

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bronchial asthma is a prevalent chronic respiratory disease. Current clinical guidelines for the management of patients with asthma recommend SDM as key principles in asthma management. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>] SDM also benefits the quality of life for pediatric patients with asthma, improves asthma control, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>] and delays exacerbations of asthma attacks [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. Moreover, SDM improves pharmacotherapy adherence and clinical outcomes of adult patients with poorly controlled asthma, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>] and patient commitment to therapy [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Despite promising evidence and integration in clinical guidelines, patient-centered communication and SDM continue to be poorly implemented in the care of asthma patients [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implementation research intents to understand what kind of health care interventions work in “real world” settings, how they work, and why. Also, implementation research investigates approaches to improve these interventions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Implementation research on SDM has recently shown that interventions on multiple system levels, including different stakeholders, are needed for a change of care that fully embraces SDM [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. However, strategies to foster the implementation of SDM usually focus on clinician-mediated or patient-mediated interventions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. SDM training also addresses the attitudes and consultation behaviors of clinicians, which are important factors in the advancement and uptake of SDM [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. Still, many existing SDM training programs have not been evaluated, and there are few studies that have assessed the outcome of SDM training on clinician SDM behaviors [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently, there is poor quality evidence on the efficacy of interventions that aim to improve clinician SDM behaviors, mainly because of the heterogeneity of SDM training programs, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>] and a lack of consensus on how to assess the adoption of SDM [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. Studies that have investigated the concordance between different perspectives on SDM have provided inconsistent results. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>] Therefore, dyadic or triadic SDM measurement approaches including the perspectives of the clinician, the patient, and an independent observer are gaining increasing attention [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of interventions to improve the SDM behaviors of physicians continues to produce inconclusive evidence [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. This can be partly explained by a lack of consensus on training content, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>] and on evaluation outcomes. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>] However, explorative qualitative studies on the perspectives of clinicians might provide helpful information [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>] to design or adapt effective SDM communication skills training. Mixed methods study designs combine the historically distinct approaches of quantitative and qualitative research and are relevant to provide data to address complex health care interventions, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>] including SDM communication skills training. Recently, a mixed methods study assessed the perceptions of clinicians and the barriers towards the adoption of SDM after training. The results provided valuable input for the design of future training and implementation strategies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. Implementation research has highlighted the importance of eliciting the perspectives of stakeholders [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>] to foster the implementation of SDM, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>] and clinicians are key stakeholders in this process.
