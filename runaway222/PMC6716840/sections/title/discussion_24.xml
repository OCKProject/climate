 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A mixed methods study was undertaken to analyze the impact of shared decision-making (SDM) communication skills training for physicians treating patients with asthma on the SDM behaviors of physicians, and to gain information about its reception and needs for modification. Study participants were predominantly highly experienced male physicians working full-time in outpatient care. The results from the quantitative evaluation phase showed increased results from all three perspectives, the physician, the patient, and the observer, after the training. The average SDM observer-rated OPTION
  <span class="sup">5</span> score, the primary outcome, remained relatively low when compared with the relatively high physician and simulated patient SDM ratings. The results from the qualitative evaluation phase revealed that most physicians reported a change of attitudes and behaviors, and mainly approved the training and its components. Physicians considered simulated patient consultations, including subsequent feedback and video-analysis, most beneficial. Moreover, they suggested the integration of real or more realistic simulated patient consultations or the inclusion of actual patients with chronic asthma.

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results from the quantitative evaluation phase showed that physicians improved their SDM behaviors after the training sessions, indicating the potential for SDM communication skills training to support the implementation of SDM in practice. Physicians and simulated patients judged the physician consultation behaviors as highly participatory. Lack of blinding to the study conditions and social desirability bias may explain these high ratings, but the average scores of the SDM-Q-9 and the SDM-Q-Doc in this study are comparable to those found in previously published studies, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>] indicating a common and reproducible finding. Similar to previous studies, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>] OPTION
  <span class="sup">5</span> scores were relatively low compared to the physician and simulated patient SDM ratings, which indicated a lack of consistency in measuring SDM from different viewpoints. However, rather than interpreting this as a problem and aiming to reduce these inconsistencies, systematic integration of all three perspectives may provide the most accurate picture of the SDM process [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the qualitative evaluation phase, physicians voiced their overall satisfaction with the training and stated they would recommend it, especially to interested and younger colleagues. Participating physicians appreciated the opportunity to receive diverse multi-perspective feedback to analyze their own communication behaviors during video-analysis. They also valued the opportunity to watch their colleagues perform consultations. Although a few physicians expressed some discomfort in the training process, most physicians considered these training components to be beneficial and educational. Physicians reported changes in attitudes and behaviors reflecting relational skills, which is one of two core SDM competency categories agreed on by an international group of experts [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. There were few criticisms of the training, which may be due to the sample of voluntary participants, and the fact that one of the trainers conducted the coaching interviews. This fact is likely to have introduced a social desirability bias. However, a few physicians expressed reluctance to incorporate SDM in daily practice as they considered it incompatible with the limited time in their busy practice schedules, which is a common argument against the use of SDM [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study has several notable limitations and strengths. First, an easily accessible sample of physicians were recruited who were willing to participate in the study. This meant that it was likely that the study sample largely consists of physicians with a particularly positive attitude towards SDM training, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>] and who might not have been representative for physicians treating patients with asthma in outpatient care in Germany [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. Moreover, most participating physicians were male, and this may have introduced a gender bias in the results of this study. The study sample was relatively small despite nationwide recruitment through Mundipharma GmbH, and there was no information regarding the reasons for non-participation in the SDM training or the study, and because of this, physician selection bias was likely. Due to the convenience sampling strategy, we did not calculate a power-analysis prior to the study, but performed a post-hoc power-analysis. Second, there was a lack of study blinding of the physicians, simulated patients, and observers, which might have introduced measurement bias due to the Hawthorne effect and social desirability bias. Observer study blinding would have been possible if the study analysis had been limited to analysis of the transcript data, but it was considered to be important to use videotapes for the OPTION
  <span class="sup">5</span> ratings. Third, coaching interviews were conducted by one of the trainers, which might have introduced bias. Moreover, no behavioral theory was used for the quantitative analysis of the interviews, which is another limitation of this study. Fourth, the use of videotaped consultations with student volunteers as patient surrogates for quantitative evaluation limited the external validity of the findings as transference to routine practice was not measured.
 </p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the use of simulated patients is also a strength of this study as it allowed investigation of physicians’ SDM performance of the physicians under equivalent circumstances, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>] increasing the internal validity of the study. Another important strength of the study was the combination of a quantitative and qualitative evaluation in one study, which allowed comparison of the measured effects of the training with perceptions of the involved physicians, to obtain information regarding effective training components and any needs for modification or change. Another possible strength of the study was that change in the SDM behaviors of the participating physicians was evaluated from three perspectives, which followed the recommendation of a triadic approach to measuring SDM (observer, physician, patient) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]. Finally, this study also included established measures with promising psychometric properties [
