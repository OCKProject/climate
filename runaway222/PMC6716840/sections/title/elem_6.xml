  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study aimed to evaluate the impact of SDM communication skills training for physicians treating patients with asthma on the SDM behaviors of physicians measured from three different perspectives (observer, physician, patient). Additionally, this study aimed to analyze physician views on the training, including their perceptions of intrapersonal change after the training, and their suggestions for improvement of the training. To meet these aims, a mixed methods study with a partially mixed sequential equal status design was conducted.</p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study was undertaken with the cooperation of Mundipharma GmbH [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. It was conducted following a partially mixed sequential equal status design, [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>] in line with the guidelines for conducting and reporting mixed analysis studies [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. The study design included a quantitative evaluation phase using a pre-post design with no control group and a qualitative evaluation phase, as shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. Study subjects were physicians treating asthma patients in outpatient care in Germany. Cooperating partners of Mundipharma GmbH invited physicians nationwide, organized their training, and were present at the training sites in Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich in Germany. Authors who were members of the study team conducted the physician training (EM, IS, MH and AB), and the coaching interviews (EM). The training sessions were independent of study participation. Non-probability sequential sampling was used with a parallel study design that included a convenience sample of physicians who were willing to participate in the study. All participating physicians signed an informed consent form including permission for pseudonymized data analysis. The study was conducted in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Association of Hamburg, Germany (Registration No: PV4973).

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SDM communication skills training consisted of 12 h of training administered during a period of 2 days on one weekend. At the beginning of the training, participating physicians performed videotaped consultations with simulated asthma patients (psychology and health sciences students), which were subsequently analyzed in small group sessions during the training. Moreover, the training included a short introductory talk by a pulmonologist, individual feedback by the simulated patients, fellow participants and trainers, short presentations, group discussions, and practical exercises with fellow participants. The training focused on SDM skills based on the three-talk model for clinical practice, [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>] but also included patient-centered communication and motivational interviewing skills [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. After the training, participating physicians had the opportunity to perform a second videotaped consultation with a simulated asthma patient at the physician’s practice site.
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participating physicians received written individual learning curve results comparing their consultations before and after the training. Learning curves included feedback on how much time simulated patients had to state their concerns and physician’s proportions of speech. The feedback also included a comparison of the physician’s and simulated patient’s perceptions of SDM during the consultations. Additionally, the physicians received individual feedback and advice based on the observer-rated Four Habits Coding Scheme, [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>] a template for both guiding and measuring the communication behaviors of physicians [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In subsequent individual semi-structured telephone coaching interviews, one team member (EM) explained individual learning curves to each participant and explored perceptions of the training using an interview guideline. First, the understanding and perception of the learning curves were discussed and time was provided to voice concerns, criticism, and needs regarding the content of the training or the physician’s clinical practice. In the second part of the telephone call, physicians were asked: whether they noticed changes in attitudes and communication behaviors after the training; how satisfied they were with the training program and its components; which training components benefited them the most; how they rated the training program; if they would recommend the training to a friend or colleague; and if they had suggestions on how to improve the training program.</p>

   <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected from May 2015 until December 2016. Demographic and professional characteristics of the participating physicians were collected at the beginning of the training program. Further quantitative data were collected at the beginning of the training (t0) and after the training at the physician’s practice site (t1). Data collection was equivalent at both measurement points. Due to the design of the study, blinding was not feasible.</p>
   <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before the training, four asthma patient case vignettes with identical airflow parameters. They were developed by study team members (EM, AB) experienced in the design of medical case vignettes, and revised by an experienced pulmonologist. Two vignettes were used in simulated patient consultations at t0 and another two were used at t1. Simulated patients were psychology and health sciences students who had received 2 h of training. Consultations with simulated patients were videotaped and transcribed verbatim. Two trained team members independently evaluated the videotapes and transcripts with the OPTION
    <span class="sup">5</span> scale (primary outcome) [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. Training in the application of the OPTION
    <span class="sup">5</span> consisted of independent rating of ten audiotapes and transcribed patient and physician consultations and subsequent comparison and discussion of the results, until consensus was reached. The OPTION
    <span class="sup">5</span> scale is a psychometrically tested five-item observer-based instrument measuring the physician’s efforts to involve the patient in the SDM process using a five-point Likert scale (0 = not observed; 4 = executed to a high standard). Simulated patients were included to measure SDM from the patient’s point of view. Directly after the consultations, the simulated patients completed the patient version of the nine-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>] and physicians completed the physician version of the nine-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-Doc) [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>] (secondary outcomes). The SDM-Q-Doc and the SDM-Q-9 are both psychometrically tested nine-item self-reporting instruments measuring the physician and patient perspective on the decision-making process using a six-point Likert scale (0 = completely disagree; 5 = completely agree).

   <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected from October 2015 until February 2017. Physicians were phoned or e-mailed to make appointments for the telephone coaching interviews (t2). They were sent learning curves by mail prior to the interviews. One team member (EM) conducted and audiotaped semi-structured telephone coaching interviews using an interview guideline, as described above.</p>

   <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study sample and the simulated patient consultations (t0 and t1). To establish the inter-rater reliability of the OPTION
    <span class="sup">5</span> scores, an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) using a one-way random effects model was calculated. The ICC was calculated to test if the mean of the two ratings was suitable for further analysis [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. The means of individual item scores were used to replace missing values for the SDM-Q-Doc and SDM-Q-9 for up to two random missing values per case [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Histograms were visually inspected, and p-p plots were used to test whether the data concurred with the assumption of normality of difference of the dependent t-test. To test whether the physicians showed more SDM behaviors following the training, the mean differences were analyzed between the pre-and post-measurements of OPTION
    <span class="sup">5</span>, the SDM-Q-Doc, and the SDM-Q-9 using dependent t-tests. Since previous training studies showed an increase in SDM behaviors after training, it was assumed that higher scores occurred at the second measurement point (t1), and one-tailed t-tests with an alpha level of 0.05 were used. Due to the pragmatic setting of the study, we did not perform a power-analysis prior to the study, but calculated a post-hoc power analysis with g*power.

   <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Descriptive statistics were analyzed to characterize the telephone coaching interviews (t2). Audiotapes of interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the transcripts were pseudonymized and imported to MAXQDA software version 10 (VERBI, GmbH, Berlin, Germany), which is a software supporting qualitative and mixed methods analysis. Transcripts were analyzed following the principles of directed content analysis, as described by Hsieh and Shannon [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. One team member (AR) made herself familiar with the data, deduced the main codes from the interview guideline, and developed subcodes from the data inductively. As coding entities, units of meaning were chosen. Two team members (AR and AD) independently coded seven (30%) randomly selected transcripts to test the suitability of the code system. The codes were discussed with a third team member (EM) and adapted if necessary. After establishing sufficient consistency, one team member (AR) coded the entire data set and discussed any uncertainties with another team member (EM).
