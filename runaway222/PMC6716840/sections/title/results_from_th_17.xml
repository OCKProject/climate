 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was a moderate degree of reliability with an average ICC of 0.52 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) from − 0.02 to 0.77 for the OPTION
  <span class="sup">5</span> scores. The mean of two raters’ OPTION
  <span class="sup">5</span> scores underwent further analysis. As visual evaluation of the histograms and p-p probability plots of the data supported the assumption of normality of difference of the scores, dependent t-tests were calculated to compare mean scores of the OPTION
  <span class="sup">5</span> (primary outcome), the SDM-Q-Doc, and the SDM-Q-9 (secondary outcomes) data before (t0) and after (t1) the training (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). From the observer’s point of view, physicians displayed more SDM behaviors at the second measurement point t1 (t (26) = − 5.16; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .001). The mean of the OPTION
  <span class="sup">5</span> increased by 11.57 ± 11.65 points on a scale from 0 to 100 from a mean of 21.02 ± 9.71 points before the training to a mean of 32.59 ± 11.49 points after the training. Physicians rated their own SDM behaviors as higher at the second measurement point t1 (t (26) = − 4.39; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .001). The mean score of the SDM-Q-Doc increased by 13.58 ± 16.06 points on a scale from 0 to 100 from a mean of 58.93 ± 16.26 points to a mean of 72.51 ± 11.27 points. Simulated patients rated the physician SDM behaviors higher at the second measurement point t1 (t (26) = − 5.86; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .001). The mean score of the SDM-Q-9 increased by 24.28 ± 21.54 points on a scale from 0 to 100 from a mean of 49.30 ± 15.86 points to a mean of 73.58 ± 11.70 points. Post-hoc power analysis for the use of one-tailored dependent t-tests (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 27, α = .05) resulted in a power of .90 for large effects (d = .50).
