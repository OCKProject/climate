  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some physicians experienced hardly any change due to the SDM training, but most participating physicians found that they consciously paid more attention to their communication behaviors and were more self-reflective since the SDM communication skills training (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Some physicians detected a more patient-centered approach in their consultations since the training and found themselves paying attention to the patient’s perspective more often than before. Aiming for better understanding of patient concerns, some physicians asked more open questions, interrupted less, and asked patients for additional questions.

  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, physicians appreciated the training and felt they benefited from participation. However, not all physicians agreed with all the SDM training contents and questioned the feasibility of some concepts. Some physicians felt that current time pressure in outpatient care prevents the communication ideals of asking open- questions. One physician recounted negative reactions to his attempts to involve patients in decision-making. Despite these critical opinions regarding the applicability of SDM in practice, most physicians expressed their approval of the training.</p>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, physicians liked the short presentations and found them interesting, although a few mentioned they already knew some of the content. Above all, physicians praised the opportunity to receive supervision and multi-perspective feedback on their communication behaviors (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Physicians appreciated the positive and respectful feedback climate and the diverse feedback from simulated patients, colleagues, and trainers, all of them providing different points of view. Repeatedly, physicians valued the chance to learn from their peers’ simulated patient consultations. Mainly, physicians viewed the simulated patient consultations as beneficial and educational, although some of them did not feel comfortable performing an artificial consultation in front of an audience while being videotaped. However, most physicians valued video-analysis of simulated patient consultations as exciting, interesting, and helpful for self-reflection. In contrast to the overall appreciative judgment of video-analysis, a few physicians felt uncomfortable or stressed during the video-analysis, which made them think that they were undergoing a test themselves.

  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, most physicians considered simulated patient consultations and their subsequent reflection and video-analysis the most beneficial training components. However, physicians highlighted different aspects. Some physicians especially valued the chance to see their own reactions and non-verbal communication during video-analysis or gained most from receiving diverse feedback on their communication behaviors (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). However, a few physicians could not pinpoint a central training component, but they experienced the succession of components as important. Other physicians gained most from the telephone coaching interviews including detailed analysis of individual learning curves.

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All physicians asked if they would recommend the training program to a friend or colleague agreed. However, some physicians limited their consent to people they considered interested in the topic or to younger physicians just starting clinical practice (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>).

  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To improve the training, some physicians felt that assessing communication behaviors under real-world conditions would be better (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Physicians suggested performing the coaching as an audit and feedback session at the practice sites and repeatedly expressed the need to integrate real patients into the training. Other physicians wanted the simulated patient consultations to be more realistic and reflecting their hectic multi-tasking practice environments. In line with this, physicians suggested integration of more diverse and more demanding patient examples. Some physicians felt the need introduce more practical exercises in the training and to have an exemplary video that illustrates optimal physician communication behaviors. Physicians also provided organizational recommendations, for examples, to reduce time intervals between the training components, to extend the training dates, to limit small group sessions to the second day of the training, and to provide references for self-study.
