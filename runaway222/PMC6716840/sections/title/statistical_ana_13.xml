 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study sample and the simulated patient consultations (t0 and t1). To establish the inter-rater reliability of the OPTION
  <span class="sup">5</span> scores, an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) using a one-way random effects model was calculated. The ICC was calculated to test if the mean of the two ratings was suitable for further analysis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. The means of individual item scores were used to replace missing values for the SDM-Q-Doc and SDM-Q-9 for up to two random missing values per case [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Histograms were visually inspected, and p-p plots were used to test whether the data concurred with the assumption of normality of difference of the dependent t-test. To test whether the physicians showed more SDM behaviors following the training, the mean differences were analyzed between the pre-and post-measurements of OPTION
  <span class="sup">5</span>, the SDM-Q-Doc, and the SDM-Q-9 using dependent t-tests. Since previous training studies showed an increase in SDM behaviors after training, it was assumed that higher scores occurred at the second measurement point (t1), and one-tailed t-tests with an alpha level of 0.05 were used. Due to the pragmatic setting of the study, we did not perform a power-analysis prior to the study, but calculated a post-hoc power analysis with g*power.
