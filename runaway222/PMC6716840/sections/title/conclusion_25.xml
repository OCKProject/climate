 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study showed that SDM communication skills training for physicians treating patients with asthma has the potential to improve SDM performance, but would benefit from using real patient consultations. This study combined quantitative and qualitative methods, which allowed for a more comprehensive evaluation of the training compared to one methodological approach alone. Results from both evaluation phases indicate the potential to initiate change in the attitudes and behaviors of physicians. However, physician-reported changes in interviews do not imply implementation of SDM but reflect relational skills, a category of SDM core competencies considered essential by experts in the field [

Ongoing training including small group sessions, video analysis of real patient consultations, more opportunities for role-play, audit and feedback sessions at the practice sites could improve the transfer of newly acquired skills to daily clinical practice [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>]. These ideas were also discussed by some physicians in this study. The introduction of patient-mediated interventions, including decision aids or initiatives such as the ‘Ask 3 Questions’ campaign [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>] could complement the training. To achieve implementation in routine care, complex SDM interventions targeting both healthcare providers and patients have so far resulted in the most promising results [
