 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of the first phase of the project (2015–2017) was to develop an interactive process that could be applied by PNN or WWF partners to support the transitions towards future-oriented conservation in their organisations. In accordance with our evolutionary learning approach, Phase 1 drew on design thinking (Brown

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2011</a>; Beier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2016</a>) and co-production processes (Kirchhoff et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2016</a>) to collaboratively explore the challenge in context; to generate shared visions for the future; and to create new ideas for achieving the transitions described in “
  <a rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec3">Four transitions towards future-oriented conservation</a>”. The research team worked with partners to learn about the context that policymakers and protected area managers operate within, establish shared goals, and test workshop activities and facilitation processes. Phase 1 included four workshops organised from August 2015 to June 2017. The participants, aims, methods and leaders are summarised in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. In these workshops, the academic research team presented tools or concepts from the literature, which were tested and critiqued by partners and practitioners, and discussed extensively. The heuristic of VRK was applied throughout to ensure that the conversation included deliberations on social and political values; institutional settings, conventions and rules; and technical and non-technical knowledge. Formal and informal feedback processes, theory of change (Vogel 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2012</a>), and scorecard evaluations were used to provide multiple avenues of dialogue and reflection, and document the process as it advanced.

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following each workshop, the research team distilled the feedback and gradually refined the approach to a suite of concepts and tools that became the “Future-Proofing Conservation process”. Key issues that emerged from Phase 1 included a need to synthesise and summarise existing technical knowledge on climate change relevant to the pilot sites; more intensive research to understand the complex decision-making settings within PNN; the value of opportunities to reflect on previous work and existing knowledge in protected area sites; and activities to engage communities as well as professionals in identifying opportunities for change.</p>
