 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conservation managers in the twenty-first century are confronting relentlessly increasing pressure to cope with change. The magnitude and nature of potential future ecological transformation challenges the very foundations of conservation (Stein et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2013</a>; Wyborn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2016</a>). The most commonly accepted norm for dealing with this pressure is to seek out scientific and technical advice for decision-making, including species adaptiveness (Beever et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2016</a>), ecological modelling (Hannah et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2017</a>), vulnerability (Metcalf et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2015</a>) and projected changes (Foden et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2013</a>). As West et al. wrote, the idea of “managing for change” in conservation “…will be a challenging proposition since it is difficult to anticipate threshold changes and because the array of potential states into which a system may change is highly uncertain; thus concentrated research to understand the characteristics and indicators of threshold responses will be essential” (West et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">2009</a>, p. 1018). Yet despite the prevalence of this norm, there is growing awareness that there may be limits to technical solutions, as climate adaptation is recognised as a complex socio-political process involving authority, knowledge and subjective values (Hagerman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">2010</a>; Lemieux and Scott 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2011</a>; Eriksen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2015</a>). Over the last decade, a growing array of scholars are drawing attention to the institutional dimensions of climate adaptation in conservation. Rannow et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2014</a>) highlight technical and legal issues for protected areas, while Abrahms et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2017</a>) make recommendations on technical knowledge, tools and frameworks for managing protected areas under climate change. Yet despite established frameworks and principles (Gross et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">2016</a>), analysts note that “Implementation of adaptation plans and strategies continues to lag…” (Stein et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2013</a>, p. 2, see also Jantarasami et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>; Wise et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2014</a>). In general terms, this can be regarded as the fault line that emerges when new (climate adaptation) demands are imposed on organisational structures that have been created and evolved to meet the old (maintain existing ecosystems) demands. As Stein et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2013</a>) go on to observe “…while the concept of adaptive capacity is often thought of in reference to the species and ecosystems that are the targets of adaptation action, the ability of institutions themselves to adjust and evolve will be key to their ability to change” (p. 508). (See also Dunlop et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2013</a>; Wyborn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2016</a>.) But although there is growing documentation of 
  <span class="italic">what</span> conservation institutions should do to govern for climate adaptation, relatively few have asked 
  <span class="italic">how</span> they can adjust or, as Pelling (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2011</a>) argues, transform in the face of climate change 
  <span class="italic">from their existing governance structures</span>?

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This article reports on a project that sought to approach this question by working with organisations at the forefront of conservation governance practice. The Future-Proofing Conservation project was developed to explore new ways of managing protected areas when there is potential for large-scale, rapid and transformative ecological change. Drawing on Pelling et al.’s (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2015</a>, see also 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2011</a>) differentiation between transitions: “incremental adjustments that preserve systems integrity when conditions change” and transformation: “measures that challenge the stability of current systems” (p. 116), we sought to establish processes and tools that enabled transitions from traditional approaches to ‘future-oriented conservation’, and to investigate whether incremental transitions could accumulate to larger transformations. This project was formed by a partnership between researchers (The Australian National University, the Luc Hoffmann Institute, The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation), civil society (World Wildlife Fund Colombia, WWF-C), practitioners (Parques Nacionales Naturales de Colombia, PNN), and conservation advisers (Equilibrium Research). (Throughout this article we refer to the core collaborative research team members as the ‘research team’ (authors), a broader group of engaged policy and management colleagues from WWF and PNN as ‘partners’ and practitioners who participated in activities as ‘participants’.) Collectively, we developed an approach to enabling transitions towards more “future-oriented” conservation (Wyborn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2016</a>). The Future-Proofing Conservation process that emerged is a structured, interactive, dialogue-based series of activities. These activities encourage conservation practitioners to consider their current management approaches in light of future climate change, and to explore alternatives based on diverse social values and benefits. In this article, we present the Future-Proofing Conservation process, illustrated by pilot studies in Colombia.
