 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Future-Proofing Conservation project was founded on a philosophical perspective drawn from evolutionary learning. Ansell and colleagues (Ansell and Gash 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2007</a>; Ansell 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2011</a>) propose that evolutionary learning takes place through three central and interconnected activities. First, taking a problem-driven perspective, ensuring that abstract concepts (in our case, around futures thinking, transformation, governance and values) are grounded in actual problems and the experience of participants, and a thorough understanding of decision-making contexts. Our collaboration directly involved practitioner partners to develop shared understanding of climate adaptation as a management problem and its socio-political framing. Second, it recognises that being reflexive about individual and institutional frameworks which shape possible actions can create new options for change. We considered both the formal institutional arrangements and the historically embedded informal expectations and norms that influence conservation actions (Ostrom 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">1999</a>). Third, it involves creating spaces where stakeholders can develop ideas, discuss social values, share information, and consider current institutional rules and future possibilities for change. We co-designed processes that encourage partners and participants to work together to explore implications of new information and create new understandings and solutions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within this broad philosophical framing we drew on the conceptual heuristic of values-rules-knowledge (VRK) as developed by Gorddard et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2016</a>) as an accessible way to engage with the contextual factors shaping how our partners and participants approach climate adaptation and conservation. VRK emphasises that climate adaptation in conservation can be enabled not only by updating or increasing what we know (technical knowledge); it also requires changing the rules that shape policy and practice (governance and management); and evolution of values (socio-political preferences) driving conservation. Addressed separately, they can each support incremental change. But deliberately driving co-evolution of values, rules and knowledge together can lead to a more meaningful transformation in thinking and action towards the goal of “future-oriented conservation”.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four transitions towards future-oriented conservation</div>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We define future-oriented conservation as policy, planning and management that effectively anticipates change and actively prepares for it over the long term. In order to achieve this, there are currently a wide range of possible approaches, tools, methods, strategies and processes (see Gross et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">2016</a>; Abrahms et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2017</a>). For protected area policymakers, planners and managers, it can be difficult to know where to start, especially when tools or methods have been developed to suit other ecological, social and political contexts, and different possible futures. We distilled from the literature four propositions regarding how future-oriented conservation could be achieved via four transitions for conservation managers:
   <div list-type="order" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p id="Par17">
      <span class="italic">From strategies and practices based on resisting ecological change to strategies and practices that anticipate and accommodate ecological change</span> Conservation is, almost by definition, concerned with conserving ecosystems, species or landscapes in their current state or restoring them to a previous state. Related climate adaptation literature and scientific research more generally have tended to frame the primary goal of adaptation as building resilience in ecosystems, increasing the capacity of ecosystems to maintain or return to their core characteristics despite changing climatic conditions. However, strategies based on resilience, stasis or restoration may not be sufficient in a changing climate (Baron et al. 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2009</a>; West et al. 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">2009</a>; Boyd et al. 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2015</a>), and may even be counterproductive if resources are directed towards maintaining features that will inevitably change (Dunlop 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2013</a>). Anticipating and accommodating involves both practical changes and a more conceptual change, as traditional conservation ideals, goals and targets (key species, historic communities) might no longer be suitable guides for management (Tschakert and Dietrich 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2010</a>). This is not simply substituting one source of information for another, but a shift in the social and political basis of decision-making (Adger et al. 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2009</a>), from objective “things” (species, ecosystems) that were previously central to conservation concern to subjective “values” that are contestable and more overtly political.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p id="Par18">
      <span class="italic">From conservation goals and targets focusing on ecological attributes to goals and targets that also focus on social values and benefits</span> Conservation goals that relate to specific attributes such as particular species or communities may become unreachable as ecosystems change. While including social values is sometimes noted as an important aspect of adaptive management for protected areas (e.g., Lockwood 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2006</a>; Tanner-McAllister et al. 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2017</a>), we propose that a focus on social values and benefits can offer an additional management path, as benefits may persist even as ecological attributes change. For example, where an important benefit of a protected area is supply of clean water, the landscape processes that produce clean water may remain even if the species of trees or understory in a forest change. This helps people to understand that benefits can persist even if ecosystems transform. For simplicity, we deliberately merged 
      <span class="italic">benefits</span> (what people get) and 
      <span class="italic">values</span> (what people like/want) by assuming that people value something that provides benefits. This transition implies a general recognition that maintaining benefits experienced by people may be different from maintaining the current state of the ecosystems themselves (Chan et al. 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2006</a>).

    <div class="list-item">
     <p id="Par19">
      <span class="italic">From understanding climate adaptation as a scientific issue to understanding it as a governance issue</span> Scientific knowledge and technical solutions are often assumed to be the best resources and strategies to support conservation (Godet 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2006</a>; Gabriel 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2014</a>; Rannow et al. 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2014</a>), and many partners and participants in our study reflected this view. This is consistent with Archie et al’s empirical research where conservation decision-makers noted “lack of information” as a key barrier to adaptation (Archie et al. 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2012</a>; see also Lonsdale et al. 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2017</a>). While climate change projections are improving, the impacts on specific protected areas are typically uncertain, and implementation options implied by technical analysis can be infeasible (Lemieux and Scott 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2011</a>). Yet even with precise information, managers are confronted by a complex array of social and political challenges when making adaptation decisions that emerge from contested values, multi-layered policy challenges and institutions that are often resistant to change (Eriksen et al. 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2015</a>). Focusing on climate adaptation as a governance issue opens conversations about how we organise ourselves to address changing ecosystems, including identifying other (non-technical) information that may also be useful for decision-making. For example, incorporating social values and benefits requires consultation on what those benefits are, who receives them and how they are prioritised.

    <div class="list-item">
     <p id="Par20">
      <span class="italic">From conservation practices based on problem-solving to practices based on ongoing learning</span> All of the above imply a more dynamic and uncertain management environment; the problem of climate change cannot be “solved” in any conventional sense. Consistent with adaptive management approaches, interventions need to be informed by new knowledge from many sources, and adapt as biophysical conditions and societal values continue to change (Olsson et al. 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">2006</a>; Berkes et al. 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2008</a>). Research on anticipatory approaches suggests management should complement activities focused on solving defined problems (e.g., a water shortage) with learning as social and ecological conditions change (e.g., water planning) (Tschakert and Dietrich 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2010</a>; Boyd et al. 
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2015</a>).

  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the diagram, we recognise that “Traditional Conservation approach to climate adaptation” is a stereotype, as most conservation practitioners are at least part way along at least some of these transitions. Activities in italics in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> were designed to determine where participants were between the “traditional” and the “future-oriented” approaches, and to develop a shared conceptual base from which we could explore possibilities for transforming conservation management. For example, in Colombia, protected area managers and conservation agencies were well advanced in understanding the need for different approaches to management (Transition #1) and were part way towards creating a learning-based approach (Transition #3), which generated opportunities to advance the other transitions.
  </p>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These transitions offer useful entry points into the complex and difficult questions of how social, political, economic and cultural forces form the context for adaptation decision-making, and were used throughout the process to help navigate the range of options and guide the development process. Importantly, they were regarded as cumulative, rather than independent—we were not looking to choose between them but to find context-relevant tools and processes that could advance all of them. Pelling (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2011</a>) differentiates between resistance that seeks to maintain existing structures and processes; transitions that represented incremental changes that do not challenge existing social and political structures; and transformations which represented change in political regimes. Our overarching proposition is that individually these propositions are incremental transitions, but cumulatively they can support a transformative change in social and political organisation.
