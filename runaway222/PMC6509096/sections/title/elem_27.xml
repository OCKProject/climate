 <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The transformation theories that informed this study emphasise the social, institutional and political aspects of decision-making (Wise et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2014</a>; Pelling et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2015</a>), and the importance of the interaction between cognitive knowledge, social values and institutional rules (Gorddard et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2016</a>). On the basis of working directly with partners to address the gap between recognition of the need for change and the implementation of transformation in practice, we found that exploring the social, institutional and political space created options for transforming management that were otherwise not apparent. The study suggests that the cognitive shift of recognising the need for changed management is not difficult; practitioners were already well aware that biophysical change was underway and needed new management strategies. However, the ‘gap’ arose when they sought to apply this cognitive shift directly to policy, planning and management shifts, 
  <span class="italic">without</span> first examining the social, institutional and political context. The pathway for transformation—for connecting the present with the future—could not extend beyond the incremental 
  <span class="italic">until</span> change was explored through the lens of existing social, institutional and political arrangements.
 </p>
 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In some respects, it may seem counter-intuitive that spending time and resources examining existing governance arrangements creates new options rather than reinforcing them making transformation more difficult to imagine. Yet by reiterating the cognitive shift throughout (“change needs to happen”), and carefully crafting context-specific links between the change in the past and change into the future (“management is dynamic”), the social, institutional and political arrangements opened up new possibilities to bridge the gap. In particular, the idea of benefits providing an alternative pathway for management was a possible transformation that practitioners could understand and relate to. As (Pelling et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2015</a> have written, “Surfacing the full range of adaptation options allows informed questions to be asked of the relationship between adaptation, underlying development priorities and the dominant values that finally determine pathway choice”. The Future-proofing Conservation process enabled participants to surface new options, and understand the values choices that such a transformation would demand.

  <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The development and use of this methodology required significant time and resource commitments for the research team, as well as willingness to listen and learn from each other as part of the process. Much has been written about the need to invest in such communication, mediation and translation to support projects at the interface of science, policy and practice (Cornell et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2013</a>), and this project was no different. Support from WWF-C and having dedicated staff for coordinating and integrating across partners was critical to meet the challenges of working with complex concepts across an international, multi-sectoral team. While implementing the established process is now less resource-intensive than its development, it still requires resources and capacities that are adequately and realistically matched to project needs.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further application</div>
  <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Future-Proofing Conservation process was designed to be applied in other protected area contexts. Further piloting to test and refine the concepts will continue. This could result in streamlining the different stages, and tailoring them to different contexts. Application in other locations will still likely require a mix of interdisciplinary academic expertise (social science, climate science, conservation biology) and practical knowledge of people working in protected areas. It is important to recognise that the process can also build capacities in strategic thinking and collective learning; an outcome beyond any action plans created. These broader skills may also facilitate protected areas management processes under uncertain climate variability, incorporating the best scientific knowledge available.</p>
