 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the Future-Proofing Conservation process emerged from Phase 1 and so is, in itself, a ‘result’, in this section we will summarise some of the main outcomes from the three workshops (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Given the multi-step process it is not possible to give a detailed account of results from all activities. We will focus on the three workshops as they comprised the ‘interventions’ towards the transitions. The climate synthesis report and knowledge governance interviews are reported elsewhere.

 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feedback from participants suggests that that the process was successful in ‘reframing’ climate adaptation from a primary focus on protecting ecological characteristics to explicitly include societal benefits, and understanding climate adaptation as a management issue. Participants appreciated that the process enabled them to think deeply about the ‘bigger picture’ of conservation, and relate that to their more immediate management context. The process helped to increase agency of some participants who had previously felt powerless to enact change and fostered a shared sense of responsibility. The final part of the Futures Dialogue, exploring the strategies that participants could readily implement to enable learning-based conservation governance, was the most challenging part of the process. Future applications of the process will allow participants more time to explore the practical implications and develop action plans. PNN have already integrated the PA-BAT into their stakeholder consultation processes, as they recognised the value of identifying the benefits local communities can gain from protected areas as having multiple implications for their management. The Future-Proofing Conservation process is being adapted and developed further within WWF-C to inform new projects.</p>

  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> illustrates how the different activities came together to support this transformation goal. This final structure could be applied across range of contexts for enabling new ways of thinking about climate adaptation and conservation; and as a basis for identifying new options for preparing for ecological transformation.
