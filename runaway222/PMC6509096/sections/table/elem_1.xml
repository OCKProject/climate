     <span class="break"/> Little monitoring and research completed, what has been done is uncoordinated
     <span class="break"/> Communities are aware of climate change; opportunities for education

     <span class="break"/> Technical studies of climate change impacts have been completed

     <span class="break"/> Institutional complexity and disconnect

     <span class="break"/> Need to review conservation objectives in light of transformation;
     <span class="break"/> Protected areas alone cannot ‘save’ biodiversity, must involve communities;
     <span class="break"/> Larger scale (territorial) organisation and planning is needed, but difficult
    </td>
    <td align="left">Participants developed an alternate way of thinking about planning for climate change that reflected the current state of technical knowledge, incorporated values and benefits, and considered existing decision-making processes and tools.
     <span class="break"/>Participants did not follow through the change in thinking with a fully revised approach to PA policy, planning and management; ideas were generated but proposed incremental rather than transformative changes.
