      <p>The North Pacific hosts extensive oxygen minimum zones. Ventilation of North Pacific
         Intermediate Water mitigates hypoxia in thermocline waters not under influence of
         oceanâ€“atmosphere processes. Instrumental datasets show recent decadal decreases in
         O
         <sub>2</sub>, but millennial-scale natural variations in mesopelagic ventilation might be large
         and are not understood well. We reconstruct Holocene ventilation changes in a key
         region (Okhotsk Sea). Modern ventilation and O
         <sub>2</sub> levels are a relatively recent feature. In the warmer-than-present Early Holocene,
         middepth O
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations were 25 to 50% reduced, with significant millennial-scale variations.
         A sudden ventilation decrease six thousand years ago is linked to higher ocean temperatures,
         sea ice loss, and higher remineralization, corroborated by results from paleoclimate
         modeling, providing constraints for future warming scenarios.
