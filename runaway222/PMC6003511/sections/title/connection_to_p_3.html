      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explain the forcing behind the observed variations in OSIW ventilation, and in
         particular the Middle-Holocene climatic shift toward the modern well-ventilated regime,
         we compared our data to other regional records. Globally, and in regions influenced
         by the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) (
         <a>Figs. 2
            <span>F</span></a> and 
         <a>4
            <span>B</span></a>), a Middle-Holocene shift is documented (
         <a>28</a>). Before 6 ka, a stronger EASM (
         <a>29</a>, 
         <a>30</a>) propagated further northeastward than at present, yielding higher precipitation
         and temperatures in the Okhotsk Sea hinterland (
         <a>31</a>), increasing runoff from the Amur River catchment into the Okhotsk Sea (
         <a>32</a>). Higher Amur freshwater discharge also transports significant amounts of heat to
         the Okhotsk Sea (
         <a>32</a>, 
         <a>33</a>), which suppresses sea ice formation and, in concert with stronger thermal stratification
         of the upper mixed layer (
         <a>34</a>), decreases OSIW ventilation. After 6 ka, strengthening and expansion of the winter
         Siberian High in concert with a southward retreating EASM front was likely responsible
         for strengthening cold northeasterly winds over the continental shelf region (
         <a>35</a>). In addition, the maximum sea ice extent in the Okhotsk Sea is dependent on mean
         sea surface temperature (SST) conditions in summer (
         <a>36</a>). We thus infer a longer and more extensive sea ice cover, more polynyas, and more
         vigorous mixing of the mixed layer after 6 ka, which together enhanced the ventilation
         of new OSIW.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alkenone-derived SSTs for the Okhotsk Sea and the Japan continental margin consistently
         show maxima in Holocene SSTs between ∼8 and 6 ka, decreasing SSTs between 6 and 4
         ka, and a last shift toward persistent colder SSTs around 2 ka (
         <a>37</a>, 
         <a>38</a>) (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>D</span></a>). Our observed decrease in OSIW ventilation during the EMH is thus in close agreement
         with increased SSTs of about 1.5 to 2 °C derived from both regional and global reconstructions
         (
         <a>38</a>, 
         <a>39</a>). Importantly, recent low-latitude middepth thermocline temperature changes (at around
         500 m water depth) in the equatorial West Pacific show concomitant higher temperatures
         in the EMH of similar magnitude, with northern NPIW-sourced thermocline or intermediate
         water temperatures (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>C</span></a>) being warmer by 2.1 ± 0.4 °C than during the last century (
         <a>40</a>), in strong accord with our assumed decrease in ventilation in OSIW and NPIW (
         <a>Fig. 3 
            <span>A</span> and 
            <span>F</span></a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results from Earth System Model COSMOS (Community Earth System Model) simulations
         corroborate our proxy-based assumptions. This model captures the modern physical characteristics
         of NPIW well under preindustrial (PI) conditions (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S5 
            <span>A</span> and 
            <span>C</span></span>). We analyzed Pacific data from PI and 9-ka time-slice runs (for details, see 
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, 
            <span>Paleoclimate Modeling</span></span> and ref. 
         <a>41</a>). On a meridional transect along 150° E through the Okhotsk Sea toward the equatorial
         Pacific, our model results show a consistently warmer (around 1 to 2 °C) and saltier
         intermediate water layer at 9 ka than at PI conditions (
         <a>Fig. 4 
            <span>A</span> and 
            <span>B</span></a> and 
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S5 
            <span>B</span> and 
            <span>D</span></span>), matching the proxy-based temperature changes surprisingly well (
         <a>40</a>). Model-derived anomalies (9 ka minus PI) in sea ice dynamics show a localized, significant
         decrease of both sea ice volume (
         <a>Fig. 4
            <span>C</span></a>) and thickness (
         <a>Fig. 4
            <span>D</span></a>) in the Okhotsk Sea in the EMH, in agreement with our hypothesized reductions in
         sea ice and polynya formation in the OSIW source region that inhibited the modern
         ventilation regime.
