      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Superimposed on the described stepwise background changes, we detected distinct cyclic
         millennial-scale variations in OSIW ventilation, visible in the δ
         <span>13</span>C C-OSIW ventilation record (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>A</span></a>) and in wavelet analyses of both the combined and individual records (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S7–S9
            </span>). These variations occur in the range of 1,500 to 1,800 y, which have been reported
         from a number of locations and Holocene proxy records (
         <a>42</a>, 
         <a>43</a>). Notably, this cyclicity is most prominent before the Middle-Holocene tipping point
         (
         <a>28</a>). While other records yielded comparable changes in terrestrial and surface ocean
         records, which were attributed to either internal (
         <a>43</a>) or external [e.g., solar (
         <a>44</a>)] forcing, evidence for a direct connection to middepth and deep water formation
         or ventilation patterns, such as we observe here, has remained relatively scarce to
         date (
         <a>28</a>, 
         <a>42</a>). Thus, our record provides evidence for the close link between high- to midlatitude
         surface ocean processes (SST and stratification changes) and intermediate water ventilation
         dynamics on Holocene millennial (and potentially shorter) timescales.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the subarctic Pacific, other evidence for Holocene millennial-scale cycles in marine
         sequences is scarce; however, a southerly located Japan margin SST record (
         <a>38</a>) also showed 1,500-y cycles in SST anomalies (see original data of ref. 
         <a>38</a> in 
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>D</span></a>). A northward propagation of low-latitude warm Kuroshio waters would plausibly explain
         the strong correspondence between Japan offshore SST records and Okhotsk Sea decreases
         in ventilation due to warming and salinification of upper ocean water masses (
         <a>38</a>), as well as the closer coupling between the midlatitude North Pacific and the subarctic
         Okhotsk Sea region. For future warming scenarios, such a pattern has been observed
         in recent modeling results, which indicated an intensification and northward shift
         of most Western Boundary Currents (
         <a>45</a>). As the 1,500-y variations are most prominent during the EMH in our records, we
         presume that during periods of suppressed OSIW ventilation, this modulation via oceanic
         forcing and the global Meridional Overturning Circulation gains importance.
