 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Superimposed on the described stepwise background changes, we detected distinct cyclic millennial-scale variations in OSIW ventilation, visible in the δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C C-OSIW ventilation record (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3

  </a>) and in wavelet analyses of both the combined and individual records (

  </span>). These variations occur in the range of 1,500 to 1,800 y, which have been reported from a number of locations and Holocene proxy records (
  <a rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" href="#r42">42</a>, 
  <a rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" href="#r43">43</a>). Notably, this cyclicity is most prominent before the Middle-Holocene tipping point (
  <a rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" href="#r28">28</a>). While other records yielded comparable changes in terrestrial and surface ocean records, which were attributed to either internal (
  <a rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" href="#r43">43</a>) or external [e.g., solar (
  <a rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" href="#r44">44</a>)] forcing, evidence for a direct connection to middepth and deep water formation or ventilation patterns, such as we observe here, has remained relatively scarce to date (
  <a rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" href="#r28">28</a>, 
  <a rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" href="#r42">42</a>). Thus, our record provides evidence for the close link between high- to midlatitude surface ocean processes (SST and stratification changes) and intermediate water ventilation dynamics on Holocene millennial (and potentially shorter) timescales.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the subarctic Pacific, other evidence for Holocene millennial-scale cycles in marine sequences is scarce; however, a southerly located Japan margin SST record (
  <a rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" href="#r38">38</a>) also showed 1,500-y cycles in SST anomalies (see original data of ref. 
  <a rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" href="#r38">38</a> in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </a>). A northward propagation of low-latitude warm Kuroshio waters would plausibly explain the strong correspondence between Japan offshore SST records and Okhotsk Sea decreases in ventilation due to warming and salinification of upper ocean water masses (
  <a rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" href="#r38">38</a>), as well as the closer coupling between the midlatitude North Pacific and the subarctic Okhotsk Sea region. For future warming scenarios, such a pattern has been observed in recent modeling results, which indicated an intensification and northward shift of most Western Boundary Currents (
  <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>). As the 1,500-y variations are most prominent during the EMH in our records, we presume that during periods of suppressed OSIW ventilation, this modulation via oceanic forcing and the global Meridional Overturning Circulation gains importance.
