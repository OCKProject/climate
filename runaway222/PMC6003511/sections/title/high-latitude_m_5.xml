  </span>) can thus provide some insight into potential ranges of past Holocene middepth oxygenation levels. When applying this modern relationship between O
  <sub>2</sub> and δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C to assess long-term oxygenation changes for OSIW, the last 0 to 6 ka would broadly range within modern instrumental data, indicating a moderately oxic environment (i.e., 100 to 200 µmol/L ± 50 µmol/L) (
  <a rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" href="#r2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>). In contrast, O
  <sub>2</sub> estimates for the preceding EMH interval, before the 6-ka threshold, show oxygenation levels that did not reach even the lower range of modern O
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1714754115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S3 and S4
  </span>). EMH O
  <sub>2</sub> values would have mostly yielded just 30 to 50% of modern ranges (50 to 120 µmol/L ± 50 µmol/L) and thus imply a substantial reduction in oxygenation of middepth waters. Taken at face value, OSIW oxygen supply would have been significantly reduced in a warmer-than-present EMH, changing the Okhotsk Sea from a modern mesopelagic O
  <sub>2</sub> source into an episodically hypoxic sink before 6 ka (

  <a rid="r52" ref-type="bibr" href="#r52">52</a>). This largely qualitative assessment, while not without methodological caveats like most proxy-based assessments of paleooxygenation levels (
  <a rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" href="#r53">53</a>, 
  <a rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" href="#r54">54</a>), is in agreement with synthesis results indicating an expansion of Early-Holocene OMZs on both a global scale and in the middepth Indo-Pacific (
  <a rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" href="#r54">54</a>). Also, independent evidence based on benthic foraminiferal assemblage analyses and multiproxy records recently indicated intensifications of O
  <sub>2</sub>-limited conditions in both the subarctic Northwest (
  <a rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" href="#r27">27</a>) and the Northeast Pacific, with more dysoxic conditions during the EMH (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modern NPIW provides nutrients, in particular silicate and phosphate, to lower latitudes via the “ocean tunnel” mechanism—that is, the meridional export of entrained nutrients in intermediate waters to subtropical and equatorial Pacific thermocline waters that are nutrient limited (
  <a rid="r57" ref-type="bibr" href="#r57">57</a>). Currently, nutrient limitation in these low-latitude regions hampers their efficiency of new and export biological production and the resulting sequestration of carbon to the deep ocean via the “biological carbon pump.” Thus, the modern low-latitude Pacific is one of the largest CO
  <sub>2</sub> source regions to the atmosphere. Today, while only about one-third of water reaching the equatorial thermocline is estimated to stem from NPIW, it provides about two-thirds of silicate and other nutrients needed to sustain biosiliceous primary production in the low-latitude Pacific (
  <a rid="r58" ref-type="bibr" href="#r58">58</a>, 
  <a rid="r59" ref-type="bibr" href="#r59">59</a>). On glacial–interglacial timescales, this nutrient transport might have increased during cold time intervals (
  <a rid="r60" ref-type="bibr" href="#r60">60</a>, 
  <a rid="r61" ref-type="bibr" href="#r61">61</a>). We suggest that, in the Holocene as well, NPIW export acted as a feedback mechanism on the biological carbon pump and thus atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> (
  <span class="italic">i</span>) through intensification and deepening of remineralization processes, thereby storing higher amounts of organic carbon in North Pacific middepth waters; and (
  <span class="italic">ii</span>) by exporting larger amounts of nutrients, in particular silicate, through OSIW and NPIW to lower-latitude thermocline waters, thus attenuating silicate limitation in the northern subtropical-to-equatorial Pacific during warmer-than-present Holocene phases (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3 
   <span class="italic">D</span> and 
   <span class="italic">E</span>
  </a>). This latter process is supported by evidence for higher nutrient concentrations and utilization in the western equatorial Pacific and its subtropical marginal seas during the EMH that are currently under the influence of NPIW inflow (
  <a rid="r61" ref-type="bibr" href="#r61">61</a>) and concurrent minima in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
   <span class="italic">G</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, our combined proxy- and modeling-based reconstructions show a crucial influence of Okhotsk Sea-sourced NPIW on Pacific Holocene oceanography. In particular, export of warmer, oxygen-poorer, and nutrient-richer NPIW from the subarctic domain likely reached and influenced the low-latitude Pacific thermocline during the warmer-than-present EMH, thus not only leading to increases in oceanic heat content (
  <a rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" href="#r40">40</a>), but also to significant changes in the biogeochemical signatures of thermocline waters, including equatorial Pacific nutrient and oxygen inventories (
  <a rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" href="#r12">12</a>, 
  <a rid="r52" ref-type="bibr" href="#r52">52</a>).
