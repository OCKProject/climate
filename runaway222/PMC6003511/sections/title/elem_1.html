      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a suite of four sediment cores to reconstruct OSIW ventilation (for details,
         see 
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, 
            <span>Site Selection – Material and Methods</span> and Figs. S4 and S5
            </span>). Gravity core 108 was retrieved from the western Kamchatka continental margin (52°01.330′
         N, 153°35.006′ E; 627 m water depth) in the pathway of inflowing North Pacific water
         to the formation region of OSIW on the northeastern Okhotsk Sea continental shelf.
         This core thus records the precursor water mass—Western Subarctic Pacific Water (WSAPW)—delivered
         via the East Kamchatka Current (
         <a>Fig. 1</a>). Three sites record changes in newly formed OSIW on the eastern Sakhalin continental
         margin, along the export pathway into the North Pacific. Site 78 (52°40.388′ N, 144°42.203′
         E; 673 m water depth) and site 4 (51°08.475′ N, 145°18.582′ E, 674 m water depth)
         are located within the core layer of OSIW (
         <a>19</a>, 
         <a>20</a>). Site 79 (52°47.272′ N, 144°57.318′ E; 1,082 m water depth) complements the records
         with a deeper location at the lower boundary of OSIW. Based on an accelerator mass
         spectrometry (AMS) 
         <span>14</span>C-anchored stratigraphic framework (

            <span>Age Models and Stratigraphic Framework</span> and Fig. S2
            </span>), these cores yield sedimentation rates between 20 and 180 cm/ka, thus allowing for
         the reconstruction of millennial-scale changes in intermediate water ventilation.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Sakhalin margin cores that monitor OSIW (sites 4, 78, and 79) are characterized
            by high-amplitude variations throughout the Holocene, exceeding glacial–interglacial
            changes in Pacific Deep Water ventilation (
            <a>14</a>), with values between −0.8‰ and −0.1‰ and a close resemblance between single cores.
            Sample resolution in the deeper core 79 is slightly worse due to the partial absence
            of 
            <span>Cibicidoides</span> species from the benthic fauna; however, core 79’s overall δ
            <span>13</span>C pattern matches that of the other cores. In contrast, the Kamchatka margin core
            108, representing WSAPW inflow, shows δ
            <span>13</span>C values ranging mostly between −0.2‰ and −0.5‰, similar to modern values (
            <a>25</a>) but with no discernible long-term trend over the Holocene (
            <a>Fig. 2

            on a combined record (named C-OSIW) of the three outflow, or “downstream” sites representing
            the OSIW (sites 4, 78, and 79) (

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our C-OSIW δ
            <span>13</span>C record shows a subdivision of the Holocene into two periods that have differing
            ventilation patterns (
            <a>Figs. 2</a> and 
            <a>3
               <span>A</span></a>). The EMH (11 to 6 ka) exhibits significantly lower than modern δ
            <span>13</span>C values (
            <a>Figs. 2</a> and 
            <a>3
               <span>A</span></a>), suggesting persistent ventilation minima in OSIW. In contrast, Late Holocene (LH)
            (0–6 ka) ventilation increases after a sudden shift around 6 ka (
            <a>Fig. 2 
               <span>C</span> and 
               <span>D</span></a>) toward modern conditions, featuring a principal Middle-Holocene threshold (or “tipping
            point”) in NPIW ventilation. In addition, the LH (
            <a>Fig. 3
               <span>A</span></a>) shows a slight but more gradual increase in the C-OSIW stack toward modern values
            of δ
            <span>13</span>C over the last 1 to 2 ka of about 0.1‰ (
            <a>Figs. 2 
               <span>C</span> and

            <a>3
               <span>A</span></a>). Therefore, a critical initial observation of this C-OSIW ventilation reconstruction
            is that the subarctic North Pacific middepth water layer rapidly changed its characteristics
            during the Middle Holocene around 6 ka toward the present-day OSIW and the connected
            mesopelagic North Pacific ventilation prevalence. For a better comparison between
            the OSIW outflow site (cores 4, 78, and 79) and the WSAPW inflow site (core 108),
            we subtracted the latter from our C-OSIW record to create a Δδ
            <span>13</span>C time series (
            <a>Fig. 3
               <span>F</span></a>), after resampling our data in evenly spaced 50-y intervals. Our Δδ
            <span>13</span>C data (
            <a>Fig. 3
               <span>F</span></a>) reveal that OSIW ventilation decreased below values of its precursor WSAPW before
            the 6-ka shift. This negative OSIW–WSAPW gradient (
            <a>Fig. 3
               <span>F</span></a>) implies that OSIW export into the North Pacific was, in effect, not actively ventilated
            in the Okhotsk Sea before 6 ka.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assume that under Holocene boundary conditions, the principles of OSIW formation
            through seasonal sea ice, polynya-induced brine rejection, and mixing between surface
            waters and WSAPW remained essentially similar. However, apparently, the intensity
            of mixing well-ventilated waters into middepth levels must have increased after the
            Middle Holocene toward the modern setting. Other processes like changed air–sea exchange
            or simple source water mass variations (e.g., through higher contributions of Pacific
            Deep Water or mixed layer water, respectively) cannot fully explain the large observed
            changes in absolute δ
            <span>13</span>C values on millennial timescales, and particularly the EMH negative Δδ
            <span>13</span>C gradient (
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S10
               </span>). Earlier qualitative multiproxy studies of nearby sites in the Okhotsk Sea (
            <a>17</a>) showed oceanographic reorganizations around 6 ka. In those results, independent
            evidence from microfossil assemblages suggested higher mesopelagic productivity with
            increased microbial biomass and higher organic matter respiration in OSIW before 6
            ka (see 
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, 
               <span>Previous Studies Indicating Okhotsk Sea Ventilation Changes</span></span>), while support for reduced formation of OSIW and intensified OMZ conditions was
            also found in nearby sites (
            <a>17</a>, 
            <a>26</a>, 
            <a>27</a>). As a result, we presume that during the EMH, physical processes likely inhibited
            the modern ventilation scheme, while increased remineralization of organic matter
            through respiration within the mixed layer and in OSIW decreased the ventilation of
            OSIW relative to WSAPW entering the Okhotsk Sea, leading to higher inventories of
            nutrients and carbon in NPIW.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explain the forcing behind the observed variations in OSIW ventilation, and in
            particular the Middle-Holocene climatic shift toward the modern well-ventilated regime,
            we compared our data to other regional records. Globally, and in regions influenced
            by the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) (
            <a>Figs. 2
               <span>F</span></a> and 
            <a>4
               <span>B</span></a>), a Middle-Holocene shift is documented (
            <a>28</a>). Before 6 ka, a stronger EASM (
            <a>29</a>, 
            <a>30</a>) propagated further northeastward than at present, yielding higher precipitation
            and temperatures in the Okhotsk Sea hinterland (
            <a>31</a>), increasing runoff from the Amur River catchment into the Okhotsk Sea (
            <a>32</a>). Higher Amur freshwater discharge also transports significant amounts of heat to
            the Okhotsk Sea (
            <a>32</a>, 
            <a>33</a>), which suppresses sea ice formation and, in concert with stronger thermal stratification
            of the upper mixed layer (
            <a>34</a>), decreases OSIW ventilation. After 6 ka, strengthening and expansion of the winter
            Siberian High in concert with a southward retreating EASM front was likely responsible
            for strengthening cold northeasterly winds over the continental shelf region (
            <a>35</a>). In addition, the maximum sea ice extent in the Okhotsk Sea is dependent on mean
            sea surface temperature (SST) conditions in summer (
            <a>36</a>). We thus infer a longer and more extensive sea ice cover, more polynyas, and more
            vigorous mixing of the mixed layer after 6 ka, which together enhanced the ventilation
            of new OSIW.

            with increased SSTs of about 1.5 to 2 °C derived from both regional and global reconstructions
            (
            <a>38</a>, 
            <a>39</a>). Importantly, recent low-latitude middepth thermocline temperature changes (at around
            500 m water depth) in the equatorial West Pacific show concomitant higher temperatures
            in the EMH of similar magnitude, with northern NPIW-sourced thermocline or intermediate
            water temperatures (
            <a>Fig. 3
               <span>C</span></a>) being warmer by 2.1 ± 0.4 °C than during the last century (
            <a>40</a>), in strong accord with our assumed decrease in ventilation in OSIW and NPIW (

            corroborate our proxy-based assumptions. This model captures the modern physical characteristics
            of NPIW well under preindustrial (PI) conditions (

               <span>Paleoclimate Modeling</span></span> and ref.

            intermediate water layer at 9 ka than at PI conditions (

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Superimposed on the described stepwise background changes, we detected distinct cyclic
            millennial-scale variations in OSIW ventilation, visible in the δ
            <span>13</span>C C-OSIW ventilation record (
            <a>Fig. 3
               <span>A</span></a>) and in wavelet analyses of both the combined and individual records (
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S7–S9
               </span>). These variations occur in the range of 1,500 to 1,800 y, which have been reported
            from a number of locations and Holocene proxy records (
            <a>42</a>, 
            <a>43</a>). Notably, this cyclicity is most prominent before the Middle-Holocene tipping point
            (
            <a>28</a>). While other records yielded comparable changes in terrestrial and surface ocean
            records, which were attributed to either internal (
            <a>43</a>) or external [e.g., solar (
            <a>44</a>)] forcing, evidence for a direct connection to middepth and deep water formation
            or ventilation patterns, such as we observe here, has remained relatively scarce to
            date (
            <a>28</a>, 
            <a>42</a>). Thus, our record provides evidence for the close link between high- to midlatitude
            surface ocean processes (SST and stratification changes) and intermediate water ventilation
            dynamics on Holocene millennial (and potentially shorter) timescales.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the subarctic Pacific, other evidence for Holocene millennial-scale cycles in marine
            sequences is scarce; however, a southerly located Japan margin SST record (
            <a>38</a>) also showed 1,500-y cycles in SST anomalies (see original data of ref. 
            <a>38</a> in 
            <a>Fig. 3
               <span>D</span></a>). A northward propagation of low-latitude warm Kuroshio waters would plausibly explain
            the strong correspondence between Japan offshore SST records and Okhotsk Sea decreases
            in ventilation due to warming and salinification of upper ocean water masses (
            <a>38</a>), as well as the closer coupling between the midlatitude North Pacific and the subarctic
            Okhotsk Sea region. For future warming scenarios, such a pattern has been observed
            in recent modeling results, which indicated an intensification and northward shift
            of most Western Boundary Currents (
            <a>45</a>). As the 1,500-y variations are most prominent during the EMH in our records, we
            presume that during periods of suppressed OSIW ventilation, this modulation via oceanic
            forcing and the global Meridional Overturning Circulation gains importance.

            of a year or less), whereas DIC and its carbon isotopes react on timescales of a decade
            [i.e., with about an order of magnitude difference (

               </span>) can thus provide some insight into potential ranges of past Holocene middepth oxygenation
            levels. When applying this modern relationship between O
            <sub>2</sub> and δ
            <span>13</span>C to assess long-term oxygenation changes for OSIW, the last 0 to 6 ka would broadly
            range within modern instrumental data, indicating a moderately oxic environment (i.e.,
            100 to 200 µmol/L ± 50 µmol/L) (
            <a>2</a>, 
            <a>3</a>). In contrast, O
            <sub>2</sub> estimates for the preceding EMH interval, before the 6-ka threshold, show oxygenation
            levels that did not reach even the lower range of modern O
            <sub>2</sub> concentrations (
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S3 and S4
               </span>). EMH O
            <sub>2</sub> values would have mostly yielded just 30 to 50% of modern ranges (50 to 120 µmol/L
            ± 50 µmol/L) and thus imply a substantial reduction in oxygenation of middepth waters.
            Taken at face value, OSIW oxygen supply would have been significantly reduced in a
            warmer-than-present EMH, changing the Okhotsk Sea from a modern mesopelagic O
            <sub>2</sub> source into an episodically hypoxic sink before 6 ka (
            <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S4

            <a>51</a>, 
            <a>52</a>). This largely qualitative assessment, while not without methodological caveats like

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modern NPIW provides nutrients, in particular silicate and phosphate, to lower latitudes
            via the “ocean tunnel” mechanism—that is, the meridional export of entrained nutrients
            in intermediate waters to subtropical and equatorial Pacific thermocline waters that
            are nutrient limited (
            <a>57</a>). Currently, nutrient limitation in these low-latitude regions hampers their efficiency
            of new and export biological production and the resulting sequestration of carbon
            to the deep ocean via the “biological carbon pump.” Thus, the modern low-latitude
            Pacific is one of the largest CO
            <sub>2</sub> source regions to the atmosphere. Today, while only about one-third of water reaching
            the equatorial thermocline is estimated to stem from NPIW, it provides about two-thirds
            of silicate and other nutrients needed to sustain biosiliceous primary production
            in the low-latitude Pacific (
            <a>58</a>, 
            <a>59</a>). On glacial–interglacial timescales, this nutrient transport might have increased
            during cold time intervals (
            <a>60</a>, 
            <a>61</a>). We suggest that, in the Holocene as well, NPIW export acted as a feedback mechanism
            on the biological carbon pump and thus atmospheric CO
            <sub>2</sub> (
            <span>i</span>) through intensification and deepening of remineralization processes, thereby storing
            higher amounts of organic carbon in North Pacific middepth waters; and (
            <span>ii</span>) by exporting larger amounts of nutrients, in particular silicate, through OSIW and
            NPIW to lower-latitude thermocline waters, thus attenuating silicate limitation in
            the northern subtropical-to-equatorial Pacific during warmer-than-present Holocene
            phases (
            <a>Fig. 3 
               <span>D</span> and 
               <span>E</span></a>). This latter process is supported by evidence for higher nutrient concentrations
            and utilization in the western equatorial Pacific and its subtropical marginal seas
            during the EMH that are currently under the influence of NPIW inflow (
            <a>61</a>) and concurrent minima in atmospheric CO
            <sub>2</sub> concentrations (
            <a>Fig. 3

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, our combined proxy- and modeling-based reconstructions show a crucial
            influence of Okhotsk Sea-sourced NPIW on Pacific Holocene oceanography. In particular,
            export of warmer, oxygen-poorer, and nutrient-richer NPIW from the subarctic domain
            likely reached and influenced the low-latitude Pacific thermocline during the warmer-than-present
            EMH, thus not only leading to increases in oceanic heat content (
            <a>40</a>), but also to significant changes in the biogeochemical signatures of thermocline
            waters, including equatorial Pacific nutrient and oxygen inventories (
