 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Sakhalin margin cores that monitor OSIW (sites 4, 78, and 79) are characterized by high-amplitude variations throughout the Holocene, exceeding glacial–interglacial changes in Pacific Deep Water ventilation (
  <a rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" href="#r14">14</a>), with values between −0.8‰ and −0.1‰ and a close resemblance between single cores. Sample resolution in the deeper core 79 is slightly worse due to the partial absence of 
  <span class="italic">Cibicidoides</span> species from the benthic fauna; however, core 79’s overall δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C pattern matches that of the other cores. In contrast, the Kamchatka margin core 108, representing WSAPW inflow, shows δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C values ranging mostly between −0.2‰ and −0.5‰, similar to modern values (
  <a rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" href="#r25">25</a>) but with no discernible long-term trend over the Holocene (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>). For better comparison hereafter, we discuss principal characteristics of OSIW based on a combined record (named C-OSIW) of the three outflow, or “downstream” sites representing the OSIW (sites 4, 78, and 79) (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our C-OSIW δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C record shows a subdivision of the Holocene into two periods that have differing ventilation patterns (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Figs. 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">3
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>). The EMH (11 to 6 ka) exhibits significantly lower than modern δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C values (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Figs. 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">3
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>), suggesting persistent ventilation minima in OSIW. In contrast, Late Holocene (LH) (0–6 ka) ventilation increases after a sudden shift around 6 ka (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2 
   <span class="italic">C</span> and 
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </a>) toward modern conditions, featuring a principal Middle-Holocene threshold (or “tipping point”) in NPIW ventilation. In addition, the LH (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>) shows a slight but more gradual increase in the C-OSIW stack toward modern values of δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C over the last 1 to 2 ka of about 0.1‰ (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Figs. 2

  </a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">3
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>). Therefore, a critical initial observation of this C-OSIW ventilation reconstruction is that the subarctic North Pacific middepth water layer rapidly changed its characteristics during the Middle Holocene around 6 ka toward the present-day OSIW and the connected mesopelagic North Pacific ventilation prevalence. For a better comparison between the OSIW outflow site (cores 4, 78, and 79) and the WSAPW inflow site (core 108), we subtracted the latter from our C-OSIW record to create a Δδ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C time series (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
   <span class="italic">F</span>
  </a>), after resampling our data in evenly spaced 50-y intervals. Our Δδ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C data (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
   <span class="italic">F</span>
  </a>) reveal that OSIW ventilation decreased below values of its precursor WSAPW before the 6-ka shift. This negative OSIW–WSAPW gradient (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
   <span class="italic">F</span>
  </a>) implies that OSIW export into the North Pacific was, in effect, not actively ventilated in the Okhotsk Sea before 6 ka.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assume that under Holocene boundary conditions, the principles of OSIW formation through seasonal sea ice, polynya-induced brine rejection, and mixing between surface waters and WSAPW remained essentially similar. However, apparently, the intensity of mixing well-ventilated waters into middepth levels must have increased after the Middle Holocene toward the modern setting. Other processes like changed air–sea exchange or simple source water mass variations (e.g., through higher contributions of Pacific Deep Water or mixed layer water, respectively) cannot fully explain the large observed changes in absolute δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C values on millennial timescales, and particularly the EMH negative Δδ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C gradient (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1714754115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S10
  </span>). Earlier qualitative multiproxy studies of nearby sites in the Okhotsk Sea (
  <a rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" href="#r17">17</a>) showed oceanographic reorganizations around 6 ka. In those results, independent evidence from microfossil assemblages suggested higher mesopelagic productivity with increased microbial biomass and higher organic matter respiration in OSIW before 6 ka (see 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1714754115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Previous Studies Indicating Okhotsk Sea Ventilation Changes</span>
  </span>), while support for reduced formation of OSIW and intensified OMZ conditions was also found in nearby sites (
  <a rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" href="#r17">17</a>, 
  <a rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" href="#r26">26</a>, 
  <a rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" href="#r27">27</a>). As a result, we presume that during the EMH, physical processes likely inhibited the modern ventilation scheme, while increased remineralization of organic matter through respiration within the mixed layer and in OSIW decreased the ventilation of OSIW relative to WSAPW entering the Okhotsk Sea, leading to higher inventories of nutrients and carbon in NPIW.
