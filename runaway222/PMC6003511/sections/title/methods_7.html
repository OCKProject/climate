      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To reconstruct changes in ventilation patterns of middepth water masses, we used the
         stable carbon isotopic composition (δ
         <span>13</span>C) of benthic foraminiferal 
         <span>C. mundulus</span> tests. Samples were measured on a Thermo Finnigan MAT 252 mass spectrometer coupled
         online to a Kiel CARBO II unit, and δ
         <span>13</span>C of seawater DIC values were measured on a Thermo Finnigan Delta E with an automated
         DICI-II preparation unit (see 
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, 
            <span>Site Selection – Material and Methods</span></span> for details). All values are reported in δ notation vs. Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite
         (‰ V-PDB).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Age control for cores 4 and 79 has been previously reported in detail (
         <a>62</a>). Age control for cores 78 and 108 was achieved through six and nine AMS 
         <span>14</span>C dates, respectively, of planktic foraminifera (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S4 and S5
            </span>). Methodology for construction of age models for all cores and age-depth relationships
         for cores 78 and 108 are provided in detail in 
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, 
            <span>Age Models and Stratigraphic Framework</span> and Figs. S4–S6
