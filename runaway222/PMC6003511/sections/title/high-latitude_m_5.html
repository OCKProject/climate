      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In principle, benthic δ
         <span>13</span>C may, in addition, provide qualitative information on past baseline variations of
         bottom water oxygenation (
         <a>46</a>, 
         <a>47</a>) (see 
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, 
            <span>Estimation of Past Oxygenation Based on δ
               <span>13</span>C Isotope Values
               </span></span>). However, because O
         <sub>2</sub> in seawater equilibrates with the atmosphere almost instantaneously (i.e., on timescales
         of a year or less), whereas DIC and its carbon isotopes react on timescales of a decade
         [i.e., with about an order of magnitude difference (
         <a>48</a>)], only long-term, millennial-scale changes can be inferred. Correlation between
         dissolved water column O
         <sub>2</sub> and δ
         <span>13</span>C
         <sub>DIC</sub> based on water column data from the Okhotsk Sea (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S3 and S4
            </span>) can thus provide some insight into potential ranges of past Holocene middepth oxygenation
         levels. When applying this modern relationship between O
         <sub>2</sub> and δ
         <span>13</span>C to assess long-term oxygenation changes for OSIW, the last 0 to 6 ka would broadly
         range within modern instrumental data, indicating a moderately oxic environment (i.e.,
         100 to 200 µmol/L ± 50 µmol/L) (
         <a>2</a>, 
         <a>3</a>). In contrast, O
         <sub>2</sub> estimates for the preceding EMH interval, before the 6-ka threshold, show oxygenation
         levels that did not reach even the lower range of modern O
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S3 and S4
            </span>). EMH O
         <sub>2</sub> values would have mostly yielded just 30 to 50% of modern ranges (50 to 120 µmol/L
         ± 50 µmol/L) and thus imply a substantial reduction in oxygenation of middepth waters.
         Taken at face value, OSIW oxygen supply would have been significantly reduced in a
         warmer-than-present EMH, changing the Okhotsk Sea from a modern mesopelagic O
         <sub>2</sub> source into an episodically hypoxic sink before 6 ka (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S4
            </span>), with likely limitations for marine life, OMZ strengthening (
         <a>49</a>, 
         <a>50</a>), and altered biogeochemical nutrient cycles (
         <a>51</a>, 
         <a>52</a>). This largely qualitative assessment, while not without methodological caveats like
         most proxy-based assessments of paleooxygenation levels (
         <a>53</a>, 
         <a>54</a>), is in agreement with synthesis results indicating an expansion of Early-Holocene
         OMZs on both a global scale and in the middepth Indo-Pacific (
         <a>54</a>). Also, independent evidence based on benthic foraminiferal assemblage analyses and
         multiproxy records recently indicated intensifications of O
         <sub>2</sub>-limited conditions in both the subarctic Northwest (
         <a>27</a>) and the Northeast Pacific, with more dysoxic conditions during the EMH (
         <a>55</a>, 
         <a>56</a>) (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>E</span></a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modern NPIW provides nutrients, in particular silicate and phosphate, to lower latitudes
         via the “ocean tunnel” mechanism—that is, the meridional export of entrained nutrients
         in intermediate waters to subtropical and equatorial Pacific thermocline waters that
         are nutrient limited (
         <a>57</a>). Currently, nutrient limitation in these low-latitude regions hampers their efficiency
         of new and export biological production and the resulting sequestration of carbon
         to the deep ocean via the “biological carbon pump.” Thus, the modern low-latitude
         Pacific is one of the largest CO
         <sub>2</sub> source regions to the atmosphere. Today, while only about one-third of water reaching
         the equatorial thermocline is estimated to stem from NPIW, it provides about two-thirds
         of silicate and other nutrients needed to sustain biosiliceous primary production
         in the low-latitude Pacific (
         <a>58</a>, 
         <a>59</a>). On glacial–interglacial timescales, this nutrient transport might have increased
         during cold time intervals (
         <a>60</a>, 
         <a>61</a>). We suggest that, in the Holocene as well, NPIW export acted as a feedback mechanism
         on the biological carbon pump and thus atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> (
         <span>i</span>) through intensification and deepening of remineralization processes, thereby storing
         higher amounts of organic carbon in North Pacific middepth waters; and (
         <span>ii</span>) by exporting larger amounts of nutrients, in particular silicate, through OSIW and
         NPIW to lower-latitude thermocline waters, thus attenuating silicate limitation in
         the northern subtropical-to-equatorial Pacific during warmer-than-present Holocene
         phases (
         <a>Fig. 3 
            <span>D</span> and 
            <span>E</span></a>). This latter process is supported by evidence for higher nutrient concentrations
         and utilization in the western equatorial Pacific and its subtropical marginal seas
         during the EMH that are currently under the influence of NPIW inflow (
         <a>61</a>) and concurrent minima in atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>G</span></a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, our combined proxy- and modeling-based reconstructions show a crucial
         influence of Okhotsk Sea-sourced NPIW on Pacific Holocene oceanography. In particular,
         export of warmer, oxygen-poorer, and nutrient-richer NPIW from the subarctic domain
         likely reached and influenced the low-latitude Pacific thermocline during the warmer-than-present
         EMH, thus not only leading to increases in oceanic heat content (
         <a>40</a>), but also to significant changes in the biogeochemical signatures of thermocline
         waters, including equatorial Pacific nutrient and oxygen inventories (
         <a>12</a>, 
         <a>52</a>).
