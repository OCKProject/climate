      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Sakhalin margin cores that monitor OSIW (sites 4, 78, and 79) are characterized
         by high-amplitude variations throughout the Holocene, exceeding glacial–interglacial
         changes in Pacific Deep Water ventilation (
         <a>14</a>), with values between −0.8‰ and −0.1‰ and a close resemblance between single cores.
         Sample resolution in the deeper core 79 is slightly worse due to the partial absence
         of 
         <span>Cibicidoides</span> species from the benthic fauna; however, core 79’s overall δ
         <span>13</span>C pattern matches that of the other cores. In contrast, the Kamchatka margin core
         108, representing WSAPW inflow, shows δ
         <span>13</span>C values ranging mostly between −0.2‰ and −0.5‰, similar to modern values (
         <a>25</a>) but with no discernible long-term trend over the Holocene (
         <a>Fig. 2
            <span>B</span></a>). For better comparison hereafter, we discuss principal characteristics of OSIW based
         on a combined record (named C-OSIW) of the three outflow, or “downstream” sites representing
         the OSIW (sites 4, 78, and 79) (
         <a>Figs. 2 
            <span>C</span>–
            <span>E</span></a> and 
         <a>3
            <span>A</span></a>). We stacked individual records on their own age models into one record and added
         a 25-point smoothing to the original data to highlight millennial-scale changes (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>A</span></a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our C-OSIW δ
         <span>13</span>C record shows a subdivision of the Holocene into two periods that have differing
         ventilation patterns (
         <a>Figs. 2</a> and 
         <a>3
            <span>A</span></a>). The EMH (11 to 6 ka) exhibits significantly lower than modern δ
         <span>13</span>C values (
         <a>Figs. 2</a> and 
         <a>3
            <span>A</span></a>), suggesting persistent ventilation minima in OSIW. In contrast, Late Holocene (LH)
         (0–6 ka) ventilation increases after a sudden shift around 6 ka (
         <a>Fig. 2 
            <span>C</span> and 
            <span>D</span></a>) toward modern conditions, featuring a principal Middle-Holocene threshold (or “tipping
         point”) in NPIW ventilation. In addition, the LH (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>A</span></a>) shows a slight but more gradual increase in the C-OSIW stack toward modern values
         of δ
         <span>13</span>C over the last 1 to 2 ka of about 0.1‰ (
         <a>Figs. 2 
            <span>C</span> and 
            <span>D</span></a> and 
         <a>3
            <span>A</span></a>). Therefore, a critical initial observation of this C-OSIW ventilation reconstruction
         is that the subarctic North Pacific middepth water layer rapidly changed its characteristics
         during the Middle Holocene around 6 ka toward the present-day OSIW and the connected
         mesopelagic North Pacific ventilation prevalence. For a better comparison between
         the OSIW outflow site (cores 4, 78, and 79) and the WSAPW inflow site (core 108),
         we subtracted the latter from our C-OSIW record to create a Δδ
         <span>13</span>C time series (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>F</span></a>), after resampling our data in evenly spaced 50-y intervals. Our Δδ
         <span>13</span>C data (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>F</span></a>) reveal that OSIW ventilation decreased below values of its precursor WSAPW before
         the 6-ka shift. This negative OSIW–WSAPW gradient (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>F</span></a>) implies that OSIW export into the North Pacific was, in effect, not actively ventilated
         in the Okhotsk Sea before 6 ka.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assume that under Holocene boundary conditions, the principles of OSIW formation
         through seasonal sea ice, polynya-induced brine rejection, and mixing between surface
         waters and WSAPW remained essentially similar. However, apparently, the intensity
         of mixing well-ventilated waters into middepth levels must have increased after the
         Middle Holocene toward the modern setting. Other processes like changed air–sea exchange
         or simple source water mass variations (e.g., through higher contributions of Pacific
         Deep Water or mixed layer water, respectively) cannot fully explain the large observed
         changes in absolute δ
         <span>13</span>C values on millennial timescales, and particularly the EMH negative Δδ
         <span>13</span>C gradient (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S10
            </span>). Earlier qualitative multiproxy studies of nearby sites in the Okhotsk Sea (
         <a>17</a>) showed oceanographic reorganizations around 6 ka. In those results, independent
         evidence from microfossil assemblages suggested higher mesopelagic productivity with
         increased microbial biomass and higher organic matter respiration in OSIW before 6
         ka (see 
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, 
            <span>Previous Studies Indicating Okhotsk Sea Ventilation Changes</span></span>), while support for reduced formation of OSIW and intensified OMZ conditions was
         also found in nearby sites (
         <a>17</a>, 
         <a>26</a>, 
         <a>27</a>). As a result, we presume that during the EMH, physical processes likely inhibited
         the modern ventilation scheme, while increased remineralization of organic matter
         through respiration within the mixed layer and in OSIW decreased the ventilation of
         OSIW relative to WSAPW entering the Okhotsk Sea, leading to higher inventories of
         nutrients and carbon in NPIW.
