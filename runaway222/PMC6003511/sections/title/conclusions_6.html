      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study highlights the nonlinear behavior of North Pacific middepth waters on millennial
         timescales under past, warmer-than-present climate conditions. We show that the modern
         NPIW ventilation pattern, as reconstructed from high-resolution δ
         <span>13</span>C records from the Okhotsk Sea, has only been prevalent since about 1 to 2 ka, while
         little to no ventilation prevailed for most of the warmer EMH. Millennial-scale variations
         in OSIW ventilation occur superimposed on these long-term baseline ventilation adjustments,
         with a main cyclicity of 1,500 to 1,800 y, indicating a relation of our dominant forcing
         factors to globally observed internal oscillation dynamics of ocean overturning.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A comparison between subarctic Pacific Gyre source waters and intermediate water exported
         from the Okhotsk Sea over the last 11 ka implies that a threshold occurred at 6 ka
         and rapidly changed NPIW characteristics from a remineralization-dominated high-nutrient
         inventory to the modern regime of relatively better-ventilated middepth waters. Accordingly,
         we hypothesize that before 6 ka, NPIW was exporting higher amounts of nutrients, especially
         silicate, to nutrient-limited subtropical-to-equatorial Pacific thermocline waters
         via ocean tunneling, potentially providing a feedback mechanism that enhanced new
         biosiliceous production and thus the efficiency of the biological carbon pump during
         the EMH.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the composite δ
         <span>13</span>C record of OSIW we also estimate that average middepth NPIW oxygen concentrations
         during the EMH were likely lower by 25 to 50% than they are today, which would have
         led to near-hypoxic conditions in the modern source region of North Pacific ventilation.
         Starting around 6 ka, the Okhotsk Sea switched from an EMH ventilation deficiency
         to the modern oxygenated regime, seemingly in lockstep with thermocline (500 m) temperature
         declines in the low-latitude equatorial Pacific and decreases in high-latitude Northwest
         Pacific SSTs.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As future global SSTs are thought to resemble or surpass Early-Holocene SST values
         (
         <a>39</a>), significant changes toward lower ventilation of middepth waters and thus O
         <sub>2</sub> supply from subarctic latitudes, coupled with changed ventilation feedback mechanisms,
         may be expected for the middepth Pacific. These will likely affect oxygen- and nutrient-dependent
         biogeochemical cycles in the lower latitudes. Given the significant importance of
         intermediate water masses in the Pacific Ocean and their short response time within
         years or decades to changing environmental forcing (
         <a>2</a>), further studies should try to elucidate the role of intermediate waters in influencing
         global marine nutrient, oxygen, and carbon budgets during warmer-than-modern times
         like the Early Holocene, which at present remain inadequately understood.
