         <p>OSIW ventilation dynamics and gradients compared with long-term changes in regional
            and global climate records. (

            <span>13</span>C
            <sub>OSIW</sub> combined record of sites 4, 78, and 79, indicating OSIW ventilation dynamics. Gray
            line: original data; black thick line: resampled 25-point moving average. (
            <span>B</span>) Proxy record for intensity of EASM changes in Huguangyan Maar Lake, southern China,
            as expressed in total organic carbon (TOC) content (
            <a>30</a>). Note inverted scale for better comparison with OSIW ventilation record. (
            <span>C</span>) Reconstruction of intermediate water temperature (IWT) (inverted) in the equatorial
            West Pacific at 500 m water depth, indicative of northern-sourced NPIW reaching the
            low-latitude thermocline. Calculated changes over the Holocene with reference to the
            last 100 y, based on Mg/Ca ratios of benthic foraminifera (
            <a>40</a>). (
            <span>D</span>) Composite alkenone-based high-resolution SST record from Japan margin (cores MD01-2421,
            KR02-06_MC, and KR02-06_GC) (
            <a>38</a>). (

            <span>15</span>N
            <sub>bulk</sub> record, indicating denitrification and nutrient utilization changes in waters under
            NPIW influence (
            <a>55</a>). (
            <span>F</span>) Ventilation difference between OSIW and WSAPW, expressed as Δδ
            <span>13</span>C between the stacked C-OISW record and site 108 (this study). Positive values (above
            dashed “zero” line) denote active ventilation in the Okhotsk Sea; negative values
            indicate ventilation loss in the Okhotsk Sea due to remineralization processes and
            lack of new water mass formation. (
            <span>G</span>) Atmospheric CO
            <sub>2</sub> record from EPICA Dome C ice core record (
            <a>64</a>).
