            WSAPW before it enters the Okhotsk Sea (
            <a>14</a>); Station 112 represents intermediate water before transport to ventilation areas
            on the Northern Shelf (orange, filled circles, this study); and Station 72 monitors
            OSIW path “downstream” of ventilation area before export into the North Pacific (blue,
            filled squares, this study). Station 40N (
            <a>24</a>) represents final water mix in a southerly position near Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension
            Region (green, open squares), where new NPIW is formed. Note gradient among WSAPW,
            OSIW before and after ventilation, and resulting change in NPIW (intermediate water
            core layer: light blue shaded area). Stations 14/29/84, 110, and 12 (yellow dots in
