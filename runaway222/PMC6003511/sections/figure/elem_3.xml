  <p>Model results from the earth system model COSMOS. Results are plotted in all panels as anomalies, calculated as differences resulting from 9 ka minus PI runs. (
   <span class="italic">A</span>) Annual mean temperature (T) anomaly, shown on a meridional transect along 150° E from the equator to 60° N. The transect crosses directly into the Okhotsk Sea north of 42° N. (
   <span class="italic">B</span>) Same as in 
   <span class="italic">A</span> but for annual mean salinity (S) anomaly. (
   <span class="italic">C</span>) Sea ice volume anomaly 9 ka minus PI, calculated from sea ice concentration multiplied by sea ice thickness in the North Pacific. (
   <span class="italic">D</span>) Same as 
   <span class="italic">C</span>, but for sea ice thickness.
