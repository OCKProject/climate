         <p>Model results from the earth system model COSMOS. Results are plotted in all panels
            as anomalies, calculated as differences resulting from 9 ka minus PI runs. (
            <span>A</span>) Annual mean temperature (T) anomaly, shown on a meridional transect along 150° E
            from the equator to 60° N. The transect crosses directly into the Okhotsk Sea north
            of 42° N. (
            <span>B</span>) Same as in 
            <span>A</span> but for annual mean salinity (S) anomaly. (
            <span>C</span>) Sea ice volume anomaly 9 ka minus PI, calculated from sea ice concentration multiplied
            by sea ice thickness in the North Pacific. (
            <span>D</span>) Same as 
            <span>C</span>, but for sea ice thickness.
