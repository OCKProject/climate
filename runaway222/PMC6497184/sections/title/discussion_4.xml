 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summary: Ende's seminal essay was the first of its kind to use the word 'feedback' to describe the practice of providing information to medical learners about their performance in order to guide future performance. He begins with a brief discussion explaining the feedback process to teachers and learners in the medical field and provides a definition of feedback for the clinical realm. In an adjustment from systems and humanities literature, feedback is defined as insight offered to a learner student as to what they did (good and bad) and the consequences of the actions taken. This insight provides a potential disconnect between the learner’s intentions and actual results. The goal of medical training is proficiency in treating patients and feedback provides a non-judgmental method of correcting mistakes, reinforcing appropriate behaviors, and guiding the learner toward competence. Feedback is described in this article as information that is formative and objective in nature. This is in contrast to evaluation which is summative and judgment-based. The two terms should not be used interchangeably. Ende believes there is a paucity of feedback in medical education because of a limited amount of direct observation of the learner, emotional responses of the learner leading to negative effects beyond the intent, and the teacher’s fear of hurt feelings, damaging the student-teacher relationship or leading to negative evaluations from students. He puts forth eight guidelines for delivery of feedback in clinical medicine. While a departure from the “vanishing feedback” that has permeated medical education, incorporating these recommendations into feedback is a challenge only in remembering to utilize them. Ende contests that providing appropriate feedback is necessary, valuable, and not that difficult.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relevance to Junior Faculty Members: Educating residents and students is a key role of academic faculty members. Being able to provide appropriate, timely, and effective feedback is a required skill for achieving that goal. Most residency programs spend little, if any, time providing direct instruction or education to faculty regarding the provision of learner feedback. Ende’s paper is the building block upon which most subsequent research and recommendations are built. The guidelines offer concrete recommendations for an instructor to follow. Understanding the goals of feedback in the clinical realm, the difference between feedback and evaluation, the risks of inadequate feedback, and the benefits of meaningful feedback provide an excellent starting point for a junior faculty member.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerations for Faculty Developers: This paper can be a valuable starting point for faculty developers looking to provide faculty with a strong basis in feedback in medical education. As the seminal article on feedback, it highlights some of the barriers to achieving meaningful feedback, while also providing a roadmap to the early instructor by providing the guidelines for giving effective feedback. This article could be used to build a series of workshops on feedback as it serves as a key article to include in any feedback-giving guide.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summary: Founded in Ende’s seminal work on feedback, this article aims to provide a solid definition of feedback in the context of student learners in the Emergency Department (ED) while detailing the goals of feedback and consequences of not providing it appropriately [
  <a rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr" href="#REF1">1</a>]. The author then discusses ten “elements of effective feedback” within this context that are grounded in the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)’s five domains of feedback (ie, timeliness, respect/communication, specificity, action plan, and feedback culture). Within these ten elements are themes of addressing the action not the person and making sure to both discuss the problem and the solution. The article continues with a brief discussion of common faculty concerns regarding providing constructive criticism and how to develop faculty who regularly provide learners with appropriate feedback. Finally, the author closes with eight “helpful hints and examples” that extend from the ten elements and are specific to providing feedback in the context of supervising students while providing patient care (particularly in the ED).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relevance to Junior Faculty Members: Feedback can be challenging to provide. This may be particularly difficult in the ED setting, where are a variety of learners with differing skill and interest levels. This article is a valuable resource for junior faculty as they learn how best to construct feedback to their learners. The examples will help faculty determine which aspects of feedback they need to work on and then focus on each component as needed.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerations for Faculty Developers: The author both provides ten elements that will serve as a basis to build faculty development courses around and suggests specifically how to build a feedback course. Faculty developers could use this to design a course or provide this to faculty as a resource.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summary: This review paper begins by briefly defining feedback and discussing the positive impact of “good” feedback and the negative impact of “feedback done badly”. The authors discuss the concept of “constructive feedback” and its importance for feedback acceptance. The authors then review of the feedback literature to detail both the general conceptual characteristics of constructive feedback. They detail the specific features that are required to construct a solid constructive feedback message that will be heard and acted upon by the feedback recipient.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relevance to Junior Faculty Members: Educators face many barriers to providing constructive feedback/positive criticism. The authors supply information to help faculty provide effective feedback and build an environment in which feedback will be heard. Junior faculty can use this technology to refine their feedback technique.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerations for Faculty Developers: The authors focus on the most challenging aspect of feedback: positive criticism. This article provides faculty with an initial foundation of knowledge of the topic. Faculty developers may use the conceptual characteristics to do an overall needs assessment of their institution’s feedback culture and to generate faculty development courses based on the results. Faculty developers may also choose to focus on the individual faculty, assessing their strengths and weaknesses in each of the 14 components of the feedback message and then developing curricula around the most lacking components.</p>

  <a rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr" href="#REF25">25</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summary: Ramani and colleagues set the stage in this article by discussing the shift in feedback from teacher-oriented to learner-focused. They perform a deep dive into the literature, drawing on several topics and papers that define and explain the reasons for the paradigm shift. The authors provide twelve recommendations for promoting this change by showing a 360-degree interpretation of these tips through four different “lenses” (ie, from the standpoint of the teacher, the learner, the feedback relationship, and the institution). A viewpoint from each of these “lenses” is critical as feedback must be acceptable, meaningful, and supported by all these participants in order to facilitate a learning environment that allows for effective, honest feedback. The tips provided from the teacher aspect include strategies to increase credibility and generate a feedback-accepting climate. The student perspective recommendations function to stimulate a growth mindset within the learner with a goal of increasing receptivity to feedback. Guidelines relating to the feedback relationship include strengthening of the alliance between teacher and learner and emphasizing that involved parties must work together toward a common goal of performance improvement. The institutional role is centered on changing the culture to focus on professional growth and creating an environment where learners and teachers understand that feedback, both positive and negative, is a key element of medical education. The underlying theme of the paper highlights the transition of feedback to a sociocultural process that is focused on the learner’s goals, and the culture change that must occur at the individual, group, and institutional levels to successfully adopt it.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relevance to Junior Faculty Members: The promotion of relationships and the change to a learner-centered feedback process is of critical importance to junior faculty. The relevance of this article lies in providing the different lenses through which to view the recommendations. It is beneficial to consider not only the teacher’s beliefs, but also the learner’s point of view and role in any feedback interaction. Understanding that the student-teacher relationship can have a dramatic effect on the reception of feedback is also paramount. Methods of enhancing that relationship will only improve the honesty and meaningfulness of the feedback exchanged. Additionally, the participatory design feedback loop that the authors propose provides step-by-step instruction for incorporating a learner-driven plan to assimilate feedback. This article helps create practical tools for the junior learner to incorporate into practice. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerations for Faculty Developers: The articles discusses institutional changes that need to occur in order to successfully implement the strategies put forth in the paper. Faculty developers will be able to design a plan for initiating the culture change that needs to occur at the departmental and institutional levels. In order for this paradigm shift to occur, the environment and culture of feedback need to change, and the tips in the article provide some guidance in that regard. Culture change requires buy-in from the entirety of the parties involved, and in order to get that buy-in, the developers would need to explain reasoning and provide examples and teaching for how this feedback process should happen. Ramani and colleagues provide a reasonable blueprint for invoking the type of change necessary to implement a feedback culture change of this magnitude.</p>

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summary: This article provides a critical appraisal of the literature on feedback with a focus on the top 20 papers with respect to their methodology. The authors performed a systematic review and scored papers using a previously established scoring tool. The authors provide a brief summary of each article, followed by an analysis of themes based upon their review. The authors identified three main themes: learner characteristics, feedback characteristics, and feedback culture. Within the theme of learner characteristics, the authors discuss the importance of incorporating learner self-assessment by providing benchmarking data and engaging learners in soliciting goal derivation and refinement. The authors note that characteristics of feedback were a dominant finding in their appraisal and that educators should strive to provide high-quality feedback with an emphasis on creating a positive feedback culture, ensuring that feedback is bi-directional, and that it is appropriately timely. They emphasize the importance of faculty development with dedicated feedback training. Finally, the authors discuss the importance of having a positive feedback culture with an expectation of routine feedback.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relevance to Junior Faculty Members: Junior faculty may struggle with understanding the evidence to support specific feedback practices or newer approaches. This article is a valuable resource for junior faculty because it provides an overview of key themes and some key references within the feedback literature. Readers can utilize this as a launching point for additional reading, as well as to gain an understanding of some of the key emerging themes within the literature. The importance of learner engagement and creating a culture of feedback are particularly important for learner buy-in and long-term adoption and incorporation of feedback recommendations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerations for Faculty Developers: Kornegay and colleagues highlight some of the key literature that can be used to inform faculty development courses for all faculty, regardless of experience. This article can be provided to faculty as pre-reading or utilized as part of the course itself. As noted by the authors, it is important to provide targeted feedback training, as well as ongoing faculty development. Therefore, faculty developers should ensure that feedback training is supported by evidence-based recommendations and incorporates the newer literature. Finally, the increasing data on the value of multi-source feedback should be considered when helping faculty to develop their feedback skills.</p>

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summary: This consensus paper from experienced educators summarizes best practices in giving feedback and identifies areas for further scholarly exploration. Although this is not a true systematic review, each recommendation is supported by the authors’ experience, in addition to evidence from the literature. The authors suggest a new definition: “Helpful feedback is a supportive conversation that clarifies the trainee’s awareness of their developing competencies, enhances their self-efficacy for making progress, challenges them to set objectives for improvement, and facilitates their development of strategies to enable that improvement to occur.” They include a summary of characteristics of feedback in the form of “Do’s”, “Don’t” and “Don’t knows” in which they provide 32 guidelines that can be incorporated into clinical practice when giving feedback. These guidelines address the process and content of feedback as well as guidelines that can be applied to create a learning culture conducive to improving the feedback experience for both faculty and learners.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relevance to Junior Faculty Members: Giving feedback is a difficult task for junior faculty who are transitioning to their new role. Often, they do not have a clear idea of what they should or should not be doing when giving feedback. The article includes an easy-to-read summary table of “Do’s,” “Don’t” and “Don’t knows” for the process and content of feedback. Many of the items on the list of “Do’s” and “Don’ts” within the topic of learning culture can be impacted by junior faculty, such as fostering trusting relationships with learners. This can serve as a quick reference for junior faculty with a review of best practices that they could glance at just before a shift to help remind them of tips for providing helpful feedback. An important point emphasized in the paper is that the impact of feedback is dependent upon proper diagnosis of a learner’s needs and their receptiveness to hearing this feedback, which ultimately reflects on the institution’s learning climate and feedback culture. This paper can serve as a practical tool for junior faculty to help change the climate and feedback culture in their respective institution.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerations for Faculty Developers: Faculty developers have an obligation not only to train their faculty how to give helpful feedback, but also to create a learning culture that supports provision and reception of feedback in the clinical environment. This paper provides a refresher on best practices in giving feedback that can be used to structure faculty development sessions. Educational leaders should also follow the guidelines identified by the authors to nurture a supportive learning culture, which can directly impact the effectiveness of feedback. Salient suggestions include prioritizing the role of regular feedback in the institution, promoting direct observation of learners, and providing regular training for faculty to maintain their competencies in giving feedback.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, faculty developers can support junior faculty interested in scholarly pursuits in feedback by directing them to help answer the questions identified in the “don’t knows” section.</p>

Rather, we utilized expert consultation combined with an open social media call to identify a list of the most important articles. This was intentional, so as to identify the most important papers, while maintaining a manageable length for the participants in the study. As such, it is possible that some relevant articles may have been missed. Additionally, while a pure Delphi approach includes only topic experts, we opted to include a combination of experts and junior faculty. By incorporating junior faculty, we are better able to determine articles of interest to this important cohort of medical educators [
