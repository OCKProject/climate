 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We present eight key papers addressing the topic of feedback with discussions and applications for junior faculty members and those leading faculty development initiatives. These papers provide a basis on which junior faculty members might build for designing the methods by which they can appraise their local programs and projects. These articles are applicable to physicians at all career stages and can help inform them on how to become more experienced with giving feedback.Â </p>
