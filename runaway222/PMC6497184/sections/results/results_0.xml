 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ALiEM Faculty Incubator discussions, expert recommendations, and social media requests yielded 88 articles. The paper evaluation process resulted in a rank-order listing of these papers in order of perceived relevance as indicated by the results of round three using the Modified Delphi approach. The group decided on using the top eight articles instead of 10 as there was 100% agreement on these. The top eight papers are expanded upon below. </p>
