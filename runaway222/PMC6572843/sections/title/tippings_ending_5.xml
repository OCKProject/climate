 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Let us now consider a scenario that drifts through several bifurcations. In the example of this section, we start with 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>−</sub> = 0.1 and end at 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>+</sub> = 0.5835 (interval 
  <span class="italic">I</span>
  <sub>2</sub> in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) where the frozen-in system has period-two attractors, possessing basins of attraction with a fractal boundary, indicating that chaotic transients are much more prominent. This applies also to the scenario-dependent basins (cf. Supplementary Discussion 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">IIA</a>). The tipping probabilities are given in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>. In contrast with the scenario of the previous section, the probabilities do not decay quickly, but saturate up to 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">r</span>
  </sub> ≈ 40. This property has to do with the emergence of complex structures in the scenario-dependent basins. The plateaus last up to about 80 time units, then 
  <span class="italic">P</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">Cy</span>,
   <span class="italic">R</span>
  </sub> and 
  <span class="italic">P</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">Cy</span>,
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </sub> start decaying, and these probabilities approach practically zero at 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">r</span>
  </sub> = 120. The quasistatic limit of perfect tracking is thus reached for 
  <span class="italic">t</span>

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A surprising new phenomenon occurs when investigating the dependence of the basin structure on the starting time 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>−</sub> &lt; 0 of the scenario. As Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a> shows, there is a strong change in the dominant attractor back to 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>−</sub> = −40, after which blue dominates. This seems to contradict the naive expectation according to which going further and further into the past on the 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>−</sub> plateau should correspond to leaving more and more time for the ensemble to converge to the single (cyan) attractor existing there, from which then no escape is possible.

 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strong 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>−</sub>-dependence up to −40, and the saturation afterwards, is clearly visible also in the tipping probabilities shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b,c</a>. For |
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>−</sub>| sufficiently large, all of the considered trajectories converge to the same attractor, which represents a complete tipping. Interestingly, the particular attractor chosen by the scenario depends on 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">r</span>
  </sub> as a comparison of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b,c</a> indicates. Thus, the attractors describing rotations behave in a strongly different way due to the parameter drift, although they are dynamically equivalent in the frozen-in system (see Supplemental Discussion 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">I</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To find an explanation, we follow an ensemble of trajectories, distributed initially uniformly over the full state space, as it evolves in time, from 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>−</sub> &lt; 0 to 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 0. All these points converge of course towards the single (cyan) attractor existing for 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>−</sub>. Because 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>−</sub> is finite, the convergence is yet incomplete but the patch formed by the ensemble is smaller for larger |
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>−</sub>|. When reaching the time instant 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 0 (when 
  <span class="italic">C</span> starts to change along the ramp), we overlay the patch with the scenario-dependent basins of attraction obtained for a scenario starting at 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>−</sub> = 0 and with all the other parameters unchanged. A sufficiently contracted patch can be considered to have converged to the (cyan) attractor at 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>−</sub> but its precise small-scale structure turns out to be relevant from the point of view of tipping. The intersection of the patch with any of the scenario-dependent basins provides those trajectories that will tip to the corresponding attractor. In this context, the surprising, almost certain tipping for |
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>−</sub>| &gt; 40 can be understood as follows. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> shows the patch placed on the corresponding scenario-dependent basins of attraction, for two different 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>−</sub>-s. We see that the basins’ small-scale structure is the cause of the change in the character of tipping. The basins are made up of unicolored regions separated by fractal boundaries. Because of this, since at the time instant when the parameter drift starts (
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 0), the small patch of the initial ensemble might overlap with several colors (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7a</a>), but for a sufficiently large |
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>−</sub>| it fully falls into one of the basins (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7b</a>). This means, that one of the frozen-in attractors is selected by the scenario, and trajectories tip to it with probability 1. The exact outcome of the tipping of course depends on 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">r</span>
  </sub>. This can be thought of as the patch remaining unchanged, but the underlying basin structure changing, depending heavily on 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">r</span>
  </sub>, as illustrated by comparing Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7b,c</a>.

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We call the strong variability in the tipping probabilities, before the asymptotic behaviour sets in,

 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is also of interest to investigate scenarios in which the initial control parameter 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>−</sub> allows more than one coexisting attractors in the frozen-in system. Then, it should be taken into account that the basin of attraction at 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>−</sub> of an attractor 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>1</sub> is only a portion of the full state space, and the tipping probability from 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>1</sub> to any other attractors should be determined from trajectories starting from this basin. The details are given in Supplementary Discussion
