      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a>Fig. 3</a> shows the evolution of the geological carbon cycle over Earth history according to
         our nominal model. Here, we have used our kinetic parameterization of seafloor weathering
         rather than the arbitrary pCO
         <sub>2</sub> power law adopted in previous studies (
         <span><span>SI Appendixes A</span> and 
            <span>B</span></span>). We have also assumed a range of continental growth curves (
         <a>Fig. 2
            <span>A</span></a>), a range of Phanerozoic biological weathering enhancements (
         <a>Fig. 2
            <span>C</span></a>), and a range of temperature dependencies of weathering from ref. 
         <a>36</a>. Proxies for surface temperature, atmospheric pCO
         <sub>2</sub>, and seafloor weathering flux are plotted alongside model outputs for comparison
         (
         <span><span>SI Appendix D</span></span>). For all results, both 95% confidence intervals and median values are plotted for
         key carbon cycle outputs. Median values are calculated at each time step, and consequently
         their evolution does not necessarily resemble the most probable time evolution of
         carbon cycle variables. In practice, however, most individual model realizations tend
         to track the median, at least qualitatively (
         <span><span>SI Appendix A</span></span>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observe that modeled temperatures are relatively constant throughout Earth history,
         with Archean temperatures ranging from 271 to 314 K. The combination of continental
         and seafloor weathering efficiently buffers climate against changes in luminosity,
         outgassing, and biological evolution. This temperature history is broadly consistent
         with glacial constraints and recent isotope proxies (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>D</span></a>). The continental weathering buffer dominates over the seafloor weathering buffer
         for most of Earth history, but in the Archean the two carbon sinks are comparable
         (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S1
            </span>). Indeed, if seafloor weathering were artificially held constant, then continental
         weathering alone may be unable to efficiently buffer the climate of the early Earth—the
         temperature distribution at 4.0 Ga extends to 370 K, and the atmospheric pCO
         <sub>2</sub> distribution extends to 7 bar (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S3
            </span>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our nominal model, the median Archean surface temperature is slightly higher than
         modern surface temperatures. If solar evolution were the only driver of the carbon
         cycle, then Archean temperatures would necessarily be cooler than modern temperatures;
         weathering feedbacks can mitigate this cooling but not produce warming. Warmer Archean
         climates are possible because elevated internal heat flow, lower continental land
         fraction, and lessened biological enhancement of weathering all act to warm to Precambrian
         climate. These three factors produce a comparable warming effect (
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S17
            <span>A</span> and 
            <span>Appendix C</span></span>), although the magnitude of each is highly uncertain and so temperate Archean temperatures
         cannot be uniquely attributed to any one variable.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Continental and seafloor weathering also buffer ocean pH against changes in luminosity
         and outgassing. Ocean pH increases monotonically over Earth history from 6.3–7.2 at
         4.0 Ga, to 6.5–7.7 at 2.5 Ga, and to the modern value of 8.2. The broad range of parameterizations
         does not tightly constrain the history of atmospheric pCO
         <sub>2</sub>, but the model pCO
         <sub>2</sub> outputs encompass paleosol proxies (
         <a>Fig. 3
            <span>B</span></a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results described above assume an Archean landmass fraction between 0.1 and 0.75
         times the modern land fraction. Next, we consider the endmember scenario of zero Archean
         landmass. This is unrealistic because abundant evidence exists for Archean land (
         <a>48</a>). However, a zero land fraction case could represent a scenario where continental
         fraction is sufficiently small that continental silicate weathering becomes supply
         limited (e.g., ref. 
         <a>49</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a>Fig. 4</a> shows model outputs for the zero land fraction case. When continental weathering
         drops to zero, seafloor weathering increases dramatically to balance the carbon cycle
         (
         <a>Fig. 4
            <span>F</span></a>). This is largely a consequence of the temperature-dependent feedback of seafloor
         weathering. The climate warms by 10–15 K (
         <a>Fig. 4
            <span>D</span></a>) before the temperature-dependent seafloor weathering flux is sufficiently large
         to balance the carbon cycle. Even in this extreme case, the median Archean temperature
         is ∼305 K, and the upper end of the temperature distribution at 4 Ga only extends
         to ∼328 K, excluding a “hot” Archean of 60–80 °C. Archean pCO
         <sub>2</sub> (and pH) are slightly higher (lower) in the zero land case, but the seafloor weathering
         feedback is still an effective buffer.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we investigated whether the inclusion of methane as a Precambrian greenhouse
         gas would substantially change our results. 
         <a>Fig. 5</a> shows model outputs where we have assumed 100 ppm Proterozoic methane and 1% Archean
         methane levels (
         <span><span>SI Appendix E</span></span>). The temperature changes are smaller than what might be expected if only methane
         levels were changing. This is because pCO
         <sub>2</sub> drops in response to the imposed temperature increase—pCO
         <sub>2</sub> must drop otherwise weathering sinks would exceed source fluxes. The pCO
         <sub>2</sub> distribution at 4.0 Ga is shifted downward relative to the nominal case with no other
         greenhouse cases, and ocean pH increases in response to this pCO
         <sub>2</sub> drop. Note that for parts of parameter space where CO
         <sub>2</sub>/CH
         <sub>4</sub> ≳ 0.2 (
         <a>50</a>), our temperatures should be considered upper limits because a photochemical haze
         would form, cooling the climate (
         <span><span>SI Appendix E</span></span>).

               <span>D</span>) Temperature increases sharply in the Archean due to methane, but by less than what
               would be expected if pCO
               <sub>2</sub> were unchanged. In practice, there is a compensating decrease in atmospheric pCO
               <sub>2</sub>, (
               <span>B</span>) which must occur to balance the carbon cycle. Otherwise temperatures would be too
               high and weathering sinks would exceed outgassing sources. Because pCO
               <sub>2</sub> is lower, Archean pH values are closer to circumneutral (

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, even with considerable warming from an additional greenhouse gas, the median
         temperature at 4.0 Ga is below 300 K, and the temperature distribution extends to
         320 K, again excluding a hot Archean. 
         <span><span>SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S7
            </span> shows the results for the most extreme case of no Archean land and high methane abundances.
         Even in this extreme scenario, the seafloor weathering flux successfully buffers the
         climate to a median 4.0 Ga value of ∼310 K. Archean pH values are closer to circumneutral
         when methane is included due to lower pCO
         <sub>2</sub>, but there is still a monotonic evolution in pH over Earth history.
