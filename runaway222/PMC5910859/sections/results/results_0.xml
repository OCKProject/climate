Median values are calculated at each time step, and consequently their evolution does not necessarily resemble the most probable time evolution of carbon cycle variables.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observe that modeled temperatures are relatively constant throughout Earth history, with Archean temperatures ranging from 271 to 314 K. The combination of continental and seafloor weathering efficiently buffers climate against changes in luminosity, outgassing, and biological evolution. This temperature history is broadly consistent with glacial constraints and recent isotope proxies (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </a>). The continental weathering buffer dominates over the seafloor weathering buffer for most of Earth history, but in the Archean the two carbon sinks are comparable (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1721296115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S1
  </span>). Indeed, if seafloor weathering were artificially held constant, then continental weathering alone may be unable to efficiently buffer the climate of the early Earth—the temperature distribution at 4.0 Ga extends to 370 K, and the atmospheric pCO
  <sub>2</sub> distribution extends to 7 bar (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1721296115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S3
  </span>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our nominal model, the median Archean surface temperature is slightly higher than modern surface temperatures. If solar evolution were the only driver of the carbon cycle, then Archean temperatures would necessarily be cooler than modern temperatures; weathering feedbacks can mitigate this cooling but not produce warming. Warmer Archean climates are possible because elevated internal heat flow, lower continental land fraction, and lessened biological enhancement of weathering all act to warm to Precambrian climate. These three factors produce a comparable warming effect (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1721296115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S17
   <span class="italic">A</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Appendix C</span>
  </span>), although the magnitude of each is highly uncertain and so temperate Archean temperatures cannot be uniquely attributed to any one variable.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Continental and seafloor weathering also buffer ocean pH against changes in luminosity and outgassing. Ocean pH increases monotonically over Earth history from 6.3–7.2 at 4.0 Ga, to 6.5–7.7 at 2.5 Ga, and to the modern value of 8.2. The broad range of parameterizations does not tightly constrain the history of atmospheric pCO
  <sub>2</sub>, but the model pCO
  <sub>2</sub> outputs encompass paleosol proxies (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results described above assume an Archean landmass fraction between 0.1 and 0.75 times the modern land fraction. Next, we consider the endmember scenario of zero Archean landmass. This is unrealistic because abundant evidence exists for Archean land (
  <a rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" href="#r48">48</a>). However, a zero land fraction case could represent a scenario where continental fraction is sufficiently small that continental silicate weathering becomes supply limited (e.g., ref. 
  <a rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" href="#r49">49</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a> shows model outputs for the zero land fraction case. When continental weathering drops to zero, seafloor weathering increases dramatically to balance the carbon cycle (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4
   <span class="italic">F</span>
  </a>). This is largely a consequence of the temperature-dependent feedback of seafloor weathering. The climate warms by 10–15 K (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </a>) before the temperature-dependent seafloor weathering flux is sufficiently large to balance the carbon cycle. Even in this extreme case, the median Archean temperature is ∼305 K, and the upper end of the temperature distribution at 4 Ga only extends to ∼328 K, excluding a “hot” Archean of 60–80 °C. Archean pCO
  <sub>2</sub> (and pH) are slightly higher (lower) in the zero land case, but the seafloor weathering feedback is still an effective buffer.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we investigated whether the inclusion of methane as a Precambrian greenhouse gas would substantially change our results. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5</a> shows model outputs where we have assumed 100 ppm Proterozoic methane and 1% Archean methane levels (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1721296115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">

  </span>). The temperature changes are smaller than what might be expected if only methane levels were changing. This is because pCO
  <sub>2</sub> drops in response to the imposed temperature increase—pCO
  <sub>2</sub> must drop otherwise weathering sinks would exceed source fluxes. The pCO
  <sub>2</sub> distribution at 4.0 Ga is shifted downward relative to the nominal case with no other greenhouse cases, and ocean pH increases in response to this pCO
  <sub>2</sub> drop. Note that for parts of parameter space where CO
  <sub>2</sub>/CH
  <sub>4</sub> ≳ 0.2 (
  <a rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" href="#r50">50</a>), our temperatures should be considered upper limits because a photochemical haze would form, cooling the climate (
