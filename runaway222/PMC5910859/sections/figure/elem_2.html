            <span>A</span>) Ocean pH with the 95% confidence interval from Halevy and Bachan (
            <a>29</a>) plotted with red dashed lines for comparison. Our model predicts a monotonic evolution
            of pH from slightly acidic values at 4.0 Ga to slightly alkaline modern values. (

            <span>D</span>) Mean surface temperature plotted alongside glacial and geochemical proxies from
            the literature. Our model predicts surface temperatures have been temperate throughout
            Earth history. (
