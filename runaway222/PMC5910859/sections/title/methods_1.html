         seafloor dissolution, and carbonate precipitation. The consequences of this simplification
         are explored in the sensitivity analysis in 
         <span><span>SI Appendix C</span></span>. We do not track organic carbon burial because organic burial only constitutes 10–30%
         of total carbon burial for the vast majority of Earth history (
         <a>40</a>), and so the inorganic carbon cycle is the primary control.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The treatment of tectonic and interior processes is important for specifying outgassing
         and subduction flux histories. We avoid tracking crustal and mantle reservoirs because
         explicitly parameterizing how outgassing fluxes relate to crustal production and reservoirs
         assumes modern-style plate tectonics has operated throughout Earth history (e.g.,
         ref. 
         <a>12</a>) and might not be valid. Evidence exists for Archean subduction in eclogitic diamonds
         (
         <a>41</a>) and sulfur mass-independent fractionation in ocean island basalts ostensibly derived
         from recycled Archean crust (
         <a>42</a>). However, other tectonic modes have been proposed for the early Earth such as heat-pipe
         volcanism (
         <a>43</a>), delamination and shallow convection (
         <a>44</a>), or a stagnant lid regime (
         <a>45</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our generalized parameterizations for heat flow, spreading rates, and outgassing histories
         are described in 
         <span><span>SI Appendix A</span></span>. 
         <a>Fig. 2
            <span>D</span></a> shows our assumed range of internal heat flow histories compared with estimates from
         the literature. Spreading rate is connected to crustal production via a power law,
         which spans endmember cases (
         <span><span>SI Appendix A</span></span>). These parameterizations provide an extremely broad range of heat flow, outgassing,
         and crustal production histories, and do not assume a fixed coupling between these
         variables.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a 1D radiative convective model (
         <a>46</a>) to create a grid of mean surface temperatures as a function of solar luminosity
         and pCO
         <sub>2</sub>. The grid of temperature outputs was fitted with a 2D polynomial (
         <span><span>SI Appendix E</span></span>). We initially neglect other greenhouse gases besides CO
         <sub>2</sub> and H
         <sub>2</sub>O, albedo changes, and assumed a constant total pressure over Earth history. However,
         later we consider these influences, such as including methane (CH
         <sub>4</sub>) in the Precambrian. The evolution of solar luminosity is conventionally parameterized
         (
         <a>47</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model has been demonstrated for the last 100 Ma against abundant proxy data (
         <a>36</a>) and it can broadly reproduce Sleep and Zahnle (
         <a>12</a>) if we replace our kinetic formulation of seafloor weathering with their simpler
         CO
         <sub>2</sub>-dependent expression (
         <span><span>SI Appendix B</span></span>). Agreement with ref. 
         <a>12</a> confirms that the omission of crustal and mantle reservoirs does not affect our conclusions.
