 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The early Earth was probably temperate. Continental and seafloor weathering buffer Archean surface temperatures to 0–50 °C. This result holds for a broad range of assumptions about the evolution of internal heat flow, crustal production, spreading rates, and the biotic enhancement of continental weathering. Even in extreme scenarios with negligible subaerial Archean land and high methane abundances, a hot Archean (&gt;50 °C) is unlikely. Sub-0 °C climates are also unlikely unless the Archean outgassing flux was unrealistically lower than the modern flux.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seafloor weathering feedback is important, but less dominant than previously assumed. Consequently, the early Earth would not have been in a snowball state due to pCO
  <sub>2</sub> drawdown from seafloor weathering. In principle, little to no methane is required to maintain a habitable surface climate, although methane should be expected in the anoxic Archean atmosphere once methanogenesis evolved (ref.

Consequently, similar feedbacks may control ocean pH and climate on other Earthlike planets with basaltic seafloors and silicate continents, suggesting that life elsewhere could emerge in comparable environments to those on our early planet.
