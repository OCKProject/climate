      <p>The climate and ocean pH of the early Earth are important for understanding the origin
         and early evolution of life. However, estimates of early climate range from below
         freezing to over 70 °C, and ocean pH estimates span from strongly acidic to alkaline.
         To better constrain environmental conditions, we applied a self-consistent geological
         carbon cycle model to the last 4 billion years. The model predicts a temperate (0–50
         °C) climate and circumneutral ocean pH throughout the Precambrian due to stabilizing
         feedbacks from continental and seafloor weathering. These environmental conditions
         under which life emerged and diversified were akin to the modern Earth. Similar stabilizing
         feedbacks on climate and ocean pH may operate on earthlike exoplanets, implying life
         elsewhere could emerge in comparable environments.
