 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, underpinned with 17 SDGs and 169 targets, was adopted in September 2015. Policymakers face the challenge of implementing the SDGs simultaneously with the aim of achieving progress across the economic, social and environmental dimensions worldwide (
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>). Social sciences are essential for surveillance, not only because they can understand the social context of diseases, but also because they help us to understand the social context of surveillance plans. As mentioned earlier, there are many obvious advantages of integrated approaches, but not often practiced successfully, because it is just plain difficult. The International Council of Science recognized this challenge and provided the following framework to get from science to implementation of SDGs (
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>):
 </p>
 <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>“The framework identifies categories of causal and functional relations underlying progress or achievement of goals and targets. The scale ranges from −3 to +3, from instances where progress on one target acts to cancel progress on another to where progress on one goal is inextricably linked to progress on another. Complementing the scale is a number of key dimensions (time, geography, governance, technology, directionality) that describe the interactions and define the context in which they occur. Most interaction scores depend on these dimensions and putting in place the right policies and technologies might shift the score to a more positive one. To be more specific, positive interactions are assigned scores of either +1 (“enabling”), +2 (“reinforcing”), or +3 (“indivisible”), while interactions characterized by trade-offs are scored with −1 (“constraining”), −2 (“counteracting”), and −3 (“canceling”). Thus, the magnitude of the score, in whichever direction, provides an indication of how influential a given SDG or target is on another.”</p>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Below, we present a discussion of how to apply this described framework to integrated vector management for dengue control and the prevention of Lyme borreliosis. For both examples, we provide a background of the particular VBD and the interactions between SDG 3 and other SDGs, which are summarized in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>. A number of dimensions are used to contextualize the assessment of specific synergies and trade-offs, such directionality, place-specific context dependencies, governance, technology, and timeframe (
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>). To further investigate the nature and dynamics of the interactions, we specify the main targets and key interactions, scored according to the framework and suggest policy options to achieve the intended goal. In the text, we focus only on a subset of the key interactions to illustrate how the scoring framework can be applied in practice. A complete overview of the application's outcome within the framework of the two examples is provided in

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dengue (DEN) poses a threat to over 3.9. billion people and its re-emergence has become one of the most serious global health threats (
   <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>). However, the more recent spread of Zika virus infections in the world is a more broadly recognized illustration of the re-emergence of mosquito-borne diseases 
   <span class="bold">(SDG 3)</span>. Driven by ever increasing trade and travel, as well as continuous and progressive urbanization 
   <span class="bold">(SDG11)</span>, and possibly climate change 
   <span class="bold">(SDG 13)</span>, the world has been witnessing an increase in diseases that are mainly transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito 
   <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span>, notably DEN, chikungunya (CHIK), and Zika (ZIK). As no effective vaccine or medicine is yet available to prevent or cure DEN, CHIK, and ZIK, disease prevention through vector control is a critical component of disease control, albeit a very challenging one.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span>, which thrives primarily in (sub)tropical climate, is a domesticated mosquito species that feeds almost exclusively on humans (
   <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>). After the female 
   <span class="italic">Ae. aegypti</span> has mated and taken a blood-meal, she searches for an aquatic breeding place to lay her eggs. This species lays her eggs preferably in artificial containers, which are often established in urban settings near human habitation (
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>, 
   <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>). 
   <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> lays her eggs against the vertical side of various kinds of water holding containers and the eggs will hatch upon flooding. The eggs can survive several months of drought (
   <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>, 
   <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>), and become cryptic for control.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The availability and density of artificial containers are important indicators for the presence and size of 
   <span class="italic">Ae. aegypti</span> population in a locality (
   <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>–
   <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>). Satterthwaite showed that the amount of artificial objects can be linked to socio-economic status (
   <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>) 
   <span class="bold">(SDG 10)</span>. The level of access to safe and affordable (drinking) water 
   <span class="bold">(SDG 6)</span> is inversely proportional to the presence of water storage systems, such as cisterns or rain barrels that are well-known breeding sites of 
   <span class="italic">Ae. aegypti</span>. Further, in low income areas there is generally more garbage lying around than in high income areas. Random garbage accumulation in a neighborhood can lead to more artificial containers suitable as a breeding ground for 
   <span class="italic">Ae. aegypti</span> (
   <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>, 
   <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>) 
   <span class="bold">(SDG 11)</span>. Neighborhood cleanup constitutes not only an important prerequisite for starting other measures of integrated 
   <span class="italic">Aedes</span> management, it is to be expected to have a considerable additional positive impact on the health and well-being of the inhabitants. Waste management needs to play a central role in integrated Aedes management that may include chemical control (
   <span class="bold">SDG12</span>) in addition to physical and social control measures. While Integrated Vector Management is a public task, it relies, in part, on people to take individual responsibilities 
   <span class="bold">(SDG 4)</span>. In temperate areas, the risk of establishment of invasive 
   <span class="bold">(SDG 15)</span>
   <span class="italic">Aedes</span> mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry is increasing, due to climate change 
   <span class="bold">(SDG 13)</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In brief, integrated vector management for dengue control involves, at least, seven SDGs other than the entry goal, SDG3. Within these goals, we identified a total of nine specific main targets (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). Among these main targets, we recognize eight, all positive, key interactions and suggested an appropriate policy option for each (
   <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). The interactions between target 3.3 and 3D with target 4.3, 10.1, and 11.6 are bi-directional, but not symmetrical. The two SDG3 targets affect the latter targets less, compared to how these targets affect the two SDG3 targets. More specifically, preventing 
   <span class="italic">Aedes</span>-borne diseases does positively affect attempts of reaching equity, education and livable cities, but we assessed that education (4.3), poverty reduction (10.1) improving urban waste management (11.6) has a more direct and stronger impact on dengue prevention. A complete overview of main targets, key interactions, scores and policy options to reach integrated vector management for dengue control are provided in

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prevention of Lyme Borreliosis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lyme borreliosis is a VBD caused by an infection with the spirochete 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi s.l</span>. In Europe, humans primarily become infected through the bite of the sheep tick 
   <span class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</span>. The transmission cycle of Lyme spirochetes in nature is intricate because, in addition to the tick, it involves several vertebrate host species.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Entering a tick's biotope poses a risk for people since they can acquire a tick bite. To reduce the risk of people acquiring a tick bite, a reduction in either the tick density and/or the exposure is necessary. Understanding, which factors drive tick densities, is an important step in assessing disease risk and formulating intervention strategies (
   <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>) (
   <span class="bold">SDG3</span>). As 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> spends almost its entire life in vegetation, temperature and relative humidity are key requirements for its development, survival and activity and determine their geographic distribution. In conclusion, drivers of tick densities comprise both biotic and abiotic elements of a tick's environment. Land use changes (
   <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>) and climate change has had considerable impact on the ticks northern latitude limit (
   <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>–
   <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">45</a>) (
   <span class="bold">SDG13, SDG 15</span>). Each of the three active stages (larva, nymph, and adult) of 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> seeks a different vertebrate host, attaches, and feeds. The tick detaches when replete and finds a resting place after dropping off the host to digest its blood meal. After this blood meal, ticks molt to the next feeding stage or enter diapause depending on the ambient temperature (
   <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">46</a>). Adults are the main life stage feeding on (roe) deer, but juvenile ticks (larvae and nymphs) prefer smaller mammals and birds. Although, to some extent, annual fluctuations in rodent densities affect the densities of nymphs the following year, the (local) presence of propagation hosts, mostly (roe) deer, is often the key factor for the presence of moderate tick densities in forested areas (
   <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>). Nature and forest corridors not only increase connectivity for vertebrates, but also for ticks and the pathogens they carry (
   <span class="bold">SDG 15</span>). When (roe) deer are absent there is a measurable change in abundance of ticks (
   <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>), illustrated by significant tick reduction in larger deer exclosures (
   <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">49</a>). Urban green areas have relatively low tick densities but pose a high risk because of the high human exposure. Over decades urban green areas have been expanded to create more space for nature but also to counter urban warming (
   <span class="bold">SDG 13</span>) and to enhance human well-being through access to nature (
   <span class="bold">SDG 11</span>) (
   <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">50</a>).

   <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>) (
   <span class="bold">SDG 15</span>). This is often inadequate because (the implementation of) these policy areas are located at different administrative levels.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In brief, prevention of Lyme borreliosis involves, at least, four SDGs other than the entry goal, SDG3, comprising a total of eight specific main targets (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). Among these main targets, we identified six key interactions and suggested an appropriate policy option for each (
   <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>). As opposed to the previous example of dengue control, all six key interactions here are unidirectional, in which the three targets of SDG3 are in all cases affected by the identified targets of the other SDGs, but not in reverse. In addition, three of these six interactions are assessed to be negative, including two constraining and one counteracting interaction. A complete overview of main targets, key interactions, scores and policy options to reach prevention of Lyme borreliosis are provided in 
   <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When following the ICSU framework to move from science to the actual implementation of the SDGs, our perspective on significant issues related to the prevention and control of VBDs and the potential solutions dramatically shifted. The framework helped us identify common goals and targets outside SDG3, the entry goal for the majority of health experts like us. At the same time, the framework illustrates that for each specific problem, even wicked ones, the entry goals and targets interact only with a very limited number of 169 targets underpinning the agenda for sustainable development. We were not as overwhelmed as originally anticipated when starting the implementation of SGDs. Further unlike most integrative initiatives, the framework does not presume that interactions between goals and targets are—for the most part—mutually supporting (
   <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>). In contrast, the framework stresses the necessity of identifying and recognizing negative (as well as positive) interactions and facing the challenges. When finding the common intention or goal (SDG) of the various stakeholders involved, joint attention can be devoted to develop policy options that can reach the common goal. For example, by acknowledging that more urban green spaces can potentially increase the tick population and subsequent risk for Lyme borreliosis, more effort can be put in local educational programs on personal preventive measures to protect against increased risk.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An implicit characteristic of any integrated approach is that partnerships are forged (SDG 17), where the focus is placed on sharing, exchanging, collaborating, learning (from each other), reflecting and generating change across disciplines, and sectors in an enabling environment. Such an approach is very helpful to identify the stakeholders for an issue-based approach, in which interactions are mutually beneficial. But greater than this is that when the approach is truly integrative and includes stakeholders across sectors as well as community input, the conversation becomes bidirectional and on some occasions may result in opposing or contradictory views.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, the thesis is confronted by the antithesis, which leads to synthesis in the form of innovation. The SDGs approach not only provides tools to not forget, but also not to be forgotten. It is not a one fit for all approach, but a tool to find old and new partners, to communicate the challenges which force us to be innovative.</p>
