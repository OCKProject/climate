    "BACKGROUND:High performance work systems (HPWSs) are successful work systems in the context of safety climate and patient safety. The 10-item HPWS questionnaire is a validated instrument developed to assess existing HPWS structures in hospitals. The objectives of this cross-sectional study were to translate the English HPWS questionnaire into German (HPWS-G), to rate its content validity, and to examine its psychometric properties. METHODS:Content validity was examined by a panel of 12 physicians and nurses, and I-CVI and S-CVI calculated. For internal consistency, Cronbach's α and item-scale correlations were determined. Construct validity was measured via confirmatory factor analysis. A convenience sample of 782 nurses and physicians in a University hospital setting in Switzerland's German-speaking region was surveyed. Four inclusion criteria were applied: working in intensive care, emergency department or operating room; having daily patient contact; having worked in the current clinical area for more than three months; and more than 40% employment. RESULTS:A total of 281 questionnaires were completed (response rate: 35.9%). Overall, the 10-item HPWS-G questionnaire showed good content validity (I-CVI = .83-1; S-CVI = .86) and internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .853). HPWS-G scores correlated significantly with safety climate (rs = .657, p < .01) and teamwork climate (rs = .615, p < .01). The proposed 1-factor model was accepted considering results of applied minimum rank factor analysis; a confirmatory factor analysis indicated an acceptable to good model fit (GFI = .968; CFI = .902; RMSEA = .043). CONCLUSIONS:The HPWS-G showed good psychometric properties. In clinical practice it can be used to assess HPWS practices and for intra- and inter-hospital benchmarking. Some minor adaptions to the wording could be made as well as reassessing the psychometric properties at other clinical sites."
