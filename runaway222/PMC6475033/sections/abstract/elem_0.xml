 <p>Narcissism, being the critical part of the toxic leadership paradigm, has its own impact in the education sphere. Contrastingly, leaderâ€™s narcissism cannot be simply underweighted because such leaders often tend to be creative strategists who can take risky challenges to suffice the self-ego and leave behind a legacy as well. This commentary intends to portray the complex mosaic of the positive and negative consequences inbred in a narcissistic leader. The debate over whether these people provide a net gain or loss remains everlasting because it varies based on the organizational climate and also other contextual factors. </p>
