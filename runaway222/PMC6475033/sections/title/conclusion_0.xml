 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is not uncanny for any person to be concerned with the negative impacts when narcissists gain leadership positions. In the face of current hypercompetitive environments, encountering narcissism is almost inevitable. We need to perceive both positive and negative senses of narcissism and the main aim of this article is to provide a nuanced view related to this. The current state of awareness regarding the outcomes of narcissism at various levels is scarce and further empirical reviews are warranted to inspire fruitful theory building and interventions. More than individual awareness, organizations need to know better about these impacts because narcissistic leaders on one hand, can self-destroy and lead their workplace terribly astray. On the other hand, a controlled narcissist can yield the sweetest results to the place where he belongs to. </p>
