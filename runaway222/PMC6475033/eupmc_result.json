    "Narcissism, being the critical part of the toxic leadership paradigm, has its own impact in the education sphere. Contrastingly, leader's narcissism cannot be simply underweighted because such leaders often tend to be creative strategists who can take risky challenges to suffice the self-ego and leave behind a legacy as well. This commentary intends to portray the complex mosaic of the positive and negative consequences inbred in a narcissistic leader. The debate over whether these people provide a net gain or loss remains everlasting because it varies based on the organizational climate and also other contextual factors."
