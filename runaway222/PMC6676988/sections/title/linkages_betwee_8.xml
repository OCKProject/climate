 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main motivation for future action in disaster preparedness and mitigation is dependent on 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> information received. The information disseminated to households, observed information, information density and information content are thus key factors that directly or indirectly increase household action-taking in disaster preparedness and mitigation (Dennis et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0020">2011</a>). This increases discussion, perceived effectiveness or efficacy of recommended mitigation or preparedness actions. Though no single generic view of risk communication suffices (Wardman 
  <a rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0084">2008</a>), risk communication is generally defined as the process of disseminating information among interested parties about the nature, magnitude, significance and control of the risk (Covello 
  <a rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0016">1992</a>), dialogue between communication and stakeholders (Palenchar &amp; Heath 
  <a rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0057">2007</a>) and ongoing risk monitoring (Coombs 
  <a rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0015">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Risk communication action raises people’s awareness about given risks, enabling them to be party to individual and collective risk decision-making (Rogers 
  <a rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0065">2004</a>; Stirling 
  <a rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0076">2005</a>). Risk communication plays an integral role in shaping individual risk perceptions as well as risk aversion or reduction behaviours. Risk communication is also a crucial element in risk management processes, as it enables actors to recognise and understand risks, identify their roles and jointly engage in monitoring, reduction, mitigation and recovery efforts (Sato 
  <a rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0069">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As risk communication focuses on the characteristics that impact risk perception and behaviour, it can be appraised through elicitation of the degree of dread associated with a particular risk and the public’s familiarity with the risk (Slovic 
  <a rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0074">2000</a>). Hence, engaging the public in risk appraisal facilitates the correction and adjustment of people’s dispositions and risk behaviour (Stirling 
  <a rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0076">2005</a>). Familiarity and the corresponding dread is used in categorisation of risks into routine, uncertain and controversial risks, respectively (Covello 
  <a rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0016">1992</a>). In this categorisation, the less understood risks are referred to as uncertain risks. Risks that require discussion on values, lifestyles and world views are referred to as controversial risks. Ecological degradation risks could be classified as uncertain risks. In this article, the risk categories are conceptualised on routine-controversial-uncertainty risk continuum.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The risk message model, the risk dialogue model, governability risk model and risk field communication model have been explored in detail by Wardman (
  <a rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0084">2008</a>). The risk message model is about one-way provision of information about the nature of risks (Jaeger &amp; Renn 
  <a rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0038">2001</a>). In the risk message model, it is assumed that people communicate to convey information which may be used by others to enhance their understanding about a given risk. The model focuses on providing or disseminating information about risks which does not necessarily lead to greater understanding (Wardman 
  <a rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0084">2008</a>). Further, it does not consider the effect of complex social networks on expectations, commitment and understanding and co-construction of risk messages and meanings (Jaeger et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0038">2001</a>; Horlick-Jones 
  <a rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0035">2008</a>). The mechanistic nature of risk message model (sender–receiver model without engagement or interaction) limits participation thus excluding knowledge from risk message recipients. Such asymmetry reduces the likelihood of the recipient accepting or adopting a particular risk proposition or viewpoints advanced by the experts (O’Neill 
  <a rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0054">2002</a>). In addressing such drawbacks, risk dialogue, risk governability and risk field model have been suggested.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Risk dialogue model seeks to promote participation and inter-subjectivity with an objective of overcoming linearity weaknesses associated with risk message model (Jovchelovitch 
  <a rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0039">2007</a>). Hence, it utilises a two-way communication model to incorporate interests of all actors involved in a particular risk issue. Under the model, the actors are regarded equally and treated like partners. The approach nurtures responsibility and allows for debates as well as collaborative interaction in risk management (Fischhoff 
  <a rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0030">2005</a>). The inter-subjective understanding of risk allows for consensus building between citizens (Jovchelovitch 
  <a rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0039">2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The risk field model considers agency in terms of the strategic conduct and interests of competing social actors (Wardman 
  <a rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0084">2008</a>). This is in an attempt to secure legitimacy and enhance trust in risk management and regulatory governance (Pidgeon &amp; Rogers-Hayden 
  <a rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0059">2007</a>). Risk governance model includes interventions that empower individual capacities for self-control, shaping actors and their own sense of self- and self-interest in managing particular risks (Rose 
  <a rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0067">2003</a>). It interrogates how rules that govern the field of possible activity are structured and bear upon the dispositions and behaviour of those concerned. In principle, it focuses on how education and policy discourses can be utilised to mobilise and influence risk dispositions and behaviour of individuals and the transfer of the agency of environmental and health risks control and enforcement from the state to an individual (Rose 
  <a rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0067">2003</a>). As communication for development focuses on use of communication processes, methods and tools to empower people to advance towards full awareness of their situations and their options for change (FAO 
  <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">2010b</a>), its role is significant in the mitigation of environmental externalities associated with adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though risk communication can be used in creating awareness about risks, it has some drawbacks, such as linearity that renders them ineffective (Evans et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0025">2018</a>; Servaes &amp; Lie 
  <a rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0072">2013</a>). As the communication for development is concerned with re-engineering diffusion research into a process of innovation, identifying the problem, stakeholder mapping, stakeholder engagement, critical evaluations and reviews as well as addressing the social costs in a participatory manner are some of the prerequisites in re-engineering the process (Leeuwis 
  <a rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0046">2004</a>). We argue that communication for development lenses can be utilised in enhancing the robustness and utility of risk communication in adaptation planning.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The four main elements in the innovation-diffusion model (Rogers 
  <a rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0065">2004</a>) are new ideas or the innovation (in this article adaptation measures and correlated environmental risks), communication channels, time and the social system. Diffusion is facilitated through a communication process by which participants’ access and share information with one another to reach a mutual understanding, form attitudes and implement the idea. Forming attitudes towards an innovation is a mental process in the decision-making and implementation process (Rogers et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0066">2007</a>). Disposition about ecological risks, risk behaviour outcomes and agency are thus akin to innovation-diffusion process. Risk communication can thus enhance adoption of positive risk behaviour and technology in the abatement of environmental and health risks (Rogers 
  <a rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0065">2004</a>).
