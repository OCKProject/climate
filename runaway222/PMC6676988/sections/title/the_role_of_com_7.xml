 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most attractive adaptation measures are those that offer benefits in the near future as well as reduce vulnerabilities in the long-term (Mimura et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0049">2014</a>). Hence, adaptation to climate change requires supportive policy environment and support systems for resilience building. A supportive environment includes policies that improve access to quality services, leadership that promotes social and behavioural change among members of society, allocation of resources for social and behavioural change, community contribution to the implementation of solutions in general and support of individuals’ own behavioural change (FAO 
  <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">2010b</a>). This considers the interaction of individuals’ knowledge and behaviour on social change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participation, a central tenet in development planning discourses, refers to the inclusion of those who are affected or who can affect a decision (Hobley 
  <a rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0034">1996</a>). Rowe and Frewer (
  <a rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0068">2000</a>) conceptualise participation from a two-way flow of communication in terms of information dissemination to passive participants and gathering information from participants. The rationale for participation in natural resources management, however, is largely informed by local resistance to state control of natural resources and need to address tragedy of the commons arguments (Bixler et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0010">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several authors (EEA 
  <a rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0023">2014</a>; Arnstein 
  <a rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0004">1969</a>) have reviewed broad spectrum of forms of public participation. According to some of the findings (Chambers 
  <a rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0013">1994</a>; Scoones 
  <a rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0071">1998</a>), participation improves the quality of decision-making process and improves use of available information and creativity in the society. Moreover, participation improves public understanding of the management issues at stake, enhances transparency in decision-making and might stimulate better coordination, monitoring and evaluation among government agencies. Participation increases better understanding, dialogue, out of thinking discipline, nuanced focus on relevant problems that confront the real drivers of change and formulation of strategy and policy (Mostert et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0052">2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Empowerment refers to the capacity of people to make effective choices, envision alternatives, participate in decision-making, negotiate with influence, control and hold accountable institutions that affect their lives and livelihoods (World Bank 
  <a rid="CIT0086" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0086">2007</a>). Accordingly, empowerment is central to community-based disaster risk reduction and resilience planning initiatives (UNISDR 
  <a rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0081">2015</a>) with communication being at the core of empowerment, participation and nurturing collective responsibility in climate change decision-making processes (Evans et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0025">2018</a>; Servaes &amp; Lie 
  <a rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0072">2013</a>). The underlying philosophy in communication for development is built around the principle of empowerment in the identification of problems, development of solutions and implementation strategies, monitoring and evaluation (FAO 
  <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">2010b</a>). This includes use of communication in extension education and research as a tool for improving productivity, incomes, welfare and sustainable natural resources management outcomes among farmers. For example, a democratic participatory approach that incorporates the interests, capacities and cultural identity of local communities at all levels has the potential to unpack the limitations of traditional media in empowering the community (Servaes &amp; Lie 
  <a rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0072">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Communication for development is defined as planned use of strategies and processes of communication in achieving development and behaviour change (Srampickal 
  <a rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0075">2006</a>). The three basic components of communication for development are advocacy, social mobilisation and behavioural change (or behavioural development) communication. The other components include participatory communication and communication for structural and sustainable social change (Servaes &amp; Lie 
  <a rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0072">2013</a>). Effective communication relies on the synergistic use of the three strategic components (UNICEF 
  <a rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0080">2008</a>). Advocacy informs and motivates leadership to create a supportive environment to achieve programme objectives and the related development goals. In essence, the advocacy component is aimed at changing policies, allocating resources, public dialogue and conversation on critical issues. Climate change action and sustainable development agenda are some of the cross-scalar issues.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Advocacy, sustained publicity and education can converge value systems to reduce gaps in knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (FAO 
  <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">2010b</a>) as well as translate existing adaptive capacities into adaptation actions that reduce vulnerability (Mimura et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0049">2014</a>). The backbone of advocacy whether national or at the local level comes from a combination of data analysis and community input (UNICEF 
  <a rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0080">2008</a>). Possible results of an advocacy intervention can be targeted at leaders taking actions, such as legal reform, or enactment of new law(s), or rules, policy decisions, formulation of and/or reform, administrative directives resource mobilisation and financial allocation. In addition, the advocacy component can build the capacity of leaders to become advocates themselves and speak out on issues pertinent on funding priorities, policy change and addressing social barriers.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social mobilisation engages and supports participation of institutions, community networks, social/civic and religious groups to raise demand for or sustain progress towards a development objective by strengthening participation in activities at the grassroots level (UNICEF 
  <a rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0080">2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The backbone of developing the social mobilisation component of a communication strategy comes from a combination of data, participant and behavioural analyses (FAO 
  <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">2010b</a>; UNICEF 
  <a rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0080">2008</a>), as well as community input. Behaviour change communication involves face-to-face dialogue with individuals or groups to inform, motivate, problem-solve or plan with the objective of promoting and sustaining change (UNICEF 
  <a rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0080">2008</a>). In agricultural extension and adoption of technologies, sustaining the change implies attaining a critical mass of adopters of a given desirable action (Rogers 
  <a rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0065">2004</a>), in this case ecological sustainability or package of technology that mediates ecological sustainability. According to public engagement conceptual framework (Devine-Wright 
  <a rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0021">2011</a>), effective communication encompasses the understanding of community’s attitudes and believes. The integration of beliefs and attitudes, and the processes used in the assessment of economic, social and environmental dimensions or substantive sustainability, and procedural sustainability is thus relevant (Del Rio &amp; Burguillo 
  <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">South Africa and Kenya are classical examples of countries whose agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to changing rainfall patterns. For instance, the area under irrigation as a result of increase in temperature and evaporation in South Africa is projected to increase by 4% – 6% in the interior hydrological zone and 15% – 30% under the hotter and drier hydrological scenarios (DEA 
  <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">2013</a>). In Kenya, irrigation is recognised as a critical pillar in food security. Of critical importance is that most of the land mass in South Africa and Kenya is located in arid and semi-arid regions. The two countries represent good case studies of potential salinisation risks in climate change action. The possibility of salinisation risks in adaptation to increasing frequency of extreme weather events such as drought in a number of countries, such as Kenya and South Africa, provides an example envisaged by Asghar et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2005</a>) where environmental impacts have the potential to increase the severity of disasters and the need for integrative use of analytical lenses that encompass the precautionary principle, disaster risk reduction and risk communication. The above analyses demonstrate the centrality of development for communication strategies in disaster risk reduction.
