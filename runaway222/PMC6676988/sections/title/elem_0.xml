 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Combating climate change is one of the critical goals under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda. This is on account that several of the targets under the climate change action overlap and impinge targets envisioned under other SDGs in itself a social policy dilemma. The overlapping targets include the need to consider environmental impacts and sustainability outcomes on land and land-based resources, ecosystems and biodiversity as well as agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers. Transforming the socio-ecological systems towards sustainability is thus critical. While risk communication has successfully been applied in emergency management, especially the crisis phase, little of the concept has been adapted in natural resource management. Using the case of smallholder farmer adaptation to climate change, this article explores how risk communication can resolve cognitive failure among multiple actors in climate change action in the context of adaptation mitigation-sustainable development frameworks. Combined with communication for development approaches, risk-communication-mediated pathways have the potential to enhance risk assessment and development of multi-hazard early-warning systems in climate change action. In this regard, risk communication offers a seamless support system for the integration of the precautionary and disaster risk reduction principles in the pursuit of sustainable development agenda.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change and weather variability are among the biggest challenges to human development as they present a combination of risks that negatively impact on human health, global food security, economic development and the natural environment on which much of the human livelihoods depends (Zakarya et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0087" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0087">2015</a>). Accordingly, combating climate change and its impacts are at the core of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda (UN 
  <a rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0078">2015</a>). This is on account that several of the targets under climate change action overlap and impinge other SDGs. Risk reduction is thus advocated in addressing disaster risk drivers, such as poor land management, unsustainable use of natural resources and declining ecosystems, in climate change action and pursuit of SDGs (UNISDR 
  <a rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0081">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pillars of sustainable development are anchored on economic, social and ecological dimensions (Kates, Parris &amp; Leiserowitz 2016). Exploring socio-ecological linkages in sustainable development is particularly critical with the rising need for inclusion of climate-related targets in SDGs and a more climate-oriented set of indicators as part of systems for sustainable development and environmental quality (Opschoor &amp; Banuri 
  <a rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0056">2007</a>). Such reality creates the need to reassess traditional policy instruments in terms of their adaptability to better reflect climate-related externalities of production and consumption. In this regard, a multi-hazard and multi-sectoral approach is envisaged in fostering people centred collaborative partnerships, mechanisms and institutions for implementation of instruments relevant to building resilient socio-ecological systems. This includes the sustainable management of natural resources (UNISDR 
  <a rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0081">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though sustainable development thinking has benefitted immensely from a number of conceptual frameworks such as the nexus model (FAO 
  <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">2014</a>) and environment-livelihood sustainability (Biggs et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0009">2015</a>) models, existence of autonomous adaptation and maladaptation (Adger, Arnell &amp; Tompkins 
  <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">2005</a>; Barnett &amp; O’Neill 
  <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">2010</a>; FAO 
  <a rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0027">2010a</a>) and attendant ecological risks suggest failure by policy makers, farmers and community of practice to recognise the underlying drivers of risks in adaptation planning. Maladaptation occurs when adaptation action or investment taken to avoid or reduce climate change impacts increases vulnerability to other risks that impact adversely on, or increases the vulnerability of other systems, sectors or social groups (Barnett &amp; O’Neill 
  <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">2010</a>). Maladaptation thus imposes negative externalities on third parties and ecosystems. Accordingly, meaningful integration against maladaptation is a challenging task in adaptation planning (Mimura et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0049">2014</a>). An externality is present when the production or consumption activities of one economic agent have direct, non-price-mediated effects on the production or consumption activities of another economic agent (Coase 
  <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">1960</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The utility of any integrative model in a dynamic socio-ecological environment to a great extend depends on its visibility and coherence (Lang &amp; Rayner 
  <a rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0045">2012</a>). Accordingly, in an attempt to bridge the gap between science and policy, increased attention on transdisciplinary paradigm and its variants have been advocated (Lang et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0044">2012</a>). However, most of the existing transdisciplinary models are short in addressing cognitive failure. Though existing models, such as the nexus model, identifies relationships and interdependencies in environmental resource management, it fails to explain how risk and behaviour, compromise and negotiation can be achieved in creating interdependencies at planning and policy phases (Biggs et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0009">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mitigation of disasters requires active public participation and strong political mobilisation, which may be achieved through assessment of community perceptions, experiences and responses to disasters (Wisner, Blaikie &amp; Davis 
  <a rid="CIT0085" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0085">2004</a>). Implicit in participation is multiplicity of actors with the tendency to generate coordination failures (DEA 
  <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">2013</a>). This calls for innovative social-political-ecological and legal processes, adjustment of institutional capacities and processes especially in relation to deliberations about risk appraisal (Stirling 
  <a rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0076">2005</a>). As the extent to which opinions and interests of stakeholders are taken into account are important in sustainability discourses (Del Rio &amp; Burguillo 
  <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">2009</a>), we attempt to explore how cognitive dissonance of various actors, such as farmers, extension workers and policy makers in adaptation planning, can be addressed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate Change communication can be an effective and sustainable means to mainstreaming of climate change into development policies, mitigation and adaptation polices, collective behavioural change and specifically positive attitudes towards climate change mitigation (Evans, Dyll &amp; Teer-tomaselli 
  <a rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0025">2018</a>). Incorporating participatory communication and communication for structural and sustainable social change at different levels of society have been found to be critical in adaptation processes, climate change and environmental communication, as well as natural resource management (Servaes &amp; Lie 
  <a rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0072">2013</a>). Communication media and communication for development approaches are thus recognised as critical platforms for engagement and empowerment in social and structural change such as those concerning adaptation and mitigation of climate change risks (Evans et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0025">2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dissemination of information or successful risk communication increases people’s knowledge and motivates the public and households to prepare and mitigate disasters (Dennis et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0020">2011</a>). Though risk communication has potential in the raising awareness about environmental and health risks, it has several limitations. Such limitations include risk of information overload (O’Neill 
  <a rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0054">2002</a>) and a high likelihood of targeted people failing to pay attention (Renn 
  <a rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0064">2006</a>). Further, the linearity in the coding, transmission and decoding can lead to substantial disengagement and the generation of meaning of the disseminated risk messages, distortion and redundancy (Jaeger &amp; Renn 
  <a rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0038">2001</a>). The utility of risk communication in the construction of collective knowledge and attitudes towards climate change, a long-term sustained crisis, is thus debatable (Servaes &amp; Lie 
  <a rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0072">2013</a>). Linearity or one-way communication is a form of passive participation that limits the extent to which a community or individuals can influence a programme (Arnstein 
  <a rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0004">1969</a>; Evans et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0025">2018</a>; Servaes &amp; Lie 
  <a rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0072">2013</a>). One-way communication depresses learning and alienates intended recipients of communication (Fischhoff 
  <a rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0030">2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this article, we explore how the weakness in risk communication can be resolved and subsequently harnessed in the development of a ‘software’ for mitigation of maladaptation risks. In doing so, we draw on the concept of integrated structural and participatory model for climate change communication (Evans et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0025">2018</a>) to suggest a robust risk communication approach that can be adopted to promote sustainability in adaptation planning. Following the participatory model for climate change communication (SPCCC) model, we posit that integration of risk communication with communication for development approaches can reduce the risk of maladaptation and contribute to resilience building at community level. Though media, local culture, empowerment, agency and communication are critical in sustainable development (Servaes &amp; Lie 
  <a rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0072">2013</a>; Evans et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0025">2018</a>), the scope of this article does not cover the diversity of communication media.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The central contribution of this conceptual article is a robust participatory communication framework that integrates risk communication and communication for development in the assessment of the nature, magnitude and significance of environmental risks, as well as the control, monitoring and evaluation of existing and underlying maladaptation risks in climate change action. By incorporating knowledge, attitudes and behaviour and addressing linearity weaknesses associated with risk communication, the model provides the basis for a holistic approach in the design and integration of multi-hazard early-warning systems into climate change adaptation planning.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The review context</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation to climate change is reflected in social, ecological and economic changes that mitigate the adverse impacts and take advantage of arising opportunities (Easterling et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">2007</a>). Adaptation to climate risks involves technical measures and modifications to farm practices with respect to climatic and non-climatic stimuli and conditions (Wall, Smit &amp; Wandel 
   <a rid="CIT0083" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0083">2004</a>). Irrigation or the artificial application of water to supplement or compliment the available moisture for plant growth in response to prolonged dry spells, erratic rains or poorly distributed rains is one of the most common adaptation measures in agriculture. However, adaptation may or may not succeed in moderating harm or exploiting beneficial opportunities because system transformations are more challenging than planning or implementing immediate measures to cope with a climate-driven disaster (Moser &amp; Ekstrom 
   <a rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0051">2010</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consideration for behavioural dynamics in the transformative processes is integral to social learning and sustainability agenda (Pelling 
   <a rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0058">2011</a>). Transformational agenda seeks to address the root cause of vulnerability by introducing fundamental changes to attributes of a system (Eriksen, Nightingale &amp; Eakin 
   <a rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0024">2015</a>). Rethinking and reframing of policy and practice, engaging multiple knowledges as well as questioning subjectivities inherent in discourses and problem understanding are critical in pursuit of transformational agenda (Eriksen et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0024">2015</a>). Such analytical frameworks are inclusive of individual, community, state and non-state actors’ interests, aspirations and interactions. Building upon the foregoing argument, the rising need for resilience building to climate-related hazards (UN 
   <a rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0078">2015</a>), the importance of identifying underlying risk factors in risk reduction initiatives (UNISDR 
   <a rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0081">2015</a>) and the centrality of strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation advocated under comprehensive conceptual model for disaster management (Asghar, Alahakoon &amp; Churilov 
   <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2005</a>), we explore some concepts in disaster risk reduction in the next section.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Disaster risk management involves strategic planning (Asghar et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2005</a>), administrative decisions and operational activities in the prevention, response, recovery, mitigation and early-warning for disasters (Satya 
   <a rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0070">2010</a>). Though the administrative activities are cross-cutting and a shared responsibility among various actors, the administrative decisions in agriculture are largely policy related while operational activities are largely farmer dependent. Risk reduction and resilience building at community level require analytical and conceptual lenses that unbundle cognitive biases and failures as well as integrate and transform individual and collective agency (Volenzo &amp; Odiyo 
   <a rid="CIT0082" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0082">2018</a>). In farmers’ use of irrigation as an adaptative measure to climate change, the critical question is on how to transform communities and individuals to collectively internalise the salinisation risks.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The crunch-release model (Blaikie et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">1994</a>) is a broad analytical framework on the causes of a disaster and disaster mitigation. The model espouses factors influencing vulnerability to a disaster by considering trigger events, elements at risk of damage or loss and vulnerable conditions both socio-ecological and physical, against actions that address underlying causes to achieve safe conditions or resilience. Developmental advocacy, policy and legislative actions, risk assessments, multi-hazards early-warning systems, public awareness and education and training (Satya 
   <a rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0070">2010</a>) are among the disaster prevention and mitigation actions suggested in the model.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Disaster risk reduction is underscored as an overarching pillar for attainment of SDGs (UN 
   <a rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0078">2015</a>). Accordingly, there is need for improved understanding of disaster risks in all its dimensions of exposure, vulnerability, hazard characteristics, strengthening of disaster risk governance for prevention, mitigation, preparedness, recovery and rehabilitation. Though precautionary principle is a tool of choice for disaster risk reduction concerning health and environmental threats in an environment of scientific uncertainty, there is paucity of appropriate frameworks for integrating implementation and decision-making support processes in the application of the principle (Fisher, Jones &amp; von Schomberg 
   <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">2006</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the natural resource management technologies, such as irrigation, have both larger spatial scales and longer time horizon impacts or externalities (Knox, Meinzen-dick &amp; Hazell 
   <a rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0042">1998</a>). Failure to recognise and/or discount such threats constitutes cognitive failure and imposes long-term social costs on society (Coase 
   <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">1960</a>). The socio-ecological dilemma is rooted in isolation paradox (Baumol 
   <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">2004</a>) and free rider (Hardin 
   <a rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0032">1968</a>) analogies. This is particularly critical in planning adaptation to climate change because existence of strong environmental and conservation polices and legislation in many countries does not necessarily imply effective implementation and enforcement (Shivakoti, Ullah &amp; Pradhan 
   <a rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0073">2016</a>). Designing cost-effective collective action strategies required for abatement of environmental externalities inherent in climate change action is thus a development planning challenge.
