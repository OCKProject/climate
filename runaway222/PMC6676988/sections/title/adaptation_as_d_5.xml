 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is the change in the state of climate whether because of natural variability or as a result of human activity that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for extended period, typically decades or longer (IPCC 
  <a rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0036">2007</a>). Evidence of climate change includes changes in patterns of temperature and precipitation, irregular and un-predictable rainfall, intense downpours, rising temperature and generally increase in frequency of extreme and harsh weather such as droughts (IPCC 
  <a rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0037">2014</a>). In realisation of the negative impacts of climate change, urgent action to combat climate change through adaptation has been proposed (UN 
  <a rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0078">2015</a>). Accordingly, adaptation is a key factor that influences the future severity of climate change impacts (Easterling et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">2007</a>). Adaptation to climate change takes place through adjustments to reduce vulnerability or enhance resilience in response to observed or expected changes in climate and associated extreme weather events. It involves changes in social and environmental processes, perceptions of climate risk, practices and functions to reduce potential damages or to realise new opportunities. Adaptation includes anticipatory and reactive actions (Adger et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0001">2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maladaptation is underlying risk in climate change action (Adger et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">2005</a>; Barnett &amp; O’Neill 
  <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">2010</a>; FAO 
  <a rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0027">2010a</a>). Hence, there is a need to investigate policies, plans and programmes in terms of risks and opportunities critical in sustainable development agenda. Underlying risks refer generally to the socio-economic and environmental factors that are the primary causes of a disaster. Individual and societal stocks of knowledge, attitudes, skills and the consequent risk behaviour are among the key factors that influence vulnerability (Satya 
  <a rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0070">2010</a>). Nuanced against the urgency for adaptation action in an environment of cognitive failure, the critical question is on who has the power to act or the ‘agency’ in safeguarding public good (interests). To answer the question requires an understanding of how hazards (trigger events), vulnerability and capacity interact. Models for such analysis are provided by Mimura et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0049">2014</a>) and Turner et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0077">2003</a>). In the current article, we contextualise the risks of salinisation from irrigation among small-scale farmers.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Salinisation is a major impediment in many arid and semi-arid regions of the world (Qadir, Qureshi &amp; Cheraghi 
  <a rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0060">2007</a>). The global extent of primary salt-affected soils is about 955 million hectares (ha), while secondary salinisation affects some 77m ha, with 58% of these in irrigated areas. Salinisation is attributed to irrigation of unsuitable soils or use of poor-quality irrigation water.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, of the 34m ha of land under cultivation in Iran, 4.1 million ha is affected by salinisation. This represents $1 billion in annual economic losses (Qadir et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0060">2007</a>). The need for increase in area under irrigation in adaptation to and mitigation of adverse climate change impacts on food and forage production and thus presents a serious challenge to sustainability of irrigated production systems. This calls for risk reduction initiatives.
