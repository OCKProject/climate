 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kelp forests are some of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world and support primary productivity comparable to that of tropical rain forests

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. However, these marine forests are under threat due to anthropogenic environmental degradation driven by climate change and local stressors such as eutrophication

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Understanding the primary drivers of kelp decline and the functioning of novel anthropogenic ecosystems that replace kelp forests is of critical importance to management and conservation of marine resources
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Here, we documented a substantial decline of kelp abundance at sites at the southernmost extent of kelp forests in the Northwest Atlantic, with order of magnitude decreases in kelp biomass and density in 2017–2018 as compared to baseline data collected in the 1980s. Contemporary biomass values at or near zero are well outside expected natural intra- or interannual variability of 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> populations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, suggesting we are observing the loss of kelp forests from this region. Furthermore, we found that once-dominant kelp was replaced by turf-forming macroalgal species, contributing to a global pattern of kelp loss followed by the “rise” of turfs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The loss of kelp forests at sites in Narragansett Bay is consistent with a multidecadal increase in sea surface temperature above a threshold for survival of 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> sporophytes and resting-stage gametophytes. This pattern of kelp loss occurred despite a significant decrease in local nutrient loads over the study period. A decrease in ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate concentrations in Narragansett Bay from 1972 to the present is best explained by passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, which reduced the discharge of pollutants into United States watersheds (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act</span>). This finding indicates a success story for local water management, but with the important implication that local management cannot necessarily protect marine ecosystems against degradation in the face of global climate change. Given current trends in sea temperatures, we predict the continual decline and absence of kelp at the southern extent in the Northwest Atlantic. Thus, despite optimistic forecasts that warm-adapted kelp populations should be the most resilient to climate change impacts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>, these 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> populations likely do not have the adaptive capacity to respond to warming sea temperatures at current rates under global climate change. Our findings are consistent, rather, with predictions that distributions of marine species at their upper thermal physiological range limits will contract poleward
  <span class="sup">

  </span>.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Turf-forming macroalgal species identified as part of our study ranged two phyla (Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta) with diverse evolutionary histories and growth forms (e.g., plumose, filamentous, and finely and coarsely branching), indicating the complex nature of the novel turf-dominated ecosystem. Turf communities are generally comprised of opportunistic, “weedy” species with high tolerance to stress; however no overarching definition of “turf” has been established
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. Indeed, many studies examining shifts from kelp to turf dominance do not characterize the composition or structure of the turf community outside of general descriptions such as “filamentous” turfs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> or “fast-growing” turfs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. This exemplifies the extent to which we understand very little about the ecological functioning of these communities, limiting the ability of researchers to generalize their findings across globally disparate turf-dominated ecosystems.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feedback mechanisms that stabilize the turf-dominated ecosystem may increase the resilience of the ecosystem to a reverse shift back towards kelp dominance, and may indicate the presence of alternative stable states
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. While we cannot directly test for hysteresis in our dataset, as kelp forests and turf reefs occur under separate environmental conditions of sea temperature, we did identify feedback mechanisms that may stabilize the turf-dominated ecosystem. The presence of such mechanisms suggests that if sea temperature trends were to reverse, the turf-dominated ecosystem could persist beyond the point at which an initial regime shift to turf occurred. We determined that space preemption by turfs results in kelp sporophytes attaching to turf rather than rocky substratum. The turf-attached kelp had lower survival as compared to rock-attached kelp, likely due to significantly weaker attachment strength. Dislodgement of kelp likely occurred during two strong wave events (&gt;3 m significant wave heights) on 17 and 26 April 2018 (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). This interpretation is consistent with the findings of Burek 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>), who observed lower survival of turf-attached as compared to rock-attached kelp transplanted from wave-protected to exposed sites in Nova Scotia, Canada, and who suggest that this creates a feedback mechanism that stabilizes the turf-dominated ecosystem.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Turf-attached kelp allocate significantly more biomass to the holdfast and have significantly more complex holdfasts than rock-attached kelp
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. We observed reduced growth rates of turf-attached kelp, which may represent a trade-off in resource allocation from blade growth to holdfast development and extension of haptera to strengthen attachment on a suboptimal substrate. Slower growth of turf-attached as compared to rock-attached kelp may act to limit the reproductive output of kelp in turf-dominated ecosystems, as the size of the sorus will be constrained by blade size
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. Thus, in combination, increased mortality of turf-attached kelp due to dislodgement, and slower growth of turf-attached individuals should create a feedback loop that stabilizes the turf-dominated ecosystem and limits the reestablishment of kelp.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean growth rate of rock-attached kelp in our study (1.2 cm d
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) was similar to that observed in the early 1980s by Brady-Campbell 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>). This result suggests that individual-based productivity rates for rock-attached kelp have not changed over an ~40-year period. However, given that approximately half of the kelp were attached to turf and had significantly slower mean growth rates (0.9 cm d
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), and kelp biomass also was much lower in 2017 and 2018, population-scale kelp productivity likely has substantially declined. Kelp have a potentially important role in mitigating climate change through the sequestration and storage of carbon that is transported to deep ocean regions as macroalgal detritus
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. Thus, loss of kelp productivity could act as a positive feedback for climate warming.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent study in the Gulf of Maine demonstrated 150 times greater 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> density at offshore sites (Caches Ledge) than coastal sites, despite thermal stress of kelp in both regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. No information currently exists for offshore kelp forests at the southern limit of 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> in the Northwest Atlantic. Future research should therefore be focused on determining whether a localized community shift to turf observed on reefs in Narragansett Bay is a region-wide phenomenon, and should investigate management strategies to prevent or reverse the disappearance of kelp forests. In addition to curbing global climate change, local management strategies that involve the removal of turfs to open up space for kelp recruitment should be considered given the ecological feedbacks associated with recruiting to turf documented here. The purple sea urchin 
  <span class="italic">Arbacia punctulata</span> has the ability to clear small patches in the algal turf and create bare space (authors’ pers. obs.). Interactions between algal turfs, kelp, and grazers on these reefs therefore warrant investigation. Grazing by sea urchins could destabilize a turf-dominated ecosystem if grazed patches are colonized by kelp propagules that survive to reproductive maturity.
