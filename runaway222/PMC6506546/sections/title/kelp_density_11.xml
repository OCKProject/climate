 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compared kelp density at Fort Wetherill in 2017–18 to baseline data collected in 1980–81 by Brady-Campbell 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>). To measure the density of kelp, divers counted kelp in belt transects at 2 to 6 m depth (n = 2–3 transects) on 1 Dec 2017, 20 Dec 2017, 9 Feb 2018, and 23 Mar 2018, and in quadrats placed randomly at 2 to 6 m depth (n = 20 1-m
  <span class="sup">2</span> quadrats) on 20 Jun and 30 Nov 2018. Belt transects were used on the earlier dates due to very low (near zero) kelp density, which required a large sampling area to minimize zero values. On each sampling date, divers counted and measured the blade lengths of all kelp encountered within the belt transects or quadrats. Blade lengths were used to produce size-frequency distributions. The width of the transect was 2 m, but the length varied throughout the season (ranging from 3 to 30 m) to accommodate changing kelp density, with larger transects used on lower density dates. The total number of individuals observed on each sampling date ranged from 48 to 139. Transects and quadrats were pooled to determine overall density. In all density surveys conducted at Fort Wetherill, only a single individual of 
  <span class="italic">L. digitata</span> was observed (20 Dec 2017).

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed both a winter and spring recruitment pulse of 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> at Fort Wetherill (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). In early December 2017, all kelp observed along belt transects were &lt;70 cm in blade length, indicating recently recruited individuals. By March 2018 individuals with blade lengths up to 180 cm were observed, indicating somatic growth of winter recruits. A second pulse of recruits with blade lengths &lt;70 cm was observed during sampling in June 2018 (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Individuals with blade lengths &gt;70 cm were rare on 20 Jun (7 out of a total of 139 individuals observed), indicating low survival of the winter recruits.
