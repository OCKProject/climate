 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rocky reefs at both sites were dominated by turf-forming algae in summer 2018; mean percent areal cover of turf was 91.9 ± 3.3 and 64.2 ± 7.9% (±SE) at Land’s End and Fort Wetherill, respectively. By contrast, in summer 1990, the rocky substratum in the vicinity of Fort Wetherill and Land’s End was dominated (&gt;50%) by 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. A third site sampled (Bass Rock Road) had a baseline kelp percent cover of ~80–100% in the mid 1990s (S. Grace pers. obs.) and had percent cover of turf of 94.1 ± 2.6% in summer 2018. The turf assemblage sampled at Fort Wetherill on 3 dates from winter 2017 to spring 2018 consisted of 8 species of red and green macroalgae (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Based on wet weight measurements, the turf assemblage was dominated by a single species, 
  <span class="italic">Phyllophora pseudoceranoides</span> (mean ± SE: 78 ± 6%, n = 3 dates), with 
  <span class="italic">Polysiphonia</span> spp. and 
  <span class="italic">Gracilaria</span> spp. also appearing quite common and accounting for 11 ± 4% and 6 ± 3% of wet weight, respectively (Fig.
