 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At Fort Wetherill from winter 2017 to spring 2018 we observed that on average 45 ± 11% of kelp were attached to turf-forming macroalgae (±SD, n = 4 sampling dates). 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> attached to turf required significantly (2 to 4 times) less force to remove from the substratum as compared to 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> attached to rock (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>, Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> attached to turf allocated a significantly greater percentage of the thallus biomass to the holdfast as compared to 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> attached to rock (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7A</a>, Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Kelp attached to turf also had significantly more complex holdfasts, with greater total bifurcations of the haptera within the holdfast as compared to kelp attached to rock (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7B</a>, Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). Moreover, kelp attached to turf at 2 depths (2 and 6 m) had significantly slower 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> growth rates as compared to kelp attached to rock (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>, Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>). Percent survival (retention) also was lower for tagged turf-attached kelp (61%) and as compared to tagged rock-attached kelp (81%) over 35 days for the 2 depths combined.
