  </span>. For consistency with the methodology of historical measurements, kelp biomass was measured in June/July at 2 m depth (season and depth of greatest historical kelp density) within n = 6 randomly placed quadrats at each site. While Brady-Campbell 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>) sampled 0.1 m
  <span class="sup">2</span> quadrats, kelp biomass was measured within 0.25 to 1 m
  <span class="sup">2</span> quadrats in our study to minimize zero values at low kelp abundance. For biomass measurements, the wet weight of blotted-dry kelp, destructively sampled from each quadrat, was determined to the nearest 0.01 g with a spring scale to give an estimate of kelp fresh biomass in units of g m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>. Given that Brady-Campbell

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>) report their data as dry weight of kelp, for comparison, we converted their measurements to wet weight with the formula for conversion of dry weight (DW) to fresh weight (FW) of
