 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Globally, forests of kelp and other habitat-forming brown seaweeds have been replaced by mats of low-lying turf-forming algae, representing a loss of ecosystem structure and biodiversity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Declines of habitat-forming kelps in disparate regions over the past 3 decades have been linked to a range of stressors, with ocean warming and eutrophication being the most commonly identified environmental drivers
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. However, despite localized kelp declines, there is no unifying global pattern of kelp change, with some populations remaining unchanged and others expanding over the past half century
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Based on studies at early life-history stages, it is predicted that warm-adapted kelp populations existing at the equatorial range limits of species distributions may be the most resilient to climate change and most likely to persist into the future
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. Longitudinal field observations at the range limits of kelp species are required to test this hypothesis.
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Where regime shifts from kelp to turf dominance have occurred, various feedback mechanisms may stabilize the turf-dominated ecosystem state contributing to its temporal persistence
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Such feedbacks include high sediment loads, kelp spore limitation, and space limitation on turf reefs, which prevent recruitment and reestablishment of kelps
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. However, in general, information is scant on the ecological functioning of novel turf-dominated ecosystems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. In particular, it is unknown whether the turf-dominated state represents an alternative stable state (sensu Scheffer

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>) of the kelp ecosystem, with both kelp- and turf-dominated states occurring under the same set of environmental conditions (i.e. with hysteresis)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. A better theoretical ecological understanding of regime shifts to turf will improve our ability to predict the reversibility of these shifts once an initial environmental driver (e.g., eutrophication) is relaxed.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the southern extent of kelp forests in the Northwest Atlantic, the dominant kelp species 
  <span class="italic">Saccharina latissima</span> exists near its upper thermal threshold for survival
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, providing a useful model for examining the resilience of warm-adapted kelp forests. Peak recruitment in this region occurs in the winter and spring following sporogenesis in early autumn and spring
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. The life history of 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> alternates between annual and biennial growth, with annual cohorts occurring in the warmest years due to blade degradation in the late summer and low survival into the following year
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. This is in contrast to more northerly locations in the North Atlantic where populations of 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> are perennial with individual lifespans of 2–3 years

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. The macroscopic diploid sporophyte stage of 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> has a lower thermal tolerance than the microscopic haploid gametophyte stage
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. Laboratory and field studies have indicated that at the southern extent, the gametophyte stage can persist through supraoptimal summer temperatures, acting as a warm-tolerant oversummering “resting stage” as an adaptation to dealing with warm temperatures

  </span>.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surprisingly, the most recent quantitative data of kelp abundance (biomass and density) for this region are from the 1980s
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. At that time, kelp forests in Rhode Island Sound and Long Island Sound, USA had primary productivity similar to that of more northerly populations in Nova Scotia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with standing biomass of up to 24 kg m

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, indicating healthy kelp forests at the southern extent. However, mean sea surface temperatures over ~6 decades from 1948 to 2012 warmed at the southern extent at a rate of 0.3 °C decade

  </span>, with unknown impacts on kelp populations.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fall 2017, divers observed low abundance of kelp at a site (Fort Wetherill) at the mouth of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island that was previously dominated by a dense 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> kelp forest
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Young 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> sporophytes that were present were largely attached to turf-forming macroalgae rather than rocky substrate, a phenomenon that was previously rare
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. The observations prompted us to conduct a field study to evaluate the state of kelp forests at the southern extent with 4 main objectives: (1) to quantify kelp biomass and density for comparison with available baseline data from the 1980s; (2) to determine whether algal turf has replaced kelp as the dominant benthic primary producers; (3) to examine correlative evidence for the environmental drivers of an apparent decline of kelp and the rise of turf; and (4) to elucidate the feedback mechanisms that stabilize a turf-dominated ecosystem; specifically, by examining the ecological consequences of kelp recruiting onto turf (e.g., morphology, growth, and survival of kelp on turf versus rocky substrate). To determine whether long-term ocean warming is a likely driver of kelp decline, we analyzed weekly sea surface temperature data from the Narragansett Bay Plankton Time Series collected over a 58-year period from 1959 to 2017 (see Methods). Based on previous observations that the rate of erosion of the distal end of 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> sporophytes exceeds the rate of meristematic growth at temperatures above 20 °C
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>, and that 22 °C is an upper critical limit for 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> gametophyte survival
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>, we developed a thermal integral of weeks with sea temperatures ≥22 °C (degree-week) for each year as an indication of the magnitude of kelp thermal stress through time. Given that eutrophication also is cited as a common cause of a regime shift from kelp to turf (e.g., in Russia, Denmark, Norway, Brazil, and Australia)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>, we also examined time series of ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate concentrations from the Narragansett Bay Plankton Time Series collected over a 46-year period from 1972 to 2018.
