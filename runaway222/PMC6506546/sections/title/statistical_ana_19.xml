  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span> over 35 d from 12 Apr to 17 May 2018. Assumptions of normality were examined with the Shapiro-Wilk test (α = 0.05). Assumptions of homogeneity of variance were examined with the Brown–Forsythe test (α = 0.05). Data were analyzed with Statistica 13.2 (StatSoft) and SigmaStat 4.0 (Systat).
