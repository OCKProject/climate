While the environmental drivers of shifts to turf are generally well-documented, the feedback mechanisms that stabilize novel turf-dominated ecosystems remain poorly resolved. Here, we document a decline of kelp <italic>Saccharina latissima</italic> between 1980 and 2018 at sites at the southernmost extent of kelp forests in the Northwest Atlantic and their replacement by algal turf. We examined the drivers of a shift to turf and feedback mechanisms that stabilize turf reefs. Kelp replacement by turf was linked to a significant multi-decadal increase in sea temperature above an upper thermal threshold for kelp survival. In the turf-dominated ecosystem, 45% of <italic>S. latissima</italic> were attached to algal turf rather than rocky substrate due to preemption of space. Turf-attached kelp required significantly (2 to 4 times) less force to detach from the substrate, with an attendant pattern of lower survival following 2 major wave events as compared to rock-attached kelp. Turf-attached kelp allocated a significantly greater percentage of their biomass to the anchoring structure (holdfast), with a consequent energetic trade-off of slower growth. The results indicate a shift in community dominance from kelp to turf driven by thermal stress and stabilized by ecological feedbacks of lower survival and slower growth of kelp recruited to turf.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Climate-change ecology</kwd><kwd>Biooceanography</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Globally, forests of kelp and other habitat-forming brown seaweeds have been replaced by mats of low-lying turf-forming algae, representing a loss of ecosystem structure and biodiversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

To determine whether long-term ocean warming is a likely driver of kelp decline, we analyzed weekly sea surface temperature data from the Narragansett Bay Plankton Time Series collected over a 58-year period from 1959 to 2017 (see Methods).

Understanding the primary drivers of kelp decline and the functioning of novel anthropogenic ecosystems that replace kelp forests is of critical importance to management and conservation of marine resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Here, we documented a substantial decline of kelp abundance at sites at the southernmost extent of kelp forests in the Northwest Atlantic, with order of magnitude decreases in kelp biomass and density in 2017&#x02013;2018 as compared to baseline data collected in the 1980s.

Furthermore, we found that once-dominant kelp was replaced by turf-forming macroalgal species, contributing to a global pattern of kelp loss followed by the &#x0201c;rise&#x0201d; of turfs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">The loss of kelp forests at sites in Narragansett Bay is consistent with a multidecadal increase in sea surface temperature above a threshold for survival of <italic>S. latissima</italic> sporophytes and resting-stage gametophytes. This pattern of kelp loss occurred despite a significant decrease in local nutrient loads over the study period. A decrease in ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate concentrations in Narragansett Bay from 1972 to the present is best explained by passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, which reduced the discharge of pollutants into United States watersheds (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act">https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act</ext-link>). This finding indicates a success story for local water management, but with the important implication that local management cannot necessarily protect marine ecosystems against degradation in the face of global climate change. Given current trends in sea temperatures, we predict the continual decline and absence of kelp at the southern extent in the Northwest Atlantic. Thus, despite optimistic forecasts that warm-adapted kelp populations should be the most resilient to climate change impacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, these <italic>S. latissima</italic> populations likely do not have the adaptive capacity to respond to warming sea temperatures at current rates under global climate change. Our findings are consistent, rather, with predictions that distributions of marine species at their upper thermal physiological range limits will contract poleward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">Turf-forming macroalgal species identified as part of our study ranged two phyla (Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta) with diverse evolutionary histories and growth forms (e.g., plumose, filamentous, and finely and coarsely branching), indicating the complex nature of the novel turf-dominated ecosystem. Turf communities are generally comprised of opportunistic, &#x0201c;weedy&#x0201d; species with high tolerance to stress; however no overarching definition of &#x0201c;turf&#x0201d; has been established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Indeed, many studies examining shifts from kelp to turf dominance do not characterize the composition or structure of the turf community outside of general descriptions such as &#x0201c;filamentous&#x0201d; turfs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> or &#x0201c;fast-growing&#x0201d; turfs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This exemplifies the extent to which we understand very little about the ecological functioning of these communities, limiting the ability of researchers to generalize their findings across globally disparate turf-dominated ecosystems.</p><p id="Par14">Feedback mechanisms that stabilize the turf-dominated ecosystem may increase the resilience of the ecosystem to a reverse shift back towards kelp dominance, and may indicate the presence of alternative stable states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. While we cannot directly test for hysteresis in our dataset, as kelp forests and turf reefs occur under separate environmental conditions of sea temperature, we did identify feedback mechanisms that may stabilize the turf-dominated ecosystem. The presence of such mechanisms suggests that if sea temperature trends were to reverse, the turf-dominated ecosystem could persist beyond the point at which an initial regime shift to turf occurred. We determined that space preemption by turfs results in kelp sporophytes attaching to turf rather than rocky substratum. The turf-attached kelp had lower survival as compared to rock-attached kelp, likely due to significantly weaker attachment strength. Dislodgement of kelp likely occurred during two strong wave events (&#x0003e;3&#x02009;m significant wave heights) on 17 and 26 April 2018 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). This interpretation is consistent with the findings of Burek <italic>et al</italic>. (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>), who observed lower survival of turf-attached as compared to rock-attached kelp transplanted from wave-protected to exposed sites in Nova Scotia, Canada, and who suggest that this creates a feedback mechanism that stabilizes the turf-dominated ecosystem.</p><p id="Par15">Turf-attached kelp allocate significantly more biomass to the holdfast and have significantly more complex holdfasts than rock-attached kelp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. We observed reduced growth rates of turf-attached kelp, which may represent a trade-off in resource allocation from blade growth to holdfast development and extension of haptera to strengthen attachment on a suboptimal substrate. Slower growth of turf-attached as compared to rock-attached kelp may act to limit the reproductive output of kelp in turf-dominated ecosystems, as the size of the sorus will be constrained by blade size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, in combination, increased mortality of turf-attached kelp due to dislodgement, and slower growth of turf-attached individuals should create a feedback loop that stabilizes the turf-dominated ecosystem and limits the reestablishment of kelp.</p><p id="Par16">The mean growth rate of rock-attached kelp in our study (1.2&#x02009;cm d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was similar to that observed in the early 1980s by Brady-Campbell <italic>et al</italic>. (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>). This result suggests that individual-based productivity rates for rock-attached kelp have not changed over an ~40-year period. However, given that approximately half of the kelp were attached to turf and had significantly slower mean growth rates (0.9&#x02009;cm d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and kelp biomass also was much lower in 2017 and 2018, population-scale kelp productivity likely has substantially declined. Kelp have a potentially important role in mitigating climate change through the sequestration and storage of carbon that is transported to deep ocean regions as macroalgal detritus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Thus, loss of kelp productivity could act as a positive feedback for climate warming.</p><p id="Par17">A recent study in the Gulf of Maine demonstrated 150 times greater <italic>S. latissima</italic> density at offshore sites (Caches Ledge) than coastal sites, despite thermal stress of kelp in both regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. No information currently exists for offshore kelp forests at the southern limit of <italic>S. latissima</italic> in the Northwest Atlantic. Future research should therefore be focused on determining whether a localized community shift to turf observed on reefs in Narragansett Bay is a region-wide phenomenon, and should investigate management strategies to prevent or reverse the disappearance of kelp forests. In addition to curbing global climate change, local management strategies that involve the removal of turfs to open up space for kelp recruitment should be considered given the ecological feedbacks associated with recruiting to turf documented here. The purple sea urchin <italic>Arbacia punctulata</italic> has the ability to clear small patches in the algal turf and create bare space (authors&#x02019; pers. obs.). Interactions between algal turfs, kelp, and grazers on these reefs therefore warrant investigation.
