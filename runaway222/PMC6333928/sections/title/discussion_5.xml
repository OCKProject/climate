 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the main sources of uncertainty for climate predictions is the response of terrestrial ecosystems, and land surface change due to disturbance has been found to be an important factor contributing to that uncertainty
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Our results show that immediate biophysical climate impacts from fire-induced forest loss may be as strong as those associated with human-induced land cover change. During the study period, we calculated that the global mean surface warming 1 year after forest fire was 0.0046 K (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.0042 – 0.0051 K, see Methods), which is comparable to the rate of long-term global surface warming at 0.0064 K yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> between 1880 and 2012
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. The immediate surface warming effect is also of roughly the same magnitude as the effects of total global forest cover change (e.g, 0.0062 K)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>, irrigation, and land cover change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. Recent estimates have shown that biomass burning results in carbon emissions of 2.2 Pg C yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, almost double the 1.3 ± 0.7 Pg C yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> emitted due to human-induced land cover change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>, and equivalent to about 20% of fossil fuel carbon emissions (~9.4 ± 0.5 Pg C yr
  <span class="sup">−2</span>)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Of total carbon emissions from biomass burning, roughly 0.55 Pg C yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> was human related, including agriculture waste burning, tropical deforestation, and peatland fire
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>, although recent estimates have shown global fire activity has reduced by 25% due to agriculture activity in tropical region for the last two decades
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. However, globally, wildfire disturbs more forests (includes both lethal and non-lethal fires) than human-caused forest cover change, especially in the boreal region
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. Our results suggest that the immediate surface RF following forest fire is equivalent to 61% of the biogeochemical atmospheric RF due to annual CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions from biomass burning (see Methods).

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contrasting results from boreal forests and tropical savannas indicate that climate–fire feedbacks are biome specific and temporally variable. Specifically, these results suggest variation relating to background climate, forest species composition, and fire regime may have an impact on the biophysical response of ecosystems to fire. We found that fires had an initial strong positive climate feedback in boreal forests primarily due to warming effects from reduced summer evaporative cooling resulting from canopy loss. At longer time scales ( &gt; 5 years), boreal forest fires had a strong cooling effect, mainly due to increased SW
  <sub>in</sub> absorption due to higher albedo. While this albedo response is consistent with results from several other studies investigating North American boreal forests
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>, our findings indicate that declines in evapotranspiration are necessary to explain the observed land surface temperature response. In contrast with boreal fire effects, fires had a persistent warming effect in tropical savannas due to reduced evaporative cooling, consistent with the expectation that the loss of tropical forests should lead to a surface warming
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Although, we found albedo-induced changes in shortwave RF were very weak at the annual scale in tropical savannas, albedo-induced changes have been found to be more important on seasonal time scales
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, patterns of land-use change following fire may vary considerably in different regions of the tropics and may determine which processes come to dominate the surface radiative budget over time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. Most previous studies have studied the climate feedbacks resulting from changes to albedo-induced shortwave radiative absorption or RF caused by greenhouse gas emissions. However, our results suggest that reduced evaporative cooling is another key mechanism in regulating climate–fire feedbacks, and is a major driver of short-term positive climate–fire feedbacks from the biome to global scales.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results also indicated that fire-induced forest loss may alter Earth’s surface radiative budget through different biophysical processes, despite the limited satellite observations. Specifically, short-term fire-induced changes in albedo exhibited distinct seasonal patterns, which appeared to cancel each other out between snow and snow-free seasons (Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>-
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a> and Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), therefore leaving decreased evapotranspiration during the growing season as the dominant control on the surface radiative budget and thus temperature response in early post-fire successional stages (e.g., &lt; 5 years in boreal forests). Over the long-term, however, shortwave radiative change due to fire-induced albedo increase dominates the surface radiative budget potentially leading to negative climate feedback, which is consistent with observationally based studies at the ecosystem, regional, and global scales studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. Our results are also consistent with a recent analysis indicating that forest loss globally resulted in a slight increase in LST
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span> across all biomes, although our results also suggest that most of this temperature response is due to reduced evapotranspiration in the case of fire. Recognition that surface climate feedbacks vary by different types and severities of land cover change may help to reconcile apparently inconsistent results from previous observational studies on forest loss
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span> and land cover change, as well as model simulations of the same processes. Consequently, understanding the climate feedback from various types of forest disturbances is necessary to understand the climate feedbacks due to changes in global forest cover.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results suggest that fire severity is a much better predictor of changes in land surface radiative budget than BA. Thus, stronger climate–fire feedbacks may be expected in high latitude ecosystems where fire regimes are predicted to become more frequent and severe
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>. Although it has been shown that BA may be declining globally, our results do not necessarily show any significant change in burn severity. Therefore, even though the areal extent of fire may be declining, the biophysical and biogeochemical effects of fire may still be affecting Earth’s radiative budget. If an intensified boreal fire regime unfolds as predicted, the magnitude and duration of the initial positive climate–fire feedbacks may be greatly enhanced, and this may have stronger influence on Earth’s surface radiative budget. Multiple lines of evidence, including increases in BA, severity, and carbon emissions, forest species changes and expansion, and permafrost thaw, have suggested that biogeochemical and biophysical properties are rapidly changing in high latitude ecosystems. Therefore, understanding the vulnerability of high latitude ecosystems in response to changing climate–fire feedbacks remains critical.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the importance of fire globally, the simulation of fire in Earth system models varies greatly in how spatial distributions, trends, and carbon emissions are implemented, and simulations are not necessarily consistent with observations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Moreover, current efforts focus on characterizing BA and the biogeochemical processes affecting carbon emissions and tend to have overly simplified representations of fire severity and biophysical climate feedbacks
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Additionally, most current models do not accurately characterize post-fire succession and its biophysical feedbacks on energy fluxes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>. Here, we present a framework for assessing the surface radiative impacts due to fire, which can be applied to a range of land surface disturbance types. The biophysical diagnostics presented here are also prognostic variables within land surface models that can help identify what processes the models are accurately simulating and what processes need improvement to increase our confidence in future climate predictions.
