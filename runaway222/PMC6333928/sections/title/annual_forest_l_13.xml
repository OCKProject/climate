  </span>. High-resolution forest loss data were aggregated into 500 m resolution, so as to be consistent with the MODIS BA product (MCD64A1) and allowing for the calculation of annual burned forest area and fire-induced tree mortality. The tree cover in 2000 was contained in the forest cover change dataset and was used to define forested area. The forest loss data used in the analysis are available online (
