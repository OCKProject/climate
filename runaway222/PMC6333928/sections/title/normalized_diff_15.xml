 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used NDVI data from the MYD13C2 (V6) product at 0.05° resolution and a monthly time step. Fire severity as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">14</a> was calculated as the NDVI change one year after fire (∆NDVI) between burned pixels (NDVI
  <sub>fire</sub>) and adjacent unburned pixels (NDVI
  <sub>control</sub>) at 0.05° spatial resolution (∆NDVI = NDVI
  <sub>fire</sub> – NDVI
  <sub>control</sub>). Only pixels in which QA was flagged as 0 (good data) and 1 (marginal data) were used.
