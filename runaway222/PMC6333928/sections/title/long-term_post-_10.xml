 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in land surface temperatures (∆LST) and energy fluxes (i.e., ∆SW
  <sub>in</sub>, ∆LE) up to 9 years post fire were contrasted between boreal forests and tropical savannas due to their identified importance in determining the global climate feedback from fires. To remove the potential confounding effect of fire-induced vegetation change, the land cover type was examined between prefire (up to 2 years before fire) and post-fire (up to 9 years after fire) periods. Pairs of fire-control were used to plot long-term post-fire dynamic only if there is no land cover change observed by MODIS. To evaluate the effect of BA on climate feedbacks, post-fire trajectories in ∆LST, ∆SW
  <sub>in</sub>, and ∆LE were also stratified by percent BA (PBA) within 0.05° grid cells (i.e., All, 0.2–0.4, 0.4–0.6, 0.6–0.8, &gt; 0.8).

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To compare the potential response of land surface radiometric temperature (∆LST) to different components of the fire regime (i.e., fire severity and BA), we examined the correlations between ∆LST (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) and the percent of high severity fire (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>), as well as the PBA (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1c</a>) over 2 × 2 degree windows for summers and winters, and annually (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>).
