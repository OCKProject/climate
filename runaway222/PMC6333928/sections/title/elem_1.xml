  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fire-induced forest loss at the global scale was quantified by overlaying MODIS annual burned area (BA) and Landsat-derived annual forest loss area at 500-m resolution from 2003 to 2014 (see Methods). We considered cells as fire-induced forest loss if BA and forest loss coincided with each other in space and time (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). We found that mean annual fire-induced forest loss accounted for 14.8 ± 3.3% of total forest loss between 2003 and 2014, and exhibited distinct geographic and latitudinal patterns (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a, b</a>). The percent of fire-induced forest loss was as high as ~30% in boreal Canada and Russia, as well as in the western US due to high fire severity (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) and in African seasonal-dry tropical forests due to high burn rates (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Fire-induced forest loss in tropics (23 S – 23 N), which are most likely deforestation fires

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
   </span>, accounted for about 25% of global fire-induced loss and about 4% global forest loss. Trend analysis of these short-term records showed an increasing trend in percent fire-induced forest loss in Eurasia, the western US, and Australia. However, N. America showed no trend in percent fire-induced forest loss, and Africa showed a decreasing trend (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3a</a>). In S. America and SE Asian tropical forests, the increasing trend in Landsat-derived tree loss (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3d</a>) cannot be explained by a decreasing trend in BA (Supplementary Fig.

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span>. By removing potential confounding factors including background climate, vegetation type, structure and variation, as well as topography (see Methods), we calculated the impact of forest fire on LST between fire-affected pixels (fire) and non-fire-affected pixels (control) (e.g., ∆LST = LST
   <sub>fire</sub> – LST
   <sub>control</sub>) following fire (Supplementary Fig 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). The spatial distribution of paired fire-control samples largely mirrored percent of annual BA (Supplementary Fig 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a> vs Supplementary Fig 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2a</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Immediately (1 year) after fire, forest fires caused a significant increase in mean annual LST (∆LST = 0.153 K, 0.120 – 0.186 K) within BAs, with a greater increase in summer (∆LST = 0.218 K, 0.151 – 0.286 K) than winter (∆LST = 0.111 K, 0.040 – 0.181 K). However, the effects of fires on LST exhibited distinct patterns across latitudes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). The mean ∆LST response was most dramatic in northern high latitudes (&gt; 45 N), where fires resulted in a strong warming effect in summer (0.664 ± 0.038 K) and a weak cooling effect in winter (−0.164 ± 0.058 K), leading to a net annual warming effect (0.198 ± 0.044 K) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The fire-induced warming effect in northern high latitudes may have direct impacts on climate due to its large spatial coverage (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). At mid-latitudes ( &gt; 20 S and 20 N – 45 N), fires had a stronger warming effect in summer than in winter, and had an annual warming effect. At low latitudes (20 S – 20 N), forest fires had a slight but non-significant warming effect on summer (∆LST = 0.036 ± 0.059 K), winter (0.029 ± 0.062 K), and annual (0.039 ± 0.045 K) surface temperatures (Supplementary Table

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Post-fire trajectories in surface LST were examined to contrast the fire-induced climate feedbacks in two biomes with very different fire regimes and climate services (i.e., boreal forests vs. tropical savannas, Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). Although limited by data availability ( &lt; 9 years), trajectories on the climate feedbacks of early successional stages provide good indicators on long-term trends about ecosystem dynamics and their associated biophysical processes and climate feedbacks. Several key differences were observed between boreal forests and tropical savannas in the magnitude and trend of surface temperature responses following fire events (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). First, the magnitude and duration of the LST responses in boreal forests were more dramatic and variable than those in savannas, probably due to higher burn severity, longer ecosystem recovery time, and the seasonal presence of snow cover. Second, boreal forest fires had strong warming effects immediately after burning ( &lt; 1 year). Following these initial impacts, the magnitude of the warming effect decreased gradually to zero within 5 years following fire (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), followed by a net cooling effect after 5 years. As the fire return interval is usually more than several decades in boreal forests, fire may have a net cooling effect when radiative impacts are integrated over the whole fire cycle, consistent with previous findings

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The underlying biophysical mechanisms behind the observed changes in surface temperature can be better understood by looking at the variations in the components of the surface energy balance (see Methods). Consistent with LST, changes in surface fluxes immediately (1 year) after fires also showed distinct latitudinal and seasonal patterns (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Changes in surface energy fluxes were more dramatic at high latitudes ( &gt; 45 N/30 S), possibly due to higher fire severity (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>). At high latitudes, there was an increase in summer (June, July, August (JJA)) SW
   <sub>in</sub> absorption (△SW
   <sub>in</sub> = 2.97 ± 0.85 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>) due to a decrease in albedo (△α = −0.0096 ± 0.0031), and a decrease in winter (December, January, February (DJF)) SW
   <sub>in</sub> absorption (△SW
   <sub>in</sub> = −2.05 ± 0.95) due to an increase in α (△α = 0.033 ± 0.0038). The combination of these changes led to a weak increase in net annual SW
   <sub>in</sub> absorption (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, Supplementary Figs. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>-
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11</a>). The upwelling longwave radiation (△LW
   <sub>out</sub>), based on the surface energy balance, is similar to the LST response. Forest fires reduced the annual evaporative cooling (△LE) (primarily during the growing season) due to the consumption of forest canopy and ground vegetation, together with changes in SW
   <sub>in</sub> absorption. These reductions contributed to latitudinal and seasonal changes in sensible and ground heat fluxes (△(HE + G)). In contrast, fire-induced changes in surface energy fluxes were relatively minor and lacked seasonality at low latitudes (Fig.

  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also attributed the post-fire trajectory in surface LST to the relative importance between albedo-induced changes in SW (shortwave) radiation (△SW
   <sub>in</sub>) and ET-induced changes in LE (latent heat) fluxes (△LE), within 9 year following fire (see Methods). The strong warming effect immediately ( &lt; 1 year) after fire in boreal forests was due to both a reduction in evaporative cooling and an increase in SW
   <sub>in</sub> absorption (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b, c</a>). As the vegetation reestablished, the surface radiative budget becomes dominated by increasing surface albedo thus contributing to a long-term cooling effect. Decreases in ET due to forest canopy loss leveled off after 2 years, possibly because reductions in forest ET (evapotranspiration) were partially offset by increases in grass/shrub ET. As a result, the initial net warming effect caused by decreased LE was slowly outweighed by the cooling effect caused by decreases in absorbed △SW
   <sub>in</sub> causing a cooling trend after 5 years (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12</a>). In contrast, warming effects in tropical savannas were caused primarily by reduced evaporative cooling (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12</a>). Changes in annual albedo and subsequent effects on SW forcing were very weak, as albedo recovered within several months after fire
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>, but evapotranspiration required a much longer time to recover.
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contrasts between boreal forest and tropical savanna LST responses and surface energy fluxes imply that fire regime characteristics are important for determining surface energy impacts. Therefore, we related △LST to fire severity (% of high severity fire) and BA (% of area burned) within each 2 × 2 degree region in order to explore their impacts on the surface energy budget (see Methods). We found a stronger non-linear relationship between fire severity and summer LST (
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.63) than between BA and summer LST (
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.02), suggesting that fire severity may have a bigger influence on perturbations to the surface radiative budget than BA (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">13</a>), which is consistent with previous findings at the regional scale
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
   </span>. We also related △LST to BA and fire severity at the 0.05˚ scale, which showed a stronger response of △LST to fire severity, especially in tropical regions (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">14</a>). Among biomes, tropical fires are characterized by higher burn frequency but lower fire severity, which partially explains the dampened response of △α, △ET, and △LST within tropical regions. In contrast, boreal forest fires are typically higher in severity but lesser in areal extent, leading to stronger responses in surface biophysical properties (e.g., albedo, forest canopy consumption) and resultant climate feedbacks and energy flux perturbations. The non-linear relationship between △LST and fire severity (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>) suggests that small changes in fire severity in typically low fire severity regions, such as the tropics and Siberian boreal forests, may result in potentially large changes in the post-fire LST response.
