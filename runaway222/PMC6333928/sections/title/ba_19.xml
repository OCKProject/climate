  </span>. In this analysis, monthly pixel-level BA was first integrated into annual pixel-level BA (1-burned, 0-unburned), and then aggregated into PBA at 0.05° spatial resolution (# of burned pixels divided by # of pixels within the 0.05° grid). To reduce potential uncertainties resulting from MODIS observations, only PBA &gt;0.2 were included in the analysis. PBA at 0.05° spatial resolution was used to select the paired fire-control samples for the assessment of the biophysical climate effects of fire and its controls.
