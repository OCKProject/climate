 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many studies have investigated the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of fire regimes and their response to climate

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. On the contrary, forest fires also alter the climate via biogeochemical processes, such as emissions of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere or sequestration of carbon via post-fire regrowth of vegetation, but also through direct biophysical processes, such as changes in the absorption or redistribution of energy at Earth’s surface

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. To understand climatic response, many studies have also investigated how fires have affected the radiative forcing (RF) at ecosystem to regional scales using observations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. However, most studies focused on RF either from albedo-induced shortwave radiation change or greenhouse gas emissions. To the best of our knowledge, no observational-based studies have quantified the amount of forest cover loss due to fire and its impact on the full surface energy balance at the global scale. Such knowledge is critical to understanding the role of fire in earth’s climate system and predicting future fire–climate interactions.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forest climate services exhibit distinct latitudinal patterns associated with different biophysical processes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. Generally, it is thought that boreal forests tend to have a net warming effect due to higher shortwave radiation absorption resulting from their relatively low albedo (α), and tropical forests tend to have a net cooling effect due to high evapotranspiration. These well-established biophysical climate feedbacks have enabled Earth system models to simulate biosphere–atmosphere interactions due to changes in forest cover, and have provided a mechanistic understanding of the climate feedbacks from observed changes in land surface properties

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. However, recent satellite evidence suggests that forest cover loss is associated with a warming of Earth’s surface globally
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Stand- to regional-scale studies have shown that forest fires have the potential to affect regional climate through changes to the energy budget

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. However, these analyses did not consider fire-induced climate feedbacks between biomes, and we still have a limited understanding of how fire alters Earth’s surface radiative budget and temperature at the global scale.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we used spatially and temporally consistent satellite observations from Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to assess the biophysical climate effects from fire-induced forest change at the global scale. To explore these relationships between fire-induced forest loss and Earth’s surface radiative budget, we first quantified how much forest loss was caused by fire annually from 2003 to 2014? Then, we studied the Earth’s land surface radiometric temperature (LST) response to fire-induced forest loss, and explored the underlying biophysical processes. We found fire-induced forest loss accounts for about 15% of global forest loss, mainly in northern high latitudes. The biophysical feedbacks of fire on surface temperature and radiative budget vary during the post-fire succession, and depend on the dynamic interaction between evapotranspiration and albedo resulted from different fire regimes among biomes.</p>
