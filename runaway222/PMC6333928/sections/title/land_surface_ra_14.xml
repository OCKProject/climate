 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used LST data from the MYD11C3 (V6) AQUA product at 0.05° resolution and a monthly time step. This product was chosen because it better approximated the timing of surface retrievals of maximum and minimum temperatures than the MOD11C3 TERRA product. We used maximum LST (day-time LST at approximately 1:30 p.m. local time), minimum LST (night-time LST at approximately 1:30 a.m. local time), and mean LST (average of maximum and minimum LST) for this analysis. MODIS LST (V6) has been widely validated against a variety of land cover types and generally shows good correlations with ground values

  </span>. Emissivity values in this product are estimated based on land cover type and therefore are not likely to accurately change following low severity fires. However, potential emissivity values cover a small range (0.95–0.98) and therefore have a relatively small influence on LST. To reduce uncertainties associated with emissivity values, we only used high quality LST values (emissivity error &lt; = 0.02 and LST error &lt; = 1 K).
