  </span>. By removing potential confounding factors including background climate, vegetation type, structure and variation, as well as topography (see Methods), we calculated the impact of forest fire on LST between fire-affected pixels (fire) and non-fire-affected pixels (control) (e.g., ∆LST = LST
  <sub>fire</sub> – LST
  <sub>control</sub>) following fire (Supplementary Fig 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). The spatial distribution of paired fire-control samples largely mirrored percent of annual BA (Supplementary Fig 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a> vs Supplementary Fig 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2a</a>).

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Immediately (1 year) after fire, forest fires caused a significant increase in mean annual LST (∆LST = 0.153 K, 0.120 – 0.186 K) within BAs, with a greater increase in summer (∆LST = 0.218 K, 0.151 – 0.286 K) than winter (∆LST = 0.111 K, 0.040 – 0.181 K). However, the effects of fires on LST exhibited distinct patterns across latitudes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). The mean ∆LST response was most dramatic in northern high latitudes (&gt; 45 N), where fires resulted in a strong warming effect in summer (0.664 ± 0.038 K) and a weak cooling effect in winter (−0.164 ± 0.058 K), leading to a net annual warming effect (0.198 ± 0.044 K) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The fire-induced warming effect in northern high latitudes may have direct impacts on climate due to its large spatial coverage (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). At mid-latitudes ( &gt; 20 S and 20 N – 45 N), fires had a stronger warming effect in summer than in winter, and had an annual warming effect. At low latitudes (20 S – 20 N), forest fires had a slight but non-significant warming effect on summer (∆LST = 0.036 ± 0.059 K), winter (0.029 ± 0.062 K), and annual (0.039 ± 0.045 K) surface temperatures (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>).

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Post-fire trajectories in surface LST were examined to contrast the fire-induced climate feedbacks in two biomes with very different fire regimes and climate services (i.e., boreal forests vs. tropical savannas, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). Although limited by data availability ( &lt; 9 years), trajectories on the climate feedbacks of early successional stages provide good indicators on long-term trends about ecosystem dynamics and their associated biophysical processes and climate feedbacks. Several key differences were observed between boreal forests and tropical savannas in the magnitude and trend of surface temperature responses following fire events (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). First, the magnitude and duration of the LST responses in boreal forests were more dramatic and variable than those in savannas, probably due to higher burn severity, longer ecosystem recovery time, and the seasonal presence of snow cover. Second, boreal forest fires had strong warming effects immediately after burning ( &lt; 1 year). Following these initial impacts, the magnitude of the warming effect decreased gradually to zero within 5 years following fire (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), followed by a net cooling effect after 5 years. As the fire return interval is usually more than several decades in boreal forests, fire may have a net cooling effect when radiative impacts are integrated over the whole fire cycle, consistent with previous findings

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. In contrast, tropical savanna fires had a weak, but persistent, warming effect (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>), consistent with deforestation
