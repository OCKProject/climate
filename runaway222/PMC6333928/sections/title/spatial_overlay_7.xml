 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We overlaid MODIS BA and Landsat-derived forest loss at 500 m resolution over forested areas (tree cover &gt; 20% in 2000 based on
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>) for each year from 2003 to 2014. To reduce potential uncertainties, we only analyzed the pixels with &gt; 20% tree cover in 2000, and also limited the study to pixels in which a maximum of one fire per year had occurred. Pixels were labeled as having experienced fire-induced forest loss if the MODIS BA data coincided with Landsat-derived forest loss for the fire year and 2 years postfire (i.e., 
  <span class="italic">t</span> + 0, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> + 1, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> + 2). This approach was used to account for delayed tree mortality after fires. Following identification of fire-induced forest loss pixels, we summarized the total forest area (Area
  <sub>forest </sub>&gt; 20% tree cover in 2000), total BA based on MODIS BA data (Area
  <sub>fire</sub>), total forest loss based on Landsat-derived annual tree loss data (TreeLoss
  <sub>total</sub>), and fire-induced tree loss ( = TreeLoss
  <sub>fire</sub>) within each 2 × 2 degree region. We derived four variables for each 2 × 2 degree region (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>): variable 1, defined as the percent of total forest loss = TreeLoss
  <sub>total</sub>/Area
  <sub>forest</sub>. Variable 2, defined as the percent of fire-induced forest loss = TreeLoss
  <sub>fire</sub>/TreeLoss
  <sub>total</sub>. Variable 3, defined as the percent of forest burned by fire = Area
  <sub>fire</sub>/Area
  <sub>forest</sub>. Variable 4, defined as the percent of fire that is high severity = TreeLoss
  <sub>fire</sub>/Area
  <sub>fire</sub>.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, these four variables were plotted at 2 × 2 degree spatial resolution, and smoothed over 4 × 4 degree moving windows (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Trends for these four variables were assessed using linear regression, and the significance level was set at 
  <span class="italic">α</span> = 0.1. Trends were plotted as Supplementary Fig.
