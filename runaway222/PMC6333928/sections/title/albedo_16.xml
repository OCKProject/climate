 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used white-sky shortwave albedo (α) from the MCD43C3 (V5) product at 0.05° and a 16-day-time step. The white-sky albedo product is derived from bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) measurements, integrated over both incoming and outgoing hemispheres, and does not depend on illumination or atmospheric conditions. Black-sky albedo (directional hemispherical reflectance) is the albedo in the absence of a diffuse component and is a function of solar zenith angle. Actual albedo uses both black- and white-sky albedo weighted by the proportion of direct and diffuse illumination, which is not currently available. We chose to use white-sky albedo, rather than black-sky or actual (blue-sky) albedo, because previous studies have found the choice of specific albedo (white-, black-, or blue-sky) has little impact on analyses at the global scale?
