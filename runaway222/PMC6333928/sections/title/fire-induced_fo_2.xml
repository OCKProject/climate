 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fire-induced forest loss at the global scale was quantified by overlaying MODIS annual burned area (BA) and Landsat-derived annual forest loss area at 500-m resolution from 2003 to 2014 (see Methods). We considered cells as fire-induced forest loss if BA and forest loss coincided with each other in space and time (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). We found that mean annual fire-induced forest loss accounted for 14.8 ± 3.3% of total forest loss between 2003 and 2014, and exhibited distinct geographic and latitudinal patterns (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a, b</a>). The percent of fire-induced forest loss was as high as ~30% in boreal Canada and Russia, as well as in the western US due to high fire severity (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) and in African seasonal-dry tropical forests due to high burn rates (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Fire-induced forest loss in tropics (23 S – 23 N), which are most likely deforestation fires

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>, accounted for about 25% of global fire-induced loss and about 4% global forest loss. Trend analysis of these short-term records showed an increasing trend in percent fire-induced forest loss in Eurasia, the western US, and Australia. However, N. America showed no trend in percent fire-induced forest loss, and Africa showed a decreasing trend (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3a</a>). In S. America and SE Asian tropical forests, the increasing trend in Landsat-derived tree loss (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3d</a>) cannot be explained by a decreasing trend in BA (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3c</a>, also in ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>), and is most likely due to human-caused deforestation activities

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. Percent of high severity fire, calculated as the ratio between fire-induced forest loss (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) and total forest burned by fire (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2a</a>), was higher in boreal and western US forests, but there was no indication of any global trend in forest fire severity (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3b</a>), although the burn area is decreasing trend in African savannas (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3c</a>), inconsistent with a recent global analysis.
