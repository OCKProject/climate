  <p>The biophysical effects of fire-induced forest loss on land surface radiometric temperature (LST). Panel 
   <span class="bold">a</span> shows the latitudinal summary of △LST resulting from fire for annual, summer (June, July, and August (JJA)), and winter (December, January, and February (DJF)) time periods. In 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, shaded areas are the mean ± one standard deviation. Panels 
   <span class="bold">b</span>, 
   <span class="bold">c</span>,
