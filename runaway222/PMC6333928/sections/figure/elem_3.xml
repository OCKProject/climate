   <span class="bold">b</span> upwelling longwave radiation (△LW

For the latitudinal summaries of impacts, black lines represent annual impacts, red lines represent summer (June, July, August; JJA) impacts, and blue lines represent winter (December, January, February; DJF) impacts. The shaded areas are the mean ± one standard deviation. Panels
