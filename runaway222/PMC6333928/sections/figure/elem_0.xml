  <p>Spatial patterns of percent of mean annual fire-induced forest loss and fire severity between 2003 and 2014. Panel 
   <span class="bold">a</span> shows the percentage of mean annual forest loss due to fire globally, and 
   <span class="bold">b</span> binned by latitude. Panel 
   <span class="bold">c</span> shows the percentage of high severity fire globally, and 
   <span class="bold">d</span> binned by latitude. In 
   <span class="bold">b</span> and 
   <span class="bold">d</span>, shaded areas are the mean ± one standard deviation. Points are spaced 2 × 2 degree in both latitude and longitude, and smoothed by 4 × 4 degree moving windows. Panels 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">c</span> were created in the R environment for statistical computing and graphics (
