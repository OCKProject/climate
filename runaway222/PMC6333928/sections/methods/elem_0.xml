  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We overlaid MODIS BA and Landsat-derived forest loss at 500 m resolution over forested areas (tree cover &gt; 20% in 2000 based on
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>) for each year from 2003 to 2014. To reduce potential uncertainties, we only analyzed the pixels with &gt; 20% tree cover in 2000, and also limited the study to pixels in which a maximum of one fire per year had occurred. Pixels were labeled as having experienced fire-induced forest loss if the MODIS BA data coincided with Landsat-derived forest loss for the fire year and 2 years postfire (i.e., 
   <span class="italic">t</span> + 0, 
   <span class="italic">t</span> + 1, 
   <span class="italic">t</span> + 2). This approach was used to account for delayed tree mortality after fires. Following identification of fire-induced forest loss pixels, we summarized the total forest area (Area
   <sub>forest </sub>&gt; 20% tree cover in 2000), total BA based on MODIS BA data (Area
   <sub>fire</sub>), total forest loss based on Landsat-derived annual tree loss data (TreeLoss
   <sub>total</sub>), and fire-induced tree loss ( = TreeLoss
   <sub>fire</sub>) within each 2 × 2 degree region. We derived four variables for each 2 × 2 degree region (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>): variable 1, defined as the percent of total forest loss = TreeLoss
   <sub>total</sub>/Area
   <sub>forest</sub>. Variable 2, defined as the percent of fire-induced forest loss = TreeLoss
   <sub>fire</sub>/TreeLoss
   <sub>total</sub>. Variable 3, defined as the percent of forest burned by fire = Area
   <sub>fire</sub>/Area
   <sub>forest</sub>. Variable 4, defined as the percent of fire that is high severity = TreeLoss
   <sub>fire</sub>/Area
   <sub>fire</sub>.

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, these four variables were plotted at 2 × 2 degree spatial resolution, and smoothed over 4 × 4 degree moving windows (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Trends for these four variables were assessed using linear regression, and the significance level was set at

  </p>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The key goal for this space-for-time approach was to make sure that the change in land surface temperature and energy fluxes was only due to fire, and not due to other factors such as background climate conditions, vegetation type, structure, and dynamics, or the physical environment. To achieve this goal, we employed a three-step procedure (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first step, for each fire pixel, we overlaid a 9 × 5 pixel search window (longitude × latitude, approximately equal to 50 km × 28 km). Only unburned pixels within the window with the same background climate (defined by Köppen–Geiger climate region map: Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>) and forest type (defined by MODIS land cover data: Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">15</a>) as the fire pixel were selected as candidate control pixels. This step ensured that the fire and control pixels were within the same background climate and forest type.
  </p>
  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the second step, time series of spectral indices, including NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), LST, and albedo (α), were compared between fire pixels and each candidate control pixel for 2 years before the fire year (
   <span class="italic">t</span> – 2, 
   <span class="italic">t</span> – 1, and 
   <span class="italic">t</span>). If the difference in spectral indices between fire and candidate control pixels was smaller than a threshold (∆NDVI &lt; 0.05, ∆LST &lt; 0.2, ∆α &lt; 0.05), the candidate control pixels were retained. After this procedure, post-fire (
   <span class="italic">t</span> + 1) spectral indices for each candidate control were checked relative to prefire time series (
   <span class="italic">t</span> – 2, 
   <span class="italic">t</span> – 1, and 
   <span class="italic">t</span>) of the same pixel in order to ensure consistency within the control pixels. This step made sure that fire and control pixels were stable and comparable in vegetation characteristics and biophysical parameters.
  </p>
  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the third step, the difference in physical environment (i.e., elevation, aspect, and slope) between fire and control pixels were also compared. If the physical environment between fire and candidate control pixels were similar (∆elevation &lt; 50 m, ∆slope &lt; 5, ∆aspect &lt; 30), the control pixels were retained. This step ensured that fire and control pixels were topographically similar enough for comparison. Only the control pixel located nearest to the fire pixel was used if more than one candidate control pixel was found following the above-mentioned procedure.</p>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 92,452 paired fire-control samples were identified between 2005 and 2013 with higher numbers in the tropics and lower numbers in boreal regions (Supplementary Fig.

Actual albedo uses both black- and white-sky albedo weighted by the proportion of direct and diffuse illumination, which is not currently available.
