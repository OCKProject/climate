  <span class="italic">T</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P</span> time series are input to a hydrological model to assess the impacts on runoff. We use CLIRUN II, the latest in a family of hydrological models developed to assess the impact of climate change on runoff

  </span>. CLIRUN II is a two-layer, conceptual, lumped-watershed rainfall-runoff model. It averages soil parameters over the watershed and models runoff at one gauge station at the mouth of the basin. It can be run on a monthly or daily time step. Using the kNN generated samples of 
  <span class="italic">T</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P</span>, CLIRUN II generates a corresponding 100 samples of 20-year long monthly timeseries of runoff.

 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CLIRUN II is calibrated using 14 years of monthly streamflow data. Only one streamflow gauge, RGS 3MA03, is available in the Mwache basin

  </span>. However, it is directly upstream of the dam location, making it representative for this study. The same monthly temperature and precipitation data from CRU used in the Bayesian climate analysis is used to calibrate CLIRUN II for consistency. This temperature and precipitation data is different than the local data used in the previous World Bank study

  </span>, leading to different calibration results but similar performance (historical MAR: 113 MCM year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>; World Bank MAR: 133 MCM year

  <span class="sup">−1</span>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis using CLIRUN II and the reservoir sizing model confirms that the 80 MCM dam meets the reliability targets in the current and expected future climate but does not meet reliability targets if the climate gets substantially warmer and drier. The 120 MCM dam meets reliability targets across all projected future climates.</p>
