 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate impacts on river runoff depend on changes in month-to-month variability in precipitation and temperature in addition to changes in the mean. We model these two changes separately. To develop monthly time-series of 
  <span class="italic">T</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P</span>, we follow the 
  <span class="italic">k</span>-nearest neighbors (kNN) approach as described in ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span> applied to GCM projections. This non-parametric statistical approach allows us to impose the mean 
  <span class="italic">T</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P</span> from the SDP while also capturing the standard deviation in monthly values and month-to-month autocorrelation projected by the GCMs. This approach was chosen for its simplicity, ease of implementation, and application in long-term water supply; future studies could use other non-parametric approaches such as the local polynomial regression method developed in ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. For each 20-year time period, we employ the kNN approach to generate 100 samples of 20-year long monthly time-series of 
  <span class="italic">T</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. The resulting time series are then applied to the rainfall-runoff model presented below.
