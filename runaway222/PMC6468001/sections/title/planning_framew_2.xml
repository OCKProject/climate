  </span>. While GCMs all project warming in the region, there is disagreement on the direction of precipitation change. This creates substantial uncertainty in future runoff and therefore the reservoir capacity needed to meet yield targets over its lifetime. We apply our framework to develop and assess a flexible infrastructure design. The flexible design enables extra storage capacity to be added if the initial dam becomes insufficient due to warmer, drier climates.

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this scenario, the target yield is greater than observed MAR in the Mwache river, and therefore the dam cannot meet the target yield in today’s climate regardless of its size. Therefore, we model the combination of a 120 MCM dam and a desalination plant that is used to supply demand when reservoir storage is low. Three desalination alternatives are chosen, analogous to the dam design alternatives. A low capacity alternative designed to meet reliability targets in the current and expected future climate with 60 MCM capacity; the large alternative that meets the reliability targets across all projected future climates with 80 MCM capacity; a flexible alternative starts with 60 MCM and can be expanded to 80 MCM. Evaluating this second scenario allows us to compare the value of flexibility across two technology options, earthen dams and desalination, which have unique water supply profiles and cost structures.</p>
