 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The infrastructure operation model includes fixed dam operations (and desalination operations when necessary) that seek to meet the specified yield target while accounting for dead storage, net evaporation, and environmental flows. Unmet demand is measured for each of the 100 streamflow time series, and the average 20-year unmet demand is used to characterize 
  <span class="italic">U</span> in the SDP formulation in Eq. (
  <a rid="Equ8" ref-type="" href="#Equ8">8</a>). We acknowledge that assuming reservoir operations that are fixed in time is a limitation given that adaptive reservoir operations would likely reduce the need for additional capacity; future work could optimize the reservoir operations to each climate state.
