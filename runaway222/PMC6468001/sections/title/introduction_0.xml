  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Because of the large expense and widespread need for adaptation investments, planning models play a critical role in targeting resources. Traditional water infrastructure planning accounts for uncertainty by adding a safety factor to new infrastructure
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. However, these large projects are typically irreversible, expensive, and last for multiple decades; the same is true across many infrastructure domains
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Preparing for climate change by adding extra capacity, therefore, incurs high risk of expensive overbuilding in resource-scare areas. Flexible infrastructure planning has the potential to manage uncertainty at reduced cost by building less infrastructure up front but enabling expansion in the future if needed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. However, enabling flexibility often requires substantial proactive planning or upfront investment
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. In water resources, it is difficult to know whether recent trends in streamflow are a result of climate change or short-tern variability and therefore whether they are predictive of future trends
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. It is therefore difficult for planners to know if and when to trigger adaptive actions. Short-term reliability outages can occur if infrastructure cannot be adapted quickly
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Further, flexibility can ultimately be more expensive by not taking advantage of economies of scale
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Appropriate methods are therefore needed to weigh the risks and benefits of static vs. flexible infrastructure approaches in responding to climate change uncertainty.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several recent studies provide methods to develop and assess flexible (also called adaptive) infrastructure planning under climate change uncertainty. Robust decision making (RDM) uses iterative scenario development to minimize the regret from both overbuilding unnecessary infrastructure and being unprepared
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. RDM has been used to develop and evaluate adaptive infrastructure planning strategies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. New policymaking processes design adaptive pathways that allow planners to switch from one action to another if specified thresholds are reached
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span> and can be combined with optimization approaches to identify adaptive thresholds and actions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Recent approaches have provided methods for adaptive sequencing of infrastructure investments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Finally, advances in search algorithms
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> have enabled assessment of adaptive and cooperative approaches against many performance measures using ensembles of streamflow projections
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive management requires an ability to learn over time as more information is collected
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. A challenge faced by the aforementioned approaches is the difficulty in assessing opportunities to learn in the future. General circulation model (GCM, i.e. climate model) projections provide us with the best available estimates of how the global climate system will evolve under a given emissions scenario. However, as time passes and new climate observations are available, some GCM trajectories will prove to be more reliable than others. For example, suppose current regional projections estimate a range between 0.5 and 1.5 °C of change over the next 20 years. If after 20 years we observe 1.5 °C of change, this suggests the climate is warming in this region more rapidly than expected. We may now shift our projections of change upward for the following 20 years. While existing frameworks provide an iterative process for planners to change course in the future, they do not provide an upfront assessment of the opportunity to learn about climate change in the future. This upfront assessment is critical to deciding whether investments in flexibility are worthwhile or whether a traditional static approach is more appropriate. Existing flexible approaches either assume a priori that flexibility is needed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>, assume perfect information about the future
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>, or rely on thresholds or signposts that are unrelated to learning about climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, but do not provide a mechanism for assessing opportunities to learn about climate change in the future. Recent studies have incorporated learning feedback from short-term nonstationary streamflow, but not long-term climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Note that while this study focuses on water supply infrastructure, the challenge of characterizing learning about climate uncertainty to enable adaptive planning has been highlighted in a range of other disciplines (for example in forest management
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We develop a planning framework that explicitly models the potential to learn about climate uncertainty over time and uses potential learning to develop and evaluate flexible planning strategies in comparison to static approaches. First, we use GCM projections to develop a wide range of possible future mean regional temperature (
  <span class="italic">T</span>) and precipitation (
  <span class="italic">P</span>) outcomes over a planning horizon. We finely discretize mean annual 
  <span class="italic">T</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P</span> within that range. This develops a comprehensive set of virtual climate observations of mean 
  <span class="italic">T</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P</span> that reflect many possible future regional climates, some of which are drier and some of which are wetter. Next, we adapt a Bayesian statistical model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> to update initial climate uncertainty estimates for each virtual climate observation. The updated estimates reflect what we will have learned if the virtual observation comes to pass. These updated uncertainty estimates characterize the transition probabilities in a non-stationary stochastic dynamic program (SDP); each possible change in SDP climate state is equivalent to a virtual climate observation. This SDP planning formulation therefore takes into account all the potential new information that may be learned in the future as it develops optimal planning policies. We use these polices to evaluate flexible infrastructure planning approaches and compare them to static approaches.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The United Nations Environment Program estimates that the cost of climate change adaptation investments in the developing world may reach $500 billion per year by 2050;
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> the World Bank estimates that the infrastructure and water sector adaptation costs may be $28 billion and $20 billion per year, respectively
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. It is therefore essential to target infrastructure investments efficiently to reach the widest number of vulnerable communities. Flexible planning strategies can substantially reduce the cost of infrastructure investments. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first framework that values the ability of flexible approaches to respond to climate learning, therefore more comprehensively evaluating the tradeoffs of robust and flexible adaptation strategies.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results show that climate change uncertainty can be reduced over the lifetime of an infrastructure project across different climate change trajectories. Flexibility is effective in preventing unnecessary infrastructure additions while maintaining similar reliability. However, the planning choice is informed by the social context including value of reliability and discount rate.</p>
