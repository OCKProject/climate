 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We develop a method that integrates iterative Bayesian learning about climate uncertainty into a multi-stage stochastic infrastructure planning model in order to address a critical limitation of adaptive infrastructure planning in both water supply and other domains: estimating upfront how much planners can expect to learn about climate change in the future and therefore whether adaptive approaches are likely to be reliable and cost effective. Our approach quantifies, for example, the extent to which a wet trajectory over the next 20 years increases the likelihood of a wet trajectory 40 years into the future. By applying the Bayesian model to a wide range of discrete virtual future climate observations, we develop adaptive policies that take into account all future opportunities for learning. While all approaches that use GCM ensembles face limitations, this approach provides a reasonable quantitative estimate of future learning that enables better-informed assessment of tradeoffs between planning approaches. This allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of flexible planning, which relies on learning processes that remain unquantified in previous methods, rather than assuming a priori that flexibility is a worthwhile planning goal. This is especially important for infrastructure planning where planners must prepare in advance to take a flexible approach due to the large, irreversible nature of infrastructure investments.</p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results in the Mombasa application demonstrate the nuances and tradeoffs inherent in comparing flexible and robust approaches for planning under climate uncertainty. Although the uncertainty and learning is driven by the climate system, decisions about whether flexibility is a valuable tool in mitigating risk are strongly influenced by social, technological, and economic factors. The large economies of scale in earthen dams make flexibility less valuable; it is better to choose a robust alternative when it is not much more expensive to do so. Reverse osmosis (RO) desalination, however, is an inherent modular technology with modest economies of scale, lending itself more readily to flexible planning. The discount rate, which trades off future adaptation goals for immediate rewards, promotes flexible approaches. Flexibility often delays investment, which can be especially impactful in resource-scarce areas where unused capital could support other critical infrastructure services. The value society places on access to reliable, sustainable water supplies, and the damage of short-term outages is also influential.</p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future extensions to other planning problems which have differences in degree and nature of uncertainty, hydrological sensitivity to climate change, and social context can be used to assess under what conditions flexible or static planning approaches are more appropriate. Future work combining this learning approach with bottom-up vulnerability assessments can address the limitations of GCM-based probability distributions
