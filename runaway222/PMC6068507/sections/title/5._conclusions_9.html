      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the context of increasing urbanization and climate change, a shift towards more
         climate-resilient cities should be at the forefront of urban planning. This fundamental
         shift is required for climate change adaptation across all sectors, and is related
         to many impacts, including human health. This study used a system thinking approach
         to consider how past and present policies and practices have influenced tree canopy
         levels in Perth. The study concluded that policies and practices that are intended
         to increase urban densities will continue to result in reductions in tree canopy levels
         unless several key changes are implemented.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The leverage points discussed in this paper provide guidance in this respect: a shift
         to a sustainable development paradigm that places greater emphasis on the environmental
         and social aspects related to tree canopy; clear goals for tree canopy levels; strong
         policies and regulations to support these goals; the power to enforce these, particularly
         in high-risk areas such as private land; and greater consideration of the interaction
         between urban planning policies, climate, and human health. Delays in the implementation
         of these actions is likely to lead a more climate-sensitive city and increased risks
         to public health.
