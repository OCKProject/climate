  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. What Is the Challenge?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first activity, ‘What is the Challenge?’, a variation of the Co-Effects Template was developed focusing on the selected challenges of temperature, urban form, and public health. The resulting conceptual model was named the Global–Local Model (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f002" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f002">Figure 2</a>), and highlights that the interaction between urban areas, temperature, and health occurs at the global and local scale.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two loops of the model reflect the considerable differences in the spatial and temporal scales of the interactions between urban form and climate. The ‘Global Loop’ is relatively unresponsive to changes in local urban form due to the small fraction of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Perth, and the inertia of the climate system. This inertia results in a delay between GHG emissions and a change to the climate represented by the parallel lines on the link between ‘Urban form’ and ‘Global climate’. In contrast, the influence of the UHI effect in the ‘Local Loop’ is more immediate and determined by the natural and built characteristics of Perth. In terms of exposure to heat, strategies targeting the Local Loop represent the best opportunity at the local level to progress towards a more climate-resilient city. </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between urban form and local climate within the context of climate change is depicted in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f003" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f003">Figure 3</a>. The diagram shows how a shift in the distribution of climatic conditions affects the frequency of extreme temperatures. Panel (a) depicts the increased probability of hot weather and record hot weather as a result of climate change [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second shift in temperature distribution will present multiple challenges. The challenge selected for this study was the management of tree canopy in areas targeted for urban infill and higher densities.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. What Is the Story?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second activity considered the historical review of the impact of planning policy and legislation on trees in Perth by Brunner and Cozens [
   <a rid="B53-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-ijerph-15-01547">53</a>]. This review indicated that the regulation and protection of trees in urban areas had been given limited attention in planning policy. More recent reductions in vegetation became apparent around the year 2000, and coincided with a change in the type of infill development. The authors concluded that “the protection of mature vegetation and trees in WA has been afforded little time or consequence”.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A content analysis of key planning policy documents highlighted climate aspects that focused on climate change mitigation, particularly the need for increased energy efficiency and the transport efficiencies of compact cities. Although ambient temperature is a critical determinant of energy use, the effect of urbanization and tree canopy changes on ambient temperature was largely overlooked in the policies reviewed. The potential loss of tree canopy as a result of urban consolidation and the issue of UHIs are only mentioned in two non-statutory documents: the Capital City Planning Framework and the Climate Change Management Draft Guidelines. No explicit UHI mitigation requirements were included in the statutory planning policies that were reviewed.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The primary focus of the WESTPLAN Heatwave is managing health outcomes related to heatwaves. The plan discusses the increased risk of extreme heat associated with climate change and the UHI effect. It also recognizes the links between heatwaves and infrastructure such as roads, railways, bridges, power supply, and industry. In contrast, the Natural Hazards and Disaster Policy, which aims to plan for natural disasters as a fundamental element of all planning documents, makes no specific mention of heatwaves, referring only to floods, cyclones, storm surges, severe storms, landslides, bushfires, and earthquakes. This suggests that the connection between the built environment and extreme heat are not afforded a high priority in natural hazard planning in WA. This view is supported by the Natural Hazard Risk in Perth study, which stated that heatwaves are probably the most underrated weather hazard in Australia [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. Can I See How You Think?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The systems workshop produced 16 pair-blended influence diagrams, as described in the methods. A selection of these diagrams is shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f004" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f004">Figure 4</a>, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f005" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f005">Figure 5</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f006" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f006">Figure 6</a>, with each of these representing a dynamic hypothesis of the system.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hypothesis represented in this influence diagram (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f004" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f004">Figure 4</a>) is that the extent of tree canopy affects a range of ecological services (including shade, visual amenity, and reduction in heat and air pollutants) that has flow-on effects to health and well-being. As these effects are realized, this leads to greater awareness of the benefits of trees on quality of life, which affects the status given to trees by the community. This status can influence the extent to which trees are included in the design phase via both policy and market (property values) mechanisms.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f005" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f005">Figure 5</a> depicts how management practices can be influenced by different factors over time. Urban infill and development has a direct influence on the extent of tree canopy. Tree canopy loss leads to reductions in shade and higher temperatures; both have detrimental effects on liveability, which is defined in the Capital City Framework as “the capacity of a place to deliver the everyday qualities of life to which most of us aspire”. This includes qualities such as accessibility to amenities, a safe and healthy living environment, a sense of community, vibrancy, and choice [
   <a rid="B55-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-15-01547">55</a>]. Urban character was selected by this pair as a separate variable. They also showed that increases in heat can escalate as higher energy use (air conditioning) releases more waste heat into the environment. This section of the diagram represents important aspects of the UHI effect, and also recognises the impact on the Global Loop, as higher energy use results in increases in greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, which over time may influence the health and extent of tree canopy.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As these effects are realized, public pressure is exerted on management practices to counter the original reductions in tree canopy. The types of processes include members of the community lobbying local government or local politicians to retain trees in their community, the formation of community groups that increase awareness of the issue through direct involvement in the community, and consumer pressure for property in areas with good tree cover.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A shared viewpoint of participants from the development and environment sectors is shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f006" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f006">Figure 6</a>. As urbanization increases, there are more space demands for services and infrastructure such as housing, roads, driveways, and utilities. This leads to competition for space. As the availability of space is reduced, policies and practices will affect tree canopy either directly (such as street tree policy) or indirectly (drainage, essential services). The extent of tree canopy will influence the available space for other services. This ‘loop’ is essentially about a number of variables that in some circumstances are viewed as ‘competing interests’. A related workshop comment was that the protection or provision of trees is given a lower priority than many other infrastructure requirements.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another feedback loop is shown where the changes in tree canopy can lead to increases in temperature, which may influence tree health and canopy levels. The change in temperature and tree canopy levels affects a broad range of social and health variables that influence the overall quality of life. Once again, the participants saw the community value of trees as a key variable in influencing tree canopy via a combination of resources for tree management and changes in the extent to which other policies impact on trees.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequent group discussions identified and ranked the most critical variables in determining tree canopy levels. The top six variables with total scores in brackets were:
   <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Urbanization policies, regulations, and practice (35)</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.4. What Drives System Behaviour?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The information from each of the previous steps was analysed post-workshop. Features considered critical to determining system behaviour, such as goals, rules, information flows, and feedback structures, were identified. Analysis of these features provided significant insight into the factors that have the most influence on tree canopy levels in areas of urban infill in Perth. These factors included:
   <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Planning policies and practices are driven predominantly by the goal of a more compact city, resulting in significant reductions in tree canopy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>A lack of policies and regulations to support the inclusion and retention of trees in a more compact city.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Accounting processes with regard to urban infrastructure do not adequately capture the value of services provided by trees or the cost of their removal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>A lack of awareness about the range of benefits provided by tree canopy and the long-term costs associated with their removal.</p>
    </div>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Urban consolidation policies were seen as a strong influence on system behaviour. The vision of Directions 2031 is for “a world-class liveable city: green, vibrant, more compact, and accessible with a unique sense of place”. The “more compact” element of this vision is supported by a clear target of an extra 154,000 infill dwellings and the Urban Growth Monitor, which reports on the construction of dwellings in urban areas [
   <a rid="B56-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-ijerph-15-01547">56</a>]. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f007" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f007">Figure 7</a> is a stock-and-flow map that depicts how these support mechanisms drive progress towards the infill target. The key stock (represented by the rectangle) is urban density, which is measured by the Urban Growth Monitor. The rate of infill development (represented by the tap symbol) is driven by the size of the gap between the current level of urban density and the urban-density target. As urban density approaches the target level, the gap between the two will reduce, the rate of infill development will slow down, and ideally, the urban density target will be met. These mechanisms are supported by a range of policies and market interest in meeting the demand for new dwellings.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The influence that the ‘Compact Mechanism’ has on tree canopy stock is represented by the dotted links in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f008" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f008">Figure 8</a>. Findings from the policy review and the workshop activities support the conclusion that current urban infill practices typically reduce opportunities to plant trees and increase the rate of removal of trees, both leading to a decline in tree canopy. Directions 2031 provides support for a more compact city, but contains no specific tree canopy targets, and no provision for monitoring tree canopy levels, planting, or the removal of trees. We conclude that, in the context of Directions 2031, a reduction of tree canopy levels in areas of urban infill are likely to be a side effect of mechanisms to support a more compact city.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between urban density and tree canopy levels depicted above can be analysed using system archetypes. In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f009" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f009">Figure 9</a>, the relationship between the Compact City and the World-Class Liveable City is expressed in terms of an archetype called “Shifting the Burden” [
   <a rid="B32-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-15-01547">32</a>]. This archetype depicts a situation where the gap between the desired state and the current state of the system can be managed by two alternative solutions: a symptomatic solution or a fundamental solution. Symptomatic solutions are frequently applied because they respond to a problem symptom and are often 
   <span class="italic">part of</span> the fundamental solution; however, they can also undermine progress towards the desired outcome in other ways. If management of the system is focused primarily on the Compact Vision, other important aspects of liveability such as tree canopy can be neglected, which is expressed in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f009" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f009">Figure 9</a> as ‘Tunnel Vision’. In the long run, the adverse effects may be recognised, and result in a shift to the fundamental solution. However, in this situation, the shift is limited by factors that are difficult to reverse, such as the removal of mature canopy trees and urban design that fails to incorporate trees. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The failure of the current system to account for the value of trees and the external costs associated with reductions in tree canopy was identified as a significant barrier to the effective management of tree canopy in urban infill areas. Although the ecosystem services provided by trees are critical to a healthy urban environment, the value of these services is largely absent from traditional economic approaches that drive budgets and private developers. While it was recognised that there was a willingness to pay a premium for greener areas that could support market mechanisms to increase tree canopy, it was considered likely to be limited to higher socio-economic areas. This is supported by studies in other cities that have shown that low income areas recorded lower rates of vegetation [
   <a rid="B57-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57-ijerph-15-01547">57</a>,
   <a rid="B58-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58-ijerph-15-01547">58</a>] as well as higher temperatures [
   <a rid="B58-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58-ijerph-15-01547">58</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extent of community awareness influences tree canopy via pressure on policy makers and the market place to incorporate trees into urban environments. The strength of this feedback is a critical determinant of the system’s behaviour; however, evidence from this study indicates that at the time of this study, this feedback loop is relatively weak. As stated in the Capital City Planning Framework [
   <a rid="B55-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-15-01547">55</a>], the incremental nature of tree canopy loss often means that it “goes unnoticed until it is too late to undertake preventative actions”. In effect, as levels gradually decline, lower tree canopy levels may become the new norm.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.5. What Are the Leverage Points?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most powerful leverage point in Meadow’s list [
   <a rid="B49-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-15-01547">49</a>] is paradigms. While paradigms are difficult to change, they have the potential to influence decision-making across all levels and aspects of the system. The paradigm shift required here is to move from a system dominated by narrow or short-term economic considerations to one that is based on a sustainable development paradigm that takes into account the environmental, social, and economic costs and benefits of tree canopy in urban areas for current and future generations.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Goals capture the purpose or function of the system, and are a powerful leverage point because they are an indication of what we value most and can have a significant influence on all aspects of the system [
   <a rid="B31-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-15-01547">31</a>]. While the study highlighted that there were clear goals for urban density targets, these were lacking for tree canopy. Introducing a specific goal or target for tree canopy levels would create a strong leverage point that could serve as an additional indicator of progress towards a more liveable city.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effective goals must be supported by rules such as policies and laws, incentives, constraints, and disincentives. If the goal of the system has been narrowed, the rules will tend to follow suit. The review of past and current policies and the findings of the workshop indicated that current rules do not provide adequate protection of tree canopy levels in Perth. Rules pertaining to tree planting and removal, on both private and public land, are critical. One example highlighted in the workshop was the need for rules to reduce the widespread practice of removing all vegetation, particularly mature trees, during urban development. The physical limitations created by other policies, such as zoning limitations, setback, and height limits and requirements for other infrastructure may severely limit the physical opportunities to incorporate trees into the urban design. If current rules discourage the inclusion of trees in urban design, these rules should be reconsidered. Community tree planting programs can play a significant role in tree management plans, and have the added advantage of increasing community awareness regarding the importance of trees in urban environments. However, these are typically limited to public land, so the influence on the critical space of private land is limited.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Information flows are strong leverage points in changing system behaviour. The study indicated that there are significant gaps and biases in the information flows of the system. In the absence of thorough tree canopy monitoring and reporting, tree canopy levels will continue to be largely overlooked. Improvements in information flows are also needed with respect to the links between tree canopy levels and a range of social, environmental, and economic factors. Responsibility for these factors is dispersed across many sectors, and highlights the need for a whole-of-government approach to manage tree canopy. </p>
