      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The systems workshop produced 16 pair-blended influence diagrams, as described in
         the methods. A selection of these diagrams is shown in 
         <a>Figure 4</a>, 
         <a>Figure 5</a> and 
         <a>Figure 6</a>, with each of these representing a dynamic hypothesis of the system.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hypothesis represented in this influence diagram (
         <a>Figure 4</a>) is that the extent of tree canopy affects a range of ecological services (including
         shade, visual amenity, and reduction in heat and air pollutants) that has flow-on
         effects to health and well-being. As these effects are realized, this leads to greater
         awareness of the benefits of trees on quality of life, which affects the status given
         to trees by the community. This status can influence the extent to which trees are
         included in the design phase via both policy and market (property values) mechanisms.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a>Figure 5</a> depicts how management practices can be influenced by different factors over time.
         Urban infill and development has a direct influence on the extent of tree canopy.
         Tree canopy loss leads to reductions in shade and higher temperatures; both have detrimental
         effects on liveability, which is defined in the Capital City Framework as “the capacity
         of a place to deliver the everyday qualities of life to which most of us aspire”.
         This includes qualities such as accessibility to amenities, a safe and healthy living
         environment, a sense of community, vibrancy, and choice [
         <a>55</a>]. Urban character was selected by this pair as a separate variable. They also showed
         that increases in heat can escalate as higher energy use (air conditioning) releases
         more waste heat into the environment. This section of the diagram represents important
         aspects of the UHI effect, and also recognises the impact on the Global Loop, as higher
         energy use results in increases in greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate
         change, which over time may influence the health and extent of tree canopy.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As these effects are realized, public pressure is exerted on management practices
         to counter the original reductions in tree canopy. The types of processes include
         members of the community lobbying local government or local politicians to retain
         trees in their community, the formation of community groups that increase awareness
         of the issue through direct involvement in the community, and consumer pressure for
         property in areas with good tree cover.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A shared viewpoint of participants from the development and environment sectors is
         shown in 
         <a>Figure 6</a>. As urbanization increases, there are more space demands for services and infrastructure
         such as housing, roads, driveways, and utilities. This leads to competition for space.
         As the availability of space is reduced, policies and practices will affect tree canopy
         either directly (such as street tree policy) or indirectly (drainage, essential services).
         The extent of tree canopy will influence the available space for other services. This
         ‘loop’ is essentially about a number of variables that in some circumstances are viewed
         as ‘competing interests’. A related workshop comment was that the protection or provision
         of trees is given a lower priority than many other infrastructure requirements.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another feedback loop is shown where the changes in tree canopy can lead to increases
         in temperature, which may influence tree health and canopy levels. The change in temperature
         and tree canopy levels affects a broad range of social and health variables that influence
         the overall quality of life. Once again, the participants saw the community value
         of trees as a key variable in influencing tree canopy via a combination of resources
         for tree management and changes in the extent to which other policies impact on trees.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequent group discussions identified and ranked the most critical variables in
         determining tree canopy levels. The top six variables with total scores in brackets
         were:

      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The qualitative models presented at the workshop were influenced by the opinions and
         expertise of the workshop participants. Further research could test or expand these
         models with other key stakeholders.
