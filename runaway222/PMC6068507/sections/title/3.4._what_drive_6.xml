 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.4. What Drives System Behaviour?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The information from each of the previous steps was analysed post-workshop. Features considered critical to determining system behaviour, such as goals, rules, information flows, and feedback structures, were identified. Analysis of these features provided significant insight into the factors that have the most influence on tree canopy levels in areas of urban infill in Perth. These factors included:
  <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Planning policies and practices are driven predominantly by the goal of a more compact city, resulting in significant reductions in tree canopy.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>A lack of policies and regulations to support the inclusion and retention of trees in a more compact city.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Accounting processes with regard to urban infrastructure do not adequately capture the value of services provided by trees or the cost of their removal.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>A lack of awareness about the range of benefits provided by tree canopy and the long-term costs associated with their removal.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Urban consolidation policies were seen as a strong influence on system behaviour. The vision of Directions 2031 is for “a world-class liveable city: green, vibrant, more compact, and accessible with a unique sense of place”. The “more compact” element of this vision is supported by a clear target of an extra 154,000 infill dwellings and the Urban Growth Monitor, which reports on the construction of dwellings in urban areas [
  <a rid="B56-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-ijerph-15-01547">56</a>]. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f007" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f007">Figure 7</a> is a stock-and-flow map that depicts how these support mechanisms drive progress towards the infill target. The key stock (represented by the rectangle) is urban density, which is measured by the Urban Growth Monitor. The rate of infill development (represented by the tap symbol) is driven by the size of the gap between the current level of urban density and the urban-density target. As urban density approaches the target level, the gap between the two will reduce, the rate of infill development will slow down, and ideally, the urban density target will be met. These mechanisms are supported by a range of policies and market interest in meeting the demand for new dwellings.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The influence that the ‘Compact Mechanism’ has on tree canopy stock is represented by the dotted links in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f008" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f008">Figure 8</a>. Findings from the policy review and the workshop activities support the conclusion that current urban infill practices typically reduce opportunities to plant trees and increase the rate of removal of trees, both leading to a decline in tree canopy. Directions 2031 provides support for a more compact city, but contains no specific tree canopy targets, and no provision for monitoring tree canopy levels, planting, or the removal of trees. We conclude that, in the context of Directions 2031, a reduction of tree canopy levels in areas of urban infill are likely to be a side effect of mechanisms to support a more compact city.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between urban density and tree canopy levels depicted above can be analysed using system archetypes. In 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f009" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f009">Figure 9</a>, the relationship between the Compact City and the World-Class Liveable City is expressed in terms of an archetype called “Shifting the Burden” [
  <a rid="B32-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-15-01547">32</a>]. This archetype depicts a situation where the gap between the desired state and the current state of the system can be managed by two alternative solutions: a symptomatic solution or a fundamental solution. Symptomatic solutions are frequently applied because they respond to a problem symptom and are often 
  <span class="italic">part of</span> the fundamental solution; however, they can also undermine progress towards the desired outcome in other ways. If management of the system is focused primarily on the Compact Vision, other important aspects of liveability such as tree canopy can be neglected, which is expressed in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01547-f009" href="#ijerph-15-01547-f009">Figure 9</a> as ‘Tunnel Vision’. In the long run, the adverse effects may be recognised, and result in a shift to the fundamental solution. However, in this situation, the shift is limited by factors that are difficult to reverse, such as the removal of mature canopy trees and urban design that fails to incorporate trees. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The failure of the current system to account for the value of trees and the external costs associated with reductions in tree canopy was identified as a significant barrier to the effective management of tree canopy in urban infill areas. Although the ecosystem services provided by trees are critical to a healthy urban environment, the value of these services is largely absent from traditional economic approaches that drive budgets and private developers. While it was recognised that there was a willingness to pay a premium for greener areas that could support market mechanisms to increase tree canopy, it was considered likely to be limited to higher socio-economic areas. This is supported by studies in other cities that have shown that low income areas recorded lower rates of vegetation [
  <a rid="B57-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57-ijerph-15-01547">57</a>,
  <a rid="B58-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58-ijerph-15-01547">58</a>] as well as higher temperatures [
  <a rid="B58-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58-ijerph-15-01547">58</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extent of community awareness influences tree canopy via pressure on policy makers and the market place to incorporate trees into urban environments. The strength of this feedback is a critical determinant of the system’s behaviour; however, evidence from this study indicates that at the time of this study, this feedback loop is relatively weak. As stated in the Capital City Planning Framework [
  <a rid="B55-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-15-01547">55</a>], the incremental nature of tree canopy loss often means that it “goes unnoticed until it is too late to undertake preventative actions”. In effect, as levels gradually decline, lower tree canopy levels may become the new norm.
