      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strategies that encourage the development of climate-resilient cities should be an
         integral part of climate change adaptation. Climate change projections for higher
         temperatures can be compounded in cities by the creation of urban heat islands (UHI).
         The UHI effect is caused by the typical characteristics of urban areas that result
         in higher temperatures than their surrounding non-urban areas [
         <a>1</a>,
         <a>2</a>,
         <a>3</a>]. These include lower rates of evapotranspiration due to less vegetation, greater
         storage of heat from solar radiation due to lower surface albedo, and more anthropogenic
         sources of heat [
         <a>2</a>,
         <a>4</a>]. Numerous cities around the world have reported UHI effects ranging from 2 °C to
         12 °C, depending on the individual characteristics of a city [
         <a>3</a>,
         <a>5</a>,
         <a>6</a>,
         <a>7</a>,
         <a>8</a>,
         <a>9</a>]. A study of 50 of the most populous cities in the United States (US) reported that
         between 1961 and 2010, temperature increased at twice the rate of background global
         increases for all of the cities that had undergone substantial urbanization during
         that period [
         <a>10</a>]. Another study in China reported an average increase in average air temperatures
         due to urbanization of 0.124 degrees for every decade [
         <a>4</a>]. UHI can also be intensified by heatwaves [
         <a>11</a>], which are likely to occur with higher frequency and duration as a consequence of
         climate change [
         <a>12</a>]. These and other studies demonstrate the potential of the UHI effect to amplify
         the warming expected from climate change.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential public health implications of higher temperatures, particularly heatwaves,
         are well documented. The European heatwave of 2003 recorded approximately 45,000 deaths
         [
         <a>13</a>]. In Australia, heatwaves have resulted in more fatalities than all other natural
         hazards combined [
         <a>14</a>]. Studies reporting heat-related mortality has been reported in all of the capital
         cities in Australia [
         <a>15</a>]. A recent example is the estimated 500 excess deaths recorded in the 2009 heatwave
         in southeast Australia [
         <a>16</a>]. Heat-related deaths are often linked to the exacerbation of existing conditions
         such as cardiovascular disease or respiratory illness [
         <a>14</a>,
         <a>17</a>,
         <a>18</a>,
         <a>19</a>]. Health impacts can also be compounded by increases in ground level ozone, which
         can occur as a result of higher temperatures [
         <a>20</a>,
         <a>21</a>]. Vulnerability to the health effects of heatwaves or extreme heat can be affected
         by exposure to heat, sensitivity to that exposure, and the capacity to adapt by implementing
         suitable coping strategies.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combined effect of climate change and UHI should be considered in light of increasing
         urbanization. The percentage of the world’s population living in urban areas has increased
         from 30% in 1950 to a current level of 55% and a projected level of 68% by the year
         2050 [
         <a>22</a>]. Given these increases and the well-established deleterious effects of extreme heat
         on human health, it is critical that the potential influence of urban planning on
         ambient temperatures is prioritized.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper reports on a case-study in Perth, Western Australia (WA) that focuses on
         the interaction between the built environment and heat in the context of climate change
         adaptation. Perth is an isolated urban centre undergoing significant population growth
         and ageing. The number of heat-related deaths in Perth is expected to double by the
         year 2050 [
         <a>23</a>]. A previous study, which used a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) methodology, determined
         that the projected increase in heatwaves and days over 35 °C presented one of the
         highest risks to human health associated with climate change in WA [
         <a>24</a>,
         <a>25</a>,
         <a>26</a>]. The study also recognized that exposure to heat could be exacerbated in some areas
         of Perth due to the occurrence of the urban heat island (UHI) effect.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A fundamental policy response of Perth’s projected population increase has been urban
         consolidation, primarily through urban infill in inner metropolitan areas. This significant
         change in urban form has the potential to contribute to the formation of UHIs over
         the coming decades. Mitigation strategies for the UHI effect include increasing urban
         vegetation, increasing the albedo of built surfaces and reducing waste heat emissions.
         Reductions of between 1 °C and 7 °C in city-wide air temperatures have been reported
         as a result of UHI mitigation [
         <a>10</a>]. Vegetative strategies, particularly tree planting, are generally found to be one
         of the most effective of all of the UHI mitigation strategies [
         <a>27</a>,
         <a>28</a>,
         <a>29</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A study in Perth was conducted as part of the national Commonwealth Scientific and
         Industrial Research (CSIRO) Urbanism, Climate Adaptation, and Health Research Cluster
         (the Cluster). The study combined HIA and systems approaches to develop effective
         adaptive strategies to reduce the potential health impacts of climate change in urban
         areas in Australia. The study identified heatwaves as the greatest health risk related
         to climate change in Perth. Following this, systems approaches were used to consider
         strategies to reduce health impacts associated with heatwaves and higher temperatures.
         This paper reports on this phase of the research. The study received ethics approval
         from the Human Research Ethics Committee at Curtin University.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Systems approaches support understanding and decision-making in complex systems. Interactions
         in complex systems typically include a network of circular feedback effects, so as
         one variable in the system is changed, a range of outcomes, both intended and unintended,
         will occur [
         <a>30</a>,
         <a>31</a>]. A common response to complexity is to divide an issue into segments and design
         policies within that segment; however, policies that emerge from this process are
         often ineffective in the long run because they are not based on an understanding of
         the behaviour of the wider system [
         <a>32</a>,
         <a>33</a>]. A range of different methods can be employed when undertaking a systems approach,
         many of which involve model building in group situations and cycles of elicitation,
         integration, representation, and reflection [
         <a>34</a>,
         <a>35</a>,
         <a>36</a>,
         <a>37</a>,
         <a>38</a>,
         <a>39</a>,
         <a>40</a>,
         <a>41</a>]. This type of collaborative modelling process is particularly useful when different
         experiences and viewpoints of the challenge can improve understandings of the structure
         and behaviour of the system [
         <a>34</a>]. In a systematic review of the use of systems thinking in public health research,
         Carey et al. [
         <a>39</a>] reviewed methods ranging from qualitative, action-based research to quantitative
         dynamic model building, concluding that the use of qualitative techniques were likely
         to be the most useful approach for public health research.
