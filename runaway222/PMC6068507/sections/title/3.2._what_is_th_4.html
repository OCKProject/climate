      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second activity considered the historical review of the impact of planning policy
         and legislation on trees in Perth by Brunner and Cozens [
         <a>53</a>]. This review indicated that the regulation and protection of trees in urban areas
         had been given limited attention in planning policy. More recent reductions in vegetation
         became apparent around the year 2000, and coincided with a change in the type of infill
         development. The authors concluded that “the protection of mature vegetation and trees
         in WA has been afforded little time or consequence”.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A content analysis of key planning policy documents highlighted climate aspects that
         focused on climate change mitigation, particularly the need for increased energy efficiency
         and the transport efficiencies of compact cities. Although ambient temperature is
         a critical determinant of energy use, the effect of urbanization and tree canopy changes
         on ambient temperature was largely overlooked in the policies reviewed. The potential
         loss of tree canopy as a result of urban consolidation and the issue of UHIs are only
         mentioned in two non-statutory documents: the Capital City Planning Framework and
         the Climate Change Management Draft Guidelines. No explicit UHI mitigation requirements
         were included in the statutory planning policies that were reviewed.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The primary focus of the WESTPLAN Heatwave is managing health outcomes related to
         heatwaves. The plan discusses the increased risk of extreme heat associated with climate
         change and the UHI effect. It also recognizes the links between heatwaves and infrastructure
         such as roads, railways, bridges, power supply, and industry. In contrast, the Natural
         Hazards and Disaster Policy, which aims to plan for natural disasters as a fundamental
         element of all planning documents, makes no specific mention of heatwaves, referring
         only to floods, cyclones, storm surges, severe storms, landslides, bushfires, and
         earthquakes. This suggests that the connection between the built environment and extreme
         heat are not afforded a high priority in natural hazard planning in WA. This view
         is supported by the Natural Hazard Risk in Perth study, which stated that heatwaves
         are probably the most underrated weather hazard in Australia [
         <a>54</a>].
