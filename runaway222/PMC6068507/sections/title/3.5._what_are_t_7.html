      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most powerful leverage point in Meadowâ€™s list [
         <a>49</a>] is paradigms. While paradigms are difficult to change, they have the potential to
         influence decision-making across all levels and aspects of the system. The paradigm
         shift required here is to move from a system dominated by narrow or short-term economic
         considerations to one that is based on a sustainable development paradigm that takes
         into account the environmental, social, and economic costs and benefits of tree canopy
         in urban areas for current and future generations.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Goals capture the purpose or function of the system, and are a powerful leverage point
         because they are an indication of what we value most and can have a significant influence
         on all aspects of the system [
         <a>31</a>]. While the study highlighted that there were clear goals for urban density targets,
         these were lacking for tree canopy. Introducing a specific goal or target for tree
         canopy levels would create a strong leverage point that could serve as an additional
         indicator of progress towards a more liveable city.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effective goals must be supported by rules such as policies and laws, incentives,
         constraints, and disincentives. If the goal of the system has been narrowed, the rules
         will tend to follow suit. The review of past and current policies and the findings
         of the workshop indicated that current rules do not provide adequate protection of
         tree canopy levels in Perth. Rules pertaining to tree planting and removal, on both
         private and public land, are critical. One example highlighted in the workshop was
         the need for rules to reduce the widespread practice of removing all vegetation, particularly
         mature trees, during urban development. The physical limitations created by other
         policies, such as zoning limitations, setback, and height limits and requirements
         for other infrastructure may severely limit the physical opportunities to incorporate
         trees into the urban design. If current rules discourage the inclusion of trees in
         urban design, these rules should be reconsidered. Community tree planting programs
         can play a significant role in tree management plans, and have the added advantage
         of increasing community awareness regarding the importance of trees in urban environments.
         However, these are typically limited to public land, so the influence on the critical
         space of private land is limited.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Information flows are strong leverage points in changing system behaviour. The study
         indicated that there are significant gaps and biases in the information flows of the
         system. In the absence of thorough tree canopy monitoring and reporting, tree canopy
         levels will continue to be largely overlooked. Improvements in information flows are
         also needed with respect to the links between tree canopy levels and a range of social,
         environmental, and economic factors. Responsibility for these factors is dispersed
         across many sectors, and highlights the need for a whole-of-government approach to
         manage tree canopy.
