      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The method used in this study was collaborative conceptual modelling (CCM), which
         is a systems approach developed by Newell and Proust that has been explained elsewhere
         in greater detail [
         <a>36</a>,
         <a>42</a>]. This approach captures different viewpoints to create a shared understanding of
         the issue of interest, culminating in ‘dynamic hypotheses’ that describe simple feedback
         structures with the potential to dominate system behaviour. This understanding can
         be used as a basis for decision-making within the issue of interest.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CCM consists of a series of six co-evolving activities that can be tailored to suit
         the characteristics and objectives of the particular research. The activities conducted
         in this project were:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">• What is the Challenge?</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The step defines the key challenge faced in a particular situation and requires the
         input of a range of stakeholders. This activity was guided by a pre-existing conceptual
         model that was developed as part of the broader cluster and previously described by
         Proust el al [
         <a>42</a>]. The model, called the ‘Co-Effects Template’ (
         <a>Figure 1</a>), was developed after several individual project workshops, and a final integrative
         workshop with nine participants from projects cutting across topics of thermal stress,
         urban food systems, and climate change adaptation. The template captures a high-level
         view of the urban climate–health system that can be applied to multiple challenges.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">• What is the Story?</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second step considered the effect of past and current policies on trees in urban
         Perth. An existing review of the impact of historical planning policy and legislation
         on trees in Perth provided an assessment of previous policies. Content analysis of
         current planning policy documents was undertaken using a coding scheme based on key
         words related to vegetation, climate, and health. Similar approaches have been used
         in a textual analysis of the extent to which health is incorporated into the planning
         strategies of major Australian cities [
         <a>43</a>]. The policies reviewed were: Directions 2031; State Planning Policies of Urban Growth
         and Settlement and Residential Design Codes; Liveable Neighbourhoods; Capital City
         Planning Framework; and Climate Change Management Draft Guidelines (WA Local Government
         Association). A review of the State Emergency Response Plan for Heatwaves (WESTPLAN
         Heatwave) and the State Planning Policy for Natural Hazards and Disaster was also
         undertaken as part of this activity.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">• Can I see how you think?</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This CCM activity reflects the need to share different perspectives (or mental models)
         of a particular issue to enhance understanding of the system, and was conducted as
         a half-day workshop. Key stakeholders with a clear connection to the issue were identified,
         including the state government (Departments of Health, Planning, Environment and Conservation
         and Water, the Environmental Protection Authority and the Building Commission), local
         government, private developers, academics, and professional institutes. A total of
         32 representatives from the health, planning, development, and environment sectors
         across state and local government and the private sector attended the workshop. The
         key focus of the workshop was the level of tree canopy in areas targeted for urban
         infill. Each participant was provided with basic instructions on how to construct
         a simple model called an influence diagram. Influence diagrams are a simple qualitative
         systems model designed to capture the key interactions, including the feedback structure,
         of the topic of interest, and have been used to investigate health issues such as
         obesity, safety, and healthy eating habits [
         <a>38</a>,
         <a>44</a>,
         <a>45</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants were given 15 minutes to draw an individual influence diagram depicting
         their viewpoint of the issue, including: three to four key variables that have the
         largest influence on tree canopy levels in Perth; three to four of the most important
         effects of tree canopy; and feedback links between these variables. Each participant
         was then allocated a partner from a different sector and asked to explain their influence
         diagram. Each pair had 15 minutes to construct a ‘pair-blended’ diagram that integrated
         both viewpoints. The diagrams were presented and discussed at table groups, and were
         also displayed around the room for participants to review. The importance of how those
         involved in collaborative modelling articulate their own views and then develop a
         common understanding has been highlighted by Oppl [
         <a>41</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants were then divided into six groups and used the pair-blended influence
         diagrams to guide the selection of eight key variables influencing tree canopy management
         in urban infill areas. The involvement of people with relevant knowledge and expertise
         to construct models is likely to produce models that are more useful for informing
         work processes [
         <a>46</a>,
         <a>47</a>]. A simple scoring system was utilized with each participant provided with three
         coloured stickers worth one, two, or three points that were assigned to the three
         most important variables. The scores were combined and the variables were ranked.
         Each group then discussed one of the top six variables. The discussion was guided
         by key categories of: opportunities, barriers, potential conflict or synergies with
         other activities or sectors, and the identification of key stakeholder groups.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">• What drives system behaviour?</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Information from the policy review and workshop was analysed to identify key feedback
         structures and consider which elements of the system currently have the greatest level
         of influence over tree canopy levels. This informed the development of additional
         models that depict key system characteristics such as feedback loops and delays that
         typically drive system behaviour. As well as updated influence diagrams, other typical
         qualitative systems models such as stock-and-flow maps and system archetypes were
         developed [
         <a>30</a>,
         <a>32</a>,
         <a>37</a>,
         <a>42</a>,
         <a>48</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">• What are the leverage points?</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leverage points are places within a complex system where a small shift in one thing
         can produce significant and enduring changes in the system. Identification of these
         points was facilitated by a consideration of Meadows’ [
         <a>49</a>] classification, which includes the mindset and goals of the system, the rules and
         who controls them, information and materials flows, feedback loops, and numbers such
         as subsidies and taxes. System archetypes, which are generic feedback structures with
         characteristic behaviour that occur in a wide range of situations, were also used
         in this step. An understanding of these structures and their behaviour can facilitate
         the identification of effective management strategies [
         <a>30</a>,
         <a>32</a>,
         <a>34</a>,
         <a>50</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">• Can we have new eyes?</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The final activity of CCM reconsiders the original challenge defined in the first
         activity. The understanding gained from the CCM process supports new mental models
         or ‘new eyes’ that can help develop more effective management strategies to the challenge.
