For the two major TEs, we set the PDF and threshold temperature of the two TEs based on the following rationale.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, the threshold of Greenland ice-sheet melting is defined as the temperature increase at which the surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet becomes negative. It should be noted that it may take hundreds of years to reach a negative mass balance after the temperature increases to the threshold. In the AR5 (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2013</a>), the threshold temperature of the Greenland ice sheet is given as greater than 1 °C (low confidence) and lower than 4 °C (medium confidence). These statements suggest that we can be relatively confident that the threshold of Greenland ice sheet melting is below 4 °C, and also implies that the threshold might be lower, and closer to 1 than 4 °C. Robinson et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2012</a>) estimated the threshold temperature to be 1.6 °C with a 95% confidence interval of 0.8–3.2 °C. In addition to the above studies, Leverman et al. (2013) discussed the threshold of abrupt Greenland ice sheet loss to be between 0.8 and 2.2 °C (90% credible interval). Based on these values, we employed a log-normal distribution for the threshold temperature of Greenland ice-sheet melting using 1.6 °C as the best estimate and 1.0–4.0 °C as the 95% confidence interval., This setting of the PDF is consistent with our assumption of a threshold around 1.6 °C with a right-skewed distribution. Second, the threshold of Arctic summer sea-ice loss is the temperature at which the Arctic Ocean is in a nearly ice-free in September, and was determined as follows. Several models have estimated that a largely ice-free Arctic sea in summer would begin around 2 °C above the present temperature (Lenton 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2012</a>). Massonnet et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2012</a>) identified a Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) subset to represent September Arctic sea ice extent, indicating an increase of 1.6–2.1 °C (mean 1.9 °C) from the present period (2.2–2.7 °C and mean 2.5 °C from preindustrial levels) as the annual mean global surface temperature threshold for a nearly ice-free state of the Arctic Ocean in September. Therefore, we set the PDF for the threshold temperature of Arctic summer sea ice of 2.45 °C as the mean and 2.2–2.7 °C as the 68% confidence interval. The mean of 2.45 °C was almost consistent with a mean value of 2.5 °C in the CMIP 5 subset presented in Fig. 12.31e of AR5 (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2013</a>), and did not conflict with the best estimate of ~ 2.0 °C (above present) given by Mahlstein and Knutti (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2012</a>). Meanwhile, setting 2.2–2.7 °C as the 68% confidence interval (1.95–2.95 °C as the 95% confidence interval) enabled the possibility of the threshold falling in the range beyond of 2.2–2.7 °C, which should be considered because of the large variabilities of the thresholds in the models presented in Figs. 12.30 and 12.31 of the AR5 (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2013</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the probability of exceeding the thresholds by the end of this century, we used a set of global mean temperature increase projections conducted as IAM simulations in ICA-RUS. The IAM simulations were performed for several policy choices based on the target temperature at the end of this century. Details of the IAM simulations can be found in Su et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2017</a>), who computed four sets of future emission pathways, including T15, T20, and T25. Each emission pathway corresponds to a temperature pathway. These pathways each correspond to a policy target that limits the temperature increase in 2100 to below 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 °C from preindustrial levels, respectively. The IAM simulations in ICA-RUS assume the existence of a policy-maker who presumes climate sensitivity as 3.65 °C, which yields a 66% probability of achieving the policy target by additionally assuming that climate sensitivity follows a normal distribution with a mean of 3.0 and standard deviation of 1.5 (ICA-RUS report 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to T15, T20, and T25, Su et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2017</a>) computed a set of future emission pathways for a business-as-usual (BaU) scenario. The T15, T20, T25, or BaU scenarios were each associated with several future emission pathways (temperature pathways) depending on the actual climate sensitivity, which were set to 1.50, 3.00, 3.65, or 4.00 °C. These settings of climate sensitivities were used because the actual climate sensitivity for policy-making is currently unknown; that is, even though policy-makers assume 3.65 °C as the climate sensitivity, future emission pathways (temperature pathways) could differ according to the discrepancy between the actual climate sensitivity and the climate sensitivity assumed by policy-makers. For this reason, four sets of actual climate sensitivities were assumed for each of the policy choices (i.e., T15, T20, T25, and BaU). Although the IAM simulations in the ICA-RUS were also conducted under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), we focused on SSP2, which is a middle-of-the-road scenario (O’Neil et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2014</a>). As a result, our analysis included 16 emission pathways or temperature pathways (i.e., the four temperature goals, including the BaU scenario, multiplied by the four sets of climate sensitivities under SSP2).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows some of the temperature pathways with threshold ranges of 1.0–4.0 °C for the Greenland ice sheet and 1.95–2.95 °C for Arctic summer sea ice. If the actual climate sensitivity were to differ from the climate sensitivity adopted in a policy, the actual temperature increases at the end of this century would differ from the temperature goal (Su et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2015</a>). As such, our framework incorporated this uncertainty in the future temperature increase using the IAM simulations for different climate sensitivities.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the 16 emission pathways (i.e., 16 temperature pathways) and assumptions of the PDFs of the threshold temperatures, the algorithm in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> was executed as follows. First, we estimated the PDFs of the threshold temperature and climate sensitivity (Step 1). The PDF of climate sensitivity was estimated following the assumption used in the ICA-RUS (i.e., climate sensitivity is normally distributed with a mean of 3.0 and standard deviation of 1.5). Then, for each policy choice, we estimated the regression line (Step 2) between the temperature increase in 2100 and actual climate sensitivity (i.e., 1.5, 3.00, 3.65, and 4.5 °C). Scatter plots of the temperature increase in 2100 and actual climate sensitivity suggested that the relationship between the temperature increase in 2100 and actual climate sensitivity could be approximated based on linear regression lines (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Therefore, we used the estimated linear regression lines to convert the PDF of climate sensitivity into the PDF of the temperature increase in 2100 (Step 3).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It should be noted that, although linear response theory of climate sensitivity suggests that the multiplicative (i.e., two) of climate sensitivity should correspond to the same multiplicative (i.e., two) of temperature increase, such multiplicative features do not appear in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> (i.e., a twofold increase in the climate sensitivity from 1.5 to 3.0 °C does not correspond to a twofold temperature increase in 2100). The reason for this response feature of temperature increase against climate sensitivity is due to the setting of the target temperature in the IAM. When the climate sensitivity assumed by the policy is in accordance with the climate sensitivity of the actual climate, the temperature increase obtained from the IAM is almost the same as the policy target temperature, as seen at 
  <span class="italic">x</span> = 3.65 in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>. However, when the policy assumes a climate sensitivity greater than that of the actual climate, a more stringent effort to reduce emissions is performed in the IAM (Su et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2015</a>), and accordingly the temperature increase at 2100 is lower than the policy target temperature. Similarly, when policy assumes a lower climate sensitivity than that of the actual climate, the temperature increase at 2100 exceeds the policy target temperature. In other words, because we use the IAM, which controls emissions according to the policy temperature target and policy-maker assumptions regarding climate sensitivity, the temperature increase at 2100 is strongly controlled by both the temperature target at 2100 and by how much the climate sensitivity of the actual climate departs from the climate sensitivity assumed by the policy. As a result, the temperature increase in 2100 does not show a linear response to increasing of climate sensitivity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, we made a joint PDF from the PDFs of the temperature increase at 2100 and the threshold temperature (Step 4). Finally, we integrated this PDF over the domain where the threshold temperature was lower than the temperature increase at 2100 to obtain probability of exceeding the threshold temperature (Step 5).</p>
