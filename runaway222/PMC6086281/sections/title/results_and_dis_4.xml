 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the above-described algorithm, we obtained the probabilities of exceeding the threshold temperatures by 2100 (see Step 5 of the algorithm). As examples of how we integrated the joint PDFs to obtain the probabilities of exceeding the threshold, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>a, b (Arctic summer sea ice under T20 and BaU, respectively) and Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>a, b (Greenland ice sheet under T20 and BaU, respectively) show the joint PDF and the PDFs of the threshold temperature and temperature increase at 2100, respectively. Comparison of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>a, b (or Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>a, b) shows that BaU has higher probabilities of large temperature increases than T20. Compared with T20, the higher probabilities of larger temperature increases in BaU shift the center of the joint probability density from outside of the integration domain (see Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>a, 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>a) to inside of the domain (see Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>b, 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>b), resulting in higher probabilities of exceeding the thresholds under BaU. In fact, the cumulative probabilities of exceeding the thresholds, which are obtained by integrating the domain where the temperature increase is greater than the threshold, confirmed that higher target temperatures result in higher probabilities of exceeding the thresholds (see “
  <a rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec7">Appendix 1</a>”).

  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> presents the probabilities of exceeding the threshold temperatures for Arctic summer sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet (see Step 5 of the algorithm). The probabilities of exceeding the threshold for the Greenland ice sheet were estimated as 24.8 (13.6)% for T15, 44.5 (26.4)% for T20, 62.5 (39.8)% for T25, and 88.1 (77.6)% for BaU, where the number in parentheses is the probability estimated assuming that the PDF of the threshold temperature follows a uniform distribution. The probability using a uniform distribution was also applied here to investigate the sensitivity of the estimated probability against the choice of probability distribution. A uniform distribution was used for this comparative PDF as an alternative assumption. The probabilities of exceeding the threshold for Arctic summer sea ice were estimated as 2.7 (3.0)% for T15, 16.6 (17.1)% for T20, 37.3 (37.5)% for T25, and 82.4 (82.2)% for BaU. Screen and Williamson (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2017</a>) estimated that the probability of a nearly ice-free Arctic sea at the end of summer was less than 1/100,000 for a 1.5 °C increase in temperature. Although our estimation showed a slightly higher probability for T15 than that of Screen and Williamson (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2017</a>), both studies indicated that the probability of exceeding the threshold temperature for Arctic summer sea ice would be low under T15.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results showed that if the policy target temperature were low, the likelihood of exceeding the threshold for the Greenland ice sheet would be higher than that of Arctic summer sea ice. This was due to our assumption that the lower bound of the threshold for the Greenland ice sheet was lower than that of Arctic summer sea ice. The assumption that the PDF of the Greenland ice sheet was right-skewed also explained the relatively high probability of exceeding the threshold even though the temperature target was low.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, under a high temperature increase (i.e., BaU), the probability of crossing the threshold for Arctic summer sea ice would rapidly increase, as indicated by a sudden increase in the probability from 37.3% (T2.5) to 82.4% (BaU). This rapid increase in probability arose because the upper bound of the threshold temperature of Arctic summer sea ice was lower than that of the Greenland ice sheet, even though the lower bound of the threshold temperature of Arctic summer sea ice was higher than that of the Greenland ice sheet. Therefore, the probability of exceeding the threshold of Arctic summer sea ice increases rapidly under high temperature increases. However, it should be noted that these trends in the probability of exceeding thresholds strongly depend on the assumptions of the form of the PDF and range of the confidence interval.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our probabilistic assessment quantitatively showed the variations in the probability of exceeding thresholds according to policy target temperature. By placing assumptions on climate sensitivity and tipping points, this computation suggested that identifying the lower bound of the threshold and narrowing the uncertainty range of the threshold, as well as identifying their PDFs could greatly improve the confidence of the estimated probability of exceeding the threshold temperature.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It should be noted that the probabilities of exceeding thresholds were derived from several assumptions. For instance, we assumed a log-normal distribution for the Greenland ice sheet and a normal distribution for the Arctic summer sea ice, despite the fact that the probability distributions for those thresholds remain unknown. Thereby, a sensitivity analysis of the estimated probabilities was performed using a uniform distribution as the PDF of tipping points. The ranges of uniform distribution for the Greenland ice sheet and Arctic summer sea ice were set as (1.0–4.0) and (1.95–2.95), respectively. The sensitivity analysis (see the numbers in parenthesis in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) suggested that the probabilities varied according to the choice of PDFs. Therefore, it is crucial to keep updating the PDFs and threshold ranges to enhance the reliability of the assessed probabilities of exceeding thresholds. Moreover, further advancement in scientific understanding of climate sensitivity is also vitally important, because previous studies employed various PDFs to fit climate sensitivity (e.g., Hare and Meinshausen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2006</a>; Annan and Hargreaves 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2011</a>) and the likely range of climate sensitivity given in AR5 (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2013</a>) is still wide (i.e., 1.5–4.5).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the meaning of “exceeding thresholds” should be interpreted carefully. Passing the threshold of the Greenland ice sheet does not mean that it reaches the point of no return; if the temperature reaches only slightly above the threshold and then decreases below the threshold within the transition time, the surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet could become positive, although it might not recover to the original state observed before crossing the threshold (Robinson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2012</a>). Passing the threshold of Arctic summer sea ice indicates a nearly ice-free state of Arctic Ocean in September and does not necessarily mean that the climate system of the Arctic Ocean has passed into a different phase; as described in AR5 (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2013</a>), although sudden loss of Arctic summer sea ice was indicated in some climate projections (Holland et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2006</a>; Vavrus et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2012</a>; Döscher and Koenigk 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2013</a>), those projections are not necessarily associated with the existence of a tipping point to another stable state or irreversible process (Amstrup et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2010</a>; Lenton 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2012</a>).
