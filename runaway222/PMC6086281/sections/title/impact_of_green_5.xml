 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To present the potential impact of crossing the threshold, we focused on the Greenland ice sheet because exceeding its threshold could cause large-scale sea level rise that has a transition time of several hundreds to thousands of years. In fact, the impact of sea level rise associated with global warming on human society has become a matter of concern for coastal areas around the world. With regard to the sea level rise beyond the threshold temperature, most recent studies on sea level rise (Clark et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2016</a>; Mengel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2016</a>) and its impacts (Hallegatte et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2013</a>; Hinkel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2014</a>; Strauss et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2015</a>) have shown only projections to the end of the 21st century or projections that do not model threshold temperatures explicitly. Here, with a focus on limiting temperature scenarios, we describe specific cases of exceeding (T20 and T25) or not exceeding (T15) the threshold temperature. The specific cases were selected based on those which have the highest probability of occurrence under the probabilistic framework outlined in the previous section. Thus, the cases correspond to an actual climate sensitivity of 3.00 °C and threshold temperature of the Greenland ice sheet of 1.6 °C, which are PDF modes for climate sensitivity and threshold temperature. As a result, three emission pathways (i.e., three temperature goals, with SSP2 and an actual climate sensitivity of 3.0 °C) were used for the analysis in this section. To present the global impacts rather than those at a regional scale, only global results that represent the potential sea level rise if the threshold of the Greenland ice sheet melting is exceeded and the degree of impact on society on a millennial timescale are described (see “
  <a rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec8">Appendix 2</a>” for technical details).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a> shows the estimated global sea level rise in the period from 2005 to 3000 under the three temperature goals (T25, T20, and T15). In most of the pathways, the sea level continued to rise even after temperature became constant in 2300 because of the slow response time. Whereas T15 temporarily reaches the Greenland ice sheet threshold of 1.6 °C around the middle of the 21st century, the contribution of the Greenland ice sheet to sea level rise is small because the exceedance of the threshold is slight and occurs for only a short period under T15. For this reason, following discussion regards T15 as the case without exceeding threshold. In the case where the threshold temperature was not exceeded (T15), the sea level rise did not stop, even though the global mean temperature rise showed a decreasing trend, because the attained equilibrium sea level was higher than the current sea level. The maximum range of the estimated sea level rise corresponded to a pessimistic outlook, which assumed the shortest response time and largest expected contribution from all four contributors (see “
  <a rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec8">Appendix 2</a>” for details). Conversely, the minimum range corresponded to an optimistic outlook. Both bounds did not contain the uncertainty of the threshold itself, due to the assumptions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The estimated sea level rise values associated with T25 and T20, which both exceeded the threshold temperature, were relatively large compared to that of T15, which did not exceed the threshold. The differences in these trends increased over time until the year 3000. Even when the temperature goal was changed from T20 to T15, the differences in the median sea level rise among the ranges was only 0.07 m in 2100, but 0.57 m in 2300 and 1.86 m in 3000. The trends beyond 2100 varied due to the longer response time of the Greenland ice sheet. The global mean temperatures in T25 and T20, which exceeded the threshold of the Greenland ice sheet, were similar, whereas the difference between the global mean temperature in T20 and T15 was relatively large. The uncertainty range of the sea level rise in T15 was smaller than those of T25 and T20 due to the lack of a contribution by the Greenland ice sheet.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> shows the responses of three types of estimated global total exposures: inundated areas (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>a), population (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>b), and assets (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>c). The estimated exposures followed similar trends irrespective of temperature pathway until around 2100. Thereafter, the trends of all exposures in T25 and T20, which continued to exceed the threshold, were relatively similar compared to that of T15, which was considerably lower. This trend became larger over time until the year 3000, because the sea level continued to rise. These increases were relatively steep compared with that of the estimated sea level rise (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>) because there are broad low-lying areas and concentrated populations in many coastal regions around the world. At a country-scale, countries with either low-lying areas or long coastlines and broad areas of land would suffer more from land loss caused by coastal inundation.
