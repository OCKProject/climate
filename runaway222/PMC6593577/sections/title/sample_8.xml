 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was done in five nursing homes in Tønsberg, Norway. The total number of wards in the five nursing homes was 34, varying from three to 13 wards. In all, the five nursing homes cared for 366 patients, varying from 38 to 101 patients in each nursing home. There were totally 765 health care professionals working in the nursing homes. We did not include in the analyses employees that were working less than/equal to 20% (equivalent to one working day per week), or those being on leave during the study period (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 302). Out of the remaining 463 employees, 288 (62.2%) answered the questionnaire (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The response rates varied between 56.9 and 72.2% across the five nursing homes.
