 <p id="Par64">As this study did not investigate health or diseases in patients, it is not regarded as a medical and health research project - and is thereby not affected by the Norwegian Health Research Act (ACT 2008-06-20 no. 44: Act on medical and health research, Chapter 1, §2 and §4)

Approval from the Committee for medical and health research ethics was therefore not needed
