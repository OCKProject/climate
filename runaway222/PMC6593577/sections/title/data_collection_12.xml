 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data were collected in the five nursing homes in February 2016. Paper versions of the SAQ-A were distributed by administrative contact persons to the health care workers. Filled-in questionnaires were returned anonymously in boxes. Questionnaires were scanned into an SPSS data file for analysis.</p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reports with the SAQ-A results were sent to nursing home wards with at least five responders. The employees were recommended to discuss local patient safety factors, and to develop strategies for improvement in their own nursing home ward.</p>
