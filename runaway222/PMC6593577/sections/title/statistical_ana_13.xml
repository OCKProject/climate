 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To reduce loss of cases by listwise deletion of cases with missing data, imputation of missings were done by multiple regression analysis with SPSS v.24. Values were imputed for the “real missing”s (but not for those who failed to return a valid value by ticking the box “Not applicable”). For each variable with missing values imputed scores were predicted by the five answers (among the answers to the 28 questions in the confirmatory factor analysis) most strongly correlated to the variable in question.</p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SPSS was used to estimate the Cronbach alphas, corrected item-total correlation, item-to-other-factor correlations and item-descriptive statistics. An indicator of an item not belonging where it was hypothesized to sit is whether its removal would markedly improve the variable set’s Cronbach’s alpha, a measure of the extent to which the responses of items within a factor correlated pairwise. Cronbach alpha scores were considered good if between 0.70 and 0.90, and acceptable if above 0.60 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Corrected item-total correlations were checked and compared to item-to-other-factor correlations to see if the items correlated more strongly with the factor they were hypothesized to belong to than with the other factors.
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hypothesized six factor model was tested by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in AMOS, using data from respondents answering all of the items, including the imputed responses. As factors reflect the correlation structure in the item responses, valid factors should reflect a thematic logic that is coherent with the purpose of the questionnaire. CFA provides goodness-of-fit indices which show how the survey responses comply with the pre-hypothesized factor model.</p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following goodness-of-fit indices (indicators of how well the factor pattern in the survey responses conforms with the hypothesized factor model) were calculated: the chi-square/degrees of freedom ratio (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span>/d.f.), the p, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), the p
  <sub>close</sub>, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and the Hoelter 0.05. Acceptable goodness-of-fit values indicate that the SAQ-A measures patient safety climate by the hypothesized factors. The χ
  <span class="sup">2</span>/d.f. should be below 2.5 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>], the 
  <span class="italic">p</span> value should exceed 0.05, the RMSEA should not exceed 0.08, the p
  <sub>close</sub> value should exceed 0.05 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>], the CFI should exceed 0.90 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. The Hoelter 0.05 - an estimate of the largest sample for which a data set with these intercorrelations among the variables would confirm the model – should exceed 200 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>].
