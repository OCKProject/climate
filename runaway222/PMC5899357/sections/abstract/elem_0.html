         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Wicked’ is the term used to describe some of the most challenging and complex issues
            of our time, many of which threaten human health. Climate change, biodiversity loss,
            persisting poverty, the advancing obesity epidemic, and food insecurity are all examples
            of such wicked problems. However there is a strong body of evidence describing the
            solutions for addressing many of these problems. Given that much is known about how
            many of these problems could be addressed – and given the risks of not acting – what
            will it take to create the ‘tipping point’ needed for effective action?

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent (2015) court ruling in The Hague held that the Dutch government’s stance
            on climate change was illegal, ordering them to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at
            least 25% within 5 years (by 2020), relative to 1990 levels. The case was filed on
            behalf of 886 Dutch citizens, suing the government for violating human rights and
            climate changes treaties by failing to take adequate action to prevent the harmful
            impacts of climate change. This judicial ruling has the potential to provide a way
            forward, inspiring other civil movements and creating a template from which to address
            other wicked problems.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This judicial strategy to address the need to lower greenhouse gas emissions in the
            Netherlands is not a magic bullet, and requires a particular legal and institutional
            setting. However it has the potential to be a game-changer – providing an example
            of a strategy for achieving domestic regulatory change that is likely to be replicable
            in some countries elsewhere, and providing an example of a particularly ‘wicked’ (in
            the positive, street-slang sense of the word) strategy to address seemingly intractable
            and wicked problems.
