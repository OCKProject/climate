      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Wicked’ is the term used to describe some of the most challenging and complex issues
         of our time, many of which threaten human health. Climate change, biodiversity loss,
         persisting poverty, the advancing obesity epidemic, and food insecurity are all examples
         of such wicked problems. However there is a strong body of evidence describing the
         solutions for addressing many of these problems. Given that much is known about how
         many of these problems could be addressed – and given the risks of not acting – what
         will it take to create the ‘tipping point’ needed for effective action?
