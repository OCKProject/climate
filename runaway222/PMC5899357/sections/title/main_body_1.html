      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent (2015) court ruling in The Hague held that the Dutch governmentâ€™s stance
         on climate change was illegal, ordering them to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at
         least 25% within 5 years (by 2020), relative to 1990 levels. The case was filed on
         behalf of 886 Dutch citizens, suing the government for violating human rights and
         climate changes treaties by failing to take adequate action to prevent the harmful
         impacts of climate change. This judicial ruling has the potential to provide a way
         forward, inspiring other civil movements and creating a template from which to address
         other wicked problems.
