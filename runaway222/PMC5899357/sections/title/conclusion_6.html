      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This judicial strategy to address the need to lower greenhouse gas emissions in one
         country is not a magic bullet, but it has the potential to be a game-changer – providing
         an example of a strategy for achieving domestic regulatory change that is likely to
         be replicable in some countries elsewhere, and providing an example of a particularly
         ‘wicked’ (in the positive, street-slang sense of the word) strategy to address seemingly
         intractable and wicked problems.
