            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Wicked’ is the term used to describe some of the most challenging and complex issues
               of our time, many of which threaten human health. Climate change, biodiversity loss,
               persisting poverty, the advancing obesity epidemic, and food insecurity are all examples
               of such wicked problems. However there is a strong body of evidence describing the
               solutions for addressing many of these problems. Given that much is known about how
               many of these problems could be addressed – and given the risks of not acting – what
               will it take to create the ‘tipping point’ needed for effective action?
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent (2015) court ruling in The Hague held that the Dutch government’s stance
               on climate change was illegal, ordering them to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at
               least 25% within 5 years (by 2020), relative to 1990 levels. The case was filed on
               behalf of 886 Dutch citizens, suing the government for violating human rights and
               climate changes treaties by failing to take adequate action to prevent the harmful
               impacts of climate change. This judicial ruling has the potential to provide a way
               forward, inspiring other civil movements and creating a template from which to address
               other wicked problems.

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This judicial strategy to address the need to lower greenhouse gas emissions in the
               Netherlands is not a magic bullet, and requires a particular legal and institutional
               setting. However it has the potential to be a game-changer – providing an example
               of a strategy for achieving domestic regulatory change that is likely to be replicable
               in some countries elsewhere, and providing an example of a particularly ‘wicked’ (in
               the positive, street-slang sense of the word) strategy to address seemingly intractable
               and wicked problems.
