 <p id="p0055" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Smallholders’ abilities to manage climatic risks can be shaped by how well they navigate shifts in agricultural policy (
  <a rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0130">Eakin, 2005</a>) and there is arguably a need to make climate risk management a central feature of development planning (
  <a rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0020">Agrawal &amp; Lemos, 2015</a>). To create opportunities for equitable adaptation to climate change, it is increasingly recognized as essential to address deeply rooted structural inequities and power differentials that have implications for distributive justice (

  <a rid="b0480" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0480">Tschakert et al., 2013</a>). To illuminate such power differentials and how they shape adaptation options, burgeoning work focuses on the lived experiences of smallholders via in-depth empirical assessments of adaptation processes (

 <p id="p0060" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For one, this work has demonstrated that top-down technocratic development and adaptation interventions can mismatch with, overlook, or undermine local-level processes that are vital to adaptive capacity (
  <a rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0065">Burnham and Ma, 2017</a>, 
  <a rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0405">Rasmussen, 2018</a>, 
  <a rid="b0465" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0465">Sovacool, 2018</a>). More generally, these studies show that vulnerability and adaptation are relational: rather than being characteristics of individual actors, they are produced through relationships with other actors, relationships that are context-dependent and in flux (
  <a rid="b0485" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0485">Turner, 2016</a>). As a lens to consider how vulnerability and adaptation emerge at the interface of political economic structures and smallholder agency, some suggest considering the role that institutions play in adaptation processes (

  <a rid="b0525" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0525">Yeh et al., 2014</a>). Institutions—that is, formal and informal rules and norms “that humans use when interacting within a wide variety of repetitive and structured situations” (
  <a rid="b0385" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0385">Ostrom, 2008, p. 24</a>)—can be crucial sites of negotiating adaptation actions (

 <p id="p0065" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A key emerging theme in this literature centers on understanding how adaptive capacity to climate change is unevenly shaped amid socio-environmental change (
  <a rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0100">Clay, 2018a</a>). In this vein, studies have demonstrated that differential asset bases can lead to divergent adaptation strategies among households in a single community (
  <a rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0240">Jain, Naeem, Orlove, Modi, &amp; DeFries, 2015</a>) and that power asymmetries and the disintegration of social institutions can intersect with climatic events to shape adaptive capacity (
  <a rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0160">Engle &amp; Lemos, 2010</a>). For example, research has shown that adaptive capacity can be influenced by shifting social norms governing common property resource grazing space during drought in East African rangelands (
  <a rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0205">Goldman &amp; Riosmena, 2013</a>) and by local power dynamics that authorize subsistence use of wetlands during flood events in Botswana’s Okavango Delta (
  <a rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0450">Shinn, 2017</a>). Within institutional change, specific adaptive capacities (those explicitly mitigating climate risk) as well as generic capabilities corresponding to livelihoods, assets, education, and political power are recognized as key to building adaptive capacity to climate change (
