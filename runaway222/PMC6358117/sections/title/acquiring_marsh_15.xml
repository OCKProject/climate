 <p id="p0195" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marshland in Kibirizi has become less accessible with the transition from ownership by local associations to more formal cooperatives. Many respondents noted that they were once part of relatively informal associations that regulated marshland use prior to 2005. At that time, people were cultivating as they liked in marshlands, often intercropping sweet potato with maize or other crops, a strategy seen to increase resilience of the plots to flooding. Now, marshlands are part of the CIP and only one crop is grown at a time. Respondents expressed frustration about this transition, noting the challenge of joining cooperatives due to high cost and the fact that cooperatives quickly reached a cap after which further members were not admitted. They lamented the loss of decision-making power over crop choice and spoke of frequent flooding that has occurred in marshlands ever since they were drained and cultivated on a large scale in just one crop.</p>
 <p id="p0200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With marshland circumscribed by CIP cropping systems, valley land has taken on renewed importance as a dry season cultivation option. Qualitative analysis of interviews clarifies that there are several intersecting reasons for this. For one, valley land can be highly fertile and permit cultivation through long dry periods. Secondly, valleys are now the only place where prohibited but important food security crops like sweet potato and sorghum are, unofficially, allowed to be cultivated. However, this higher demand has led to escalating costs for purchasing or renting valley land. As 
  <a rid="t0025" ref-type="table" href="#t0025">Table 5</a> shows, access to valley land is uneven. As a proportion of total cropland (including woodlots), valley land comprises only around 10 percent among lower capacity households, compared to two and three times that among the two higher capacity groups. 
  <a rid="t0025" ref-type="table" href="#t0025">Table 5</a> also shows that there is unevenness in the number of different parcel locations operated and that diverse parcel locations have increasingly concentrated in the hands of higher capacity households. In short, while there is a net loss in parcel locations among lower capacity groups, the highest capacity group has seen a net gain in parcel locations.

 <p id="p0205" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This discrepancy is also reflected in the proportions of each group operating agriculture during the dry season and those with access to fields beyond the formal reach of the CIP (
  <a rid="t0025" ref-type="table" href="#t0025">Table 5</a>). 
  <a rid="t0030" ref-type="table" href="#t0030">Table 6</a> further clarifies other factors associated with access to these key land types. Intensity of CIP activity is negatively related to accessibility of places to plant CIP crops, suggesting that where the program is most strict, access to places to plant food security crops is also lowest. Relatedly, CIP intensity, in combination with lower household capacity and numbers of field locations stands out in the number of climatic and other challenges experienced by households on CIP land. Similarly, households living in areas of higher CIP intensity are more likely to run out of food earlier than they were ten years ago (‘consume household produced food earlier’ in 
  <a rid="t0030" ref-type="table" href="#t0030">Table 6</a>). The implication of this finding in terms of specific adaptive capacity is that even while valley land is becoming more important as a risk management strategy, it is becoming further out of reach for households living closest to the margin.
