 <p id="p0025" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Looming over smallholder producers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are constellations of climate change and ambitious development interventions that aim to enhance agricultural productivity as a way to end hunger and stimulate economic growth. Climate change models predict increased temperatures and erratic rainfall patterns that will likely challenge current modes of production and exacerbate food insecurity across the region (

  <a rid="b0420" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0420">Schmidhuber and Tubiello, 2007</a>). A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) notes that the 1.5 degree Celcius increase in mean global temperature expected by 2030 will severely impact rural livelihoods and human health in SSA (
  <a rid="b9000" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9000">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018</a>). Meanwhile, development efforts in SSA have re-centered on smallholder agriculture as an engine of economic growth. Large-scale agricultural intensification schemes have proliferated across SSA over the past decade in effort to close crop ‘yield gaps’ (

  <a rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0120">Diao et al., 2010</a>). Within this context of rapid social-environmental change, smallholders (those with limited resources relative to other farmers)—already seen as among the most vulnerable to climatic variability and uncertainty (

  <a rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0380">Oppenheimer et al., 2014</a>)—will likely need to adapt livelihood portfolios and land use systems to ensure food security in the short term and equitable and sustainable growth and poverty reduction in the medium and longer term (

  <a rid="b0460" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0460">Smith et al., 2014</a>). This confluence of development transitions and climate change necessitates in-depth empirical studies that examine the mechanisms by which smallholders manage and adapt to multiple intersecting risks (

  <a rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0060">Burnham and Ma, 2016</a>). In particular, research is needed on how agricultural intensification policies enable and/or constrain smallholders from adapting to climate change (

  <a rid="b0485" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0485">Turner, 2016</a>). As a result, climate risk management is seldom incorporated into development policies, leading to limited effectiveness in equitably addressing adaptation challenges (
  <a rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0020">Agrawal &amp; Lemos, 2015</a>). This has also meant little opportunity to address uneven power relations and social inequalities that may be at the root of these vulnerabilities (

 <p id="p0035" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is essential to investigate how development intersects with other social-environamtal processes to enable and/or constrain people from adapting to climate change (
  <a rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0145">Eakin, Lemos, &amp; Nelson, 2014</a>), or their adaptive capacity, which is produced at the interface of political ecnomic structures and household agency (
  <a rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0100">Clay, 2018a</a>). Adaptive capacity comprises the assests that people can draw on to change as well as the power, knowledge, flexibility, and agency to decide whether to change or not (
  <a rid="b9005" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9005">Cinner et al., 2018</a>). Recent work suggests that local institutions are key mediators of adaptive capacity (

  <a rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0500">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Some have encouraged differentiating between “specific” adaptive capacities (those explicitly addressing climate-related risk) and “generic” capacities (i.e. general livelihood components and the structural constraints leading to inequalities in education, income, or political autonomy) and examining positive and negative feedback between the two (

  <a rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0285">Lemos et al., 2013</a>). Others suggest an ‘adaptation pathways’ approach to visualize how the dynamic, multi-scalar processes shaping vulnerability and adaptation coalesce over time and shape adaptation trajectories (

  <a rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0510">Wise et al., 2014</a>). In contrast to temporally-static framings, adaptation pathways work illustrates fluidity in decisions and helps uncover how certain adaptations come to stabilize over time (
  <a rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0065">Burnham &amp; Ma, 2017</a>). In many ways, these assessments of social-ecological dynamics resemble livelihoods perspectives (

 <p id="p0040" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we build upon this work on adaptation pathways and the sub-components of adaptive capacity. We investigate how adaptive capacities are unevenly shaped amid development transitions in rural Rwanda and how this leads to differential adaptation pathways for smallholder households. This paper illustrates how development interventions that emphasize input-led agricultural intensification have uneven outcomes for smallholders' capacities to adapt to climate change and other risks. In so doing, this research speaks to the need to reformulate development policies in ways that can address deeply-rooted social inequalities and facilitate “transformative adaptation” (
  <a rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0030">Bassett &amp; Fogelman, 2013, p50</a>; see also, 
  <a rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0390">Pelling, 2011</a>). The paper presents the results of a mixed-methods case study of four communities in rural Rwanda. Two questions frame our analysis: (1) How do cross-scalar social, political economic, and environmental processes converge to shape smallholders’ adaptive capacities? and (2) How do these uneven capacities lead to differential adaptation pathways?
 </p>
 <p id="p0045" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addressing these questions, we contribute empirical reinforcement and conceptual clarity on how specific and generic components of adaptive capacity intersect. We find that the implementation of an input-led agricultural intensification program in Rwanda has deactivated social institutions of climate risk management (e.g. autonomy over cropping decisions and seed sharing), leading to diminished specific adaptive capacities for many households. In their place, new adaptation options have emerged for some households in the form of (a) commercial agriculture with associated input access and crop insurance, and (b) planting woodlots on surplus land for charcoal and timber. However, a consequence of development programs in Rwanda is that these adaptation strategies are only available to households with certain livelihood portfolios. To build and employ these alternate specific capacities, smallholders must negotiate new social institutions, a prerequisite for which is land, labor, and stable nonfarm income. We find that the majority of households that lack these entitlements are pulled deeper into poverty with each successive climatic shock.</p>
