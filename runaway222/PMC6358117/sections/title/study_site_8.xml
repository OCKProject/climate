 <p id="p0115" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study is sited in Kibirizi sector, southwest Rwanda, a mountainous region of the country, which has continually suffered from poverty and waning soil fertility, and which the National Adaptation Plan of Action for climate change identifies as high risk for both recurring heavy rain and drought (EICV, 2015, 
  <a rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0215">GoR, 2006</a>). The study period coincided with numerous climatic shocks. Torrential rain and flooding occurred in 2014 and 2015; extended dry spells in 2013, 2014, and 2016 decimated harvests throughout the country (

  <a rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0190">FEWS NET, 2016</a>) and combined to produce what some have called “the longest drought in six decades” (
  <a rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0350">Times, 2016</a>). The study site comprises 4 
  <span class="italic">umudugudu</span> (smallest administrative unit, roughly translating as ‘rural settlement’) that were selected as 1) representative of rural settlements throughout Rwanda; and 2) eliciting variations in the degree and type of agricultural intensification (see 
  <a rid="t0005" ref-type="table" href="#t0005">Table 1</a>). Agriculture (either own farm or working others’ land) is the principal livelihood for nearly all households, who cultivate rain-fed, mixed crop-livestock systems for both subsistence and commercial ends. Cultivation on hillsides is circumscribed by two growing seasons per year (one from September to December, the other from March to May) and restricted to marsh and valley areas during dry seasons. When possible, households diversify livelihoods to include non-farm employment such as small businesses, skilled labor in masonry or house framing, and other labor such as collecting sand or making charcoal. The CIP has been implemented in Kibirizi since 2010 and the program has been widely adopted, with over 90 percent of survey respondents participating in 2015.

 <p id="p0120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As elsewhere in Rwanda, three variations of CIP-prescribed agriculture have been implemented in Kibirizi: terraced-hillside agriculture, unterraced hillside-agriculture, and marshland agriculture. The rules are most strict in terraced areas. A regional agronomist selects crops each season according to government targets. Although households retain land titles, farmers are strongly compelled to cultivate selected crops by threat of fine, jailing, or land expropriation if a crop is not cultivated during a growing season. On unterraced land, restrictions are somewhat eased. However, households are still incentivized to grow selected crops and discouraged from growing four crops known for their subsistence importance: sweet potato, cassava, sorghum, and a regionally important grain known locally as 
  <span class="italic">ciraza</span>. Prior to each growing season, households submit contracts to local leaders indicating that they will grow selected crops. If they do not meet these contracts, individuals can be publicly disgraced during weekly meetings of village-level farmer associations. Cooperatives coordinate intensification activities in marshlands, with a regional agronomist making cropping decisions. While access to marshlands prior to 2005 was subject to 
  <span class="italic">de facto</span> land rights and planted in mixed crops and grazing, access now requires paying cooperative membership (5000 RWF, or 8 USD) and seasonal use fees (2000 RWF, 3 USD) per 100 m square parcel. Seed and fertilizer for government-selected crops are distributed through cooperatives, state extension agents, and (for maize and bean) by an American company called the One Acre Fund (known locally as 
  <span class="italic">Tubura</span>) which has partnered with the GoR. In addition, eucalyptus tree seedlings (
  <span class="italic">E. globulus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">E. maidenii</span> species) are sold at subsidized rates throughout the study area in line with government aims of increasing tree cover across Rwanda.
