 <p id="p0230" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above results demonstrate that agricultural intensification and afforestation policies in SSA intersect with changing and variable climates to shape pathways for adapting land use strategies and livelihoods. In rain-fed smallholder farming systems, the success of these policies can be predicated on how they facilitate adaptive capacities to adjust practices to mitigate increasing climatic variability and uncertainty. Our findings from southwest Rwanda suggest that land use transitions aligned with the ‘New African Green Revolution,’ a mandate of intensified, commercial-oriented agriculture, have uneven effects on the diverse range of smallholder households in the midst of global climate change. CIP-prescribed land use practices have been differentially adopted in Kibirizi, with households closest to the margin putting proportionately more of their land into the program than households with more diversified land use systems and livelihood portfolios. This has meant that smallholders most reliant on subsistence agriculture have felt the largest impact of the destabilization of local social institutions that enabled flexible decision-making in the past. The poorest households experience far more yield-reducing challenges (both climatic and non-climatic) in fields planted under CIP-specifications, challenges that are exacerbated by the degree of intensity of CIP activity, with the most strictly regulated terraced areas showing the largest negative effects on household abilities to produce enough food and to continue planting core food security crops together with their forced adoption of commercial agriculture.</p>
 <p id="p0235" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By combining the adaptation pathways approach with research on the specific and generic components of adaptive capacity, this study contributes insight into how negative effects of development policies can arise through uneven access to new institutions (e.g. cooperatives and buying inputs on credit from companies) which can become necessary for managing climate risks in the absence of traditional institutions. Diversifying livelihoods to include nonfarm income has become a prerequisite for access to risk management institutions, leaving many households behind and curtailing their chances for succeeding with the CIP. In the context of these abrupt institutional changes—which compel households to adopt riskier land use practices—substantial farm assets (land and livestock) as well as sufficient capital or steady income are increasingly needed to buffer climate shocks and facilitate adaptation. While flexible land-use strategies have become less of an option for all, households with substantial landholdings (especially valley land that falls outside the CIP jurisdiction) are able to practice traditional polyculture systems of agriculture alongside intensified production. Overall, this is a diversified system that facilitates continued buffering of environmental and economic shocks and enables the continued production of food security crops. Another observable trend is that valley land, originally an important risk management resource, appears to be transitioning into a wealth accumulation platform for wealthier households, those who hold a significantly larger proportion of their cropland in valleys than do poorer households and are twice as likely to cultivate during dry seasons. In these ways, smallholders that additionally have steady nonfarm income and who operate across a variety of land types are far better positioned to absorb the risks of involvement in commercial agriculture. These households, which have higher generic capacity to begin with, can further build that foundation and thus expand their adaptive capacity to future social and environmental change. Such households can be seen to have adaptive livelihoods in that they draw on livelihood capitals in ways that enhance their abilities to manage risk and uncertainty. Conceptually, this also underscores the value of nuancing an adaptation pathways approach by considering how generic and specific capacities intersect.</p>
 <p id="p0240" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By contrast, a majority of smallholder households could be classified as risk averse in that their circumstances preclude diversifying into riskier livelihoods and/or land uses. For such groups, 
  <a rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0145">Eakin et al. (2014)</a> argue that development policies should aim to “build generic capacities without undermining the existing endogenous capacities for risk management: i.e., their specific capacities” (p. 3). Yet, our findings indicate that development resources are being expended in ways that provoke further inequality in household abilities to access and adopt climate risk mitigation mechanisms. The case of uneven adoption of woodlots as a climate-resilient land use strategy further illustrates how uneven adaptation pathways are produced through the interface of development policy and climate change. Faced with more uncertain climate and decreased soil fertility, households with surplus land have been able to capitalize on subsidized access to tree seedlings by dramatically expanding woodlots across their landholdings. Yet those without these bundles of resources and livelihoods (especially nonfarm work) have not adopted woodlots as a land use strategy. This uneven ability to invest in woodlots curtails adaptation pathways for many households, who instead are forced to adopt CIP agriculture on much of their land. Relatedly, the proliferation of woodlots also means less available land for rent for poorer households to produce food, which in turn is a factor in escalating land prices.
 </p>
 <p id="p0245" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, an approach that combines longer term concerns of adaptation pathways with the multiple components of adaptive capacity can help us understand how complex development processes influence households’ adaptive capacities to climate change. On top of having limited specific capacities due to these new institutional arrangements, poorer households are experiencing food shortages that stem from the challenges of implementing land use according to CIP specifications. Furthermore, without access to woodlots or enough valley land, poorer households have difficulty engaging in land use and livelihood practices that help to strengthen their fundamental livelihood capitals in the face of an uncertain climate. This demonstrates that when agricultural intensification policies focus exclusively on building general livelihood capacities through commercialized agriculture they can undermine specific adaptive capacities, leading to unwitting adoption of riskier farming practices. Opportunities can emerge for alternative risk management mechanisms. However, our findings illustrate that the adoption of these alternate specific capacities can be highly uneven as it is often rooted in fundamental livelihood capitals and capabilities (or ‘generic capacities’). As the above narrative illustrates, a series of climatically adverse seasons—as occurred from 2013 to 2016 in Kibirizi—can set in place a downward spiral that will make it even more challenging for the poorest smallholder households to climb out of poverty. These divergent synergies (negative for poorer households, positive for wealthier households) are illustrated in

    <p>Differential livelihood pathways emerge out of uneven adaptive capacities. Institutional change prohibits traditional risk management and the resulting scenarios for wealthier households (adaptation as adoption of new specific adaptive capacities through use of livelihood capitals) and poorer households (continued poverty due to lack of options for diversifying livelihoods and land uses while also being forced to adopt commercial agriculture).</p>
