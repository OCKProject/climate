 <p id="p0165" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite increasingly precarious climatic conditions, Kibirizi smallholders have been pressed to rapidly adopt an external vision of intensive agricultural practices in line with the CIP. Adoption is widespread, with over 93 percent of survey respondents taking up CIP land use practices in 2015. To better understand the uneven outcomes of this institutional change, we situate Rwanda’s program of agricultural commercialization in a shifting social, environmental, and political economic context within which smallholders manage risks and make adaptive decisions. While the aim of the CIP is to intensify and commercialize agriculture to create more resilient smallholder production systems, we find that the program has had corollary shifts in local social institutions of smallholder climate risk management that, for many, actually decrease resilience to droughts and heavy rain. As observed elsewhere in SSA, smallholders in Rwanda employ various climate risk management strategies that include 
  <span class="italic">ex-ante</span> (decisions made prior to a growing season to minimize risks), 
  <span class="italic">in-season</span> (responses to perceived and forecast weather conditions that drive adjustments to crops or cultivation practices), and 
  <span class="italic">ex-post</span> (buffering negative impacts of climate shocks that already occurred) (see 
  <a rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0110">Cooper et al., 2008</a>, 
  <a rid="b0495" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0495">Waha et al., 2013</a> for this typology). Surveys and interviews revealed that smallholders in Kibirizi have traditionally employed a range of strategies (summarized in 
  <a rid="t0015" ref-type="table" href="#t0015">Table 3</a>). These include four principal 
  <span class="italic">ex-ante</span> land use strategies to buffer risks of uncertain climate: a) intercropping several crop varieties within a parcel; b) cultivating parcels at multiple locations (including upper, mid, and lower hillside as well as valley and marshland); c) preparing fields and acquiring inputs ahead of time such that seeds can be sown after first rains; d) selecting low-risk crops. Respondents noted two principal 
  <span class="italic">in season</span> risk management strategies: a) adjusting crops in response to perceived and forecast weather conditions such as planting short-maturation crops like sweet potato rather than maize if rains are delayed; and b) avoiding investing further inputs in fields that are seen as likely to fail following adverse climate conditions (for example, not weeding or applying fertilizer after inconsistent rains in the first months of a growing season). Some strategies extend across seasons; for example, social networks of seed sharing permitting cultivation in a season after drought even if household seed stores are depleted.

 <p id="p0170" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ability to employ this range of strategies has traditionally comprised Kibirizi smallholders’ specific adaptive capacities. These capacities are facilitated by various social institutions operating at multiple levels. Many of these institutions are currently in flux due to intersecting social-environmental changes (summarized in 
  <a rid="t0015" ref-type="table" href="#t0015">Table 3</a>). Several key social institutions pertain to flexible decision-making at household and parcel levels concerning which crops to grow. Respondents noted that norms of land-use flexibility are deeply engrained in Kibirizi. However, the state’s crop regionalization and land use consolidation programs have sharply eroded household autonomy over cropping decisions: 75 percent of survey respondents indicated that the government primarily makes cropping decisions. In short, this means that smallholders are increasingly compelled to grow crops selected by local leaders for their supposed economic value rather than selecting crops themselves according to household needs, agroecological features of their parcels, and climate risk. As interview respondents noted: ‘Decisions have changed because of the government program and performance contracts;’ ‘The plots are under land use consolidation where one selected crop by local leaders is grown;’ ‘All decisions are coming from our local leaders.’
 </p>
 <p id="p0175" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One result of these governance changes is that 91 percent of households now cultivate fewer crop varieties than they did ten years ago. Not only does this eradication of flexible decision-making institutions debilitate 
  <span class="italic">ex-ante</span> capacities, it also has implications for 
  <span class="italic">in-season</span> capacities. As discussed above, smallholders must submit contracts (which both bind producers to the state’s selected crops and allow calculation of the amount of seed to be delivered to particular rural areas) months ahead of growing seasons. This affords little leeway to adjust cropping decisions in response to climate cues. Constraints to 
  <span class="italic">in-season</span> capacities are most pronounced in terraced areas, where producers risk land appropriation if they choose not to cultivate their holdings for a season. Negative effects associated with these policy changes are widespread, as summarized in the following responses: ‘We don't have good production and we lose all the crops planted;’ ‘we harvest less and we are obligated to buy additional food on market;’ ‘this program is the main cause of hunger because we are growing just one crop.’
 </p>
 <p id="p0180" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another risk management strategy that 64.4 percent of respondents noted is preparing fields ahead of time so that when rain does arrive seeds can be planted without delay. However, due to challenges in accessing seeds and labor on time, 35.3 percent of respondents report planting late during the preceding year. Difficulties planting fields on time appear to be increasingly common for several intersecting reasons associated with development transitions in Rwanda. For one, hybrid seed (maize, wheat, and bean) for CIP crops, along with inputs that are required for these crops, must be purchased. Privatization of seed and fertilizer distribution has decreased ability to access seed, since seed must be purchased at steep interest rates, a risk that many smallholders are unwilling to accept. Further, commercialization of input networks appears to have led to a decline in local seed sharing practices. These seed access challenges converge especially among those lacking nonfarm income, who must first work in others’ fields before they prepare their own fields in order to afford seed and other inputs. Moreover, respondents commonly noted that government seed deliveries are frequently delayed, and that they are not permitted to plant other seed but must instead delay planting fields until seed arrives and therefore risk missing a crucial period in the growing season.</p>
 <p id="p0185" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Government-implemented institutions associated with carrying out the CIP have in some ways replaced more locally-based institutions. These could in theory correct for the diminished specific adaptive capacity caused by the suppression of traditional risk management institutions, perhaps thereby easing the transition to intensive production of commercial crops. For example, distribution of seed and fertilizer for CIP crops has been privatized and is now being carried out by agricultural cooperatives and by Tubura. Tubura provides maize seed and chemical fertilizer on credit, charging 19 percent interest. While the company provided a rebate of 50 percent on these loans following a nationwide drought, many respondents noted that for local or regional climate shocks they offer no such assistance. Similarly, cooperatives do not provide a rebate following localized flooding that frequently destroys crops. As such, these institutions are seen by many respondents as limited in their risk mitigation effectiveness. Moreover, they are not even accessible to households without a steady cash flow, who see Tubura’s high interest rates as potentially exacerbating risks in the event of climate shocks or pest outbreaks. These reservations are reflected in uneven Tubura membership, shown in 
  <a rid="t0020" ref-type="table" href="#t0020">Table 4</a>. While nearly 60 percent of the wealthier households are members, only 21 percent of the poorest households are members of this institution.

 <p id="p0190" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that they are accessible only to households that already have substantial generic capacity, reliance on institutions such as Tubura does not confer inclusive risk mitigation. Moreover, lack of access to the core institutions of the CIP among the poorest households creates a paradox in that these households are relatively more invested in the CIP than are their wealthier neighbors by proportion of land area. As shown in 
  <a rid="t0020" ref-type="table" href="#t0020">Table 4</a>, the poorest households have more than one third of their land under CIP management, while the wealthier households have less than one fifth of their land set aside for the program. In other words, those with less institutional support to make the transition to commercial agriculture are, often unwillingly, under greater pressure to alter production practices in line with the government’s vision. Many interview respondents among lower capacity households expressed challenges in how institutional change and climatic shocks have intersected over the past five years. For example, an elderly male smallholder explained:
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“They told us not to grow sweet potato and cassava and only to grow wheat and beans, and farmers were dying of hunger. It cost between 5,000 and 6,000 Frw for a basket of sweet potatoes [about ten times the typical price].”</p>
   <p>
    <span class="bold">Interviewer:</span> “Is it the government policy that caused sweet potatoes to become so expensive?” ‘No. it is because of two reasons. The first reason is that there was too much sun [drought] and people could not cultivate sweet potatoes. Then after rain those who did plant sweet potato had them uprooted by local leaders.’
