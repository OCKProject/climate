 <p id="p0070" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This recent emphasis on generic capabilities and building adaptive capacity calls to mind a rich tradition of livelihoods approaches, which have long focused on capabilities and resource governance institutions (

  <a rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0435">Sen, 1999</a>, 
  <a rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0275">Leach et al., 1999</a>), but which have seldom been employed to consider climate adaptation (
  <a rid="b0430" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0430">Scoones, 2009</a>). For instance, 
  <a rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0365">Nussbaum and Sen (1993, p. 3)</a> assert that the “capability of a person refers to the various alternative combinations of functionings, any one of which (any combination, that is) the person can choose to have.” The work of 
  <a rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0275">Leach et al. (1999, p. 232)</a> builds upon this by advocating for an environmental entitlements framework to explain “how the consequences of environmental change in general, and access to and control over natural resources in particular, are also socially differentiated.” Methodologically based in assessments of these capabilities, livelihoods approaches provide a useful contribution to adaptive capacity assessment by enabling appreciation of the diverse factors that shape heterogeneous opportunities for people. Put differently, capabilities—and fundamental livelihood possibilities—are shaped through power-laden, context specific processes (

 <p id="p0075" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importantly, livelihoods are not simply a function of having enough economic capital to respond to social-environmental change; rather, what is at stake is the possibility to leverage these resources and relationships, or have the 
  <span class="italic">agency to generate alternative adjustments</span>, as needed (
  <a rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0040">Bebbington, 2000</a>). Our analytic draws on livelihoods frameworks (
  <a rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0035">Bebbington, 1999</a>, 
  <a rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0155">Ellis, 2000</a>, 
  <a rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0425">Scoones, 1998</a>) in that it positions generic capacities as associated with capitals (human, natural, physical, social, and financial). In turn, the process of translating those generic capacities into specific climate risk mitigation mechanisms resembles entitlements/capabilities (i.e., abilities to access and utilize resources), which livelihoods frameworks posit are embedded in institutions (
  <a rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0275">Leach et al., 1999</a>). Drawing from livelihoods frameworks encourages us to see adaptive capacity not as a quantifiable entity but as a complex process (

 <p id="p0080" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More specifically, we approach adaptive capacity as a process that unfolds in places over time by building from recent work on adaptation pathways. Doing so helps fill a crucial gap concerning how some groups and individuals come to have more or less adaptive capacity than others. Adaptation pathways research illuminates how adaptation decisions emerge and build on one another over time and how adaptation trajectories can vary by social groups and across levels of organization (e.g. household, community) (
  <a rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0070">Butler et al., 2014</a>, 
  <a rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0170">Fazey et al., 2016</a>, 
  <a rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0510">Wise et al., 2014</a>). By de-emphasizing assessments of adaptation ‘successes’ or ‘failures’ and instead highlighting fluidity in adaptation processes, this work depicts how seemingly discrete adaptation decisions coalesce into broader trajectories of change (
  <a rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0170">Fazey et al., 2016</a>). For example, 
  <a rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0065">Burnham and Ma (2017)</a> demonstrate that smallholders in central China have gravitated towards maize cultivation because the crop permits livelihood diversification, is consistent with social norms surrounding agri-environmental management, and is perceived as resilient to environmental and market risks. Adaptation pathways can also trend towards 
  <span class="italic">maladaptation</span> (
  <a rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0510">Wise et al., 2014</a>). For example, 
  <a rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0075">Carr (2008)</a> shows that smallholder agricultural diversification strategies can persist even with sub-optimal household-level outcomes due to their coherence with pre-existing gender roles.

 <p id="p0085" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we consider how adaptation pathways emerge amid development transitions by investigating the interplay among specific and generic adaptive capacities. This adaptive livelihoods approach encourages us to consider how adaptive capacity is unevenly built. That is, how individuals, households, and social groups come to differ in their abilities to adaptively respond to climatic variability and change. As we discuss below, this approach helps understand links between development and smallholder adaptation to climate change. Specifically, we assert that assessments of adaptive capacity can be more constructively framed by considering development policies and programs as imbuing complex negotiations and interactions among diverse actors that shape adaptation pathways. We demonstrate this approach through a case study of how differential adaptive capacities emerge in Rwanda amid development transitions associated with the ‘African Green Revolution’ (
