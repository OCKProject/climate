 <p id="p0250" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study considers household impacts and responses to climatic shocks and change (including late rain onset, drought, and heavy rain) amid broader social-environmental changes in Rwanda to understand how smallholder producers come to differ in their abilities to mitigate and adapt to climatic uncertainty, variability, and change. Findings show that certain combinations of livelihood and land use practices enable households to more effectively cope with discrete climatic shocks and adaptively respond to perceived climate changes so as to mitigate current and future risks of uncertain and variable rainfall. We demonstrate that adaptation options emerging within the context of social-environmental change are attenuated by differential adaptation pathways that embody pre-existing resource access regimes and power asymmetries. Individuals and households must navigate new institutions in order to mitigate risks of increasingly uncertain precipitation patterns and episodes of drought and heavy rain. Mitigating risk now requires either accessing institutions associated with the CIP (which require surplus land, income, livestock, and labor) or diversifying land use into woodlots (which demands surplus land). Households lacking these resources have limited access to newly important specific capacities (crop insurance, woodlots, and dry season planting areas) to effectively respond to risks of climatic variability and uncertainty and to adapt to climate change. The overall result is that an important segment of the smallholder farming population in Rwanda cannot effectively adapt livelihood and land-use portfolios to navigate structural changes and climatic changes.</p>
 <p id="p0255" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The longer-term implications of the CIP in Rwanda bode poorly for pro-poor agricultural development. As this research demonstrates, negative synergies can arise when households with low generic capacity plant riskier commercial crops in lieu of traditional food security crops during periods of increasing climatic unpredictability. A series of climatic and other shocks can deplete a household of what little capitals it has, forcing adoption of livelihood activities that are not compatible with needed longer-term investments in livelihoods in ways that can create future opportunities for poverty reduction and increased wellbeing. To help promote sustainable adaptation for households across socio-economic groups, agricultural development policies must be mindful of the important role of local institutions in mitigating risk. Such an effort can be guided by attention to two questions about institutional change: 1) how does it differentially constrain and/or enable households’ traditional specific capacities? And 2) how does it differentially constrain and/or enable households to adapt livelihoods and land use to adopt new specific capacities? With looming climate change and visions of agriculture-led growth for SSA, both questions compel public leaders and private partners to face up to the potential for an economic growth paradox that pits the relative merits of higher productivity and incomes for already-advantaged households against the prospect of greater food insecurity among those at the lower end of the spectrum, for whom poverty and hunger continue to be ever-present realities.</p>
 <p id="p0260" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This research addresses a deeper issue: whether the orientation of Green Revolution inspired agricultural development approaches towards economic growth precludes consideration of risk management as a policy component. These results suggest that large-scale intensification programs with externally prescribed quotas for planting export crops can exacerbate existing risks and introduce new risks in the form of crops ill-suited for the region or for particular parcels or farming systems. The negative impacts of cropping mandates are particularly evident during rainfall deviations and among households lacking capitals to invest in commercial crops (

  <a rid="b0470" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0470">Thornton, Jones, Alagarswamy, Andresen, &amp; Herrero, 2010</a>). Absent such attention, crop productivity gains will come at the expense of disadvantaged individuals’ livelihoods. For Rwanda’s agricultural policy agenda, care should be taken to ensure that the most vulnerable groups do not slide further into poverty. Specifically, rather than applying the CIP indiscriminately across relatively arbitrary spatial jurisdictions that comprise administrative units, the intensification program should be designed to adaptively respond to spatial and temporal variations across the mountainous agro-ecological landscape. For households lacking the requisite generic capacities to adapt successfully, it is essential to consider options for easing the requirements of compulsory crop cultivation. This need for flexibility resonates across resource use systems, as a recent case from Botswana illustrates (

 <p id="p0265" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To broader work at the interface of climate and development, this paper contributes understanding of how uneven adaptive capacities can arise through interacting social-environmental processes over time (
  <a rid="b9050" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9050">Watts, 1983</a>). Development research and policy must actively consider such dynamics whether or not a study or program specifically targets climate adaptation. Optimistically, adaptation processes can embody the ‘potential to constitute or to contest authority, subjectivity and knowledge claims’ (
  <a rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0165">Eriksen, Nightingale, &amp; Eakin, 2015, p. 523</a>) and active application of pathways approaches through participatory work and continuous reflection on management paradigms can empower individuals to take action to remake institutions (
  <a rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0510">Wise et al., 2014</a>). However, rigid institutions of environmental governance can also constrain livelihood adaptations (
  <a rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0260">King, Shinn, Crews &amp; Young, 2016</a>). To visualize and implement transformative adaptation that actively reworks structural constraints and social inequalities (

  <a rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0390">Pelling, 2011</a>), it is essential to understand how adaptive capacity is unevenly built during development transitions and within contexts of environmental change.
