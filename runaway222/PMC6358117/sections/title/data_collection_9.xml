 <p id="p0125" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Focus groups (n = 4, one in each umudugudu; 12–20 people each; participants recruited by local leaders) and key informant interviews served to introduce the research team and develop understanding of central issues. Interviews were conducted in Kinyarwanda or French with the help of a research assistant, employing open-ended questions to query changes in livelihoods, policies, and rainfall patterns over the past twenty years. Two primary concerns emerged surrounding agricultural livelihoods: climatic shocks have increased in magnitude and frequency and the CIP has altered land use decision-making by reducing household autonomy over crop selection and access to inputs. These issues informed subsequent research phases.</p>
 <p id="p0130" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, the first author conducted a structured household survey from November 2014 to March 2015 with an adult male or female representative of all available households (households deemed unavailable if not present on three visits on separate days

  <span class="italic">umudugudu</span> (428 households out of approximately 500 total) by a team of four Rwandan research assistants. In addition to documenting household demographics, assets, livelihoods, and food security, questions focused on land use, the influence of Rwanda’s CIP and broader agricultural policies on decision-making and crop yields, and changes in resource access, institutions, and climate. For questions addressing political economic and agricultural changes, a 10-year timeframe was used; this is supported in literature on agrarian change in SSA (
  <a rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0220">Guyer, 1997</a>). All surveys were conducted within respondents’ home compounds and administered in Kinyarwanda (1 h 56 min average per respondent). Third, a structured parcel-level survey (administered July 2015 to October 2015) was completed with all households that had operational land holdings (402 households and their 3017 parcels), meaning that 26 landless households were excluded. Questionnaire development and administration followed the same protocol as above with the addition of four local research assistants (secondary school graduates) who were trained in calculating field area and use of GPS units. All parcels less than 30 min’ walk from the homestead were visited, otherwise location was indicated on a map. The questionnaire included 30 questions at the household level (number and location of parcels, general challenges to agriculture, seed and labor availability, etc.) and 70 questions for each parcel operated, including general parcel characteristics (fertility, soil type, tenure status, years operated, etc.) and crop choice, yields, and challenges affecting yield for the previous three seasons.

 <p id="p0135" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fourth, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 36 male and 36 female respondents (April 2015 to August 2015) from randomly-selected households. Each of these 72 interviews involved three members of the research team: one asked questions in English, another translated between English and Kinyarwanda, and a third took detailed notes. Meetings immediately following each interview ensured that details and overall meaning were accurately recorded. Interviews averaged 1 h 20 min and concentrated on changes in climate, land use, livelihoods, household agricultural labor, agricultural challenges, and perceptions and impacts of government policies. Fifth, unstructured interviews were conducted (October 2014 to December 2016) with 32 individuals representing key institutions involved in agro-ecosystem management, including leaders in six umudugudu, five mayors at ‘cell’ and ‘sector’ levels, agronomists, state employees overseeing land tenure issues, cooperative presidents, input distribution companies, health workers, local development officers, and security officials, among others. Questions pertained to contemporary and historical political, economic, environmental, and agricultural aspects of the study area and broader region, including the implementation of Rwanda's CIP and perceptions of climate change.</p>
 <p id="p0140" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In-depth interviews complement quantitative data with rich detail on power relations and the effects of institutional change. As a case study, this work does not consider regional differences. However, it provides a comprehensive picture on how development transitions intersect with broader social-ecological change, enabling visualization of the complex pathways by which smallholders weave together livelihood and land use strategies within social and biophysical contexts that vary markedly within the study site. Data from household and parcel surveys were analyzed using SPSS. Tests included descriptive statistics, bi-variate comparison of means, bivariate correlation, Chi-Square, multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), and other multivariate regressions. Interviews were coded and analyzed qualitatively using ATLAS.ti software. An initial round of coding was done and refined into a codebook that was employed in a second round of coding, enabling sub-themes to emerge. The coding strategy reflected attempts to account for relationships deemed statistically robust as well as to further explain relationships that remained unclear following statistical analyses.</p>
