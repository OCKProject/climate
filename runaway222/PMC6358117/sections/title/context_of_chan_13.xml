 <p id="p0155" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As discussed above, the years surrounding the period of this study were marked by erratic rainfall, including several seasons where rains ended early or began late, seasons where rain stopped for long stretches during key stages of crop development, and seasons with torrential rain and flooding that destroyed crops. Focus group and institutional interviews early in this study revealed that adverse climate and soil fertility are major impediments to agriculture. Precipitation patterns are widely viewed as less predictable than they were 10 or more years ago. Study participants commonly spoke of rains that used to occur but no longer do, or changes to their start and end dates. For example:
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>‘It can’t happen again anymore… many years ago rains fell at times that allowed harvest and then land preparation for the next season…. now it keeps changing, it can begin in September or October, we just don’t know.’ (focus group, October 2014)</p>
   <p>‘Nowadays it is starting to rain in April but in past years it was raining in February, where farmers used to plant wheat in March. The rain used to stop in June but now it stops in May.’ (Interview, May 2015)</p>
   <p>‘Everything has changed with the rain and hunger has been the result. Before…production was sufficient. Then there was more rain. Now sometimes seeds do not even come up.’ (focus group, October 2014)</p>

 <p id="p0160" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to changing climate, there is widespread acknowledgement of two major changes to land management throughout Kibirizi. First, four crops that were once extensively cultivated (sweet potato, cassava, ciraza, and sorghum) are now effectively forbidden by the GoR. According to respondents and local leaders, the chief reason for this shift is that these crops are not part of the CIP due to their low market values. This is in spite of wide agreement that these are among the most drought and flood tolerant crops, especially when compared to much riskier CIP crops. We also explored with producers the issues of adopting the CIP in terms of institutions of climate risk management. Intersections between the government’s intensification program and issues of climatic uncertainty in Kibirizi were evident early on and throughout this study. When asked about any difficulties of adopting CIP land use practices, study participants often couched responses in terms of climate. For example:
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>‘The program of land use consolidation is here but because of drought seeds did not grow. We put seeds in the soil but they did not grow. We recognize that land use consolidation is important but due to climate change we are losing. There is no means for irrigating during drought.’ (focus group, October 2014)</p>
