 <p id="p0050" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate how adaptive capacity is differentially built amid development transitions in rural Rwanda, we integrate recent insight on the multiple components of adaptive capacity and adaptation pathways with livelihoods perspectives, which have long attended to multi-scalar processes of agrarian change within which smallholders make decisions (
  <a rid="b0430" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0430">Scoones, 2009</a>). We focus on adaptive decision-making in the context of Green Revolution-inspired agricultural intensification policies and related programs of rural transformation in Rwanda. Our analytical approach enables us to 1) visualize the array of social-environmental processes that interact to shape smallholders’ adaptive capacities and livelihood adaptation options and 2) identify patterns in how these adaptive capacities arise unevenly in accordance with pre-existing livelihood portfolios and social inequalities. This 
  <span class="italic">adaptive livelihoods</span> approach (see 
  <a rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0100">Clay, 2018a</a> for further description) allows us to chart how development transitions intersect with climate change to give rise to unequal adaptation pathways: trajectories of accumulation for some, maladaptive paths to further impoverishment for others.

To create opportunities for equitable adaptation to climate change, it is increasingly recognized as essential to address deeply rooted structural inequities and power differentials that have implications for distributive justice (

More generally, these studies show that vulnerability and adaptation are relational: rather than being characteristics of individual actors, they are produced through relationships with other actors, relationships that are context-dependent and in flux (
   <a rid="b0485" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0485">Turner, 2016</a>). As a lens to consider how vulnerability and adaptation emerge at the interface of political economic structures and smallholder agency, some suggest considering the role that institutions play in adaptation processes (

  </p>
  <p id="p0065" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A key emerging theme in this literature centers on understanding how adaptive capacity to climate change is unevenly shaped amid socio-environmental change (
   <a rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0100">Clay, 2018a</a>). In this vein, studies have demonstrated that differential asset bases can lead to divergent adaptation strategies among households in a single community (
   <a rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0240">Jain, Naeem, Orlove, Modi, &amp; DeFries, 2015</a>) and that power asymmetries and the disintegration of social institutions can intersect with climatic events to shape adaptive capacity (
   <a rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0160">Engle &amp; Lemos, 2010</a>). For example, research has shown that adaptive capacity can be influenced by shifting social norms governing common property resource grazing space during drought in East African rangelands (
   <a rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0205">Goldman &amp; Riosmena, 2013</a>) and by local power dynamics that authorize subsistence use of wetlands during flood events in Botswana’s Okavango Delta (
   <a rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0450">Shinn, 2017</a>). Within institutional change, specific adaptive capacities (those explicitly mitigating climate risk) as well as generic capabilities corresponding to livelihoods, assets, education, and political power are recognized as key to building adaptive capacity to climate change (

  <p id="p0070" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This recent emphasis on generic capabilities and building adaptive capacity calls to mind a rich tradition of livelihoods approaches, which have long focused on capabilities and resource governance institutions (
   <a rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0365">Nussbaum and Sen, 1993</a>, 
   <a rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0435">Sen, 1999</a>, 
   <a rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0275">Leach et al., 1999</a>), but which have seldom been employed to consider climate adaptation (
   <a rid="b0430" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0430">Scoones, 2009</a>). For instance, 
   <a rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0365">Nussbaum and Sen (1993, p. 3)</a> assert that the “capability of a person refers to the various alternative combinations of functionings, any one of which (any combination, that is) the person can choose to have.” The work of 
   <a rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0275">Leach et al. (1999, p. 232)</a> builds upon this by advocating for an environmental entitlements framework to explain “how the consequences of environmental change in general, and access to and control over natural resources in particular, are also socially differentiated.” Methodologically based in assessments of these capabilities, livelihoods approaches provide a useful contribution to adaptive capacity assessment by enabling appreciation of the diverse factors that shape heterogeneous opportunities for people. Put differently, capabilities—and fundamental livelihood possibilities—are shaped through power-laden, context specific processes (
   <a rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0255">King, 2010</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="p0075" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importantly, livelihoods are not simply a function of having enough economic capital to respond to social-environmental change; rather, what is at stake is the possibility to leverage these resources and relationships, or have the 
   <span class="italic">agency to generate alternative adjustments</span>, as needed (
   <a rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0040">Bebbington, 2000</a>). Our analytic draws on livelihoods frameworks (

   <a rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0425">Scoones, 1998</a>) in that it positions generic capacities as associated with capitals (human, natural, physical, social, and financial). In turn, the process of translating those generic capacities into specific climate risk mitigation mechanisms resembles entitlements/capabilities (i.e., abilities to access and utilize resources), which livelihoods frameworks posit are embedded in institutions (
   <a rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0275">Leach et al., 1999</a>). Drawing from livelihoods frameworks encourages us to see adaptive capacity not as a quantifiable entity but as a complex process (
   <a rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0100">Clay, 2018a</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="p0080" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More specifically, we approach adaptive capacity as a process that unfolds in places over time by building from recent work on adaptation pathways. Doing so helps fill a crucial gap concerning how some groups and individuals come to have more or less adaptive capacity than others. Adaptation pathways research illuminates how adaptation decisions emerge and build on one another over time and how adaptation trajectories can vary by social groups and across levels of organization (e.g. household, community) (
   <a rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0070">Butler et al., 2014</a>,

   <a rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0510">Wise et al., 2014</a>). By de-emphasizing assessments of adaptation ‘successes’ or ‘failures’ and instead highlighting fluidity in adaptation processes, this work depicts how seemingly discrete adaptation decisions coalesce into broader trajectories of change (
   <a rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0170">Fazey et al., 2016</a>). For example, 
   <a rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0065">Burnham and Ma (2017)</a> demonstrate that smallholders in central China have gravitated towards maize cultivation because the crop permits livelihood diversification, is consistent with social norms surrounding agri-environmental management, and is perceived as resilient to environmental and market risks. Adaptation pathways can also trend towards 
   <span class="italic">maladaptation</span> (
   <a rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0510">Wise et al., 2014</a>). For example, 
   <a rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0075">Carr (2008)</a> shows that smallholder agricultural diversification strategies can persist even with sub-optimal household-level outcomes due to their coherence with pre-existing gender roles.
  </p>
  <p id="p0085" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we consider how adaptation pathways emerge amid development transitions by investigating the interplay among specific and generic adaptive capacities. This adaptive livelihoods approach encourages us to consider how adaptive capacity is unevenly built. That is, how individuals, households, and social groups come to differ in their abilities to adaptively respond to climatic variability and change. As we discuss below, this approach helps understand links between development and smallholder adaptation to climate change. Specifically, we assert that assessments of adaptive capacity can be more constructively framed by considering development policies and programs as imbuing complex negotiations and interactions among diverse actors that shape adaptation pathways. We demonstrate this approach through a case study of how differential adaptive capacities emerge in Rwanda amid development transitions associated with the ‘African Green Revolution’ (

  <p id="p0090" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the past decade, development policies across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have come to re-center on smallholder agriculture as an engine of economic growth. In hopes of catalyzing an African Green Revolution (
   <a rid="b0515" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0515">World Bank, 2007</a>), major development actors (e.g. the World Bank, the United States Agency for International Development, and the United Nations) and national governments have made substantial investments in agricultural intensification, (

   <a rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0335">Moseley et al., 2015</a>). As in earlier Green Revolutions in Mexico and Asia, contemporary agricultural intensification programs throughout SSA center on smallholders, aiming to encourage households to adopt high-yielding varieties of maize, rice, and wheat and to increase application of agrochemicals, which these varieties often require to achieve optimal productivity. Africa’s Green Revolution has thus far taken shape as a top-down enterprise, with governments and development agencies incentivizing and sometimes enforcing the increased adoption of technologies (

   <a rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0090">Clay, 2017</a>). Not only do intensification policies aim to sustainably end hunger and malnourishment—which have abated very little in SSA compared to other regions—they illustrate a renewed development emphasis on agriculture as an engine of overall economic growth (
   <a rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0400">Rashid et al., 2013</a>, 
   <a rid="b0515" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0515">World Bank, 2007</a>). As with earlier Green Revolutions, land and technology are identified as the limiting factors (
   <a rid="b9010" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9010">Jarosz, 2014</a>). Increased inputs (such as hybrid seed, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides) and agroengineering (terracing, draining wetlands, and irrigating fields) are thus positioned as essential to shore up ‘yield gaps’ and thereby curtail further expansion of agricultural land into biodiverse areas (
   <a rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0195">Foley et al., 2011</a>,

  </p>
  <p id="p0095" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, political economic and agroecological contexts in contemporary SSA poorly resemble those of 1960s and 1970s Asia. In contrast to consistent national markets and robust state-led subsidy programs that facilitated Green Revolutions in India, for example, decades of neoliberal reforms in SSA have meant weakened state involvement in agriculture and dependence on erratic global markets (

There is growing evidence that input-based agricultural intensification has done little to meet pro-poor development goals in SSA. Although aggregate crop yields may have increased in some places, national-level food production figures say little about local-level food access (
   <a rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0050">Bezner Kerr, 2013</a>). Technology-driven intensification policies appear to have done little to address longstanding unevenness in land and resource access among smallholders, resulting in exacerbated malnutrition and inequality among some rural communities while large-holders, urban populations, and agribusiness benefit (

   <a rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0335">Moseley et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, increased yields in rural areas do not guarantee the emergence of nonfarm employment opportunities (
   <a rid="b9020" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9020">Haggblade, Hazell, &amp; Reardon, 2010</a>) and increased commercial activity is not universally beneficial across the socially diverse range of smallholder farmers (

  <p id="p0100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With its Crop Intensification Program (CIP), Rwanda is an archetype of the New Green Revolution in SSA. In 2007, the country was the first to sign a compact with the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), a pan-African framework of agriculture-led growth.
