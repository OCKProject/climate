 <p id="p0210" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Woodlots are widely seen to have proliferated in Kibirizi over the past ten years. Over 74 percent of survey respondents noted that trees have increased in their umudugudu during this period. This is due to the perceived resilience of woodlots to climatic shocks and their importance as a source of cash once the wood is harvested and sold for charcoal or for construction. In the minds of many study participants, the rapid adoption of woodlots is closely linked to 
  <span class="italic">Ruchamakara</span> (meaning “charcoal making hunger”), one of the worst famines in the past century. The Ruchamakara hunger period is understood to have arisen following three growing seasons of markedly low yield due to adverse climatic conditions. Though the order of climate shock events is not completely clear, most respondents indicated that it began with a prolonged period of drought that negatively affected two seasons. This drought is said to have been followed by unusually heavy rains in a third growing season. The prolonged duration of this hunger period reportedly caused some households to migrate, some individuals to perish, and a great many to participate in the production of charcoal. Charcoal making, as the name of the hunger period would indicate, was widely seen as the only recourse for households to purchase food from market in the wake of three failed harvests. Ruchamakara occurred around the year 2000, and stories still circulated of even stumps being cut out of the ground and processed in charcoal kilns. Respondents in Kibirizi also clarified that there are structural factors underlying increased tree farming. The GoR has incentivized woodlot adoption, ensuring that tree seedlings of two eucalypt species are made widely available at subsidized rates (seedlings cost 20 Frw each). Additionally, the GoR requires that all fields beyond 45 degrees (deemed too steep to farm) must be planted with trees to reduce erosion. The 45-degree slope rule is enforced by local leaders, who are often called upon to settle disputes regarding woodlots. This explicit erosion-reduction measure nests within a broader afforestation policy that has been implemented throughout Rwanda.

 <p id="p0215" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Converting agriculture to woodlot is an adaptive land use strategy that has thus come about through the intersection of a changing climate, declining soil fertility, increased connectivity to urban areas where charcoal is delivered, and government policy to increase tree cover. It has become a generic adaptive capacity strategy that also enhances specific adaptive capacity to climate change. Whether or not they currently owned a woodlot, respondents frequently acknowledged that they could plant trees in a woodlot, put very little work into their upkeep, and after ten or 15 years hire somebody to cut the trees into poles for home construction (if the trunks are straight enough) or charcoal (if the trunks are less straight). Both of these outputs provide substantial cash income to the woodlot owner. Perhaps more importantly, woodlots can be effectively cashed in at any time, whenever the household is most in need of money. Indeed, numerous interview respondents indicated that trees are an effective income diversification strategy, even preferable to having money in a bank.</p>
 <p id="p0220" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, adoption of woodlots is a highly uneven adaptation. Interviews clarified that woodlots are by all accounts recognized as a land use option largely available to wealthier households. And, as shown in 
  <a rid="t0035" ref-type="table" href="#t0035">Table 7</a>, the percentage of total household land in woodlots correlates strongly with livelihood group. Only 26.7 percent of the poorest households own any woodlot, which is generally small and used to gather firewood, compared to 93.8 percent of among the wealthiest households, many of whom own large woodlots which are harvested for making charcoal or selling timber. Further illustrating this discrepancy, the wealthiest group of households has roughly half of their total land in woodlots while the poorest households have less than ten percent of their landholdings in woodlots. This finding is strongly supported by in-depth interviews, wherein respondents commonly acknowledged that although woodlots are the preferred climate-resilient land use, they are unable to convert to woodlots given the need to continuously produce food for their families. Indeed, while half of wealthier households report expanding woodlots in the past ten years, only 8 percent of the poorest households have planted more trees in that time period. For wealthier households, conversion to woodlots has become an important livelihood diversification strategy, as the following quotes illustrate:
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>‘The number of trees has increased so much. People who have land for tree planting do so.’</p>
   <p>‘They started to grow more trees after realizing timber are being exported and trees are fetching much money. Before, people were planting only in high risk zones but now they are planting in land favorable for crops.’</p>

 <p id="p0225" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As we explore further in the discussion, these inequalities in adoption of resilient land use strategies are symptoms of the ways in which specific and generic capacities have intersected over time to reinforce or impede adaptation options. In the next section we employ the adaptive livelihoods framework to evaluate what these findings mean in terms of the differential livelihood pathways that emerge out of uneven adaptive capacities.</p>
