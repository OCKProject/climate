  <p>(a) Anomalies of surface temperature (relative to the globally averaged value) and (b) low‐cloud amount stratified by the vertical velocity at 500 hPa for simulation 1xCO
   <sub>2</sub>. (c) is the same as (a), and (d) is the same as (b) but for simulation 2xCO
   <sub>2</sub>. Colors follow time in each simulation but are reversed between the two simulations so that global mean surface temperature always increases from blue to red. For the 1xCO
   <sub>2</sub> simulation, the first time step indicated by the red line corresponds to the period just after self‐aggregation (beginning of “medium” period, after red dashed line in Figure 
   <a rid="jame20804-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0002">2</a>b). The 2xCO
   <sub>2</sub> starts from the beginning with the dark blue line. The mean global fraction of low clouds in the subsidence regions is specified in the box. Each line is a time average over 300 consecutive days. Dashed black arrows indicate the time evolution.
