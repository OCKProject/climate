  <p>(a) Idealized large‐scale subsidence (arrow) forced by the emergence of convective aggregation and a sea surface temperature (SST) gradient of small amplitude (red line), with convection above warm SSTs and clear‐sky areas above cold SSTs. (b) Formation of boundary layer clouds over the cold, subsiding regions capped by a temperature inversion due to this large‐scale circulation while the system cools uniformly until it reaches a temperature where low clouds can influence the surface significantly and strengthen the SST gradients. (c) The increased SST gradient reinforces the large‐scale circulation and the low‐cloud amount over the cold subsiding regions, which cools the subsiding regions further, hence strengthening the spatial gradient of SST between convective and subsiding regions, as well as the large‐scale circulation.</p>
