 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study investigates how the interaction between SST gradients and convective aggregation impacts climate feedbacks and the climate sensitivity in the idealized framework of RCE. For this purpose, different types of perturbations are applied to the system: either the atmosphere is abruptly homogenized spatially to start with disaggregated convection (and then left free to develop heterogeneities and aggregation again), which results in a large positive imbalance of the top‐of‐atmosphere radiation budget (1xCO
  <sub>2</sub> experiments), or the CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration of the atmosphere is abruptly doubled in the atmosphere (2xCO
  <sub>2</sub> experiments). In addition, to further assess the role of SST patterns in the behavior of the coupled system, additional experiments are run without SST patterns; this is done by spatially homogenizing the SST field at each time step (experiments 1xCO
  <sub>2</sub>uni and 2xCO
  <sub>2</sub>uni).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These experiments show that the triggering of convective self‐aggregation results in a strong and abrupt drop in global mean surface temperature. This triggering is slowed down in the presence of SST gradients because of the competition between two circulations: one associated with the mass convergence in deep convective areas and divergence in subsiding areas, and a shallow circulation induced by SST gradients (with convergence over warmer areas and subsidence over colder areas). This competition stops and self‐aggregation starts cooling the system only when the spatial scale of the SST gradient is large enough to force convective clouds to move toward the warmest SSTs. When imposing a CO
  <sub>2</sub> doubling to an atmosphere already organized, the climate warms and convective aggregation increases. However, the magnitude of the aggregation change is much weaker than in a situation of convective self‐aggregation when convection transitions from a non‐aggregated state to an aggregated state.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of the total climate feedback parameter in the different experiments suggests that the (strong) negative feedback associated with the enhanced convective aggregation is more than offset by the (strong) positive feedback associated with the change in SST patterns and its interaction with the low‐cloud cover. It suggests that due to the coupling between SST, convective aggregation and low‐cloud cover (Coppin &amp; Bony, 
  <a rid="jame20804-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0011">2017</a>), the role that changes in aggregation play in climate sensitivity may not be as strong as speculated based on prescribed uniform SST experiments.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One may wonder whether these conclusions are model dependent. Indeed, the IPSL‐CM5A GCM is known to produce a strong positive low‐cloud feedback (Vial et al., 
  <a rid="jame20804-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0032">2013</a>) and therefore to predict a large decrease of the low‐cloud cover as the climate warms. Moreover, in this model an increase of convective aggregation is generally associated with an increase of the low‐cloud cover (Coppin &amp; Bony, 
  <a rid="jame20804-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0010">2015</a>, 
  <a rid="jame20804-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0011">2017</a>). The impact of convective aggregation on climate sensitivity is likely to depend on the relative response of low‐level clouds and convective aggregation to surface warming. Whether the compensation between the aggregation feedback and other feedbacks (primarily those associated with SST patterns and low clouds) is robust and occurs in models that predict a very different low‐cloud feedback remains to be investigated.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In any case, the present results suggest that numerical experiments with uniform surface temperatures might be misleading because the response of convective aggregation to global mean surface temperature is different with and without SST gradients. The relative sensitivity of aggregation to SST and CO
  <sub>2</sub> differs between the uniform SST and the SST gradient frameworks. Indeed, for a given surface temperature anomaly, we find that the change in aggregation is generally larger in a coupled ocean‐atmosphere framework than in any experiments in which the SST is uniform, be it prescribed or evolving (Table 
  <a rid="jame20804-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#jame20804-tbl-0002">2</a>). This is because in a coupled framework with SST gradients, the interplay between surface temperature gradients and convective aggregation prevents aggregation from reaching its maximum and thus from “saturating” as it does more easily in the absence of interactive SSTs (Coppin &amp; Bony, 
  <a rid="jame20804-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0010">2015</a>; Cronin &amp; Wing, 
  <a rid="jame20804-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0012">2017</a>). This means that, in simulations with ocean‐atmosphere interactions, convection may never reach a high degree of aggregation. It also emphasizes the fact that the link between SST gradient and aggregation may be crucial to assess the behavior of convective aggregation in a changing climate. Nevertheless, the difference observed between uniform SST and interactive SST configurations in our model may also result from the saturation of convective aggregation at high SST in the uniform SST setups. Theses differences might not hold for lower SSTs or for other models where convective aggregation does not saturate at high SST.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SST gradients strongly modulate feedbacks in our coupled RCE framework. They limit the impact of convective aggregation and add a strong positive feedback that overcompensates the negative feedback of aggregation. The latter point echoes results from GCMs where changes in the spatial distribution of tropical SST generate a pattern effect, causing changes in radiative feedbacks that are not included in the global mean temperature response to a forcing and that usually occur on different time scales (Andrews et al., 
  <a rid="jame20804-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0001">2015</a>; Zhou et al., 
  <a rid="jame20804-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0034">2016</a>). It is noteworthy that, in these studies as in the present one, the modulation of the radiative feedback by the SST happens via a strong control on the low‐cloud fraction in the subsiding regions and thus on the shortwave cloud feedback.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extending the discussion over more ancient periods where the climate was much warmer and considering that the low‐cloud fraction continues to decrease with temperature, we can imagine a transition where low clouds eventually disappear when the lowest SST becomes too warm and the SST gradients are reduced relative to today's climate. With these high SSTs and weak SST gradients, would the climate become more similar to the uniform but evolving SST experiment (2xCO
  <sub>2</sub>uni) and its high degree of aggregation? In that state where aggregation mostly depend on CO
  <sub>2</sub>, would 
  <span class="italic">λ</span> become much stronger (lower ECS when CO
  <sub>2</sub> increases)? These are all speculations, but understanding how convective aggregation is controlled by SST gradients in much warmer climates might be helpful to understand past and future climates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if convective aggregation is not critical for climate sensitivity because of the countereffect of SST gradients, changes in convective aggregation could influence other aspects of climate change. For instance, they may contribute to the narrowing of convergence zones in a warmer climate, as discussed by Bony et al. (
  <a rid="jame20804-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0006">2016</a>). This hypothesis remains to be tested in a multimodel framework and in observations.
