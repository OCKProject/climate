 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitation of Aggregation Changes by SST Gradients</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A striking feature highlighted by Figure 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0007">7</a> is the relatively small change in aggregation after the doubling of CO
  <sub>2</sub>. The difference between the two equilibrium states is of the same order as the internal variability of aggregation before the CO
  <sub>2</sub> doubling and much smaller than the change in aggregation associated with the transition from a non‐aggregated to an aggregated state. In Figure 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0007">7</a>, SF also remains much lower than its maximum value (0.85) observed in 1xCO
  <sub>2</sub> after self‐aggregation (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0002">2</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison between Figures 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0004">4</a>a and 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0004">4</a>b shows that the total climate feedback of −1.23 ± 0.04 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>/K for the 2xCO
  <sub>2</sub> ensemble is equal to the total climate feedback of the 1xCO
  <sub>2</sub> ensemble over the late period (Table 
  <a rid="jame20804-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#jame20804-tbl-0002">2</a> and red lines in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0004">4</a>). This suggests similar feedbacks, although the system is experiencing a global warming in 2xCO
  <sub>2</sub> and a global cooling in late 1xCO
  <sub>2</sub>. In both cases, the convection is already aggregated and undergoes a change in global mean temperature with freely evolving SST gradients. Consistently, the regime distributions of SST and low clouds are similar in 1xCO
  <sub>2</sub> and 2xCO
  <sub>2</sub>, and the change in SST pattern present in 1xCO
  <sub>2</sub> is also found in 2xCO
  <sub>2</sub>, even though with a smaller amplitude because the global SST change is much smaller (Figures 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0005">5</a>c and 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0005">5</a>d). This means that in 2xCO
  <sub>2</sub>, as the surface temperature increases, the low‐cloud fraction and SST gradients decrease, amplifying the warming even more (Figures 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0006">6</a>c to 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0006">6</a>a).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly to what happens as part of internal variability (Coppin &amp; Bony, 
  <a rid="jame20804-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0011">2017</a>), the interplay between convection, SST gradients, and surface temperature is what limits convective aggregation and controls the total climate feedback. When convection is concentrated above the highest SST, convective aggregation reaches a maximum. But rapidly, the SST below convection decreases, as well as the SST gradients that maintained the large‐scale circulation necessary for convective aggregation. Therefore, convection disaggregates before reaggregating once the differential surface warming between convective and subsiding zones develops large‐scale SST gradients again. As long as the surface temperature increases in response to the CO
  <sub>2</sub> forcing, convective aggregation gradually increases but the magnitude of the increase is limited by this mechanism. Once at equilibrium, this feedback loop generates some internal variability in global mean surface temperature (Coppin &amp; Bony, 
  <a rid="jame20804-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0011">2017</a>). This explains why aggregation, SST gradients, and low‐cloud fraction decrease together around the equilibrium temperature, and why Δ
  <span class="italic">R</span> increases with temperature in 2xCO
  <sub>2</sub> above Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">S</span>
  </sub> = 2 K in Figures 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0003">3</a>b and 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0004">4</a>b respectively.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results suggest that the interaction between SST gradients and convective aggregation acts to limit the magnitude of the aggregation change and therefore the strength of the stabilization effect exerted by aggregation changes.</p>
