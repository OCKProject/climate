  <sub>2</sub> simulation gives us the opportunity to estimate the total feedback parameter 
  <span style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">λ</span>. We estimate it using a Gregory‐like approach (Gregory et al., 
  <a rid="jame20804-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0019">2004</a>), that is, by calculating the slope of the linear regression between Δ
  <span style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">R</span> and Δ
  <span style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">T</span>
  <sub>
   <span style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">S</span>
  </sub> (lines in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0004">4</a>a). As long as self‐aggregation is not triggered, the system is transitioning toward an equilibrium without convective aggregation: the radiative imbalance Δ
  <span style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">R</span>, which is maximum after the homogenization of the atmosphere decreases while temperature increases (early period, the slope of the green dashed line representing 
  <span style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">λ</span>). After the triggering of self‐aggregation, aggregation remains constant and strong for 2 years while the SST gradients increase and the system cools down (medium period). Once the low‐cloud amount is large enough in the subsiding regions, convective aggregation decreases and 
  <span style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">λ</span> changes (“late” period).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To isolate the relative influences of SST gradients and convective aggregation on the feedback parameter, we decompose it into three components. The first one does not depend on SST gradients nor aggregation. This “background” feedback, which includes other feedbacks such as the Planck response, water vapor, lapse‐rate, and cloud feedbacks, corresponds to the green line with 
  <span style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">λ</span>=−1.42 ± 0.02 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>/K in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0004">4</a>a. The second component includes in addition the effect of SST gradients (blue line), and the third one includes the background feedback, the feedback from SST gradients, and the feedback associated with the interaction of convective aggregation with the SST gradients (red line).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To calculate the second component (background plus SST gradient feedback), we focus on the lower right branch of 1xCO
  <sub>2</sub> where convective aggregation and low clouds are constant but the SST gradients increase (between 6 and 8 K in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0003">3</a>a). This medium period lasts only 2 years in the example shown and even less in the other members of the ensemble (Figures 
  <a rid="jame20804-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jame20804-supitem-0001">S4</a>a and 
  <a rid="jame20804-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jame20804-supitem-0001">S5</a>a). During this period, the net feedback parameter is positive and equal to +1.32 ± 0.20 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>/K (blue line in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0004">4</a>a). Assuming that the background feedback remains similar implies that the positive feedback associated with the buildup of SST gradients is +2.74 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>/K. This positive feedback may come from a reorganization of the circulation while aggregation remains constant.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To infer the feedback associated with convective aggregation (see Appendix 
  <a rid="jame20804-app-0001" ref-type="app" href="#jame20804-app-0001">A</a> for an attempt to conceptualize the impact of aggregation on global mean surface temperature), we consider the red line in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0004">4</a>a (part late). Assuming that the combined effect of the background plus the SST gradients remains similar, the negative feedback necessary to get the total climate feedback is the difference between the total feedback and this combined feedback (blue line), namely −1.20–1.32 = −2.52 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>/K, the feedback due to aggregation changes. Since this value also includes the low‐cloud positive feedback that occurs when SST gets cooler, that is, below the 6 K warming in 1xCO
  <sub>2</sub> (green line in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20804-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0003">3</a>a), we expect the negative feedback of aggregation changes on temperature to be even stronger. However, in a coupled system with interactive SST gradients and preindustrial CO
  <sub>2</sub> conditions, its impact is more than compensated by the positive feedback associated with the change in SST pattern and low‐cloud feedbacks (−2.52 vs. +2.74 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>/K).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The question now arises whether this behavior is representative of a changing climate perturbed by an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To answer this question, we analyze a 2xCO
  <sub>2</sub> experiment.
