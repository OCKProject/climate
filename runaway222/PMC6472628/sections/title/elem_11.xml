 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further assess the effect of the SST gradients on convective aggregation, we analyze experiments called 1xCO
  <sub>2</sub>uni and 2CO
  <sub>2</sub>uni where the SST gradients are removed at each time step by spatially averaging the SST. The SST is thus interactive but remains spatially uniform within the domain.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 1CO
   <sub>2</sub> ensembles of simulations run with or without SST gradients start from uniform conditions and without any large‐scale circulation. As long as a large‐scale circulation does not develop, the surface temperature remains nearly homogeneous, even when SST gradients are free to develop, and the two ensembles of simulations are almost identical (first months in Figure 
   <a rid="jame20804-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0008">8</a>). They start to diverge as soon as deep convection and a large‐scale circulation emerge, and promotes the development of SST gradients. In 1xCO
   <sub>2</sub>uni, convective aggregation increases very quickly and reaches a maximum shortly after the start of the self‐aggregation process. In contrast, in 1xCO
   <sub>2</sub>, aggregation increases more slowly and therefore the system keeps warming for a longer time until aggregation reaches its maximum and temperature starts to decrease.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This different behavior between 1xCO
   <sub>2</sub> and 1xCO
   <sub>2</sub>uni is directly related to the emergence of SST gradients in 1xCO
   <sub>2</sub>once deep convection is triggered. The ocean below convective clouds cools down, mainly because of the shadowing effect of clouds on the surface and the increase in evaporation in the vicinity, thus favoring the emergence of SST gradients. The slight cooling of SST under convective clouds relative to non‐convective areas generates a circulation that opposes the shallow circulation that gives rise to convective self‐aggregation (Hohenegger &amp; Stevens, 
   <a rid="jame20804-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0020">2016</a>). It becomes harder for convection to self‐aggregate, hence the delayed self‐aggregation. It is only when SST gradients cover a sufficiently large area of the domain that convection moves toward the warmest SSTs and that the system starts to cool.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even though the system in 1xCO

   <a rid="jame20804-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20804-fig-0008">8</a>), the initial cooling following self‐aggregation is qualitatively similar to the uniform cooling that happens over the medium period in 1xCO

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These findings emphasize the fact that the coupling of the atmosphere with SST fundamentally affects the system's response to a global increase in surface temperature. The framework with uniform but evolving SST shares a lot of similarities with the prescribed and uniform high SST simulations: same organization of convection, saturation of convective aggregation for high SST, stronger dependence of aggregation on CO
   <sub>2</sub> rather than on surface temperature, and same large‐scale circulation. On the contrary, the framework with interactive SST is more representative of less idealized setups (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20804-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jame20804-supitem-0001">S2</a>). This study thus casts doubt on the ability of the prescribed SST framework to correctly assess the impact of convective aggregation on the climate sensitivity, at least for our model.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yet a large literature has shown how relevant prescribed SST frameworks can be to interpret climate feedbacks in coupled frameworks (e.g; Brient &amp; Bony, 
   <a rid="jame20804-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0007">2013</a>; Ringer et al., 
   <a rid="jame20804-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0029">2014</a>). One possible explanation for this apparent contradiction could be the saturation of convective aggregation at high SST in our model. The prescribed SST framework might still be relevant to assess the impact of convective aggregation on climate in other models where this saturation does not occur or even at smaller SSTs when convective aggregation is not saturated (for models where it will saturate at higher SST). As a matter of fact, in our model, the organization of convection at these smaller SSTs is more similar across configurations (see Figures 2.7 and 2.8 of Coppin, 
   <a rid="jame20804-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20804-bib-0009">2017</a>, for the same comparison as in section 
   <a rid="jame20804-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jame20804-supitem-0001">S1</a> between the reference simulation, a prescribed and uniform SST of 298 K, the AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project) simulation over the tropical oceans and AquaControl over the tropics). To answer this contradiction, the impact of convective aggregation on climate should be investigated with other models in coupled frameworks.
