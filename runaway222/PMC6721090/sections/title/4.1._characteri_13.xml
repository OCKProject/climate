  <sub>2</sub> Emissions from LF, PF, and BF
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study showed that the seasonal variation of CO
  <sub>2</sub> emission fluxes in typical forest LF, PF, and BF in the Daxingâ€™an Mountains were similar, and reached a peak during the growing season (from July to August, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02999-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02999-f002">Figure 2</a>a), which is consistent with the results of the Song et al. [
  <a rid="B33-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-16-02999">33</a>] and Li et al. [
  <a rid="B34-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-16-02999">34</a>]. Soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> is mainly derived from autotrophic respiration (mainly vegetation root respiration), heterotrophic respiration (mainly soil microbial respiration), and mineralization decomposition of organic matter. The vegetation in this study area is mostly a shallow root system. During summer, with gradually increasing temperature, the appropriate combination of water and heat in the soil drives root respiration and soil microbial activity, which promotes soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> to reach emission peaks. Previous studies reported that the seasonal change of CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions were dominant controlled by soil temperature [
  <a rid="B32-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-16-02999">32</a>,
  <a rid="B35-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-16-02999">35</a>]. This study found a consistent result, whereby soil temperature was significantly correlated with CO
  <sub>2</sub> fluxes as the dominant environmental variables in affect CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02999-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02999-f003">Figure 3</a>a). During the non-growing season, soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> fluxes fluctuated within a lower range. Analysis of the reasons indicated that root respiration and microbial activity were weak due to low temperature. On the other hand, when the soil was frozen, the active nutrient substrate, which can be directly used by microorganisms was reduced [
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-16-02999">36</a>], thus resulting in the reduction of soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> fluxes. Two years of observations revealed that the temperature in the study area suddenly decreased due to the influence of low environment temperatures at the end of August each year, and the soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> fluxes of the three forest types decreased. Then, the soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> emission flux value increased, accompanying the increasing temperature back to the normal level of the same period [
  <a rid="B35-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-16-02999">35</a>]. This study found that the soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> fluxes in coniferous forests were higher than that in broad-leaved forests. The PF soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> cumulative fluxes were significantly higher than BF. Analysis of the reason found that the PF soil with high temperature had strong microbial metabolic activity, and the humus layer under the forest decomposed faster, releasing a large amount of CO
  <sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere.

  <sub>10</sub> is widely used to assess the sensitivity of soil or ecosystem respiration to temperature changes [
  <a rid="B37-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-16-02999">37</a>]. The 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> value of forest soil respiration in China is 1.33~5.53 [
  <a rid="B38-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-16-02999">38</a>]. The LF soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> fluxes (
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> = 5.47) are more sensitive than BF (
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> = 4.06) and PF (
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> = 3.67) to temperature changes, which is consistent with the research results of Zheng et al. [
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-16-02999">39</a>]. The significant correlation between soil temperature in the study area and soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> fluxes indicates strong positive short-term feedback between climate warming and soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> fluxes.
