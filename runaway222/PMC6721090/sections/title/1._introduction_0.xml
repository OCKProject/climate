 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global warming has become increasingly prominent. The average surface temperature of the earth has increased by 0.85 °C compared to that before the industrial revolution. This trend is expected to continue and reach an increase of 0.3~4.8 °C by the end of this century [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-16-02999">1</a>,
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-16-02999">2</a>]. The latest analysis of observations from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) program showed that the concentration of CO
  <sub>2</sub> was 405.5 ± 0.1 ppm, that of CH
  <sub>4</sub> was 1859 ± 2 ppb, and that of N
  <sub>2</sub>O was 329.9 ± 0.1 ppb in the atmosphere of 2017 [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-02999">3</a>]. Soil is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions. Almost 5~20% of CO
  <sub>2</sub>, 15~30% CH
  <sub>4</sub>, and 60~80% N
  <sub>2</sub>O are emitted from soils to the atmosphere every year [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-16-02999">4</a>], which comprises a key contributor to climate warming. The concentration of greenhouse gas is closely related to the carbon and nitrogen cycles of ecosystems, and its “source-sink” relationship directly affects the response and feedback of ecosystems to climate change [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-16-02999">5</a>]. Therefore, the dynamics of three greenhouse gas fluxes have become an important aspect of global climate change research.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Permafrost is the result of energy exchange between the lithosphere and the atmosphere and is also an important part of the cryosphere. Global climate change directly affects both the evolution and development of permafrost. Permafrost soils are large pools of carbon and nitrogen. Jorgenson et al. [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-16-02999">6</a>] estimated that one third of the world’s carbon is fixed in soil active layers and permafrost, while 31~102 Pg of total nitrogen is stored in the top 3 m of permafrost [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-16-02999">7</a>]. Climate warming will increase the thickness of permafrost active layers, thus releasing the stored ancient carbon and water, and providing more living space and matrix for microorganisms. This increases the emission of greenhouse gases (e.g., CO
  <sub>2</sub>, CH
  <sub>4</sub>, and N
  <sub>2</sub>O), which has a positive feedback effect on the global carbon or nitrogen cycle [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-16-02999">8</a>] and climate warming [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-16-02999">9</a>]. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of greenhouse gas flux in the permafrost region is of great scientific significance to recognize the carbon and nitrogen cycle of permafrost ecosystems or their response to global climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forest ecosystems are important players in the global carbon and nitrogen cycle process, and maintain 86% of the plant carbon pool and 73% of the soil carbon pool [
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-16-02999">10</a>]. With global warming, the forest ecological environment changes, which changes the exchange of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and forest soils, thus influencing the regional climate. Livesley et al. [
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-02999">11</a>] and Jang et al. [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-16-02999">12</a>] found that the canopy, undergrowth litter, roots, and secretions of different tree species differ, resulting in differences in soil physical and chemical properties, microbial community composition and diversity, and changes greenhouse gas emission. Ju et al. [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-16-02999">13</a>] found that the soil ecosystem of coniferous forests was highly metabolized, and the CO
  <sub>2</sub> flux was significantly higher than that of broadleaf forests. In contrast, Leckie et al. [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02999">14</a>] believed that coniferous forest litter was rich in refractory compounds, reducing the soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization rate, and resulting in a lower CO
  <sub>2</sub> flux. Wang et al. [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-16-02999">15</a>] reported that coniferous forests had thicker litter layer to intercept precipitation, which decreased the soil water content. Coniferous forest soil therefore had a stronger CH
  <sub>4</sub> absorption capacity than broadleaf forest soil. Castro et al. [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-16-02999">16</a>] believed that the difference in CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes between both forest types were not significant. The conclusions for soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O flux in broadleaf forests and coniferous forests were also different. Butterbach-Bahl et al. [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-16-02999">17</a>] held that broadleaf forest soil was more likely to form an anaerobic environment and emit more N
  <sub>2</sub>O. Several scholars have suggested that the N
  <sub>2</sub>O emission of both forest types are similar, or that coniferous forests are slightly higher [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-16-02999">18</a>]. In summary, the effects of different forest types on the flux of CO
  <sub>2</sub>, CH
  <sub>4</sub>, and N
  <sub>2</sub>O in soil remain unclear and need further investigation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">China is one of the world’s three countries with permafrost regions. The permafrost area is about 220 × 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-16-02999">19</a>]. Northeast China, in which the Xing’an-Baikal permafrost develops (approximately 39 × 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), is one of the main distribution areas of permafrost at high latitudes in China, and is to the south of the most prominent part of the Eurasian high-latitude permafrost region [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-16-02999">20</a>]. The Daxing’an Mountains area is an important forestry base in China, with a forest coverage rate of 84.32%, which is significantly affected by human activities and climate warming. At present, research on greenhouse gases in Northeast China mainly includes in situ monitoring or indoor simulated incubation experiments, and mostly concentrates on arable land [
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-16-02999">21</a>,
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-16-02999">22</a>] or peat swamp wetlands [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-16-02999">23</a>,
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-02999">24</a>]. Relatively few studies have addressed greenhouse gas fluxes of forest soils in the permafrost region of the Daxing’an Mountains, and quantitative assessment has not been conducted. This study continuously monitored (from May 2016 to April 2018) the dynamics of greenhouse gas fluxes in different forest types in the permafrost region of the Daxing’an Mountains. The effects of soil temperature, moisture, and other physical and chemical properties on CO
  <sub>2</sub>, CH
  <sub>4</sub>, and N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions were investigated, and the global warming potential (GWP) and 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> were evaluated. The purpose is to assess the greenhouse effect of greenhouse gases, released as a result of permafrost degradation in the Daxing’an Mountains, and provides a basis for the study of carbon and nitrogen budget in the Daxing’an Mountains’ forest ecosystem.
