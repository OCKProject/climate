 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study showed that the CO
  <sub>2</sub> accumulation fluxes of three forest types in the permafrost region of the Daxing’an Mountains dominated, followed by N
  <sub>2</sub>O and CH
  <sub>4</sub> as absorption fluxes (

  <sub>2</sub> as a reference gas on a 100-year time scale. The radiation effects of CH
  <sub>4</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O were 25 times and 298 times that of CO
  <sub>2</sub>, respectively [

The study clarified that the release of greenhouse gases from forest soils in the permafrost region of the Daxing’an Mountains has a positive effect on global warming, and the greenhouse gas GWP value of coniferous forests was higher than that of broad-leaved forests.
