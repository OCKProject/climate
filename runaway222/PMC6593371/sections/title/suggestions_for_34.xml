 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A questionnaire survey method was adopted as the research method of this study. The depth and value of research results can be enhanced if long‐term observations or qualitative interviews are used for looking into the impact of leadership style and organizational climate on employee food safety and hygiene behaviors to further understand employees' views on leadership style and organizational climate.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regulations require that 70% of staff working in institutional food service in school lunch kitchens must have a license as a Chinese food technician. Presently, it is not clear whether all institutional food service companies or schools are encouraging employees to obtain this license. However, some companies and schools encourage employees to actively obtain certification by way of subsidy fees and monthly incentives granted after obtaining the license. As previously indicated, employees who have food safety certifications have a significantly better attitude and intention regarding food safety and hygiene behaviors. At the same time, food safety certification presents a mediating effect (Lee et al., 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0031">2013</a>). Therefore, it is suggested that in the future, whether or not an employee has a Chinese food technician license should be studied to investigate the related mediating effect of leadership style on food safety and health behaviors.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of the questionnaires in this study were distributed by the school dietitian to the staff of the institutional food service serving in the school. Because school dietitians are either direct managers or supervisors at the job site, the subjects might therefore be less willing to fill out their true thoughts or opinions. Some subjects might be affected by social desirability bias when filling out questionnaires and give answers they think correct are socially acceptable. An example is the first question in the scale of compliance with food safety behaviors: “I have observed food safety behaviors during my working hours.” This statement is considered socially acceptable—that is, everyone should comply with food safety regulations. Therefore, the employee may be inclined to agree or strongly agree with this statement, whether or not that person actually complies with food safety behaviors. This bias may thus affect the average mean of variables.</p>
