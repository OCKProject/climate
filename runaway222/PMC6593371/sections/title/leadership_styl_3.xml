 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leadership is the ability of a leader to increase the effectiveness of the group (Northouse, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0043">2013</a>). In other words, a group of people with specific goals, when faced with challenges or conflicts, makes use of many different resources to satisfy the motivation of the members and reach goals (Burns, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0013">1978</a>). Maxwell (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0037">1998</a>) stated that leadership is the process of leading members to achieve organizational goals. General leadership style is often divided into transactional leadership and transformational leadership. Transactional leaders trade or exchange valuable things (e.g., in the form of compensation, status, and other incentives) to encourage followers to achieve the most basic job performance; on the other hand, transformational leaders inspire and improve followers to achieve higher levels of performance than usual and to promote greater demand and desire among group members (Northouse, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0043">2013</a>). Transactional leaders and organization members agree on terms, and the leaders recognize and reward hard‚Äêworking employees and correct or punish employees for deviations or errors (Burns, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0013">1978</a>). Transformational leaders motivate employees to go beyond specific expectations (Doucet, Fredette, Simard, &amp; Tremblay, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0018">2015</a>). Transformational leaders focus on promoting higher levels of motivation and morality for leaders and followers. This form of leadership is concerned with the needs and motives of followers and tries to help followers exert their maximum potential (Kouzes &amp; Posner, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0029">2012</a>; Northouse, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0043">2013</a>). To adapt to a highly competitive ecological environment, an organization is bound to seek changes and innovations, and transformational leaders have a positive impact on successful organizational change (Ahmad &amp; Gelaidan, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0001">2011</a>). Kreitner and Kinicki (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0030">2001</a>) believe that transformational leadership achieves the process of interaction between leaders and subordinates by enhancing this relationship to the level of morality and motivation beyond the original contractual relationship, where the subordinates sincerely respect the leader and are willing to follow and obey, and the incentive actions of the leader cause the subordinates to accept the organization's vision and mission. Sheraz, Zaheer, Rehman, and Nadeem (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0049">2012</a>) also state that transformational leaders can enhance the value of ethics in the workplace.
