 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Food‐borne illness is a disease transmitted through the intake of infected foods and is one of the most widespread and significant public health problems (WHO, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0054">2000</a>). If a restaurant, a catered event, or a packed meal involves the slightest negligence in the manufacturing process, such as poor sanitation in dishes or packed meals, it can easily result in group food poisoning (Wall, de Louvois, Gilbert, &amp; Rowe, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0052">1996</a>). Griffith, Livesey, and Clayton (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0022">2010</a>) also estimates that approximately 70% of food poisoning cases occur in commercial food service places such as restaurants. Food‐borne illnesses associated with staff typically emerge one after another, and the frequency of occurrence appears to be increasing (Greig, Todd, Bartleson, &amp; Michaels, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0021">2007</a>). The most common causes of illness include poor personal hygiene, cross‐contamination, and inadequate time/temperature (Guzewich &amp; Ross, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0023">1999</a>). An employee's personal beliefs and attitudes toward consumer health and a sense of honor toward the job will affect the employee's food safety behavior (Pragle, Harding, &amp; Mack,
