 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In any modern and highly competitive business environment, leadership is regarded as one of the most critical factors for the success of the company's future development (Mohan, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0039">2000</a>). At the same time, the leader is also an important factor affecting the success or failure of the organization (Bennis &amp; Nanus, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0009">1985</a>). Bass (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0006">1985</a>) points out that leaders influence 45%–65% of the success or failure of an organization. Andersen (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0002">2016</a>) believes that leaders can motivate, inspire, and identify with their employees to facilitate employees completing their work and achieving the desired goals. Moreover, leaders use a variety of different leadership styles to inspire and motivate employees.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transactional and transformational leaders, as proposed by Burns (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0013">1978</a>), have received greater attention in recent years. There is a process of exchange of benefits between transactional leaders and their subordinates to realize their respective goals (Bass, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0007">1990</a>). Unlike transactional leaders, transformational leaders motivate employees to do things beyond their abilities and to refocus from personal interests in favor of group interests (Bass, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0007">1990</a>). Food safety deals with relevant inappropriate behaviors and conditions, such as inappropriate temperatures, poor hygiene habits, and cross‐contamination, which have a significant relationship with the occurrence of food‐borne illnesses. Such inappropriate behaviors and conditions are caused by employees failing to comply with food safety regulations (Pilling, Brannon, Shanklin, Howells, &amp; Roberts, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0046">2008</a>). Therefore, changing the behavior of employees in the organization and creating a food safety culture are very important actions to reduce food‐borne illness (Yiannas, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0055">2009</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study took the employees working in the institutional food service of schools as subjects with the purpose of studying whether their food safety behaviors in the workplace are affected by different leadership styles of managers. This study also explored the impact of leadership styles on organizational climate and further analyzed whether there is a link between organizational climate and employees' implementation of food safety and their hygiene behaviors in the hope of understanding the leadership style applicable to employees of institutional food services. This study can be a reference to the institutional food service sector for leading staff at the grassroots level.</p>
