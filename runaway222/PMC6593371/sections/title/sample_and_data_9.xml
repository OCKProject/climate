 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study took the employees working in institutional food service in northern Taiwan as the subjects. A quantitative survey was conducted using a questionnaire. With regard to the distribution of questionnaires, school dietitians in the northern part of Taiwan (Taoyuan City and New Taipei City) were asked to assist in forwarding the questionnaires. The questionnaires were distributed to employees who have worked in the school lunch institutional company for 3 months and who have already spent 8 hr in the food safety courses, including chefs and kitchen workers. The subjects are anonymous and voluntary to fill out the questionnaires. One hundred questionnaire copies were distributed for the trial and 100 copies were returned; 400 questionnaires were formally issued, and 324 copies were returned. The recovery rate is 81%.</p>
