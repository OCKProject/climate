 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">School lunch institutional catering creates nonprofit group meals for schoolchildren (Mary &amp; Gregoire, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0035">2001</a>). The catering mainly provides growing children with a nutritious health diet that is tasty, healthy, and safe, with balanced nutrition. It does not emphasize delicate ingredients; rather, eating can be finished within a fixed time, and the meal has a low cost with fixed timing, quantity, and pricing (Henroid &amp; Sneed, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0024">2004</a>). Schools need adequate food safety training for food supply staff to ensure safe operation practices and to incorporate them into the school's food safety management plan (Curwood, Arendt, Rajagopal, &amp; Stephen, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0017">2017</a>). Jipiu, Abdullah, Ariffin, Anuar, and Mohi (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0027">2016</a>) showed that school dietary staff members have good knowledge and positive behavior to prevent cross‐contamination, perform hand cleaning procedures, maintain personal hygiene, and use disposable gloves. Although this study's results are satisfactory, it also clearly points out that food operators still lack food safety behaviors that would directly lead to the prevention of food‐borne diseases in schoolchildren.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0014">2015</a>), the three most common food safety misconducts that result in unsafe food and food‐borne illness are food handling errors, poor personal hygiene, and cross‐contamination. Painter et al. (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0045">2013</a>) found that of the 17 food categories, the highest percentage (46%) cause of food‐borne diseases is the production process. This finding again demonstrates the importance of food safety training of school kitchen staff for food production and processing.
