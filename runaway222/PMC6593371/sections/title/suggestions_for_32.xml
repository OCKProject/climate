 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaders should engage employees when making decisions before making changes affecting employees. They should have good interaction with employees and make employees feel supported and respected. Employees should be given necessary education and training. In addition to the required health education according to regulations, employees can be encouraged to participate in relevant studies and develop skills, such as obtaining licenses as Chinese food technicians, taking small‐boiler training courses, cooking courses, and healthy eating courses, to enhance the value of their work, inject vigor into their work, and input competitiveness into their organization.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The company/school should remain flexible and be willing to employ new ideas. The company/school should review the relevant work regulations, conform to the trend of the times and regulations, encourage employees to receive education and training, and update or repair kitchen facilities and equipment timely. In addition, it should provide leadership‐style training courses for managers and make employees aware that the company/school has clear policies and flexible practices. Moreover, the school can actively seek funding from higher level units, including for equipment maintenance and renewal, employee salary subsidies, and grants for study courses. At the same time, additional integration activities can be added and transparency of company information can be increased to make employees work in a better environment, thus facilitating their compliance with food safety behaviors.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Employees can accurately understand the advantages and disadvantages of the workplace and related equipment operations and maintenance and make recommendations. The company/school should update or repair work equipment to meet the needs of employees at the right time and facilitate the smooth preparation of lunches. Since lunch preparation is very constrained, and work efficiency needs to be maintained to enable dining on time, a good and normal operation of the equipment is required under such time pressure, as much preparation time for employees is needed to comply with work norms, food safety, and hygiene behaviors.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The firm can also help employees be aware of business goals. When employees are immersed in hard work, they can be told about organizational goals. In addition to providing meals on time, the most important goal is to ensure safety and hygiene. To enable employees to understand the value of their work, the company/school needs to pass on experience through education and training.</p>
