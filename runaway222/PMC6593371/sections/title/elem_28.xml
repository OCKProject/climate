  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conclusion</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leadership styles, organizational climate, and employees' compliance with food safety and hygiene behaviors are positively correlated. There is a significantly positive impact of transactional leadership style and transformational leadership style on organizational climate, there is a significantly positive impact of organizational climate on employees' compliance with food safety and hygiene behaviors, there is a significantly positive impact of transactional leadership style and transformational leadership style on employees' compliance with food safety and hygiene behaviors, and there is a significantly positive impact of transactional leadership style, transformational leadership style, and organizational climate on employees' food safety and hygiene behaviors. Organizational climate has a complete mediating effect between the transactional and transformational leadership style on food safety and hygiene behaviors. In other words, the employees working in institutional food service can enhance compliance with food safety and hygiene behaviors via the mediating effect of organizational climate.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ohly and Fritz (
    <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0044">2010</a>) found that leadership style has a significant impact on organizational climate, while organizational climate has a comprehensive impact on the organization because it impacts organizational performance. Therefore, it is recommended that supervisors of institutional food service strengthen their education and training of managers in school lunchtime kitchens and make the employees aware that leadership style and corporate/school system are good for building relationships between managers and employees on the job site.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of this study show that organizational climate has a significant impact on food safety and hygiene behaviors of employees of institutional food services. The study also finds that organizational climate is an intermediary factor in the leadership style of food safety and health behavior. Therefore, it is recommended that the supervisors of institutional food services should create a good organizational climate that is beneficial for employees to adhere to food safety and hygiene behaviors.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of this study show that leadership style has a significant impact on food safety and health behaviors of the employees of institutional food services. However, the difference between transactional leadership style and transformational leadership style is not significant. In other words, both leadership styles are applicable to employees of institutional food services; thus, management can use them freely to achieve organizational goals. With regard to the development of transactional and transformational leadership styles, it is recommended that the supervisors of institutional food services receive leadership training courses for empowerment training and have interschool/company visits for observations, exchanges, and experience sharing.</p>

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Suggestions for lunch team of a company providing institutional food service/school—Creation of organizational climate</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaders should engage employees when making decisions before making changes affecting employees. They should have good interaction with employees and make employees feel supported and respected. Employees should be given necessary education and training. In addition to the required health education according to regulations, employees can be encouraged to participate in relevant studies and develop skills, such as obtaining licenses as Chinese food technicians, taking small‐boiler training courses, cooking courses, and healthy eating courses, to enhance the value of their work, inject vigor into their work, and input competitiveness into their organization.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The company/school should remain flexible and be willing to employ new ideas. The company/school should review the relevant work regulations, conform to the trend of the times and regulations, encourage employees to receive education and training, and update or repair kitchen facilities and equipment timely. In addition, it should provide leadership‐style training courses for managers and make employees aware that the company/school has clear policies and flexible practices. Moreover, the school can actively seek funding from higher level units, including for equipment maintenance and renewal, employee salary subsidies, and grants for study courses. At the same time, additional integration activities can be added and transparency of company information can be increased to make employees work in a better environment, thus facilitating their compliance with food safety behaviors.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Employees can accurately understand the advantages and disadvantages of the workplace and related equipment operations and maintenance and make recommendations. The company/school should update or repair work equipment to meet the needs of employees at the right time and facilitate the smooth preparation of lunches. Since lunch preparation is very constrained, and work efficiency needs to be maintained to enable dining on time, a good and normal operation of the equipment is required under such time pressure, as much preparation time for employees is needed to comply with work norms, food safety, and hygiene behaviors.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The firm can also help employees be aware of business goals. When employees are immersed in hard work, they can be told about organizational goals. In addition to providing meals on time, the most important goal is to ensure safety and hygiene. To enable employees to understand the value of their work, the company/school needs to pass on experience through education and training.</p>

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Suggestions for individuals of employees of institutional food services</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is recommended that employees should be rational in reflecting their suggestions for work or personal needs. They should respect the managers at the job site, follow normal communication channels to reflect their own opinions on appropriate occasions to create good interaction with supervisors, and actively participate in education and training and obtain relevant certificates.</p>

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Suggestions for future research and limitations</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A questionnaire survey method was adopted as the research method of this study. The depth and value of research results can be enhanced if long‐term observations or qualitative interviews are used for looking into the impact of leadership style and organizational climate on employee food safety and hygiene behaviors to further understand employees' views on leadership style and organizational climate.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regulations require that 70% of staff working in institutional food service in school lunch kitchens must have a license as a Chinese food technician. Presently, it is not clear whether all institutional food service companies or schools are encouraging employees to obtain this license. However, some companies and schools encourage employees to actively obtain certification by way of subsidy fees and monthly incentives granted after obtaining the license. As previously indicated, employees who have food safety certifications have a significantly better attitude and intention regarding food safety and hygiene behaviors. At the same time, food safety certification presents a mediating effect (Lee et al., 
    <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0031">2013</a>). Therefore, it is suggested that in the future, whether or not an employee has a Chinese food technician license should be studied to investigate the related mediating effect of leadership style on food safety and health behaviors.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of the questionnaires in this study were distributed by the school dietitian to the staff of the institutional food service serving in the school. Because school dietitians are either direct managers or supervisors at the job site, the subjects might therefore be less willing to fill out their true thoughts or opinions. Some subjects might be affected by social desirability bias when filling out questionnaires and give answers they think correct are socially acceptable. An example is the first question in the scale of compliance with food safety behaviors: “I have observed food safety behaviors during my working hours.” This statement is considered socially acceptable—that is, everyone should comply with food safety regulations. Therefore, the employee may be inclined to agree or strongly agree with this statement, whether or not that person actually complies with food safety behaviors. This bias may thus affect the average mean of variables.</p>
