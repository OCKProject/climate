  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leadership is the ability of a leader to increase the effectiveness of the group (Northouse, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0043">2013</a>). In other words, a group of people with specific goals, when faced with challenges or conflicts, makes use of many different resources to satisfy the motivation of the members and reach goals (Burns, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0013">1978</a>). Maxwell (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0037">1998</a>) stated that leadership is the process of leading members to achieve organizational goals. General leadership style is often divided into transactional leadership and transformational leadership. Transactional leaders trade or exchange valuable things (e.g., in the form of compensation, status, and other incentives) to encourage followers to achieve the most basic job performance; on the other hand, transformational leaders inspire and improve followers to achieve higher levels of performance than usual and to promote greater demand and desire among group members (Northouse, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0043">2013</a>). Transactional leaders and organization members agree on terms, and the leaders recognize and reward hard‐working employees and correct or punish employees for deviations or errors (Burns, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0013">1978</a>). Transformational leaders motivate employees to go beyond specific expectations (Doucet, Fredette, Simard, &amp; Tremblay, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0018">2015</a>). Transformational leaders focus on promoting higher levels of motivation and morality for leaders and followers. This form of leadership is concerned with the needs and motives of followers and tries to help followers exert their maximum potential (Kouzes &amp; Posner, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0029">2012</a>; Northouse, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0043">2013</a>). To adapt to a highly competitive ecological environment, an organization is bound to seek changes and innovations, and transformational leaders have a positive impact on successful organizational change (Ahmad &amp; Gelaidan, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0001">2011</a>). Kreitner and Kinicki (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0030">2001</a>) believe that transformational leadership achieves the process of interaction between leaders and subordinates by enhancing this relationship to the level of morality and motivation beyond the original contractual relationship, where the subordinates sincerely respect the leader and are willing to follow and obey, and the incentive actions of the leader cause the subordinates to accept the organization's vision and mission. Sheraz, Zaheer, Rehman, and Nadeem (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0049">2012</a>) also state that transformational leaders can enhance the value of ethics in the workplace.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stringer (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0050">2002</a>) advocated that organizational climate is a part of culture, and leadership behavior has the greatest impact on organizational climate. Organizational climate can be viewed as employees' perception of the working environment and therefore can be defined as the shared cognition of the organization and work environment by members of the organization (James et al., 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0026">2008</a>). Organizational climate reflects the perceptions and emotions that members of the organization have about the nature of their work environment (Glisson &amp; James, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0020">2002</a>). Leading the organization to establish a good organizational climate is a very important task for leaders (Ohly &amp; Fritz, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0044">2010</a>). Organizational climate is also a key factor in determining employee behavior (Ball, Wilcock, &amp; Colwell, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0004">2010</a>). As food preparation becomes increasingly commercial, the risk of potential food‐borne hazards in dining establishments due to poor food handling and hygiene is increasing, and changing employee behavior and creating a food safety culture in the organization are necessary considerations for reducing such hazards (Yiannas, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0055">2009</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Food safety and hygiene</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Food‐borne illness is a disease transmitted through the intake of infected foods and is one of the most widespread and significant public health problems (WHO, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0054">2000</a>). If a restaurant, a catered event, or a packed meal involves the slightest negligence in the manufacturing process, such as poor sanitation in dishes or packed meals, it can easily result in group food poisoning (Wall, de Louvois, Gilbert, &amp; Rowe, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0052">1996</a>). Griffith, Livesey, and Clayton (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0022">2010</a>) also estimates that approximately 70% of food poisoning cases occur in commercial food service places such as restaurants. Food‐borne illnesses associated with staff typically emerge one after another, and the frequency of occurrence appears to be increasing (Greig, Todd, Bartleson, &amp; Michaels, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0021">2007</a>). The most common causes of illness include poor personal hygiene, cross‐contamination, and inadequate time/temperature (Guzewich &amp; Ross, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0023">1999</a>). An employee's personal beliefs and attitudes toward consumer health and a sense of honor toward the job will affect the employee's food safety behavior (Pragle, Harding, &amp; Mack, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0048">2007</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">School lunch institutional catering</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">School lunch institutional catering creates nonprofit group meals for schoolchildren (Mary &amp; Gregoire, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0035">2001</a>). The catering mainly provides growing children with a nutritious health diet that is tasty, healthy, and safe, with balanced nutrition. It does not emphasize delicate ingredients; rather, eating can be finished within a fixed time, and the meal has a low cost with fixed timing, quantity, and pricing (Henroid &amp; Sneed, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0024">2004</a>). Schools need adequate food safety training for food supply staff to ensure safe operation practices and to incorporate them into the school's food safety management plan (Curwood, Arendt, Rajagopal, &amp; Stephen, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0017">2017</a>). Jipiu, Abdullah, Ariffin, Anuar, and Mohi (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0027">2016</a>) showed that school dietary staff members have good knowledge and positive behavior to prevent cross‐contamination, perform hand cleaning procedures, maintain personal hygiene, and use disposable gloves. Although this study's results are satisfactory, it also clearly points out that food operators still lack food safety behaviors that would directly lead to the prevention of food‐borne diseases in schoolchildren.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0014">2015</a>), the three most common food safety misconducts that result in unsafe food and food‐borne illness are food handling errors, poor personal hygiene, and cross‐contamination. Painter et al. (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0045">2013</a>) found that of the 17 food categories, the highest percentage (46%) cause of food‐borne diseases is the production process. This finding again demonstrates the importance of food safety training of school kitchen staff for food production and processing.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cloete (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0016">2011</a>) stated that organizational climate theory advocates that leaders in an organization have a significant influence on deciding organizational climate. If there are better leaders in the organization, then the organization will be more productive, more competitive, and more responsive (Griffith et al., 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0022">2010</a>). Organizational climate is top‐down, starting with the superior and influencing the subordinate (Yianns, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0055">2009</a>). Lemons, Newsome, and Brashears (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0032">2013</a>) pointed out that “leadership behavior directly affects organizational climate.” Eustace and Martins (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0019">2011</a>) show that there is a strong positive correlation between heuristic leadership and organizational climate. On the other hand, transformational leadership can create an innovative organizational climate and increase employee creativity and satisfaction (Mohamed, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0038">2016</a>). Therefore, the author present H1 and H2: Transactional or transformational leadership styles have a direct impact on organizational climate.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Organizational climate is considered a collective attitude of employees toward the organization (Burton, Lauridsen, &amp; Obel, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0011">2004</a>). Organizational climate is also formed through interactions between employees and affects the behavior of employees within the organization (Manning, Davidson, &amp; Manning, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0034">2005</a>). Pragle et al. (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0048">2007</a>) suggested that an organization's goals and expectations must be expressed clearly to employees, food safety training must be provided, strict regulations on food safety handling behaviors must be in place, and proper education must be provided to new employees so that the employees can become accustomed to food safety regulations upon entering the organization. Food safety is the behavior reflecting the food safety culture and food safety climate (Powell, Jacob, &amp; Chapman, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0047">2011</a>). If an organization provides an environment of proper food safety behaviors and encourages employees to comply with food safety behaviors, then employees will perceive that the organization offers a positive food safety organizational climate. Employees will then have a positive will to comply with food safety behavior. Therefore, we have H3: Organizational climate has a positive impact on employees' compliance with food safety and hygiene behaviors.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transformational leaders have a positive effect on employee self‐efficacy, motivation, creativity, and organizational performance (Bronkhorst, Steijn, &amp; Vermeeren, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0012">2015</a>; Kim &amp; Yoon, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0028">2015</a>; Newland, Newton, Podlog, Legg, &amp; Tanner, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0042">2015</a>). Transactional leaders can increase job satisfaction and organizational identification (LePine, Zhang, Crawford, &amp; Rich, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0033">2015</a>). Transformational leaders predict outcomes for individuals, groups, and organizations and make employees feel positive about job satisfaction through leadership behaviors of caring for employees (Wang, Oh, Courtright, &amp; Colbert, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0053">2011</a>). Leaders should motivate employees, give positive feedback, and recognize good behaviors so that employees can be motivated to work in a safe and secure manner (Griffith et al., 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0022">2010</a>). Therefore, we have H4 and H5: Transactional and transformational leadership styles have a direct impact on employees' compliance with food safety and hygiene behaviors.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stringer (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0050">2002</a>) proposed that “leadership behavior directly influences organizational climate.” Leaders provide employees with respect and trust by the leadership behavior of caring for employees, making employees' perceptual reaction to organizational climate better; on the other hand, transformational leaders can create an innovative organizational climate and increase employee creativity and employee satisfaction (Mohamed, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0038">2016</a>). Pragle et al. (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0048">2007</a>) argued that the organization's goals and expectations must be expressed clearly to employees, food safety training must be provided, strict regulations on food safety handling behaviors must be in place, and proper education must be provided to new employees so that the employees can become accustomed to food safety regulations when entering the organization. Neal, Griffin, and Hart (
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0041">2000</a>) found that the organizational climate of the organization as a whole will significantly affect the safety climate in the workplace (safety climate is defined as a specific type of organizational climate, which describes the health and safety of the workplace as perceived by the employees). Safety climate is associated with employees' compliance with safety regulations and procedures in the workplace. If employees perceive that their organization treats them well and provides them with a positive organizational climate, then the employees will respond to the organization with positive attitudes and behaviors, such as more effort, more positive work‐related attitudes, and lower resignation rates (Aryee, Budhwar, &amp; Chen, 
   <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0003">2002</a>). Hence, we have H6 and H7: Organizational climate is the mediating factor in transactional or transformational leadership styles for employees to comply with food safety and hygiene behaviors.
