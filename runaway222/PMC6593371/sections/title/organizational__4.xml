  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0050">2002</a>) advocated that organizational climate is a part of culture, and leadership behavior has the greatest impact on organizational climate. Organizational climate can be viewed as employees' perception of the working environment and therefore can be defined as the shared cognition of the organization and work environment by members of the organization (James et al., 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0026">2008</a>). Organizational climate reflects the perceptions and emotions that members of the organization have about the nature of their work environment (Glisson &amp; James, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0020">2002</a>). Leading the organization to establish a good organizational climate is a very important task for leaders (Ohly &amp; Fritz, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0044">2010</a>). Organizational climate is also a key factor in determining employee behavior (Ball, Wilcock, &amp; Colwell, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0004">2010</a>). As food preparation becomes increasingly commercial, the risk of potential food‚Äêborne hazards in dining establishments due to poor food handling and hygiene is increasing, and changing employee behavior and creating a food safety culture in the organization are necessary considerations for reducing such hazards (Yiannas, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0055">2009</a>).
