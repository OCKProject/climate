  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0016">2011</a>) stated that organizational climate theory advocates that leaders in an organization have a significant influence on deciding organizational climate. If there are better leaders in the organization, then the organization will be more productive, more competitive, and more responsive (Griffith et al., 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0022">2010</a>). Organizational climate is top‐down, starting with the superior and influencing the subordinate (Yianns, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0055">2009</a>). Lemons, Newsome, and Brashears (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0032">2013</a>) pointed out that “leadership behavior directly affects organizational climate.” Eustace and Martins (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0019">2011</a>) show that there is a strong positive correlation between heuristic leadership and organizational climate. On the other hand, transformational leadership can create an innovative organizational climate and increase employee creativity and satisfaction (Mohamed, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0038">2016</a>). Therefore, the author present H1 and H2: Transactional or transformational leadership styles have a direct impact on organizational climate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Organizational climate is considered a collective attitude of employees toward the organization (Burton, Lauridsen, &amp; Obel, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0011">2004</a>). Organizational climate is also formed through interactions between employees and affects the behavior of employees within the organization (Manning, Davidson, &amp; Manning, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0034">2005</a>). Pragle et al. (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0048">2007</a>) suggested that an organization's goals and expectations must be expressed clearly to employees, food safety training must be provided, strict regulations on food safety handling behaviors must be in place, and proper education must be provided to new employees so that the employees can become accustomed to food safety regulations upon entering the organization. Food safety is the behavior reflecting the food safety culture and food safety climate (Powell, Jacob, &amp; Chapman, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0047">2011</a>). If an organization provides an environment of proper food safety behaviors and encourages employees to comply with food safety behaviors, then employees will perceive that the organization offers a positive food safety organizational climate. Employees will then have a positive will to comply with food safety behavior. Therefore, we have H3: Organizational climate has a positive impact on employees' compliance with food safety and hygiene behaviors.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transformational leaders have a positive effect on employee self‐efficacy, motivation, creativity, and organizational performance (Bronkhorst, Steijn, &amp; Vermeeren, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0012">2015</a>; Kim &amp; Yoon, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0028">2015</a>; Newland, Newton, Podlog, Legg, &amp; Tanner, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0042">2015</a>). Transactional leaders can increase job satisfaction and organizational identification (LePine, Zhang, Crawford, &amp; Rich, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0033">2015</a>). Transformational leaders predict outcomes for individuals, groups, and organizations and make employees feel positive about job satisfaction through leadership behaviors of caring for employees (Wang, Oh, Courtright, &amp; Colbert, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0053">2011</a>). Leaders should motivate employees, give positive feedback, and recognize good behaviors so that employees can be motivated to work in a safe and secure manner (Griffith et al., 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0022">2010</a>). Therefore, we have H4 and H5: Transactional and transformational leadership styles have a direct impact on employees' compliance with food safety and hygiene behaviors.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stringer (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0050">2002</a>) proposed that “leadership behavior directly influences organizational climate.” Leaders provide employees with respect and trust by the leadership behavior of caring for employees, making employees' perceptual reaction to organizational climate better; on the other hand, transformational leaders can create an innovative organizational climate and increase employee creativity and employee satisfaction (Mohamed, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0038">2016</a>). Pragle et al. (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0048">2007</a>) argued that the organization's goals and expectations must be expressed clearly to employees, food safety training must be provided, strict regulations on food safety handling behaviors must be in place, and proper education must be provided to new employees so that the employees can become accustomed to food safety regulations when entering the organization. Neal, Griffin, and Hart (
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0041">2000</a>) found that the organizational climate of the organization as a whole will significantly affect the safety climate in the workplace (safety climate is defined as a specific type of organizational climate, which describes the health and safety of the workplace as perceived by the employees). Safety climate is associated with employees' compliance with safety regulations and procedures in the workplace. If employees perceive that their organization treats them well and provides them with a positive organizational climate, then the employees will respond to the organization with positive attitudes and behaviors, such as more effort, more positive work‐related attitudes, and lower resignation rates (Aryee, Budhwar, &amp; Chen, 
  <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0003">2002</a>). Hence, we have H6 and H7: Organizational climate is the mediating factor in transactional or transformational leadership styles for employees to comply with food safety and hygiene behaviors.
