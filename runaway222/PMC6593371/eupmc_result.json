    "This study took the employees working in the institutional food service of schools in northern Taiwan as subjects to explore the influences of leadership style and organizational climate on food safety and hygiene behaviors. In this study, 400 questionnaires were distributed and 324 valid questionnaires were collected, for a valid return rate of 81%. The results showed that leadership style and organizational climate positively correlate with employees' behaviors with respect to food safety and hygiene. Transactional and transformational leadership have a significantly positive effect on organizational climate. Organizational climate has a significantly positive impact on employees' food safety and hygiene behaviors. Transactional and transformational leadership have a significantly positive effect on employees' food safety and hygiene behaviors, but the difference between the two factors is not obvious. Organizational climate has a complete mediating effect on the process of transactional and transformational leadership affecting food safety and hygiene behaviors."
