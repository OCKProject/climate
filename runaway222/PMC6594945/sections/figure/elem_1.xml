  <p>(
   <span class="bold">A</span>) Regional 2-D seismic line across the Falkland Plateau slope, across the South Falkland Slope Drift and Lower Falkland Slope Drift. All seismic sections are in the time domain (vertical axis is Two-Way Time) and have a ~5x vertical exaggeration (VE) unless otherwise stated. Blue, circled, letter A represents the core of the current flowing away from the reader. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) Compressed (~20x VE) seismic section across the SFSD, with main horizons from Koenitz 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span>, and location of the Toroa#1 geotechnical borehole. Black arrows indicate erosional truncation of underlying seismic reflections at the base-drift unconformity. (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) Regional 2-D seismic line across the central Falkland Plateau, showing stepped/terraced morphology and erosional (and minor depositional) features associated with the SAF. The white dashed line indicates the possible seafloor height before erosion by the SAF. Seismic lines were originally acquired by Wavefield and PGS. (
   <span class="bold">D</span>) Lithologies and interpreted ages of the Toroa#1 borehole through the SFSD, acquired and analysed by BHP. Core recovery is shown by the black (sample) and white (core gap) barcode to the right of the lithology column. The key to the lithology is shown in Fig.
