  <p>Seismic sections from the FINA 3D survey and geotechnical boreholes through the Falkland Sand Sheet. (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) Depth (i) and seismic amplitude map (ii) of the seabed around the Loligo well locations. White line shows location of the seismic section in panel C. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) Depth map of the seabed across a linear array of circular-elliptical scour features in the northeast of the survey area. White line shows location of the seismic section in panel D. Locations of maps A and B are shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>. (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) Seismic line across the Loligo#A and Loligo#C geotechnical boreholes. The high-impedance seismic package near the seabed around Loligo#C is absent around Loligo#A. Dashed orange horizon is the Bartonian-Priabonian (37.8 Ma) boundary, which is offset by numerous polygonal faults. (
   <span class="bold">D</span>) Seismic line along a linear array of asymmetric circular-elliptical scour features, typically 1–3 km in diameter, and parallel to the main flow of the SAF (blue arrow). Scours are mostly asymmetric, with a steep SW flank and a shallow NE flank, with sand preferentially deposited on the NE (down-current) flank. (
   <span class="bold">E</span>) Lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic correlation of Loligo#C and Loligo#A wells, acquired and analysed by BHP, which penetrate the Falkland Sand Sheet. Core recovery is shown by the black (sample) and white (core gap) barcode to the right of the lithology column. Detailed biostratigraphic data are shown in Appendix
