  <p>(
   <span class="bold">A</span>) Topographic features, plate tectonic and oceanographic setting of the Falkland Plateau (FP; outline in black dashed line), showing locations of main fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, including the Subantarctic Front (SAF), Polar Front (PF) and Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF)

   </span>. The yellow star shows the location of the 54–54 passage, where the SAF crosses the North Scotia Ridge between Burdwood Bank and Davis Bank. Image created using GeoMapApp. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) Salinity and velocity data across the Falkland Plateau from the World Ocean Atlas, created using Ocean Data View software

   </span>. Blue dashed line shows the pycnoclines between water masses, including Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW), Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW), and Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW). White dashed lines are velocity contours (in cm/s), measured using acoustic doppler current profilers on a parallel transect

   <span class="bold">C</span>) Location map of the western Falkland Plateau showing depth contours (in metres), seismic and well data, and main sedimentary/geomorphological features associated with the SAF, including the main contourite drifts and the Falkland Terrace and the individual sand deposits that make up the Falkland Sand Sheet, based on the presence of high impedance seismic packages with distinct geomorphological features at the seafloor. SFSD – South Falkland Slope Drift; LFSD – Lower Falkland Slope Drift.
