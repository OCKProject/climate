  <p>Seismic attributes from 3D data across the Falkland Terrace and Falkland Sand Sheet. Locations of the FINA (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) and FISA (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) survey are shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. Attributes include depth, dip angle and absolute amplitude for both surveys, as well as an isopach (sediment thickness) map of the sand sheet for the FINA survey. ‘Warm’ colours (green-red) on the amplitude maps represent sand, which has a higher acoustic impedance than shale near the seafloor. The main geomorphological features annotated on the maps include individual sand sheets (ss), sand ribbons (sr), circular-elliptical scours (cs), erosional remnants (er) and escarpments (es), all of which are produced by bottom currents associated with the Subantarctic Front.
