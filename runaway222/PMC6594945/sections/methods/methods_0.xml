 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use a regional 2D multichannel seismic reflection dataset and two large (total of ~12,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) 3D seismic reflection volumes (the FINA and FISA surveys), as well as biostratigraphic and lithological data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span> from three geotechnical boreholes (Toroa#1, Loligo#A and Loligo#C; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), and two deep exploration boreholes (Toroa-1 and Loligo-1), to calibrate stratigraphic age and lithology. Core recovery for the geotechnical boreholes is typically 10% on average. Biostratigraphic data from these boreholes are summarized in the Appendices, and the original data are available from the Falkland Island Government’s Department of Mineral Resources (

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 3D surveys were acquired by PGS using two Bolt LLXT airguns with an air pressure of 2000 psi and 4130 cubic inch volume. Data were recorded using an array of 12*6.6 km long streamers at 120 m spacing, each with 528 Hydroscience 24 bit hydrophones at a 12.5 m group interval. The data were processed using a 3D Kirchhoff pre-stack time migration (PSTM) sequence.</p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shallow seismic velocities (
  <span class="italic">v</span>) of around 1600–2000 metres per second, and a dominant frequency (
  <span class="italic">f</span>) of ~40–50 Hz give a vertical resolution (
  <span class="italic">v/4f</span>) of around 10 m for the shallow sections of these surveys, with a horizontal resolution of 12.5 m. Well-to-seismic ties were carried out using an average velocity of 1520 m/s for shallow sediments, derived from calibrated time-depth pairs in the Loligo-1 well (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Seismic interpretation was carried out using Schlumberger Petrel 2015 software, including horizon mapping, dip and amplitude extractions for seismic geomorphological analyses
