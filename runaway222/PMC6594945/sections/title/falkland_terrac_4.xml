 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Falkland Terrace covers a large area of the eastern Falkland Plateau slope, between 1200 m and 1800 m water depth (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2C</a>). 3D seismic data across the Falkland Terrace shows that the seabed has a markedly rugose morphology, with numerous erosional features, both parallel and perpendicular to the slope and to modern currents (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). These include slope-parallel erosional escarpments, with seabed gradients locally exceeding 45 degrees and relief up to 200 m, plateau-like erosional ‘remnants’ bounded by escarpments, and circular-elliptical scour features, typically 0.5–3 km in diameter and up to 100 m deep (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). These scours form in discrete clusters parallel to the slope contours, and are markedly asymmetrical with a steep scarp at the up-current end and a gentler slope extending down-current.

Attributes include depth, dip angle and absolute amplitude for both surveys, as well as an isopach (sediment thickness) map of the sand sheet for the FINA survey. ‘Warm’ colours (green-red) on the amplitude maps represent sand, which has a higher acoustic impedance than shale near the seafloor. The main geomorphological features annotated on the maps include individual sand sheets (ss), sand ribbons (sr), circular-elliptical scours (cs), erosional remnants (er) and escarpments (es), all of which are produced by bottom currents associated with the Subantarctic Front.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These various erosional features occur both at the seabed and underlying a high-impedance seismic package, which is present across a large area of the Falkland Terrace (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Where present, this high-impedance package has a much higher amplitude seabed reflector than surrounding areas, and a strong negative base reflector (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4C</a>). This shows that this feature has a significantly higher acoustic impedance than adjacent or subjacent units. This high-impedance package is typically located down-slope of moats (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2C</a>, inset), on the plateau-like erosional remnants (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4C</a>), and on the northeast (down-current) side of individual erosional bedforms (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4D</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two wells penetrate the shallow stratigraphy, including the high-impedance seismic package. This package is not evident in the seismic data at the Loligo#A location (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4C</a>). This well penetrated a thin (~2 m, below seismic resolution), sand-dominated interval (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4E</a>), with a Holocene-Pleistocene age inferred from the presence of 
  <span class="italic">E.huxleyi, C.leptoporus</span> microfossil assemblages
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. Neritic foraminifera and the presence of glauconite indicate a shallow water origin for the sediment, whereas abundant Eocene microfossils indicate a substantial degree of reworking of older sediments. Below 3 m, there is a distinct change in both lithology and fossil assemblages, with the sediment being dominated by mudstone of exclusively late Eocene (Priabonian − 35–37 Ma) age.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Loligo#C well penetrated a thicker (16.5 m) sequence of sand, with fossil assemblages of Oligocene to Holocene age, indicating long-lived coarse-grained sediment transport and reworking. The base of the sand package is most likely earliest Oligocene (~34 Ma), but with a minimum age of 25.1 Ma, based on the abundance of 
  <span class="italic">Chiasmolithus altus</span> and other Oligocene nannofossil assemblages
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. Most of the sand is Oligocene-Pliocene in age, with only the shallowest ~1 m of Holocene age. Pleistocene sediments are absent, or were missed due to the sampling frequency. The base of this 16.5 m-thick sand coincides with the base of the high-impedance seismic package, which is evident from the seismic at this location, confirming that the high-impedance seismic package represents an extensive Oligocene-Recent sand deposit, herein referred to as the Falkland Sand Sheet. Below ~16.5 m, there is a distinctive change to latest Eocene – earliest Oligocene mudstone, with a distinct absence of reworked fossil assemblages. Unequivocal Priabonian (late Eocene) species dominate the mudstone sequence from ~26 m depth, with Bartonian (middle Eocene) species occurring below 99 m.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The high-impedance seismic package which we interpret as the Falkland Sand Sheet has been mapped across both the FINA and FISA surveys, as well as on the 2D data. It covers around half of the seafloor across the Falkland Terrace, (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), a total area of more than 30,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. Where present it is typically 10 ms (minimum seismic resolution) to 75 ms ‘thick’ in TWT (~60 m thickness) and locally as much as 150 ms TWT (~112 m true thickness) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3A</a>). Assuming an average thickness, of ~30 m where present (50% of the total area), we estimate the total volume of sediment in the Falkland Sand Sheet to be around 900 km
  <span class="sup">3</span>. As such, this is the largest contourite sand sheet to be recognized anywhere in the modern or ancient sedimentary record, to our knowledge.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extensive individual sand sheets, ‘ribbons’ and sand waves, are evident in both map view and on seismic cross sections. Individual sand sheets range in size from several hundred to over 2000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Individual sand ‘ribbons’, which may represent sand infilling elongate erosional troughs rather than depositional bedforms, can be traced over at least 2–10 km (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). The gently sinuous sand wave crests extend up to 5 km laterally, with wavelengths typically around 500 m, and are oriented perpendicular, or highly oblique, to the isobaths (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3B</a>). The sand has a complex relationship with the erosional features mentioned above, many of which have evidently pre-dated the deposition of the sand itself, and then partly controlled the location of sand deposition. This is particularly evident within the circular-elliptical scour features, where the sand is preferentially deposited on the shallow-dipping upstream-facing side relative to prevailing currents (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Although these are primarily erosional bedforms, we interpret the dominant process as being analogous to cyclic steps in turbidite systems, where the flow initially accelerates and becomes more turbulent (and erosive) on the lee-side of the scours, and then decelerates and deposits sediment on the stoss side
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. This indicates that the currents are supercritical, at least periodically, and that flow was continuously south-west to north-east, as in the present day.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is clear that the whole of the Falkland Terrace has been affected by prolonged and extensive erosion. Such slope-parallel terraces are known to form under the persistent action of bottom currents, especially where the interface between water masses impinges on the seafloor
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. It is here that kinetic energy transferred to the seafloor is at a maximum. Significant erosion in this case may partly coincide with the interface (pycnocline-thermocline couple) between the AAIW and UCDW, which intersects the slope at around ~1200 m water depth. Hydrodynamic activity at this interface can be elevated by an order of magnitude or more in the presence of benthic storms or by the action of internal waves
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. However, although the updip limit of the Falkland Terrace coincides with the AAIW-UCDW pycnocline, the erosional features extend well down the continental slope to a depth of 1800 m or more, corresponding closely with the location of the Subantarctic Front
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although there is strong evidence that the primary mechanism for such pronounced erosion was (and is) strong bottom currents associated with the SAF, measured current velocities at the seafloor in the region of the SAF are only in the order of 0.1–0.2 ms
  <span class="sup">−1 </span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>, which are significantly lower than the predicted current strength for generating the erosive (&gt;1 ms
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and depositional (0.5–0.8 ms
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) bedforms observed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. Erosion may be enhanced by the presence of episodic, fast-flowing, meso-scale eddies and vortices related to the interaction of the front with complex seafloor topography. In the area around the 54–54 passage, such eddies have been observed in present-day seismic oceanographic records
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>, with modelled velocities of several metres per second in the area
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. However, both eddies and turbulence at the pycnocline would also affect the plateau to the south, in the vicinity of the SFSD, where erosion and coarse-grained deposition has not occurred since the Pleistocene. Therefore, it seems likely that the currents which generated the Falkland Sand Sheet were significantly stronger than those forming the Pleistocene-Recent SFSD.
