 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is evident from our seismic stratigraphic observations and data from the shallow boreholes that substantial changes in SAF intensity have taken place since the Paleogene. Eocene sediments penetrated in Loligo#A and Loligo#C are dominated by biosiliceous pelagic sediment, with little terrigenous input and no evidence of bottom-current reworking of older sediment in the deep ocean. By contrast, the Oligocene-Recent sediment encountered in the Falkland Sand Sheet sits on top of an erosional surface, with evidence from seismic reflection terminations, and our interpretation of an exhumed Opal A-CT transition, for up to 300 m of erosion in places, clearly formed by high-energy along-slope bottom currents. We interpret the unconformity as marking the onset of strong bottom currents associated with the SAF in the Falkland Plateau region. This major oceanographic change occurred after 35 Ma, in the earliest Oligocene (or possibly latest Eocene), and by 25 Ma at the latest. Our interpretation of the data is that the erosional unconformity occurred at or very close to the Eocene-Oligocene boundary.</p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This erosional unconformity was not only a result of uplift of an active forebulge
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>, but was primarily caused by intense bottom current erosion throughout the region, acting over a long period of time. This, therefore, provides us with a most likely age (~34 Ma) of ACC onset, which precisely matches the generally accepted onset of global cooling at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. It is consistent with the hypothesis that thermal isolation of Antarctica by the ACC was a fundamental component of this transition, rather than global cooling being purely a function of atmospheric CO

  <span class="sup">

  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span> due to changes in wind-strength that drives the ACC
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. The onset of the wind-driven ACC likely had a direct role in changing atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations at the Eocene-Oligocene transition as well. We note that this predates the onset of ocean spreading in the Drake Passage (~26.5 Ma
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>), and indicates that an intermediate-depth gateway must have formed by the early Oligocene, which was sufficient to allow shallow and intermediate water circulation around Antarctica. These data also necessitate the presence of a sufficiently deep 54–54 passage in the North Scotia Ridge to allow the SAF to flow across the bathymetric barrier by this time. We note that a marked Eocene-Oligocene unconformity is evident elsewhere along the Atlantic margins indicating that the entire AMOC was affected
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The onset of drift deposition in the SFSD and LFSD, by contrast, was significantly later, with a Middle Pleistocene age interpreted for the base of the penetrated sequence. Although the oldest drift sediments have not been penetrated
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>, extrapolation of sedimentation rates from the upper succession would suggest that the entire drift is younger than 0.5–0.7 Ma. Minor erosional unconformities within this are associated with thin silt or sand beds, indicating that they were formed by elevated current conditions, most likely due to the alignment of the SWW with the Drake Passage to the east. This may also explain the onset of sedimentation in the muddy drift at this time, as it seems that current conditions prior to the Pleistocene were likely too strong to allow the deposition of fine-grained sediment. Ongoing erosion at this location continued from the Oligocene until the Pleistocene, by which time weaker current conditions allowed the muddy drift to accumulate. We hypothesize that this decrease in current strength between the Pliocene and the Pleistocene was a result of the northward migration of the SWW, in response to the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation, as has previously been proposed for DO events
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span> and interglacial-glacial transitions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given this hypothesis, it is not yet clear why the onset of drift deposition occurred near the mid-Pleistocene, rather than at the end of the Pliocene. We speculate that this may be related to a change in ACC intensity following the middle Pleistocene transition (~0.7–0.9 Ma), possibly due to increasing variability of sea-surface temperatures
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>, or possibly in the transition from ‘lukewarm’ to warm interglacials at 450 ka
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. However, the long-term trend is clear. The extended period of erosion and coarse-grained sediment deposition from the Oligocene to the Pliocene was due to the onset a prolonged high-energy of bottom currents in the region. The onset of fine-grained (mud) deposition in the Pleistocene was due to a marked slow-down in current speed, suggesting that the latitude and strength of the SWW was closely coupled to the climate state as the Earth entered ice-house conditions. Our data suggests that SWW were stronger and better aligned with the Drake Passage in the Oligocene-Pliocene, when atmospheric CO2 content and global temperatures were substantially higher, driving a faster-flowing ACC than at present, even at intermediate depths.
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is of fundamental importance to future models of ocean-atmosphere interactions in the southern hemisphere, as the SWW are currently moving southwards and intensifying in response to climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>, resulting in an increase in shear stress on surface waters. Our data suggests that this will result in a pronounced strengthening of ACC circulation at intermediate-to-deep depths, as well as of surface currents. The nature and strength of past circulation, therefore, is clearly an important key to predicting future patterns of circulation and their influence on climate. The link between climate state and current strength remains controversial, however, and requires more high-resolution data from contourite deposits around the Southern Ocean, including the SFSD. The results from ongoing scientific drilling expeditions around the Southern Ocean in the coming years, will be crucial to our further understanding of the feedbacks between atmospheric circulation, ocean circulation and climate in a warming world.
