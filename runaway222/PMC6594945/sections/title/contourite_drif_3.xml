 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SFSD is a plastered drift deposit that extends from ~500 m to 1500 m water depth, across an area of over 6600 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The base of the drift is marked by a ~60 m deep, SW-NE trending erosional moat at 1600 m (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2A</a>) separating it from the ~2000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> LFSD. The base of the LFSD is indistinct due to incomplete seismic coverage, but likely extends to the Falkland Trough, where a thick Neogene sequence is present

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SFSD was penetrated by the Toroa#1 geotechnical borehole, which extended to the base of the drift at the well location (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2B</a>), with recovery rates of ~30% in the shallow 40 m and ~10% below that. This well penetrated a thick (175 m) sequence of Middle Pleistocene-Holocene mud, with minor silt layers, above a thin (10 m) clay-rich sand of indeterminate age (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2D</a>). A Middle Pleistocene age (MIS8; &lt;270 ka) for the mud is confirmed by the presence of 
  <span class="italic">E. huxleyi</span> coccolithophores down to the base of the drift, as well as a distinctive nannofossil assemblage
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span> (the complete nannofossil and foram assemblage is summarized in Appendix 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">A</a>). The basal sand sits on a pronounced erosional unconformity, overlying Upper Cretaceous (Campanian-Santonian) mudstone, based on the presence of the dinoflagellate 
  <span class="italic">Isabelidinium cretaceum</span> and other microfossils
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. This mid-Pleistocene age is significantly younger than previous published estimates for the SFSD, which inferred an Early Miocene onset of drift deposition, and a series of intra-drift unconformities of Miocene to Pliocene age
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Our results show that onset of drift deposition was much more recent than any published age for the onset of ACC circulation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, and that the intra-drift unconformities must represent fluctuations in current strength on glacial-interglacial, or shorter, timescales.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The LFSD has not been penetrated by any geotechnical boreholes, thus its age remains uncertain. A number of prominent intra-drift unconformities are present (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2A</a>, inset), which could be tentatively correlated to the unconformities in the SFSD (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2B</a>), but this remains speculative.
