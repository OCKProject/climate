 <p>We are grateful to the Rockhopper Exploration for providing us with 3D seismic data and well data for this research, and for permission to publish the data, as well as to the Falkland Island Government, for providing access to, and permission to publish, 2D seismic data and geotechnical borehole data. Seismic data were originally acquired by PGS and Wavefield and geotechnical boreholes were acquired and analysed by BHP. Thanks also to David Van Rooij, Robert Larter, Dan Arnold and one anonymous reviewer for constructive reviews of the first version of this manuscript.</p>
