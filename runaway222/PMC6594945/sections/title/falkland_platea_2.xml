 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The south-western slope is characterized by two extensive sediment drifts, with characteristic convex-up morphologies, separated by a slope-parallel erosional moat at around 1600–1700 m water depth (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2A</a>). This moat separates the SFSD from another drift deposit, which we herein refer to as the Lower Falkland Slope Drift (LFSD). Both of these drifts sit above a prominent erosional unconformity (the base drift unconformity). Truncation of underlying seismic reflectors below the unconformity (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2B</a>) indicates that there may be more than 100 ms of missing sequence in this location.
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Along slope to the north-east, the slope flattens out into a broad terrace at water depths of ~1200–1800 m, which we refer to as the Falkland Terrace (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2C</a>). The terrace forms part of a broader area of slope erosion, with evidence for along-slope erosion occurring up to water depths of 800 m, and locally even as shallow as 500 m (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). There are a number of prominent moats evident in the seismic data, the shallowest of which is situated at around 800–950 m water depth (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2C</a>), as well as other indications of sea-floor scouring along the main Falkland Terrace. In some locations, there are also depositional features, including minor drifts, some of which are associated with moats and other erosional features (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2C</a>, inset). These coincide with areas of higher seabed amplitudes, with the larger acoustic impedance contrast indicating a distinct change in lithology at the seabed.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A prominent feature of the shallow subsurface across the Falkland Plateau is a ‘hard’ (increase in acoustic impedance) reflector, which is situated between 150–700 ms below the seabed, and which cross cuts stratigraphy (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2A,C</a>). The discordant nature and seismic polarity of the reflection is consistent with an Opal A-CT transition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. This transition is one of a group of ‘bottom simulating reflectors’ (BSRs), and represents the diagenetic transformation of silica from a non-crystalline to a disordered crystalline form
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. The primary control on this reaction is temperature, with other factors such as lithology, pore-fluid chemistry and time having a lesser influence
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. The Opal A-CT transition is a non-reversible diagenetic process, with Opal remaining in a crystalline form even when temperature and pressure are reduced, thus it acts as a palaeothermometer, recording the maximum temperature experienced by the sediments.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Opal A-CT transition in the south-western Falkland Plateau is situated at a maximum of around 700 ms TWT below the seabed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2A</a>), which is equivalent to around 560 m based on Loligo-1 velocity data (~1600 m/s). Using a geothermal gradient of 38.5 °C/km and a seabed temperature of 2 °C from Loligo-1, this is equivalent to a temperature of ~22 °C. This is at the lower bound (~20 °C) of temperatures derived from wells associated with clear geophysical expressions of Opal A-CT transitions elsewhere, most of which exceed 35–40 °C
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. Opal A-CT transitions at significantly greater depths, with temperature greatly exceeding this value have also been reported in some instances, where the vertical (upward) migration of the diagenetic front has been arrested, or fossilized, for reasons that remain poorly understood
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. However, empirical observations of shallower and lower temperature (~16–20 °C) transitions are rare
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>, and are only found in association with large-scale slide scars representing widespread seabed erosion
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the Falkland Terrace, however, the Opal A-CT transition is significantly shallower than in the south-western Falkland Plateau region, typically around 250 ms (~200 m) and as little as 150 ms (~120 m) below the seabed, representing temperatures of ~10 and ~6 °C respectively. These temperatures are significantly lower than any experimental or empirical observations for the onset of the Opal A-CT transformation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. These anomalously low present-day temperatures suggest that subsurface temperatures are, or were in the past, higher in this area. In the case of the Falkland Terrace, assuming that there are no significant lateral changes in geothermal gradient, we interpret the anomalously shallow Opal A-CT transition to be a result of widespread seafloor erosion (~300 m, locally exceeding 400 m) across the Falkland Terrace region since the Opal A-CT transition initially formed. This area of maximum erosion is directly associated with the core of the SAF, suggesting that elevated bottom current velocities associated with the front are, or have been, strong enough to erode, entrain and transport substantial quantities of sediment.
