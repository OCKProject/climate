 <div class="title">Emissions in the absence of behavioural change.</div>
 <p>In the socio-climate model, the factor 
  <span class="italic">ϵ</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) corresponds to the global CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions should there be no change in human behaviour. Preceding 2014, 
  <span class="italic">ϵ</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) takes the historical emission trajectory (solid line) as human behaviour is not modelled here. Post 2014, 
  <span class="italic">ϵ</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) follows a saturating function (dashed line) to capture the saturation of global population size and energy needs. Details of this functional form can be found in the Methods section.
