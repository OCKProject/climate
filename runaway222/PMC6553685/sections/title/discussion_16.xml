 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study has shown how social processes can influence climate dynamics, according to one possible way of modelling social dynamics and norms. However, other frameworks for modelling human behaviour could yield different predictions. For instance, the socio-climate model of Ref. [
  <a rid="pcbi.1007000.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1007000.ref021">21</a>] does not include social learning. Individuals respond directly to changes in the climate, and not through interactions with one another. As a consequence, the rate at which individuals adopt mitigative strategies only varies with the current climate situation, and not with current population consensus. Mitigation efforts can therefore be expected to closely follow the severity of climate change in the model. In our model, social learning manifests as a feedback within the social system, resulting in qualitatively different socio-climate trajectories. Mitigative behaviour is initially suppressed–even as temperatures rise to levels that should incentivise mitigation–due to low numbers of mitigating individuals and therefore little turnover of behaviour in the population. However, social learning creates a positive feedback loop once there is a net positive utility to mitigate, and so as the numbers of mitigators increases, so too does the rate at which non-mitigators switch to being mitigators. This results in a sharp non-linear increase in mitigators, as a combined outcome of both the social and the climate system dynamics. We note that, all else being equal, adding social learning to a model has the effect of slowing down behaviour change in the human population (since a process takes time, by definition), and therefore the mitigation response of human populations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conversely, the case of very rapid social learning recovers a ‘best response’ model similar to those assumed in classical economics, where individuals immediately adopt the highest payoff strategy without learning the behaviour from others. Whether or not this assumption can approximate behaviour in real human populations hinges upon how fast social learning occurs—individuals would need to sample others rapidly enough to enable complete population behaviour change within 5 years for this approximation to work in our model, which seems implausible (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a different vein, we assumed a homogeneous population with respect to mixing and individual utilities. The model’s social dynamics capture interactions at the individual level, though there are many different scales of social organisation that the model does not consider, from families/neighbourhoods to cities/states and up to interacting countries. Future models could include this more hierarchical social structure. Similarly, these models could include different types of individual with correspondingly different utilities. For instance, the model could include industrial corporations with utilities biased toward shareholder profit, and social institutions (such as laws, taxes, the education system) that reflect the current governmental stance. Social learning may also take on different forms due to diverse individual psychologies and values [
  <a rid="pcbi.1007000.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1007000.ref039">39</a>–
  <a rid="pcbi.1007000.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1007000.ref041">41</a>]. Such heterogeneities are known to affect the dynamics of a wide variety of systems [
  <a rid="pcbi.1007000.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1007000.ref042">42</a>] and can prevent population consensus by permitting development of echo chambers [
  <a rid="pcbi.1007000.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1007000.ref043">43</a>]. Our model also makes the simplifying assumption that individuals base their temperature projection on linear extrapolation of past temperatures. This could be generalised to a non-linear extrapolation to reflect an individual’s perception of ‘accelerating’ change. Extending socio-climate models to include these finer details should prove valuable in further investigations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is a manifestation of coupled human-environment dynamics and therefore we should start coupling climate models to social models [
  <a rid="pcbi.1007000.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1007000.ref005">5</a>, 
  <a rid="pcbi.1007000.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1007000.ref044">44</a>]. Our simple coupled socio-climate model shows that the rate at which individuals learn socially strongly influences the peak global temperature anomaly, to the point that variation of this parameter within plausible ranges changes the peak temperature anomaly by more than 1°C. Therefore, it matters whether social processes cause slow or fast uptake of climate change mitigation measures. We found that social norms may not provide help when we most need it, although this finding could be nuanced by adding social heterogeneity. Finally, we illustrated how exploring the parameter space of socio-climate models suggests optimal paths for mitigating climate change. A more sophisticated policy impact assessment model based on a coupled socio-climate approach could therefore be useful to decision-makers facing a mandate to reduce GHG emissions with a fixed budget. In summary, it is essential for climate change research to account for dynamic social processes in order to generate accurate predictions of future climate trends, and the paradigm of coupled socio-climate modelling could help us address this challenge.
