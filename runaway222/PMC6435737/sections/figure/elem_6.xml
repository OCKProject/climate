  <p>Annual CO
   <sub>2</sub> reductions by policy in the policy package scenario relative to the BAU reference case scenario. R&amp;D refers to research and development. LDV refers to light-duty vehicle and HDV refers to heavy-duty vehicle. The various colorful segments show how much each policy can reduce CO
   <sub>2</sub> emission. The results show that no single policy results in the achievement of Chinaâ€™s CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions peak by 2026. The top five most effective policies before 2030 are power sector reform, industrial transformation, industrial efficiency, ETS, and LDV efficiency
