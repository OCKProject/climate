  <p>Total CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions in China under different scenarios. The results of the policy package scenario show Chinaâ€™s CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions from energy combustion, industrial processes, and land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) peak twice, which is different from previous predictions. The first peak is a temporary, small peak in 2019 at the level of 10.7 billion tons. There is a subsequent permanent peak in 2026 at the level of 11.8 billion tons, well ahead of the 2030 target. After 2026, a long-lasting plateau ensues until 2040 rather than a decisive post-peak drop in emissions. Meanwhile, the CO
   <sub>2</sub> emission comparisons between the scenarios of our model and the scenarios of the other models

   <sub>2</sub> emission level of our reference case scenario is between that of MIT-Tsinghua (No policy) and Reinventing Fire (Reference scenario). The CO
   <sub>2</sub> emission level of our policy package scenario is higher than the levels of MIT-Tsinghua (Continued effort) and IEA (Current policy) as we include more climate change policies, but higher than the levels of the Peak CO
   <sub>2</sub> scenario of Reinventing Fire, MIT-Tsinghua (Accelerated effort) and IEA (450 scenario) where new policies beyond current policy package are added
