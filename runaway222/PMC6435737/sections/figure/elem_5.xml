  <p>Primary energy use by fuel type in the policy package scenario. Bright colors show the share of primary energy use in China from non-fossil fuels, including biomass (light green), nuclear (dark purple), hydro (orange), wind (blue), solar (yellow), geothermal (purple), biofuel diesel (dark blue), and biofuel gasoline (dark green). The total share of non-fossil fuels in Chinaâ€™s primary energy consumption gradually increases and will reach to 19.86% by 2030. China will, therefore, nearly meet its commitment of 20% of primary energy consumption from non-fossil fuels by 2030</p>
