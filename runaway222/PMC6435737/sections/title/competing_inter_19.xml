 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is potential concern of non-financial interests since the fifth author is affiliated with the official Chinese government think tank on climate change. But this concern should not be overestimated as the research design was developed by an independent research institute and substantial modification to the initial version of the system dynamics model was made, to which the fifth author contributed. The Authors declare no further competing interests.</p>
