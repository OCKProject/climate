  </span>. The direct output from 15 CMIP5 GCMs is used here to examine CH values, selected based on availability of 6-hourly data archived on Australia’s national repository of CMIP5 data. The GCMs are ACCESS1-0, ACCESS1-3, BCC-CSM1–1, BCC-CSM1–1-M, BNU-ESM, CCSM4, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, FGOALS-G2, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, MIROC5, MRI-CGCM3 and NorESM1-M. These 15 GCMs were also used to examine FFDI values, with the four weather variables used for the FFDI calculation (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and rainfall) first being calibrated using quantile matching to be more consistent with the input variables used for the observations-based FFDI data set
