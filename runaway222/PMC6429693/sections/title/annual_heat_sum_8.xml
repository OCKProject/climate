 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual heat sum threshold (PDD) is the number of degree-days of thermal accumulation above DV0 required by a given species to complete one generation (
  <a rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0040">Kriticos et al. 2015</a>). In its northernmost range limits, some portions of a given population may take up to 2-yr to complete a single generation (

  <a rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0068">Vittum et al. 1999</a>). Therefore, the PDD represents the minimum heat sum required each year to complete the 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> life cycle (egg to egg). With a base and upper developmental threshold of 10 and 34°C, 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> requires 524°C degree-days from January first before adult beetles begin to emerge (

  <a rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0043">Magarey et al. 2015</a>). A threshold PDD of 525°C degree-days above DV0 (10°C) just allowed the persistence of the species at the limits of its distribution on the Kuril region’s Kunashir island.

  <a rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0055">Régnière et al. (1981a)</a> estimated that degree-day requirements for 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> 1,422°C degree-days above 10°C for complete development (egg to egg). Therefore, areas that accumulated a minimum of 1,422°C degree-days were defined as areas where annual life cycles occur. Areas that accumulated less than the 1,422°C degree-day developmental threshold were defined as areas where biannual life cycles may occur. It is important to note that the degree-day accumulations calculated by CLIMEX are based on the mean annual accumulated degree-days calculated over multiyear climatological data sets. For instance, in its invaded range in the Northeastern United States, 2-yr life cycles occur sporadically in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (

  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span>’s native range, Hokkaido, Japan, larvae normally exhibit a 2-yr life cycle, but a 1-yr life cycle may occur in years with above average temperatures (
