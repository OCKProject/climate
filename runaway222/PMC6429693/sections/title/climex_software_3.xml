It utilizes an ecophysiological growth model that enables users to explore the effects of climate on the distribution and phenology of poikilothermic organisms. CLIMEX is a model of moderate complexity that combines the strengths of correlative modeling methods (fitting stress parameters based on geographical occurrence data) and deductive modeling methods (utilizing laboratory studies and phenological observations for growth function fitting;

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The key assumption behind CLIMEX is that climate is the primary determinant of the geographical distribution of a species. It uses weekly growth and stress-related indices to evaluate the potential for species to persist and grow at a given location for which relevant climatic data are available. The final output of CLIMEX is an overall annual index climatic suitability, the Ecoclimatic Index (EI), which describes the climatic suitability of a given location for the persistence of the species under investigation. The EI is scaled from 0 (unsuitable) to 100 (climatically perfect all year round), and theoretically, species can establish if EI &gt; 0. In practice, EI values of 100 are rarely achieved and only then in locations with high climatic stability, such as equatorial environments. In CLIMEX, the annual growth index (GI
  <sub>A</sub>) describes the potential for population growth during favorable climatic conditions and is determined from a given species’ specific temperature (TI) and moisture (MI) growth preferences. The four primary stress indices (Cold, Heat, Dry, Wet) describe the probability of a given population surviving under unfavorable conditions and often limit the potential growth of a population in a given location. These stress indices are useful for determining a target species’ geographic range limits.
