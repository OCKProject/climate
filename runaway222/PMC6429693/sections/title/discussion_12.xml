 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of this model’s projections for the potential global 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> distribution under current climatic conditions, the results are mostly consistent with previous climate niche modeling work done on this widespread pest (
  <a rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0001">Allsopp 1996</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0069">Zhang et al. 2002</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0070">Zhu et al. 2017</a>). Extreme cold winter temperatures limit 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> distribution in northern latitudes, whereas prevailing warm and wet conditions restrict its potential range in the humid tropical southern latitudes. These findings are not surprising given 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span>’s specific temperature and soil moisture requirements for development and oviposition (
  <a rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0041">Ludwig 1928</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0020">Fleming 1972</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">Allsopp et al. 1992</a>). Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, rising winter temperatures reduce cold stress in the Northern Hemisphere, converting previously unsuitable areas into new climatically suitable ranges. Therefore, it is plausible that 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> will expand its current Canadian range further northward and invade additional countries across northern Europe in the coming decades. In addition, warmer midcentury temperatures enhance 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> population growth potential across its current northern North America range, which in turn could increase the frequency and severity of 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> outbreaks particularly in Southern Ontario, New England, and the Midwest (
  <a rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0046">Niziolek et al. 2013</a>). In contrast, increasingly hot and dry conditions projected under the RCP 8.5 reduce previously suitable range in the southeastern United States, southeastern Asia, and all continents in the Southern Hemisphere by midcentury. Given that the southeastern United States is expected to become increasingly warm and dry under climate change (
  <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">Carter et al. 2014</a>) and that recent 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> declines in Arkansas have been linked to rising temperatures (
  <a rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0049">Petty et al. 2015</a>), it is plausible that this beetle will soon become a minor pest within its current southeastern U.S. range.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CLIMEX model for 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> indicates the possibility of substantial range expansion and infill across Europe under both current climatic conditions and midcentury projections under the RCP 8.5. Spain, France, Romania, Ireland, and the United Kingdom are especially at risk for 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> invasion due to a combination of favorable climate and large expanses of pasture lands (
  <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">EPPO 2016</a>). To date, 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span>’s presence in mainland Europe is still limited to the Ticino Valley of Italy (
  <a rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0016">EPPO 2018</a>). Recent detections of 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> in Switzerland (
  <a rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0015">EPPO 2017</a>) and Germany (
  <a rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0066">Urban 2018</a>) suggest that this pest will probably spread and eventually establish elsewhere in Europe. Regardless, European biosecurity managers still have time to prevent or, at the very least, slow the spread of this pest across mainland Europe. Coordinated early detection and eradication efforts will help prevent further spread of this invasive pest throughout Europe. Traps with a combined pheromone and floral attractant lure have proven very effective in detecting isolated infestations in the western United States (
  <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">ODA 2017</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">CDFA 2018</a>) and are strongly recommended in high-risk sites throughout central Europe (
  <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">EPPO 2016</a>). Increasing public awareness among the horticultural industry as well as agencies and stakeholders working in high-risk areas (e.g., parks, nurseries, golf courses, and entry and exit points) is warranted.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Southern Hemisphere, New Zealand is especially vulnerable to 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> invasion given that the already large portion of climatically suitable range under current conditions expands under both GCMs by 2050. In addition, New Zealand’s vast expanses of pastureland would provide ideal habitat for oviposition and subsequent larval development (
  <a rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0059">Stats NZ 2018</a>). Large portions of southern and eastern South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and the eastern coast of Australia are also at risk for 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> establishment now and under possible midcentury future climates in spite of some notable range contractions. Biosecurity authorities in high-risk Southern Hemisphere jurisdictions may want to consider enhancing quarantine and monitoring efforts at national or subnational administrative entry and exit points (e.g., airports, ferry docks, railway stations).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nonclimatic factors, which are not included in CLIMEX, also affect insect pest distribution and abundance such as natural enemies, topography, human activity, and host plant distribution. In the case of 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span>, the presence of appropriately moist landscapes needed for successful larval development can be augmented by human-made pasture lands and urban turfgrass, thereby enabling this insect to establish in areas often deemed too dry by CLIMEX. 
  <a rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0070">Zhu et al. (2017)</a> found that the inclusion of anthropogenic landscape factors improved their Maxent model performance in areas of high human activity. Therefore, the CLIMEX model’s projections should be approached with some caution, especially in normally dry landscapes altered by human activity as 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> readily invades irrigated parks, golf courses, and pasture lands (
  <a rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0065">USDA 2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As with previous climate-based modeling approaches (
  <a rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0001">Allsopp 1996</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0069">Zhang et al. 2002</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0070">Zhu et al. 2017</a>), these results indicate large portions of unfilled climatically suitable space in eastern Asia, particularly in eastern central China and the Korean peninsula. To date, no 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> specimens have ever been recovered from mainland Asia (
  <a rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0021">Fleming 1976</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0054">Reed et al. 1991</a>) where abundant natural enemies probably hinder 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> establishment (
  <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">Clausen et al. 1927</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">Fleming 1968</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0010">Chen et al. 2006</a>). Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, large portions of northeastern Asia will become climatically suitable for 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> by 2050 as projected increases in winter temperatures break down previous cold barriers to 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> survival in these regions. It is plausible that 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> may be able to successfully establish in mainland Asia if the pest is inadvertently transported to these newly climatically favorable habitats outside the distribution of their natural enemies (
  <a rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0024">Furlong and Zalucki 2017</a>). Furthermore, the biological control efficacy of natural enemies against 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> in its native and invaded ranges may decrease if climate change leads to a phenological mismatch between this pest and its enemies. There is compelling evidence that an increasingly variable and warmer climate will disrupt the 
  <span class="italic">phenological</span> synchrony between parasitoids and their insect hosts (
  <a rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0061">Stireman et al. 2005</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">Grabenweger et al. 2007</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0017">Evans et al. 2013</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Tiphia vernlais</span> (Rohwer 1924) (Hymenoptera: Tiphiidae) and 
  <span class="italic">Tiphia popilliavora</span> (Rohwer 1924) (Hymenoptera: Tiphiidae) are parasitoids that attack 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> larvae and can provide moderate levels of control in both 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span>’s native range as well as areas in the United States where they been deliberately released (
  <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">Fleming 1968</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0010">Chen et al. 2006</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0053">Ramoutar and Legrand 2007</a>). Future studies examining 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span>’s associated parasitoids’ responses to changing climatic conditions are warranted to better predict possible effects of climate change on the biological control of this pest.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simulated occurrence of biannual life cycles is concordant with those reported in the literature and similar 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> degree-day model projections conducted by 
  <a rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0037">Korycinska and Baker (2017)</a>. Field surveys conducted in these regions found that biannual life cycles occur sporadically in the northeastern United States and southern Ontario, Canada (
  <a rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0020">Fleming 1972</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0067">Vittum 1986</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0068">Vittum et al. 1999</a>), whereas in the northern most portion of its native range, Hokkaido, Japan, beetles regularly undergo biannual life cycles (
  <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">Clausen et al. 1927</a>). Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, these lower outbreak risk regions are projected to switch from a 2-yr life cycle to a 1-yr life cycle by 2050, indicating 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> outbreaks may occur more frequently on a year-to-year basis. In the context of this study, projected changes in 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> voltinism were consistent with previous work examining the effects of climate change on biannual insect life cycles. For instance, longer and warmer growing seasons are expected to enable several species, including North American spruce beetles, to complete their life cycle in a single year in areas where previously a generation took at least two (
  <a rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0003">Bentz et al. 2010</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">Everall et al. 2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study highlights some areas under threat of invasion by 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> under current and possible future climates. It also reveals that ongoing plant health risks posed by 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> in certain northern portions of its current known range may become more severe in light of climate change. The differences in the outcomes between the two GCMs emphasize the uncertainties associated with current climate change modeling (
  <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">Harris et al. 2014</a>). Therefore, the possible future climates presented here should be considered indications of the potential changes in suitable geographical range and voltinism of 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> in response to climate change. To prevent the introduction and spread of 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span>, enhanced public awareness about the threat it poses along with adequate quarantine and monitoring efforts should be implemented in areas under high invasion risk from this pest under both current and possible future climates.
