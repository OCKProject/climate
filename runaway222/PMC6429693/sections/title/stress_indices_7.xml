 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Larval winter kill can be substantial, particularly when unusually cold weather occurs without an insulating layer of snow (
  <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">Fox 1935</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0023">1939</a>; 
  <a rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0020">Fleming 1972</a>). In Japan, overwintering larvae exhibit a supercooling point of −7°C (
  <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">Hoshikawa et al. 1988</a>), while 
  <a rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0023">Fox (1939)</a> observed near 100% larval mortality at soil temperatures below −9.4°C in New Jersey. In the northern limits of its North American range, soil temperature rarely falls below 0°C because snow acts an insulating blanket over the winter months (
  <a rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0020">Fleming 1972</a>). For instance, snow cover keeps soil temperatures in New Jersey near 0°C, even when air temperature falls around −15°C (
  <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">Fox 1935</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0030">Hawley and Dobbins 1941</a>). A threshold temperature cold stress of −15°C (TTCS) and a stress accumulation of −0.007 wk
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (THCS) allowed the northern most records to barely persist.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hot–wet stress is probably limiting the potential for 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> to establish in wet tropical regions (
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). A combination of a threshold temperature (TTHW) of 27°C and a threshold soil moisture index of (MTHW) of 1.4, and a stress accumulation (PHW) of 0.01 wk
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, reduced the potential range of 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> in tropical and subtropical portions of the Southern Hemisphere where the species has not established, but includes the maritime subtropical Azores Islands where the species is widespread.
