  <a rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0042">1930</a>) observed that eggs did not hatch at temperatures below 13°C. Adult beetles lay their eggs in July and August. These eggs hatch within ~2 wk, and most larvae will reach the cold tolerant third-instar life stage before the onset of winter (
  <a rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0020">Fleming 1972</a>). Consequently, cold intolerant eggs and early instar grubs are probably not exposed to winter temperatures below their developmental threshold. As such, a value of 10°C was set as the minimum temperature for development (DV0), which is consistent with the lower developmental threshold for 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> third-instar grubs and pupae (
  <a rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0055">Régnière et al. 1981a</a>). The optimal development temperature is 30°C for eggs, 27.5°C for larvae (first to third instars), and between 30 and 32°C for pupae (
  <a rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0041">Ludwig 1928</a>). Therefore, the lower (DV1) and upper (DV2) optimal temperatures were set at 27.5 and 31°C, respectively. The maximum temperature threshold is 35°C for pupae, 34°C for eggs and third instars, and 31°C for first and second instars (

  <a rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0055">Régnière et al. 1981a</a>). Adult beetles will stop feeding and seek shelter at a temperature above 35°C. (
  <a rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0020">Fleming 1972</a>). Given that larvae should be able to escape extreme soil temperatures by vertical soil movement while eggs cannot (

  <a rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0033">Kaya 1990</a>), the upper temperature threshold (DV3) was set as 34°C. Taken together, these values provided a good fit to the observed global distribution and enable persistence in southern limits of 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span>’s North American range where summer soil temperatures up to 10 cm below the turf often reach above 31°C (

  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span>. Adult females preferentially oviposit in moist areas as long as the soil is not waterlogged since egg survival declines in oversaturated soils (

  <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">Allsopp et al. 1992</a>). Experimental results showed that adult beetle oviposition preference decreased significantly when soil moisture was below 20% (
  <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">Allsopp et al. 1992</a>). The immature stages are well adapted to moderate to high soil moisture levels and are vulnerable to desiccation (

  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). In the absence of turf or pastoral grasslands, it is reasonable to assume that
