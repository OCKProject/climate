 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> model was fitted using a 1981–2010 global climatological data set (D. J. Kriticos, personal communication). This data set represents the baseline climate and consists of monthly long-term averages for daily minimum and maximum temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), and rainfall totals (mm; 
  <a rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0039">Kriticos et al. 2012</a>). The averages are centered on the year 1995. Two global climate models (GCMs), ACCESS1-0 (CAWCR-CSIRO, Australia) and CNRM-CM5 (CNRM-CERFACS, France) with the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 emission scenario for the year 2050 were used in this study to represent possible future climates (
  <a rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0044">Moss et al. 2010</a>). The two GCMs represent different climate sensitivities, defined as the amount of global warming for a doubling CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration by midcentury compared with 1990s levels. Predictions of long-term climate change are highly variable, so only midcentury climate projections (2040–2059 centered on 2050) were assessed in the content of this study. Currently, global greenhouse emissions are tracking the highest representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5) used by the IPCC to assess projected climate change (
  <a rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0057">Sanford et al. 2014</a>). The RCP 8.5 represents the ‘worst case’ scenario in which current trends in greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated and predicts the greatest increases in global mean temperatures ranging from 1.3 to 2.0°C by 2050. 
  <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">Harris et al. (2014)</a> provide detailed explanations of GCM and emission scenario selection in terms of ecological niche modeling. All gridded global climate data sets used in the CLIMEX modeling had a spatial resolution of 30 arc minutes (0.5° × 0.5°; D. J. Kriticos, personal communication).
