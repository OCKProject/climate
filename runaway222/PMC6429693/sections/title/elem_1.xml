  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The key assumption behind CLIMEX is that climate is the primary determinant of the geographical distribution of a species. It uses weekly growth and stress-related indices to evaluate the potential for species to persist and grow at a given location for which relevant climatic data are available. The final output of CLIMEX is an overall annual index climatic suitability, the Ecoclimatic Index (EI), which describes the climatic suitability of a given location for the persistence of the species under investigation. The EI is scaled from 0 (unsuitable) to 100 (climatically perfect all year round), and theoretically, species can establish if EI &gt; 0. In practice, EI values of 100 are rarely achieved and only then in locations with high climatic stability, such as equatorial environments. In CLIMEX, the annual growth index (GI
   <sub>A</sub>) describes the potential for population growth during favorable climatic conditions and is determined from a given species’ specific temperature (TI) and moisture (MI) growth preferences. The four primary stress indices (Cold, Heat, Dry, Wet) describe the probability of a given population surviving under unfavorable conditions and often limit the potential growth of a population in a given location. These stress indices are useful for determining a target species’ geographic range limits.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
   <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> model was fitted using a 1981–2010 global climatological data set (D. J. Kriticos, personal communication). This data set represents the baseline climate and consists of monthly long-term averages for daily minimum and maximum temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), and rainfall totals (mm; 
   <a rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0039">Kriticos et al. 2012</a>). The averages are centered on the year 1995. Two global climate models (GCMs), ACCESS1-0 (CAWCR-CSIRO, Australia) and CNRM-CM5 (CNRM-CERFACS, France) with the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 emission scenario for the year 2050 were used in this study to represent possible future climates (
   <a rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0044">Moss et al. 2010</a>). The two GCMs represent different climate sensitivities, defined as the amount of global warming for a doubling CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration by midcentury compared with 1990s levels. Predictions of long-term climate change are highly variable, so only midcentury climate projections (2040–2059 centered on 2050) were assessed in the content of this study. Currently, global greenhouse emissions are tracking the highest representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5) used by the IPCC to assess projected climate change (
   <a rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0057">Sanford et al. 2014</a>). The RCP 8.5 represents the ‘worst case’ scenario in which current trends in greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated and predicts the greatest increases in global mean temperatures ranging from 1.3 to 2.0°C by 2050.

   <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> life cycle (egg to egg). With a base and upper developmental threshold of 10 and 34°C, 
   <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> requires 524°C degree-days from January first before adult beetles begin to emerge (

   <a rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0055">Régnière et al. (1981a)</a> estimated that degree-day requirements for 
   <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> 1,422°C degree-days above 10°C for complete development (egg to egg). Therefore, areas that accumulated a minimum of 1,422°C degree-days were defined as areas where annual life cycles occur. Areas that accumulated less than the 1,422°C degree-day developmental threshold were defined as areas where biannual life cycles may occur. It is important to note that the degree-day accumulations calculated by CLIMEX are based on the mean annual accumulated degree-days calculated over multiyear climatological data sets. For instance, in its invaded range in the Northeastern United States, 2-yr life cycles occur sporadically in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (

   <span class="italic">P. japonica</span>’s native range, Hokkaido, Japan, larvae normally exhibit a 2-yr life cycle, but a 1-yr life cycle may occur in years with above average temperatures (
