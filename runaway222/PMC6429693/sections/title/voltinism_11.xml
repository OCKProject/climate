  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> (1,422°C degree-days above 10°C for a 1-yr life cycle) under current climate (1995) are fairly consistent with observed annual and biannual life cycles across its known global geographic range (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Figs. 5A</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6A</a>). Model outputs show annual life cycles across the recently invaded Piedmont and Lombardy regions of northern Italy, which is consistent with observed 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> phenology in Italy (
  <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">EPPO 2016</a>). However, model outputs also indicate that much of central and northern Europe will exhibit biannual year life cycles under current climatic conditions (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the climate change scenario explored, changes in projected 
  <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> voltinism varied across regions, within regions, and between GCMs (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>). In Canada, new suitable range mostly fell in cold regions where minimum growing degree-day requirements for consistent annual life cycles could not be met. However, suitable range in southern Ontario under current climatic conditions shifted from biannual to annual life cycles under both GCMS (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>). In its northern U.S. range limits, many areas exhibiting biannual life cycles under current climatic conditions switched to annual life cycles by 2050 with few differences between GCMS (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>). In Europe, the simulated number of cumulative growing degree-days increase and the proportion of areas exhibiting annual life cycles subsequently rise under both GCMs, but more so under the ACCESS1-0 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5B</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">C</a>). In Japan, projected gains in cumulative growing degree-days increase the portion of the areas capable of supporting an annual life cycle by 10.6% under the CNRM-CM5 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6B</a>) and 19.4% under the ACCESS1-0 models (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6C</a>), respectively. Current climatic conditions and the CNRM-CM5 model projections for 2050 on Honshu Island indicate the co-occurrence of both annual and biannual life cycles (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6A</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">B</a>), whereas the ACCESS1-0 model suggests that all of Honshu Island would exhibit an annual life cycle by 2050 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6C</a>). Likewise, the western coastline of the island of Hokkaido would switch from a biannual to an annual life cycle by 2050 under the ACCESS1-0 model (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6C</a>).
