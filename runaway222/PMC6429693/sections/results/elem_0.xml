  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, modeled potential distribution of 
   <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> under current climate agrees well with the known distribution of this species in both its native and invaded ranges (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>). In general, areas of the world that are climatically suitable for 
   <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> invasion (i.e., locations where the model gives EI ≥ 1) include eastern Asia, central Europe, large portions of southern and eastern South America, sub-Saharan Africa, the North Island of Zealand, and along the eastern coast of Australia (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>, 
   <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>). In the equatorial tropics, consistent excessive hot–wet stress prevents population growth. In its non-native North American range, areas of highest modeled climatic suitability accord strongly with the highest densities of occurrence records in the eastern and Midwestern United States (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>). There is also potential for further spread along the western coastline and infill in the north central states. Discordant records in New Mexico, Colorado, Idaho, Texas, Arizona, and Nevada were found to be either isolated infestations associated with anthropogenic landscapes (e.g., parks, gulf courses, lawns), or single detections around airports (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figs. 1</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3A</a>). Over half of Europe is climatically suitable for 
   <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> (
   <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>), indicating a strong possibility of further spread and establishment across the continent (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On a global scale, the percentage of climatically suitable ranges for 
   <span class="italic">P. japonica</span> does not vary much between current climatic conditions and possible future climates for midcentury (
   <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>), but rather the positioning of suitable range tends to shift northward (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>). Under the RCP 8.5 emission scenario, notable range contractions occur in portions of eastern Asia and North America below the 40th Parallel North due to increased heat stress (HS) over the summer months (i.e., extended exposure to weekly maximum temperatures above an upper temperature threshold of 34°C; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">C</a>). In the southern United States, these range contractions are much more extensive under the ACESS1-0 model with a 29.09% reduction in climatically suitable U.S. range (EI ≥ 1) compared with the 3.13% reduction observed in the CNRM-CM5 model (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). Likewise, range expansions in Canada are more pronounced under the ACCESS1-0 model (
   <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>). In Canada, large portions of British Columbia, Saskatoon, and Manitoba became climatically suitable as growing degree-day requirements could now be met (
