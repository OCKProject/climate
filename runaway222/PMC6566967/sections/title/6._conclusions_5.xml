 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, the mathematical model of the detection range of the semi-active laser guidance system is established. The temperature characteristic of each node of the analog signal chain is measured and the main factors with dramatic changes are screened. The relationship between the

Compensation is applied to the system when the ambient temperature changes from−40 °C to 30°C.The ratio of the maximum variation of the detection range to the design point is 6.9% and 20.1% with compensation and without compensation, respectively. It can be concluded that this temperature compensation method can improve the detection range of semi-active laser guidance system in a wide temperature range. Furthermore, the ratio of the maximum variation of the detection range to the design point can be optimized to nearly zero when a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) is applied when the ambient temperature is higher than the design point. However, the cooling efficiency of TEC is relatively low and the typical cooling efficiency can reach 50%. It needs a large amount of energy from a power supply and a long time to cool the detector to 30 °C when the ambient temperature is 60 °C.
