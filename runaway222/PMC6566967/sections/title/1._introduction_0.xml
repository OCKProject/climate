 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current research directions for four-quadrant detectors are generally divided into two categories. One is to study the physical properties of a four-quadrant detector, which influence measurement accuracy. The physical properties of a four-quadrant detector include noise, crosstalk and dead zone. There are many achievements in this field. Zhang et al. studied the noise characteristics of four-quadrant detectors [
  <a rid="B6-sensors-19-02284" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-sensors-19-02284">6</a>]. Ma et al. analyzed the influence of crosstalk on the measurement accuracy of four-quadrant detectors [
  <a rid="B7-sensors-19-02284" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-sensors-19-02284">7</a>]. Zhang et al. analyzed the influence of dead zone on the position measurement accuracy of four-quadrant detectors [
  <a rid="B8-sensors-19-02284" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-sensors-19-02284">8</a>]. Gao et al. studied the influence of the different characteristics between the four channels of the four-quadrant detector and the post-processing circuit [
  <a rid="B9-sensors-19-02284" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-sensors-19-02284">9</a>]. Lee et al. studied the influence of spot size on position detection sensitivity [
  <a rid="B10-sensors-19-02284" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-sensors-19-02284">10</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The other research direction is to study the position detection algorithm of four-quadrant detectors. Hao et al. studied the layout of the four-quadrant detector and pointed out that a 45° tilting arrangement has a higher sensitivity than the conventional method when the spot is near the center of the detector [
  <a rid="B11-sensors-19-02284" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-sensors-19-02284">11</a>]. Lu et al. compared the effect of uniform distribution of energy density and Gaussian distribution of energy density on position detection accuracy [
  <a rid="B12-sensors-19-02284" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-sensors-19-02284">12</a>]. Li et al. proposed a new method to improve the position measurement accuracy for Laguerre-Gaussian beams on a QD [
  <a rid="B13-sensors-19-02284" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-sensors-19-02284">13</a>]. Chen et al. used a polynomial fitting method to solve the spot position on the QD [

  <a rid="B16-sensors-19-02284" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-sensors-19-02284">16</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the above studies were carried out under stable ambient temperature conditions, such as room temperature 25 °C. However, the ambient temperature of the four-quadrant PIN detector varies widely in the semi-active laser guidance system, between −40 °C to +60 °C. The parameters of the four-quadrant PIN detector and its signal processing chain can vary significantly within this temperature range. These parameters affect the maximum detection range in the semi-active laser guidance system directly. Therefore, it is necessary to measure and compensate the temperature characteristics of the four-quadrant PIN detector and its signal processing chain, so that the maximum detection range of the laser guidance system is kept within a reasonable and usable range over the entire ambient temperature range.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inspired by the above researchers, the contents of this paper are as follows. The second part of the paper sets up the mathematical model of the detection range in the semi-active laser guidance system and analyzes the main factors affecting the detection range. The third part sets up observation points in the analog signal chain, monitors each point within the range of temperature variation, and fits the observation data to obtain the temperature variation characteristics of each main parameter in the model. The fourth part picks out the parameters with significantly different temperature characteristics and performs temperature compensation. In the fifth part, the temperature stress is applied to the compensated system, and the maximum detection range of compensated system is compared to the system which is not compensated. The validity of the proposed compensation method is verified.</p>
