  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adjustments are calculated individually for each model and kernel (Figure

   <a rid="grl58185-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58185-fig-0001">1</a>. In previous work it has been shown that differences in kernel base climatology and radiative transfer are typically minimal (Soden et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0043">2008</a>), and differences are only significant where climate perturbations are larger than in this study (Jonko et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0023">2012</a>). In general, we find this to be true as interkernel agreement is good except for stratospheric temperature adjustment to 2xCO
   <sub>2</sub> forcing as discussed below. Interkernel agreement is also good for cloud adjustments, although cloud adjustments calculated using MMPRPs differ somewhat from the kernel‐derived methods. For 5xSul we only use cloud adjustments calculated from the MMPRP for Figure 
   <a rid="grl58185-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58185-fig-0001">1</a> except from the NCAR‐CESM1‐CAM4 model, which does not include cloud microphysical changes in its PDRMIP configuration. This is to isolate the component of the cloud lifetime effect (Albrecht, 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0001">1989</a>) from the cloud microphysical effect (Twomey,

   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0039">2008</a>). For most models and experiments the true IRF is not available as this requires a double radiation call. However, in some situations the shortwave (SW) or LW IRF is known to be 0. This occurs when either SW or LW absorption of a particular species is not present in a model's radiation code. In these cases, any difference between the ERF and the sum of all rapid adjustments is a residual by equation

In each of the three cases it can be seen that the residual term is small, being 6%, 12%, and 2% of the ERF for 10xBC LW, 3xCH
   <sub>4</sub> SW, and 2%Sol LW in magnitude, respectively. The larger multimodel residual in the 3xCH

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For 2xCO
   <sub>2</sub>, the adjustment due to stratospheric temperature change is strong and positive due to stratospheric cooling. The stratospheric cooling is the largest temperature response throughout the atmospheric column and is consistently present in all models. It is a remarkable coincidence that the stratospheric temperature adjustment for 2xCO
   <sub>2</sub> is the same size as the total adjustment, despite the nonnegligible contributions from other adjustments, which sum to 0. This can explain why stratospherically adjusted RF has for a long time been a useful metric for evaluating the energetic effects of CO
   <sub>2</sub> forcing. The larger error bar for the total adjustment reflects the assessment of Myhre et al. (
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0031">2013</a>) that ERF is expected to be similar to RF for CO
   <sub>2</sub> forcing with a larger uncertainty due to the inclusion of the tropospheric and surface adjustments.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is some disagreement between kernels for the stratospheric temperature adjustment for 2xCO
   <sub>2</sub>, for which the ECMWF‐ERA‐Interim/Oslo kernel projects a stronger adjustment in most models. The reason for this is that the ECMWF‐ERA‐Interim/Oslo kernel has a higher resolution in the stratosphere than the other kernels considered in this study. The ECMWF‐ERA‐Interim/Oslo kernel has 60 model levels with the highest at 0.1 hPa, whereas the other five kernels use the 17 standard pressure levels in CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0047">2012</a>) with 10 hPa being the highest. The difference is largest in models for which the output is also highly resolved in the stratosphere, such as CanESM2. This additional contribution to the stratospheric cooling accounts for about an additional +0.4 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> allocated to stratospheric adjustment in CanESM2 using the ECMWF‐ERA‐Interim/Oslo kernel compared to other kernels.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Black carbon shows a strong negative total adjustment (Stjern et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0044">2017</a>), for which the largest (absolute) negative contributions are tropospheric temperature and clouds. The largest positive adjustment in absolute terms is due to the change in water vapor, which opposes tropospheric temperature changes. The vertical profiles associated with BC forcing show a warming and wetting throughout the atmosphere coupled with a large reduction in cloud fraction, particularly at higher levels. Unlike for 2xCO
   <sub>2</sub>, the stratospheric temperature adjustment is negative rather than positive in 10xBC, due to a warming stratosphere (Hansen et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0020">1997</a>). The total adjustment is substantially different from the stratospheric temperature adjustment, so RF is not an appropriate measure of ERF for BC forcing. The strong negative adjustment to black carbon forcing indicates that the equilibrium global mean near‐surface temperature response to a black carbon forcing is smaller than indicated by its direct effect. Unlike CO
   <sub>2</sub>, BC (and sulfate) mass mixing ratios are spatially variable, and rapid adjustments depend on the location of the aerosol perturbation (Samset &amp; Myhre, 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0036">2015</a>). An increase in solar forcing is not distributed equally either, as more solar radiation is received in the tropics, and this zonal asymmetry can drive different circulation responses compared to CO
   <sub>2</sub> (Guo et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0019">2018</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 2%Sol experiment, the tropospheric temperature adjustment (partially offset by water vapor) also dominates over the stratospheric temperature adjustment. Net cloud adjustments are negative rather than positive for 2%Sol as seen by the change in vertical cloud fraction profile but are smaller in magnitude relative to the IRF than for 10xBC. Again, the rapid adjustment due to stratospheric temperature change does not equal the total adjustment.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The stratospheric temperature adjustment in 3xCH
   <sub>4</sub> shows a much smaller level of change than 2xCO
   <sub>2</sub>, as stratospheric temperature changes are much less pronounced. The small stratospheric temperature adjustment could be due to competition between radiative absorption and emission processes in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS; Zhong et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0057">1993</a>), unlike for CO
   <sub>2</sub> in which emission from the upper troposphere dominates due to its relatively higher abundance in the atmosphere (Forster et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0015">1997</a>; Stocker et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0045">2001</a>). Therefore, for 3xCH
   <sub>4</sub>, more of the LW emission from the warming troposphere passes through the stratosphere and reaches the TOA. However, overlap with water vapor bands for CH
   <sub>4</sub> is also important. The subset of models with an explicit treatment of SW absorption by methane (CanESM2, MIROC‐SPRINTARS, MPI‐ESM, and NCAR‐CESM1‐CAM5) exhibits a UTLS warming and a negative stratospheric temperature adjustment to methane forcing; the opposite is true for those that do not (Figures 
   <a rid="grl58185-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58185-supitem-0001">S5</a>b and 
   <a rid="grl58185-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58185-supitem-0001">S6</a> in the 
   <a rid="grl58185-supInfo-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58185-supInfo-0001">supporting information</a>). Inclusion or omission of SW methane absorption also determines whether cloud adjustments are negative or positive. In the multimodel mean, the stratospheric temperature adjustment is similar to the total adjustment, but for the subset of models that either exclude or include SW absorption of methane, they do not agree. This may indicate that ERF also differs from RF for methane.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 5xSul, noncloud adjustments are generally small in comparison to the IRF, and cloud adjustments, which are larger in magnitude and spread, are described in the following subsection.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all experiments there is an anticorrelation between tropospheric temperature and water vapor adjustments, which is a result of the Clausius‐Clapeyron relationship. This is shown by observing that the water vapor adjustment is dominated by the adjustment calculated assuming a constant relative humidity for the tropospheric temperature change in each model and experiment (Figure 
   <a rid="grl58185-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58185-supitem-0001">S7</a> in the 
   <a rid="grl58185-supInfo-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58185-supInfo-0001">supporting information</a>). By decomposing tropospheric temperature responses into Planck and lapse‐rate components, we also show that the model spread in lapse‐rate plus constant relative humidity is smaller than in each of the individual components, reinforcing this anticorrelation and in line with feedback studies (Soden et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0043">2008</a>).

   <sub>2</sub> forcing are +0.45 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> on average and all models and methods agree that the net effect is positive, dominated by the SW effect. This is due to a reduction in low‐level and midlevel cloud fraction (also noted in Zelinka et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0055">2013</a>), which reduces outgoing SW radiation. There is no agreement between models on the sign of the LW cloud adjustment.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 10xBC, a downward shift of clouds occurs. Many competing processes that affect cloud adjustments occur in response to a BC forcing, such as cloud burn off (reduction in clouds), increased convection (increasing clouds), and changes in atmospheric stability, which could increase or decrease clouds depending on the altitude of the BC perturbation (Koch &amp; Del Genio, 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0025">2010</a>; Samset &amp; Myhre, 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0036">2015</a>). Every model shows a negative LW cloud adjustment to 10xBC, whereas there is no agreement on the sign of SW cloud adjustments. However, those models with a substantial negative cloud adjustment to 10xBC (ECHAM6‐HAM2 and CanESM2) show a large increase in cloud liquid water content in the lower or middle troposphere that is not present in other models, suggesting a possible mechanism.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For 5xSul, there is a large spread in the strength of the cloud adjustment, dominated by the SW effect, which is particularly strong in the HadGEM3 model. Further analysis is undertaken with the APRP method for SW cloud adjustments in the seven models for which diagnostics permit (Figure 
   <a rid="grl58185-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58185-supitem-0001">S8</a> in 
   <a rid="grl58185-supInfo-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58185-supInfo-0001">supporting information</a>). This shows that the ERF for 5xSul is substantially more negative in HadGEM3 than for other models, driven by a large contribution from the RFaci (RF due to aerosol‐cloud interactions or cloud microphysical effect). The direct aerosol forcing (RF due to aerosol‐radiation interactions, RFari) in HadGEM3 is in line with other models. The APRP highlights the varying strength in RFaci, which ranges from 33% (in CanESM2) to 63% (in HadGEM3) of the ERF in models, which include cloud microphysical changes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One limitation of the APRP method is that it does not appear to work well with models that do not include interactive cloud microphysical changes in their configurations, such as the apparent positive RFaci in NCAR‐CESM1‐CAM4 and GISS‐E2‐R. Furthermore, the computed SW cloud adjustments with the MMPRP and APRP methods do not agree in magnitude, and the kernel difference method, which is only available in three models due to the availability of double calls, only agrees with the MMPRP where cloud microphysical changes are not included (i.e., in NCAR‐CESM1‐CAM4; Figure 
   <a rid="grl58185-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58185-supitem-0001">S3</a>). The differences obtained with different methods highlight the difficulties in estimating cloud adjustments. A direct estimate of cloud adjustments can be obtained using a cloud kernel (Zelinka et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0054">2012</a>) and model output of International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) simulator diagnostics (Bodas‐Salcedo et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0005">2011</a>; Klein &amp; Jakob, 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0024">1999</a>; Webb et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0051">2001</a>). These diagnostics were not part of the PDRMIP data request and are generally not output by models outside of the CFMIP protocol (Webb et al., 
   <a rid="grl58185-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0050">2017</a>). Inclusion of these diagnostics as standard in more models would aid understanding of cloud adjustment mechanisms.
