 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study we use atmosphere‐only integrations from 11 global climate models (Canadian Earth System Model version 2 [CanESM2], ECHAM6‐HAM2, Goddard Institute for Space Studies E2‐R [GISS‐E2‐R], Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 2 Earth System [HadGEM2‐ES], Hadley Centre Global. Environment Model 3 [HadGEM3], Institut Pierre‐Simon Laplace Coupled Model version 5A [IPSL‐CM5A], Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate / Spectral Radiation‐Transport Model for Aerosol Species [MIROC‐SPRINTARS], National Center for Atmospheric Research‐Community Earth System Model version 1‐Community Atmospheric Model version 4 [NCAR‐CESM1‐CAM4], NCAR‐CESM1‐CAM5, Max‐Planck‐Institute Earth System Model [MPI‐ESM], and Norwegian Earth System Model 1‐Medium Resolution [NorESM1]) participating in the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP; Myhre et al.,

  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0037">2016</a>) for five idealized climate forcing experiments (Table 
  <a rid="grl58185-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58185-supitem-0001">S1</a> in the 
  <a rid="grl58185-supInfo-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58185-supInfo-0001">supporting information</a>). The experiments are a doubling of CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations (2xCO
  <sub>2</sub>), tripling of methane concentrations (3xCH
  <sub>4</sub>), 5 times sulfate emissions or concentrations (5xSul), 10 times black carbon emissions or concentrations (10xBC), and a 2% increase in the solar constant (2%Sol). One control (base) integration is also performed for each model. Perturbations are made abruptly, and for each model years 6 to 15 of the control and perturbed integrations are used for analysis. For the 5xSul and 10xBC experiments, some models are driven by emissions rather than concentration increases, and aerosol mass loadings depend on the aerosol transport and dynamical schemes within the model. Therefore, the emission‐driven experiments are not necessarily equal in terms of forcing size perturbation with each other or with the concentration‐driven experiments (Figures

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The atmosphere‐only integrations use climatological sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice. ERF is defined as the difference in TOA flux imbalance between the perturbed and base integrations of each climate model using the same base SST and sea ice climatology in both runs. By fixing the ocean state, any contribution from climate feedback is minimized leaving just the IRF plus the rapid adjustments, which sums to the ERF (Forster et al., 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0016">2016</a>). For aerosol experiments, we define IRF as the sum of the direct aerosol effect (RFari) and cloud‐albedo effect (RFaci), whereas adjustments include the semidirect and cloud‐lifetime effects (Boucher et al., 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0006">2013</a>). Land surface temperatures are allowed to respond, and feedback from land surface temperature changes, although small, do get aliased into calculations of adjustments (Chung &amp; Soden, 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0008">2015b</a>). There is more than one way to define ERF (Gregory et al., 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0017">2004</a>; Hansen et al., 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0021">2005</a>; Myhre et al., 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0031">2013</a>), but we use the fixed‐SST method as fewer model years are needed to minimize the uncertainty in ERF (Forster et al., 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0016">2016</a>).
