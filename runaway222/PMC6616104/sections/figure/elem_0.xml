  <p>Dynamic model of team learning climate. Note that this model conforms to systems dynamics modeling conventions (
   <a rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92">Sterman, 2000</a>). Boxed variables are stocks, and the hourglass shapes are flows. Cloud shapes represent factors exogenous to the model. Causal influence arrows are all directional, and denote either positive (blue) or negative (red) relationships. Arrows with “||” on the stem denote delayed influence (e.g., it may take time before goal orientation starts to influence the team learning inflow).
