 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drawing on the work of 
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Dweck (1986)</a> and others (e.g., 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">Button et al., 1996</a>; 
  <a rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97">VandeWalle, 1997</a>) on individuals’ psychological traits, 
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Bunderson and Sutcliffe (2002</a>, 
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">2003</a>) have shown that teams may approach achievement situations from two angles: learning and performance. When teams are oriented toward learning, their members take a proactive approach to solving new, complex problems and are more likely to engage in behaviors that facilitate learning (
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Alexander and Van Knippenberg, 2014</a>). Since they are not particularly interested in relying on prior capabilities, these teams invest considerable time and energy in planning their work (
  <a rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75">Mehta et al., 2009</a>) and their members continue to exchange information with each other during execution (
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">Gong et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, in achievement situations where teams are oriented toward performance, novel or puzzling insights tend to prompt irritation or discomfort rather than enthusiasm, because they undermine the team’s strongly rooted commitment to the collective expression of competence and the favorable judgment that comes with it (
  <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">Mehta and Mehta, 2018</a>). Mistakes are far less welcome on such teams, since they prize concrete progress or tangible results. For instance, highly performance-oriented teams are unlikely to continue pursuing radical innovation after they encounter challenges, because they realize that doing so increases their chances of failure (
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Alexander and Van Knippenberg, 2014</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leadership influences the emergence of a learning or performance orientation on teams. 
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Dragoni and Kuenzi (2012)</a> show that the leader’s individual goal orientation influences that of the team. Leaders are likely to induce learning or performance orientation when they offer feedback on behaviors or reward certain outcomes (
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Alexander and Van Knippenberg, 2014</a>). For their part, 
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">Chen et al. (2011)</a> show that leaders facilitate the emergence of a learning orientation by encouraging discussion of opposing views, while 
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Bunderson and Boumgarden (2010)</a> show that conflicts and disagreements between team members reduce the odds that a learning orientation will emerge within the team.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While some team research treats goal orientation as a team composition variable (an input in the ISPO model) (e.g., 
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">LePine, 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83">Porter, 2005</a>), the research above along with several other team studies (e.g., 
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">DeShon et al., 2004</a>; 
  <a rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75">Mehta et al., 2009</a>) conceptualize it as a team emergent state. The reason to conceptualize goal orientation as a state is that while individuals may have goal orientations when they join a team, such individual orientations are not immediately manifest by the collective, and the collective level may change over time given leadership behaviors and incentives (
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Dragoni and Kuenzi, 2012</a>). Again, because team goal orientation is an intangible property, individuals’ beliefs about it are more likely to have inertia. We could also imagine team factions that diverge in their goal orientations; it would make goal orientation more “compilational” in structure (
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">Klein and Kozlowski, 2000</a>), but it would still make it a state with inertia.
