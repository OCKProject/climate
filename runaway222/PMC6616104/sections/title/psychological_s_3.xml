  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Edmondson (1999)</a> has examined team psychological safety – the shared belief that a team is a safe place to take interpersonal risks – as a variable that would affect team learning. She has shown that learning behaviors translate effective team leadership into performance outcomes when team members feel able to question assumptions and discuss difficult issues. For instance, engaging in trial-and-error experimentation is extremely difficult when there is a sense that team members’ participation is being scrutinized or evaluated because chance of success is uncertain and failure is a strong possibility (
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">Lee et al., 2004</a>). The open discussion of errors, just as voicing ideas and concerns, requires a psychologically safe environment that encourages team members to engage in candid conversation focused on improving team task performance (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Today, psychological safety is the most common emergent state studied in relation to team learning (
  <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">Sanner and Bunderson, 2015</a>). It has been shown to have a positive relationship with team learning in a great variety of settings (for reviews, see

  <a rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80">Newman et al., 2017</a>). Companies as influential as Google have pointed to psychological safety as the most important feature of high-performing work teams (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaders can nurture psychological safety by inviting and showing appreciation for others’ contributions (
  <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">Nembhard and Edmondson, 2006</a>), creating clear structures (
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">Bresman and Zellmer-Bruhn, 2013</a>), and establishing shared rewards (
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">Chen and Tjosvold, 2012</a>). 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Edmondson and Harvey’s (2017)</a> multiple case study of extreme teaming projects also offers an in-depth account of what leaders can do to foster rapport that gives rise to psychological safety. The authors find that successful project leaders are not solely focused on task completion and project progress when they interact with team members, but also display genuine interest in team members’ needs and challenges in completing the task.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Psychological safety should be thought of as having inertia. It is a belief that builds over time (
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Edmondson, 1999</a>), and while behaviors can subtract from its level, the prior level should persist over time. For example, one angry outburst at a team member for a mistake would not destroy all psychological safety, though it would probably reduce the level (
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">Edmondson, 2018</a>). Also, a team that was temporarily disbanded and then re-assembled would be unlikely to restart from zero in terms of expectations about psychological safety.
