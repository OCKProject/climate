 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Team cohesion, defined as the shared belief or commitment from team members to the task, or to each other, has been extensively studied (
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">Beal et al., 2003</a>). Both the integration or “bonding” of individual team members into the group (social cohesion) as well as their desire to accomplish the team task (task cohesion) have been argued to increase team members’ willingness to invest time and energy within the team (
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">Hackman, 1990</a>). This is important for team learning because adopting learning behaviors is demanding for team members (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaders can play a significant role in influencing the degree of cohesion in teams. 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Edmondson and Harvey (2017)</a> find that leaders may facilitate its development by explicating shared values in articulating the team goal. Similarly, 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Chiniara and Bentein (2018)</a> show that shaping leader-member relationships in ways that lower perceptions of differentiation positively influences team cohesion. The degree of participation from team members in key facets of the team endeavor is another factor that affect team cohesion (
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Bergman et al., 2012</a>) and that leaders can enable. Leaders can also strategically request task-relevant information, point out flaws in task procedures, and question the team’s output. Monitoring task complexity in such a way brings team members together (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once again, because cohesion takes time to build (
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">Mathieu et al., 2015</a>) and is stored in individuals’ beliefs, we posit that it will not necessarily dissipate without some event and that it has inertia. However, such a state may have the possibility for more drastic change in a moment than, for example, goal orientation (which is rooted in individual proclivities). For example, some huge violation or betrayal by team members could destroy team cohesion (
  <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">Mach et al., 2010</a>). Yet the level of cohesion would move from its prior level to the new level, meaning that cohesion at time t+1 is a function of the event plus cohesion’s level at time t. This is how one operationalizes inertia (
