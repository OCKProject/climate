 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taking a systems view on TLC opens up avenues for future research while also offering practical insights. Specifically, our work offers three main contributions to theory. First, we still know little about whether some of the emergent states that bring about TLC are more amenable to leadership interventions. Scholars have distinguished between task- and person-focused leadership (
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">Koeslag-Kreunen et al., 2018</a>) but TLC, while being rooted in persons’ beliefs, also relates to features of the team task. Thus it is unclear what focus would be recommended to influence TLC. One direction for future research is to examine whether the four emergent states are more (or less) likely to evolve over time—and, if so, under what conditions. Doing so may require a move away from cross-sectional designs toward special research designs and new measurement tools. For instance, experience sampling methodology (ESM), which demands that research participants complete several surveys over a relatively short period of time, could enable the investigation of the dynamics and coevolution we aim to delineate in this paper. Such 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> momentary assessments of team emergent states could show which ones are more or less event-contingent (see 
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">Kozlowski, 2015</a>). The knowledge generated with this research can provide leaders with actionable insights into how to approach TLC monitoring.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, our work also provides grounds to think more deeply about who is best positioned to monitor TLC. The functional theory of leadership is inclusive when it comes to who should undertake leadership functions (
  <a rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78">Morgeson et al., 2010</a>). Anyone inside and around the team can exert leadership, whether they assume a formal or informal role. Is there a difference between a longstanding team leader and a newly integrated team member intervening to influence TLC? This raises questions such as whether team members are more effective at monitoring emergent states, given their proximity to fellow members, or whether appointed leaders may provide greater stimulus to TLC trajectory by dint of their formal authority. Recent work by 
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">Koeslag-Kreunen et al. (2018)</a> has shown that leadership from both formally appointed leaders and team members can influence team learning. Future research could look into team member interactions and how they might boost, maintain, or impair TLC. Computational methods would be particularly useful in leading such endeavors by modeling various team member characteristics and behaviors (see 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">Cronin and Vancouver, 2018</a>). The use of wearable wireless sensors designed to measure human social interactions is yet another way to give us cues about the respective influence of distinctive sources of leadership actions in real time (
  <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">Kozlowski and Chao, 2018</a>; 
  <a rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" href="#B103">Zhang et al., 2018</a>). This could also shed light on the conditions underlying the changes—for example, whether team-level features such as task interdependence, or features associated with the work environment such as virtual communication, interact with monitoring practices to affect TLC.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, while much has been written about TLC, what it actually represents has remained unclear. We hope to have provided more clarity to this important construct. However, we based our work on 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Bell et al. (2012)</a> and therefore focused on psychological safety, goal orientation, cohesion, and efficacy. Other emergent states may need to be included in TLC. One avenue for future research in that direction is to validate TLC as a second-order construct, similar to what 
  <a rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73">Mathieu et al. (in press</a>) have done with the action, transition, and interpersonal processes of teamwork proposed by 
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">Marks et al. (2001)</a>. Researchers need to map the many emergent states that have proliferated throughout the past decades or so, put them under larger umbrellas (second-order constructs), and test them empirically. This likely means reducing the number of items used to measure each emergent state and reassessing validity (
  <a rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90">Smith et al., 2000</a>), but this is necessary to start exploring the dynamics between these key constructs. Only then will team research be able to fully embrace the systems view that we propose here.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of practical implications, taking a systems view on TLC can help managers interpret the potential multivariate effect of their actions. For instance, a manager who wishes to cultivate psychological safety by modeling openness and asking feedback from team members can affect the goal orientation, efficacy, and cohesion of the team depending on the content of the feedback that is provided and the exchanges that ensue. Training managers in systems thinking could be useful to develop their holistic conception of management practice and leadership, which goes beyond the logical thinking that is usually taught in business schools. In general, this should lead managers to better appreciate the complexity of their impact and reduce the impression of direct connectedness between their actions and the desired outcomes.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thinking of TLC as an equilibrium that needs balance also brings the notion of time to the fore. It moves away from the perception of TLC as a starting point or a definite state represented as an intrinsic dialectical quality (learning vs. non-learning climate). Managers can then better understand why TLC is never a 
  <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> and rather an enduring accomplishment that revolves around managing several emergent states over time. Going back to 
  <a rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88">Senge (1990)</a>, this is at the foundation of the reflexivity and inquiry skills necessary for organizations to thrive over the long haul.
