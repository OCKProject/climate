 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Team Learning Climate</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the seminal work of 
  <a rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88">Senge (1990)</a>, learning has become a central part of the literature in management (
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">Huber, 1991</a>; 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">Edmondson, 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" href="#B101">Wilson et al., 2007</a>). Many researchers and practitioners have adopted Senge’s view that organizations need to learn in order to achieve and maintain superior performance. His argument is that fixed commitment to a leader’s vision is ultimately a bad strategy. The business environment inevitably changes over time, and thus organizations need to be able to adapt. As a result, Senge advocates for developing reflection and inquiry skills throughout the organization, hence facilitating the continuous emergence of new ways of thinking. Organizations are then better able to adapt quickly and effectively by matching (or creating) radical changes in their environment. He argues that work teams are a key unit for such learning to occur in organizations because learning begins with dialogue, a dialogue that allows individuals to make sense of complex situations and discover insights not attainable individually. Team learning has since been studied extensively in organizational behavior to explain team effectiveness.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">Edmondson et al. (2007)</a> find three perspectives on team learning in the literature, and each one of them considers features of TLC to be important. The first one, outcome improvement, examines the progression that teams go through as they gain cumulative experience performing the same set of tasks. The outcome improvement research shows clearly that teams learn at a different rate, and such differences have been attributed to various factors, such as team composition stability (
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">Edmondson et al., 2003</a>) or communication networks (
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">Argote et al., 2018</a>), and the learning climate (
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">Edmondson et al., 2001</a>). These studies demonstrate that team performance increases over time as teams learn how to improve their coordination (
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">Reagans et al., 2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second perspective, task mastery, suggests that team learning occurs when teams develop shared knowledge about each other and the task during the process of discussing and coordinating effort. Teams are seen as information-processing systems that may be better or worse at encoding, storing, retrieving, and communicating knowledge (
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">Hinsz et al., 1997</a>; 
  <a rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" href="#B101">Wilson et al., 2007</a>). Better teams are said to develop a more elaborate “transactive memory system,” which enhances performance on interdependent tasks (
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">Liang et al., 1995</a>). For instance, Ellis and colleagues define team learning as “the team’s collective level of knowledge and skill produced by the shared experience of the team members” (
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">Ellis et al., 2003</a>, p. 822). Interventions that involve training team members together on the task (e.g., 
  <a rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77">Moreland et al., 1996</a>) and facilitating face-to-face communication (
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">Lewis, 2004</a>) are demonstrative of this perspective on team learning. Scholars also find that the learning climate is a factor to consider in teams developing such shared knowledge (
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">Hammedi et al., 2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the third perspective defines team learning in terms of the activities of the learning process instead of its outcomes. It is deeply rooted in the input-process-output (IPO) model first developed by 
  <a rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74">McGrath (1964)</a>. In this model, team member behaviors and interactions are the processes that transform input conditions into performance outputs (e.g., 
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">Hackman and Morris, 1975</a>). As such, team learning comprises many different sorts of learning behaviors that reflect the particular needs and goals of the specific team (
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">Edmondson, 2002</a>). They include four behaviors: (a) building prototypes, drawing sketches, and running trials (e.g., 
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">Lee et al., 2004</a>), (b) questioning goals or methods to reach them, suggesting alternatives, reflecting on new information (e.g., 
  <a rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" href="#B99">West, 1996</a>), (c) engaging with experienced others outside the team (e.g., 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Bresman, 2010</a>), and (d) seeking information about the environment (e.g., 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Ancona and Caldwell, 1992</a>). Put together, these behaviors take place inside or outside the team, and may serve exploration or exploitation purposes (see 
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">Harvey et al., 2018</a>). In this paper, we focus on learning behaviors that take place inside the team because they are more dependent on TLC (e.g., 
  <a rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" href="#B102">Wong, 2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drawing on these three perspectives, we define team learning as team members’ behaviors related to processing knowledge that allows the team to improve. We argue that while team leaders can control inputs, they actually spend most of their time managing processes as they change in response to alterations in tasks and environment. In other words, individuals are the agents of learning, and the agents that initiate team learning. Because of that, leaders do not really affect the individuals as much as they set up conditions that enable individual/team learning. This is why 
  <a rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88">Senge (1990)</a> suggests that leaders in organizations should first and foremost enable individuals to adopt learning behaviors within their respective teams. Such enabling conditions usually relate to the beliefs that are shared by team members with regards to the team and its task, which have been termed “team emergent states.”
 </p>
 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Key Team Emergent States in Support of Team Learning</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A lot of the scholarly conversation on team learning focuses on understanding the conditions that facilitate learning in teams; that is, the states that emerge over time as individuals engage in teamwork and facilitate or constrain learning behaviors. The distinction between states and processes was a critical step toward understanding the dynamics of teamwork. As 
   <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">Marks et al. (2001)</a> have argued, the conditions of states are what influence a team and can persist over time. For example, the level of trust today will maintain itself over time until some other process changes that level. States allow explicit consideration of inertia in contrast to processes, like communication, that only affect the team when they are engaged and thus do not have inertia. The levels in the states alter the processes that take place in the team. Continuing with our example, a high level of trust may lead to more frequent and open communication, while a low level would make communication less frequent and more guarded. Processes also change states, so the open communication may further increase the level of trust. Taken together, 
   <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">Marks et al. (2001)</a> highlight the feedback between states and processes that affect the dynamics of team conditions over time.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While Marks and colleagues’ model has offered a conceptual path toward further precision in the exploration of team dynamics, much of the research that has followed does not take advantage of these. Most research focuses on the substance of emergent states, and largely studies them as moderators of other relationships without considering how they emerge and evolve in the first place (
   <a rid="B98" ref-type="bibr" href="#B98">Waller et al., 2016</a>). In particular, the ways in which emergent states dynamically interact with each other to explain certain team outcomes remains underexplored (
   <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">Cronin et al., 2011</a>), despite research demonstrating their joint effects in creating pathways that spur team learning (
   <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">Harvey et al., in press</a>). Before we can describe such dynamic interrelationships, we must briefly review the functionality of the four emergent states that have received most attention in team learning scholarship—psychological safety, goal orientation, efficacy, and cohesion (
   <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Bell et al., 2012</a>), summarized in 
   <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>. It is the fact that each emergent state has a different functionality but that these states may jointly affect common processes that justifies the need to consider them as a dynamic system.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Psychological Safety</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Edmondson (1999)</a> has examined team psychological safety – the shared belief that a team is a safe place to take interpersonal risks – as a variable that would affect team learning. She has shown that learning behaviors translate effective team leadership into performance outcomes when team members feel able to question assumptions and discuss difficult issues. For instance, engaging in trial-and-error experimentation is extremely difficult when there is a sense that team members’ participation is being scrutinized or evaluated because chance of success is uncertain and failure is a strong possibility (
    <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">Lee et al., 2004</a>). The open discussion of errors, just as voicing ideas and concerns, requires a psychologically safe environment that encourages team members to engage in candid conversation focused on improving team task performance (
    <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">Carmeli and Gittell, 2009</a>), instead of succumbing to defensive routines such as self-censoring (
    <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">Argyris, 1990</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Today, psychological safety is the most common emergent state studied in relation to team learning (
    <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">Sanner and Bunderson, 2015</a>). It has been shown to have a positive relationship with team learning in a great variety of settings (for reviews, see 
    <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">Edmondson and Lei, 2014</a>; 
    <a rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80">Newman et al., 2017</a>). Companies as influential as Google have pointed to psychological safety as the most important feature of high-performing work teams (
    <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">Duhigg, 2016</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaders can nurture psychological safety by inviting and showing appreciation for others’ contributions (
    <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">Nembhard and Edmondson, 2006</a>), creating clear structures (
    <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">Bresman and Zellmer-Bruhn, 2013</a>), and establishing shared rewards (
    <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">Chen and Tjosvold, 2012</a>). 
    <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Edmondson and Harvey’s (2017)</a> multiple case study of extreme teaming projects also offers an in-depth account of what leaders can do to foster rapport that gives rise to psychological safety. The authors find that successful project leaders are not solely focused on task completion and project progress when they interact with team members, but also display genuine interest in team members’ needs and challenges in completing the task.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Psychological safety should be thought of as having inertia. It is a belief that builds over time (
    <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Edmondson, 1999</a>), and while behaviors can subtract from its level, the prior level should persist over time. For example, one angry outburst at a team member for a mistake would not destroy all psychological safety, though it would probably reduce the level (
    <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">Edmondson, 2018</a>). Also, a team that was temporarily disbanded and then re-assembled would be unlikely to restart from zero in terms of expectations about psychological safety.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Goal Orientation</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drawing on the work of 
    <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Dweck (1986)</a> and others (e.g., 
    <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">Button et al., 1996</a>; 
    <a rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97">VandeWalle, 1997</a>) on individuals’ psychological traits, 
    <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Bunderson and Sutcliffe (2002</a>, 
    <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">2003</a>) have shown that teams may approach achievement situations from two angles: learning and performance. When teams are oriented toward learning, their members take a proactive approach to solving new, complex problems and are more likely to engage in behaviors that facilitate learning (
    <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Alexander and Van Knippenberg, 2014</a>). Since they are not particularly interested in relying on prior capabilities, these teams invest considerable time and energy in planning their work (
    <a rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75">Mehta et al., 2009</a>) and their members continue to exchange information with each other during execution (
    <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">Gong et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, in achievement situations where teams are oriented toward performance, novel or puzzling insights tend to prompt irritation or discomfort rather than enthusiasm, because they undermine the team’s strongly rooted commitment to the collective expression of competence and the favorable judgment that comes with it (
    <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">Mehta and Mehta, 2018</a>). Mistakes are far less welcome on such teams, since they prize concrete progress or tangible results. For instance, highly performance-oriented teams are unlikely to continue pursuing radical innovation after they encounter challenges, because they realize that doing so increases their chances of failure (
    <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Alexander and Van Knippenberg, 2014</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leadership influences the emergence of a learning or performance orientation on teams. 
    <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Dragoni and Kuenzi (2012)</a> show that the leader’s individual goal orientation influences that of the team. Leaders are likely to induce learning or performance orientation when they offer feedback on behaviors or reward certain outcomes (
    <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Alexander and Van Knippenberg, 2014</a>). For their part, 
    <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">Chen et al. (2011)</a> show that leaders facilitate the emergence of a learning orientation by encouraging discussion of opposing views, while 
    <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Bunderson and Boumgarden (2010)</a> show that conflicts and disagreements between team members reduce the odds that a learning orientation will emerge within the team.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While some team research treats goal orientation as a team composition variable (an input in the ISPO model) (e.g., 
    <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">LePine, 2005</a>; 
    <a rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83">Porter, 2005</a>), the research above along with several other team studies (e.g., 
    <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">DeShon et al., 2004</a>; 
    <a rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75">Mehta et al., 2009</a>) conceptualize it as a team emergent state. The reason to conceptualize goal orientation as a state is that while individuals may have goal orientations when they join a team, such individual orientations are not immediately manifest by the collective, and the collective level may change over time given leadership behaviors and incentives (
    <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Dragoni and Kuenzi, 2012</a>). Again, because team goal orientation is an intangible property, individuals’ beliefs about it are more likely to have inertia. We could also imagine team factions that diverge in their goal orientations; it would make goal orientation more “compilational” in structure (
    <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">Klein and Kozlowski, 2000</a>), but it would still make it a state with inertia.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cohesion</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Team cohesion, defined as the shared belief or commitment from team members to the task, or to each other, has been extensively studied (
    <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">Beal et al., 2003</a>). Both the integration or “bonding” of individual team members into the group (social cohesion) as well as their desire to accomplish the team task (task cohesion) have been argued to increase team members’ willingness to invest time and energy within the team (
    <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">Hackman, 1990</a>). This is important for team learning because adopting learning behaviors is demanding for team members (
    <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">Edmondson, 2003</a>; 
    <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Edmondson and Harvey, 2018</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaders can play a significant role in influencing the degree of cohesion in teams. 
    <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Edmondson and Harvey (2017)</a> find that leaders may facilitate its development by explicating shared values in articulating the team goal. Similarly, 
    <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Chiniara and Bentein (2018)</a> show that shaping leader-member relationships in ways that lower perceptions of differentiation positively influences team cohesion. The degree of participation from team members in key facets of the team endeavor is another factor that affect team cohesion (
    <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Bergman et al., 2012</a>) and that leaders can enable. Leaders can also strategically request task-relevant information, point out flaws in task procedures, and question the team’s output. Monitoring task complexity in such a way brings team members together (
    <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">Kane et al., 2002</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once again, because cohesion takes time to build (
    <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">Mathieu et al., 2015</a>) and is stored in individuals’ beliefs, we posit that it will not necessarily dissipate without some event and that it has inertia. However, such a state may have the possibility for more drastic change in a moment than, for example, goal orientation (which is rooted in individual proclivities). For example, some huge violation or betrayal by team members could destroy team cohesion (
    <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">Mach et al., 2010</a>). Yet the level of cohesion would move from its prior level to the new level, meaning that cohesion at time t+1 is a function of the event plus cohesion’s level at time t. This is how one operationalizes inertia (

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efficacy</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Researchers have theorized that team members’ confidence in their capability 
    <span class="italic">vis-á-vis</span> one particular task—team efficacy—is an important determinant of team performance (e.g., 
    <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">Gibson and Earley, 2007</a>). This is primarily due to the fact that team members are more likely to engage in learning behaviors when they share a belief that the team can do anything it sets out to accomplish (
    <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Edmondson, 1999</a>). As a result, teams that rate high on efficacy are prone to persist in the face of a challenging goal, and even tend to push themselves to surpass such a goal when they come close to achieving it (
    <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">Gully et al., 2002</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research has shown how leadership can enable team efficacy. For instance, one way is to embody the belief that the team is capable of achieving good performance—especially shortly after team formation, since teams have little information to support such assessments (
    <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">Pescosolido, 2001</a>). Likewise, designing the team’s work in order to achieve early wins is another way for leaders to facilitate the emergence of team efficacy (
    <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">Lester et al., 2002</a>). Finally, leaders can closely monitor goal achievement to counter the negative effects associated with high levels of team efficacy (
    <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">Rapp et al., 2014</a>).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efficacy can be said to be rooted in individuals’ beliefs (
    <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Bandura, 1997</a>). Like goal orientation, such beliefs aggregate and can be focused on teams, and team scholars have picked up on this assumption (
    <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">Gully et al., 2002</a>). Also like goal orientation, they can represent proclivities and habits. They too are likely to have inertia, and to have a persistent influence on individual and team activities even when such beliefs are not actively being discussed. Efficacy thus fits the profile of a construct with inertia.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interplay Among Team Emergent States</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each of these four emergent states contributes significantly to team learning. However, they have usually been studied in isolation from each other. There are two reasons to be concerned about this. The first is that when it comes to the levels of team states, it is not always “more is better.” For example, high levels of cohesion have detrimental effects due to increased pressure for conformity (
   <a rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69">Lott and Lott, 1965</a>; 
   <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">Hackman, 1976</a>). Alternately, if team members believe 
   <span class="italic">too</span> strongly in their ability to accomplish a task (efficacy), theory suggests that they can succumb to overconfidence and complacency (
   <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">Gist, 1987</a>). They tend to make poorer decisions by taking uncalculated risks, spending less time on information-processing activities, and rejecting negative feedback (
   <a rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" href="#B100">Whyte, 1998</a>). While such curvilinear relationships have not been investigated with respect to psychological safety, it would not be hard to imagine a team where effectiveness suffers because mistakes are so welcome. Similarly, there are contexts where performance orientation is more appropriate (
   <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Alexander and Van Knippenberg, 2014</a>). The bottom line is that each emergent state has an optimum setting that may change with task and context.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This leads to the second point, efforts to influence one state may affect the utility of the others. For example, moderate level of team efficacy is recommended for teams to engage in learning behaviors that enhance performance (e.g., 
   <a rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" href="#B93">Tasa and Whyte, 2005</a>), unless they monitor their goal closely—then, high level of team efficacy is beneficial (
   <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">Rapp et al., 2014</a>). Such contingencies mean that beneficial effects of one state might be counteracted by negative effects on another. It would explain why some researchers find a positive relationship between cohesion and team learning (e.g., 
   <a rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87">Schippers et al., 2008</a>), and others find no relationship (e.g., 
   <a rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94">van Ginkel and van Knippenberg, 2008</a>). What is unknown is whether some attempts to increase cohesion might not cancel out the benefits by also increasing a negative effects like groupthink (
   <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">Janis, 1972</a>). The bottom line is that if team emergent states affect each other, then research needs to address how to manage an equilibrium among them in order to maximize positive behaviors and outcomes such as learning in teams. We lack such an understanding of how the four team emergent states 
   <span class="italic">collectively</span> influence team learning.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research on the dynamics of teams is still in its infancy (
   <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">Bowers et al., 2017</a>), and conceptual work must therefore take a step forward and develop more dynamic models of team learning (
   <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Bell et al., 2012</a>). Inertia is a foundation for dynamics – without inertia there is no way for the past to influence the future (
   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">Cronin and Vancouver, 2018</a>). Above we have discussed why each emergent state could exhibit inertia. Yet to truly understand the 
   <span class="italic">dynamics</span> of TLC, we must consider the feedback loops within the system. That is, how the change to emergent states produced by some leadership action may set into motion a causal chain that loops back to perpetuate or even reinforce the current conditions. Such feedback loops can diminish the intended effect of leaders’ actions or even worsen the problem via unintended consequences. What leaders really need to do is to promote virtuous cycles within the system. In all cases, one cannot control a system by focusing only on one part of it (i.e., one emergent state).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To be clear, when we discuss feedback, we are talking about circular chains of causality (
   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">Cronin and Vancouver, 2018</a>). Feedback loops are what 
   <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">Marks et al. (2001)</a> and others (e.g., 
   <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">Ilgen et al., 2005</a>) have recognized as inherent in teams: An “output” at time 1 becomes the “input” at time 2. Such feedback is how non-linear growth and change can continue within a system even after a leadership action (or any other process intended to affect the team) has stopped. Feedback when coupled with inertia is also how systems as a whole resist change. To articulate how to control systems with inertia and feedback, it is often helpful to model them as 
   <span class="italic">stock and flow systems</span> (
   <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">Forrester, 1968</a>). A stock is like a tank that maintains its water level over time unless it is filled or emptied. Thus it has inertia like other emergent states. But importantly, the stock and flow structure highlights that what causes TLC to increase may not be what causes it to decrease—the inflow to TLC can represent a different set of processes or actions from the outflow (
   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">Cronin and Vancouver, 2018</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This decoupling of inflows from outflows allows for greater prediction and control of TLC both within and between emergent states. For example, efficacy opens the inflow to TLC, for example, by increasing the motivation to perform. Yet after a certain point, efficacy might also open the outflow to TLC as well, albeit through a different process such as the discarding of new knowledge (i.e., “our way works, why would we change it?”). Such a characterization still fits with the conceptualization of efficacy, but it suggests that to control the system a leader should focus on counteracting the tendency to ignore new knowledge. The broader point is that the emergent states act as a collective to alter the inflow and outflow to TLC.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The systems view implies that to truly understand how leadership can manage TLC, research must conduct studies that will simultaneously monitor the equilibration among the different emergent states. To use another analogy, consider a vegetable garden. To achieve the highest yield, the gardener must balance soil quality, sunlight, watering, and pest control. The relative levels of all these factors in concert determine the garden’s potential to produce a healthy crop. Moreover, addressing one factor might influence another (e.g., using pesticides might impair soil quality). Further, the relationships are not linear: Some watering is needed, but not too much, and this also depends on the amount of sunshine. TLC is like the yield of the garden. It represents the team’s potential to learn effectively, based on the current levels of the important factors that support or inhibit team learning. In many ways, leaders must be capable gardeners.</p>

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a> provides a more graphical illustration of the kinds of questions a systems view would warrant, and why these would be useful. The bottom of 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a> shows the stock of TLC with a single inflow and a single outflow, the arrows with hourglass symbols. Based on what we know about team learning, the inflow would represent experimentation and reflection processes (those that increase knowledge), while the outflow might represent forgetting and discounting processes (those that reject new knowledge). The emergent states are represented above the inflow and outflow arrows, and these have the capacity to influence each other as well as to open or close the flows. For simplicity, let us focus on psychological safety, and let us further assume that leaders are going to attempt to increase psychological safety through policy about the importance of always speaking up. The direct effect (represented by the bold arrow to the TLC inflow) should increase the rate of speaking up, which will encourage others in the team to do so as well, thus increasing the stock of TLC. Such an immediate effect can be tested and verified, but if one ignores the longer term effects, the understanding of the utility of this policy is incomplete.

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For one thing, thinking about the growth of TLC over time leads one to realize that it would not be reasonable to expect that psychological safety will increase TLC forever. There is likely to be some control function, possibly emanating from the limits on psychological safety itself, that could eventually cause diminishing returns on the accumulation of TLC. We might conjecture that people will get used to the policy of speaking up, and thus its influence on behavior will fade over time as it becomes taken for granted. Alternately, after a certain point, psychological safety may start to decrease TLC if teammates feel no need to consider their ideas before voicing them; it may lead to a kind of information overload. This kind of influence is represented by the arrow from psychological safety to the outflow of TLC, and may only emerge after psychological safety grows to a certain point, which is why there is a delay mark (||) on the arrow.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As we discussed above, psychological safety can affect or be affected by the other states as well (
   <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">Harvey et al., in press</a>). These would be represented by the other curved arrow in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>. Perhaps more important is that such effects can be delayed and can have second and even third order effects on TLC (i.e., the effect of psychological safety on TLC goes through two or three pathways). Consider first that while psychological safety can increase cohesion, as cohesion grows beyond a certain point it may increase conformity pressures which loopback to limit psychological safety (
   <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">Kahn, 1990</a>; 
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">Edmondson, 2018</a>). This is a balancing loop (denoted by B). This would be another way that the impact of the policy that encourages speaking up might fade over time (as cohesion grows).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sometimes the second order effects are harder to identify. Psychological safety may lead to increased efficacy, and as we discussed above, this might lead to overconfidence that decreases TLC as team members reject new knowledge (
   <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">Rapp et al., 2014</a>). This effect might also be delayed (represented by the two perpendicular lines on the arrow) because efficacy takes time to grow. However, once the effect of overconfidence surfaces and TLC starts to decrease, it may cause leaders to try to further increase psychological safety. Yet this will not fix the problem, and because of the delay between the change to psychological safety and the effect of overconfidence, leaders might overlook efficacy as the cause of the problem.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the feedback loops get longer and causes and effects become more distal in time, the potential for perverse outcomes increases. Continuing with our example, if psychological safety improves efficacy, it might eventually change the goal orientation to a performance one (especially if performance is rewarded and the team gets used to “winning”). This is a second order effect that might produce the third order effect whereby performance orientation reduces the willingness to experiment and possibly fail, thus shutting the TLC inflow.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The important point about a systems view is that all of these things may co-occur. Thus, while initially psychological safety is a boon to TLC, over time its influence becomes more limited because of increased cohesion, and possibly even detrimental if the dark side of efficacy and goal orientation takes over. Managing this system thus requires managing all four emergent states, not just one.</p>
