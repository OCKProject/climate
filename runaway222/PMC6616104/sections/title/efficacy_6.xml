 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Researchers have theorized that team members’ confidence in their capability 
  <span class="italic">vis-á-vis</span> one particular task—team efficacy—is an important determinant of team performance (e.g., 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">Gibson and Earley, 2007</a>). This is primarily due to the fact that team members are more likely to engage in learning behaviors when they share a belief that the team can do anything it sets out to accomplish (
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Edmondson, 1999</a>). As a result, teams that rate high on efficacy are prone to persist in the face of a challenging goal, and even tend to push themselves to surpass such a goal when they come close to achieving it (
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">Gully et al., 2002</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research has shown how leadership can enable team efficacy. For instance, one way is to embody the belief that the team is capable of achieving good performance—especially shortly after team formation, since teams have little information to support such assessments (
  <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">Pescosolido, 2001</a>). Likewise, designing the team’s work in order to achieve early wins is another way for leaders to facilitate the emergence of team efficacy (
  <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">Lester et al., 2002</a>). Finally, leaders can closely monitor goal achievement to counter the negative effects associated with high levels of team efficacy (
  <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">Rapp et al., 2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efficacy can be said to be rooted in individuals’ beliefs (
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Bandura, 1997</a>). Like goal orientation, such beliefs aggregate and can be focused on teams, and team scholars have picked up on this assumption (
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">Gully et al., 2002</a>). Also like goal orientation, they can represent proclivities and habits. They too are likely to have inertia, and to have a persistent influence on individual and team activities even when such beliefs are not actively being discussed. Efficacy thus fits the profile of a construct with inertia.
