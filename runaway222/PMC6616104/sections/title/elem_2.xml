 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Key Team Emergent States in Support of Team Learning</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A lot of the scholarly conversation on team learning focuses on understanding the conditions that facilitate learning in teams; that is, the states that emerge over time as individuals engage in teamwork and facilitate or constrain learning behaviors. The distinction between states and processes was a critical step toward understanding the dynamics of teamwork. As 
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">Marks et al. (2001)</a> have argued, the conditions of states are what influence a team and can persist over time. For example, the level of trust today will maintain itself over time until some other process changes that level. States allow explicit consideration of inertia in contrast to processes, like communication, that only affect the team when they are engaged and thus do not have inertia. The levels in the states alter the processes that take place in the team. Continuing with our example, a high level of trust may lead to more frequent and open communication, while a low level would make communication less frequent and more guarded. Processes also change states, so the open communication may further increase the level of trust. Taken together, 
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">Marks et al. (2001)</a> highlight the feedback between states and processes that affect the dynamics of team conditions over time.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While Marks and colleagues’ model has offered a conceptual path toward further precision in the exploration of team dynamics, much of the research that has followed does not take advantage of these. Most research focuses on the substance of emergent states, and largely studies them as moderators of other relationships without considering how they emerge and evolve in the first place (
  <a rid="B98" ref-type="bibr" href="#B98">Waller et al., 2016</a>). In particular, the ways in which emergent states dynamically interact with each other to explain certain team outcomes remains underexplored (
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">Cronin et al., 2011</a>), despite research demonstrating their joint effects in creating pathways that spur team learning (
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">Harvey et al., in press</a>). Before we can describe such dynamic interrelationships, we must briefly review the functionality of the four emergent states that have received most attention in team learning scholarship—psychological safety, goal orientation, efficacy, and cohesion (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Bell et al., 2012</a>), summarized in 
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>. It is the fact that each emergent state has a different functionality but that these states may jointly affect common processes that justifies the need to consider them as a dynamic system.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Psychological Safety</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Edmondson (1999)</a> has examined team psychological safety – the shared belief that a team is a safe place to take interpersonal risks – as a variable that would affect team learning. She has shown that learning behaviors translate effective team leadership into performance outcomes when team members feel able to question assumptions and discuss difficult issues. For instance, engaging in trial-and-error experimentation is extremely difficult when there is a sense that team members’ participation is being scrutinized or evaluated because chance of success is uncertain and failure is a strong possibility (
   <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">Lee et al., 2004</a>). The open discussion of errors, just as voicing ideas and concerns, requires a psychologically safe environment that encourages team members to engage in candid conversation focused on improving team task performance (
   <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">Carmeli and Gittell, 2009</a>), instead of succumbing to defensive routines such as self-censoring (
   <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">Argyris, 1990</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Today, psychological safety is the most common emergent state studied in relation to team learning (
   <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">Sanner and Bunderson, 2015</a>). It has been shown to have a positive relationship with team learning in a great variety of settings (for reviews, see 
   <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">Edmondson and Lei, 2014</a>; 
   <a rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80">Newman et al., 2017</a>). Companies as influential as Google have pointed to psychological safety as the most important feature of high-performing work teams (
   <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">Duhigg, 2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaders can nurture psychological safety by inviting and showing appreciation for others’ contributions (
   <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">Nembhard and Edmondson, 2006</a>), creating clear structures (
   <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">Bresman and Zellmer-Bruhn, 2013</a>), and establishing shared rewards (
   <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">Chen and Tjosvold, 2012</a>). 
   <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Edmondson and Harvey’s (2017)</a> multiple case study of extreme teaming projects also offers an in-depth account of what leaders can do to foster rapport that gives rise to psychological safety. The authors find that successful project leaders are not solely focused on task completion and project progress when they interact with team members, but also display genuine interest in team members’ needs and challenges in completing the task.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Psychological safety should be thought of as having inertia. It is a belief that builds over time (
   <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Edmondson, 1999</a>), and while behaviors can subtract from its level, the prior level should persist over time. For example, one angry outburst at a team member for a mistake would not destroy all psychological safety, though it would probably reduce the level (
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">Edmondson, 2018</a>). Also, a team that was temporarily disbanded and then re-assembled would be unlikely to restart from zero in terms of expectations about psychological safety.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Goal Orientation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drawing on the work of 
   <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Dweck (1986)</a> and others (e.g., 
   <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">Button et al., 1996</a>; 
   <a rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97">VandeWalle, 1997</a>) on individuals’ psychological traits, 
   <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Bunderson and Sutcliffe (2002</a>, 
   <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">2003</a>) have shown that teams may approach achievement situations from two angles: learning and performance. When teams are oriented toward learning, their members take a proactive approach to solving new, complex problems and are more likely to engage in behaviors that facilitate learning (
   <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Alexander and Van Knippenberg, 2014</a>). Since they are not particularly interested in relying on prior capabilities, these teams invest considerable time and energy in planning their work (
   <a rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75">Mehta et al., 2009</a>) and their members continue to exchange information with each other during execution (
   <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">Gong et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, in achievement situations where teams are oriented toward performance, novel or puzzling insights tend to prompt irritation or discomfort rather than enthusiasm, because they undermine the team’s strongly rooted commitment to the collective expression of competence and the favorable judgment that comes with it (
   <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">Mehta and Mehta, 2018</a>). Mistakes are far less welcome on such teams, since they prize concrete progress or tangible results. For instance, highly performance-oriented teams are unlikely to continue pursuing radical innovation after they encounter challenges, because they realize that doing so increases their chances of failure (
   <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Alexander and Van Knippenberg, 2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leadership influences the emergence of a learning or performance orientation on teams. 
   <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Dragoni and Kuenzi (2012)</a> show that the leader’s individual goal orientation influences that of the team. Leaders are likely to induce learning or performance orientation when they offer feedback on behaviors or reward certain outcomes (
   <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Alexander and Van Knippenberg, 2014</a>). For their part, 
   <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">Chen et al. (2011)</a> show that leaders facilitate the emergence of a learning orientation by encouraging discussion of opposing views, while 
   <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Bunderson and Boumgarden (2010)</a> show that conflicts and disagreements between team members reduce the odds that a learning orientation will emerge within the team.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While some team research treats goal orientation as a team composition variable (an input in the ISPO model) (e.g., 
   <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">LePine, 2005</a>; 
   <a rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83">Porter, 2005</a>), the research above along with several other team studies (e.g., 
   <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">DeShon et al., 2004</a>; 
   <a rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75">Mehta et al., 2009</a>) conceptualize it as a team emergent state. The reason to conceptualize goal orientation as a state is that while individuals may have goal orientations when they join a team, such individual orientations are not immediately manifest by the collective, and the collective level may change over time given leadership behaviors and incentives (
   <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Dragoni and Kuenzi, 2012</a>). Again, because team goal orientation is an intangible property, individuals’ beliefs about it are more likely to have inertia. We could also imagine team factions that diverge in their goal orientations; it would make goal orientation more “compilational” in structure (
   <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">Klein and Kozlowski, 2000</a>), but it would still make it a state with inertia.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cohesion</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Team cohesion, defined as the shared belief or commitment from team members to the task, or to each other, has been extensively studied (
   <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">Beal et al., 2003</a>). Both the integration or “bonding” of individual team members into the group (social cohesion) as well as their desire to accomplish the team task (task cohesion) have been argued to increase team members’ willingness to invest time and energy within the team (
   <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">Hackman, 1990</a>). This is important for team learning because adopting learning behaviors is demanding for team members (
   <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">Edmondson, 2003</a>; 
   <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Edmondson and Harvey, 2018</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaders can play a significant role in influencing the degree of cohesion in teams. 
   <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Edmondson and Harvey (2017)</a> find that leaders may facilitate its development by explicating shared values in articulating the team goal. Similarly, 
   <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Chiniara and Bentein (2018)</a> show that shaping leader-member relationships in ways that lower perceptions of differentiation positively influences team cohesion. The degree of participation from team members in key facets of the team endeavor is another factor that affect team cohesion (
   <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Bergman et al., 2012</a>) and that leaders can enable. Leaders can also strategically request task-relevant information, point out flaws in task procedures, and question the team’s output. Monitoring task complexity in such a way brings team members together (
   <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">Kane et al., 2002</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once again, because cohesion takes time to build (
   <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">Mathieu et al., 2015</a>) and is stored in individuals’ beliefs, we posit that it will not necessarily dissipate without some event and that it has inertia. However, such a state may have the possibility for more drastic change in a moment than, for example, goal orientation (which is rooted in individual proclivities). For example, some huge violation or betrayal by team members could destroy team cohesion (
   <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">Mach et al., 2010</a>). Yet the level of cohesion would move from its prior level to the new level, meaning that cohesion at time t+1 is a function of the event plus cohesion’s level at time t. This is how one operationalizes inertia (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efficacy</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Researchers have theorized that team members’ confidence in their capability 
   <span class="italic">vis-á-vis</span> one particular task—team efficacy—is an important determinant of team performance (e.g., 
   <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">Gibson and Earley, 2007</a>). This is primarily due to the fact that team members are more likely to engage in learning behaviors when they share a belief that the team can do anything it sets out to accomplish (
   <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Edmondson, 1999</a>). As a result, teams that rate high on efficacy are prone to persist in the face of a challenging goal, and even tend to push themselves to surpass such a goal when they come close to achieving it (
   <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">Gully et al., 2002</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research has shown how leadership can enable team efficacy. For instance, one way is to embody the belief that the team is capable of achieving good performance—especially shortly after team formation, since teams have little information to support such assessments (
   <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">Pescosolido, 2001</a>). Likewise, designing the team’s work in order to achieve early wins is another way for leaders to facilitate the emergence of team efficacy (
   <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">Lester et al., 2002</a>). Finally, leaders can closely monitor goal achievement to counter the negative effects associated with high levels of team efficacy (
   <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">Rapp et al., 2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efficacy can be said to be rooted in individuals’ beliefs (
   <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Bandura, 1997</a>). Like goal orientation, such beliefs aggregate and can be focused on teams, and team scholars have picked up on this assumption (
   <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">Gully et al., 2002</a>). Also like goal orientation, they can represent proclivities and habits. They too are likely to have inertia, and to have a persistent influence on individual and team activities even when such beliefs are not actively being discussed. Efficacy thus fits the profile of a construct with inertia.
