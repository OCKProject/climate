 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the studies (79%, 27/34) used time-series analysis as the research design in associating exposure variables and health outcomes, while the remaining used cross-sectional (9%, 3/34), process-based modeling (6%, 2/34), Bayesian modeling (3%, 1/34), and fuzzy association rule mining (FARM) (3%, 1/34) (

  <a rid="B37-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-16-02624">37</a>], and a study projected dengue, malaria, and cholera cases to 2020 and 2050 using general linear models [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two process-based modeling studies (i.e., CLIMEX and the susceptible-infected-recovered model) were hybrid models incorporating time-series [

  <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-02624">24</a>]. The three cross-sectional studies used descriptive statistics to present associations between dry/wet seasons and health outcomes. One study applied the Bayesian logistic geostatistical model for schistosomiasis [
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-16-02624">21</a>]. Only two models forecasted health outcomes (i.e., the CLIMEX model for malaria prevalence and FARM predictor model for dengue incidence). The CLIMEX model projected malaria prevalence up to year 2100 based on eco-physiological suitability for mosquitoes. Similarly, the predictor model purposively predicted dengue outbreaks four weeks in advance based on environmental predictors related to suitability for mosquitoes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the exposure variables, 27 studies (79%) used various meteorological parameters, five (15%) used extreme weather events, three (9%) used atmosphere-ocean interaction phenomena, and three (9%) used wet and dry seasons. The meteorological parameters used were rainfall (100%, 27/27), air temperature (89%, 24/27), humidity (67%, 18/27), sunshine hours (4%, 1/27), sea-level pressure (4%, 1/27), wind speed (4%, 1/27), and dew-point temperature (4%, 1/27). Most of the studies’ sources (56%, 19/34) of these parameters was the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which routinely observes these parameters via synoptic weather stations. Other sources were the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (18%, 6/34), WorldClim (6%, 2/34), CliMond (3%, 1/34), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (3%, 1/34). For rainfall, three studies used counts of rainy days rather than using the total/mean rainfall in millimeters. The extreme weather events used were high temperature days (categorized by high temperature percentiles), heatwaves (consecutive days with high temperature percentiles), and typhoons. For the atmosphere-ocean interaction phenomena, El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices (i.e., Southern Oscillation Index, Oceanic Niño Index, and ENSO years) and the sea-surface temperature were used.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of outcome variables, the most common (44%, 15/34) was surveillance data from the Philippine Department of Health and a non-government active surveillance. These were secondary data from the existing surveillance system of selected public hospitals and clinics. Nine studies (26%) used hospital admissions data, in which five were primary and four were secondary medical records. Four studies (12%) using mortality data were from vital statistical records of the Philippine Statistics Authority. Three (8%) used data from government- and foreign-funded national surveys for schistosomiasis, enteric protozoans, and poverty, while others were hospital outpatient-, community-, and school-based human and non-human samples that were collected.</p>
