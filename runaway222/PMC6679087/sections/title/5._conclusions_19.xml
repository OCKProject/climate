 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of scoping reviews supports the process of research agenda-setting. This particular study provided an overview of the current status of climate and health research in the Philippines, which allowed for identification of certain gaps and possible research topic priorities, such as health vulnerability, health adaptation, and co-benefits. However, the broad results should require additional analysis or a consultation workshop to conclusively select more specific health research topics for funding.</p>
