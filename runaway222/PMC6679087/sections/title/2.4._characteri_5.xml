 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The selected articles and papers were categorized based on the human health outcomes, climate factors, research design, methodologies, and country affiliations of the first authors which were researched. Further data on the study results were extracted to identify the specific details on the type of research and depth of the findings. To identify research themes, five climate and health themes by Smith et al. in one of the chapters of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report were adopted [

To guide the categorization of the articles, excerpts from their study objectives and results were used as a basis from which to identify which theme they fell under (
