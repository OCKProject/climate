  <p>The relationship between fire and vegetation change in the Siwaliks through time. PAH concentrations normalized to C
   <sub>31</sub>
   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkane (ΣPAH/C
   <sub>31</sub>) plotted on a logarithmic scale against δ
   <span class="sup">13</span>C values from C
   <sub>29</sub>, C
   <sub>31</sub>, C
   <sub>33</sub>, and C
   <sub>35</sub>
   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes. Shaded boxes correspond to time slices in the record; symbols correspond to each chain length. Dotted lines represent approximate limits of C
   <sub>3</sub> and C
   <sub>4</sub> values (
   <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>). Respective correlation coefficients and significance levels for log-transformed PAH values vs. n-alkane δ
   <span class="sup">13</span>C are C
   <sub>29</sub>, 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.70 and 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01; C
   <sub>31</sub>,

   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.79 and 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01; and C
   <sub>35</sub>, 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.57 and 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = nonsignificant. Two samples (R17-B, CFS-4 and R29-1, Psol 2) have both relatively depleted δ
   <span class="sup">13</span>C values and low PAH concentrations relative to other samples of their time slice and fall outside the annotated boxes. However, these samples fit with the statistical relationship between δ
   <span class="sup">13</span>C values and PAH concentrations. We interpret these as C
   <sub>3</sub> patches on the landscape that were subject to less burning.
