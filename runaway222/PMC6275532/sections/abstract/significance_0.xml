 <p>Fire is crucial to maintaining modern subtropical grasslands, yet the geologic and ecological history of this association is not well constrained. Here, we test the role of fire during the expansion of C
  <sub>4</sub> grassland ecosystems in the Mio-Pliocene through innovative molecular proxies from ancient soils in Pakistan. We produce a synoptic terrestrial record of fire and vegetation change in this region, which indicates that increased fire occurrence accompanied two stages of landscape opening. Proxy data confirm that a pronounced fireâ€“grassland feedback was a critical component of grassland ecosystems since their origination and fostered the rise of C
  <sub>4</sub>-dominated grasslands. The approach presented here can be used to examine landscape-scale interactions between paleofire and vegetation for other geographic regions and climatic transitions.
