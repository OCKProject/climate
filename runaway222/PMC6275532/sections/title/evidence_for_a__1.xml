 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first examined the distributions of PAHs found in the Siwalik paleosols to ensure that the molecules primarily reflect fire inputs and were not confounded by modern fossil fuel contamination or derived from geologic sources. First, to evaluate potential laboratory contamination, stringent blanks were run during each processing step, and these proved clean. Second, diagnostic ratios of methylated and nonmethylated PAHs widely used in modern environmental chemistry (
  <a rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" href="#r27">27</a>) indicated that the PAHs were almost exclusively derived from predominately pyrogenic sources and not from coal or other petrogenic inputs (
  <a rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" href="#r28">28</a>). The exception was four samples, all from the oldest Chinji Formation (∼14 to 11 Ma), which had ratios of methylphenanthrene (MPh) to phenanthrene (Ph) characteristic of petrogenic PAH sources (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>). As previously reported, 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkane distributions in the Chinji Formation were degraded and indicated weathered parent-material inputs (
  <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>), which suggests that weathered thermally mature parent material was also the source of PAHs with a petrogenic signature. These samples also have some of the lowest concentrations of PAHs in the dataset, and we conclude that petrogenic inputs were rare, low, and do not confound the primary fire signal in this record.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diagnostic ratios indicated that PAHs were not biologically degraded and give confidence that PAHs are a primary source signal. Modern soil studies show that fluoranthene (Fl) is more readily biodegraded by microbes over its more stable isomer, pyrene (Pyr) (
  <a rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" href="#r29">29</a>). Fl/(Pyr+Fl) ratios were &gt;0.5 in all samples, indicating no preferential loss of the less stable form (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>) (
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>, 
  <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>). Fl/(Pyr+Fl) ratios are also a diagnostic indicator of source, with ratios &gt;0.5 indicating inputs from biomass burning and those &lt;0.5 corresponding to a fossil fuel source (
  <a rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" href="#r27">27</a>). Since the MPh/Ph values indicate that the source of these samples was predominantly pyrogenic, it is likely that these Fl/(Pyr+Fl) ratios also reflect a primary vegetation burning signal that has not been subject to extensive microbial degradation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on these analyses, we conclude that abundances of the pyrogenic PAHs primarily reflect trends in fire input to the soil during the Mio-Pliocene. Total parent PAH concentrations (nonmethylated) were normalized to C
  <sub>31</sub>
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkane concentration (total PAH/C
  <sub>31</sub>) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>). This normalization of PAH concentrations to a plant-derived biomarker accounts for PAH abundance variations solely due to decreases or increases in plant biomass production (
  <a rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" href="#r26">26</a>). Fire-derived PAH concentrations normalized to waxes increased by over an order of magnitude from 13.7 to 1.6 Ma. Notably, the rise in the total PAH/C
  <sub>31</sub> ratio occurred in two distinctive steps: (
  <span class="italic">i</span>) a fivefold increase between 10 and 6 Ma and (
  <span class="italic">ii</span>) an additional 10-fold increase starting at 6 Ma (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PAH distributions in these ancient soil samples were also similar to those in vegetation-derived smoke particulates in modern environments. Samples older than 8 Ma contained retene, phenanthrene, and fluoranthene as major constituents. These three components are dominant in smoke particulates from modern burned conifers (
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>). In samples younger than 8 Ma, the major constituents were phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene in distributions that are similar to modern deciduous forest and Gramineae burn products (
  <a rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" href="#r33">33</a>). We interpret the decline in retene and the increase in pyrene among the major constituents as reflecting changes in the plant communities that burned.
