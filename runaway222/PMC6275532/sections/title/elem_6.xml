  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Siwalik Group consists of fluvial channel and overbank deposits with floodplain paleosols deposited by the proto-Indus and Ganges rivers in the foreland basin of the Himalayas. We analyzed organics extracted from 25 paleosol samples collected by A.K.B., Thure Cerling, and Jay Quade from the Chinji, Nagri, and Dhok Pathan formations of the Potwar Plateau in Pakistan. Chronostratigraphy in this area is based on paleomagnetism and is constrained with

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ten of these samples had already been analyzed for 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkane carbon isotopes in a previous study (
   <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>), and new analyses were conducted to investigate PAHs in all samples. Paleosol sediments were cleaned, freeze-dried, and powdered. Lipids were extracted from sediments using Soxhlet extraction and separated via accelerated solvent extraction as per Magill et al. (

   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes were quantified and identified via GC-MS (Hewlett-Packard 6890 GC and Hewlett-Packard 5973 MS). Carbon isotopes of 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes were measured using an irm-GCMS (Varian 3400 GC connected to Thermo MAT 252), and standard mean error for each measurement was 0.3‰ or less (1σ) (
