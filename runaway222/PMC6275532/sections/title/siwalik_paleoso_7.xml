 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Siwalik Group consists of fluvial channel and overbank deposits with floodplain paleosols deposited by the proto-Indus and Ganges rivers in the foreland basin of the Himalayas. We analyzed organics extracted from 25 paleosol samples collected by A.K.B., Thure Cerling, and Jay Quade from the Chinji, Nagri, and Dhok Pathan formations of the Potwar Plateau in Pakistan. Chronostratigraphy in this area is based on paleomagnetism and is constrained with
