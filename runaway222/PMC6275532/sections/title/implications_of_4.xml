 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Large-scale patterns of fire frequency and intensity are linked to both vegetation and climate conditions in the present (
  <a rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" href="#r43">43</a>). The interaction of these factors with fire, as represented in ecological threshold models, characterizes rapid, nonlinear transitions between forest and grassland vegetation states (
  <a rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" href="#r48">48</a>, 
  <a rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" href="#r49">49</a>). We suggest that two distinctive fire-regime states accompanied the vegetation changes in the late Miocene. The first transition (∼10 Ma), with a modest increase in fire signatures, reflected a mostly linear system response to fire (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). The second transition—the expansion of C
  <sub>4</sub> grasses and the accompanying exponential jump in fire signatures (∼6 Ma)—has characteristics of a system crossing a critical ecologic threshold and transitioning to a new stable vegetation state (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>) (
  <a rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" href="#r43">43</a>). It is possible that through positive feedbacks, favorable fire conditions were a necessary precondition that enabled the proliferation of grasslands in the late Miocene, and the two-staged ecosystem shift culminated in the establishment of frequent fire regimes unique to modern seasonal grassland ecosystems (
  <a rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" href="#r43">43</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An early association between a fire regime with frequent burning and C
  <sub>4</sub> grasslands has important implications for both the development of subtropical ecosystems and the evolution of grassland fauna. In South Asia, the expansion of grasslands prompted the extinction of some browser and frugivore taxa, along with a transition to dominance of grazers and mixed feeders (
  <a rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" href="#r16">16</a>, 
  <a rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" href="#r18">18</a>, 
  <a rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" href="#r50">50</a>), Additionally, open habitats are linked to the development of traits such as hypsodonty and cursorial traits (
  <a rid="r51" ref-type="bibr" href="#r51">51</a>, 
  <a rid="r52" ref-type="bibr" href="#r52">52</a>). Animals in modern grassland ecosystems are adapted to open landscapes and, therefore, to environments characterized by frequent fire. In modern habitats, synergistic relationships between fire and herbivory are vital to the maintenance of open and productive grassland habitat (
  <a rid="r51" ref-type="bibr" href="#r51">51</a>, 
  <a rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" href="#r53">53</a>). Our results indicate that changing fire dynamics and the establishment of frequent fire regimes characterized the initial expansion of grassland floras and suggest that plant–fire–animal functional and evolutionary relationships have been in operation ever since.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of this study emphasize the need to reconstruct paleofire in the geologic record alongside vegetation and climate to fully examine the development of grassy biomes in Earth history. Feedbacks proposed by modeling studies (
  <a rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" href="#r53">53</a>) can now be explicitly tested using proxy data from the geologic record. The recognition of two distinct increases in fire input in the Siwaliks revealed unexpected contingencies between fire-regime changes and intermediate vegetation states that previously were not considered when examining this region’s C
  <sub>4</sub> expansion and vegetation change. We have demonstrated that pyrogenic PAHs are preserved in paleosols and can be used to characterize paleofire inputs in conjunction with the development of grasslands in terrestrial contexts. The combination of this proxy approach with the interpretative paradigm of fire as an emergent property with feedbacks into the earth system is a powerful lens through which to decipher the role of paleofire in paleoecological transitions (
  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>, 
  <a rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" href="#r4">4</a>). In modern grasslands, the fire–vegetation–climate system responds differently in distinct continental contexts, and likely did so in the past as well (
  <a rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" href="#r54">54</a>). We hope further use of this approach will address how regional differences in fire dynamics contributed to the globally asynchronous late Miocene grassland expansion, as well as other terrestrial ecosystem questions in Earth history.
