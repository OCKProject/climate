 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ten of these samples had already been analyzed for 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkane carbon isotopes in a previous study (
  <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>), and new analyses were conducted to investigate PAHs in all samples. Paleosol sediments were cleaned, freeze-dried, and powdered. Lipids were extracted from sediments using Soxhlet extraction and separated via accelerated solvent extraction as per Magill et al. (
  <a rid="r57" ref-type="bibr" href="#r57">57</a>). PAHs and 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes were quantified and identified via GC-MS (Hewlett-Packard 6890 GC and Hewlett-Packard 5973 MS). Carbon isotopes of 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes were measured using an irm-GCMS (Varian 3400 GC connected to Thermo MAT 252), and standard mean error for each measurement was 0.3‰ or less (1σ) (
  <a rid="r58" ref-type="bibr" href="#r58">58</a>). Carbon isotope values are reported in per mil (‰) delta notation normalized to the international standard Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) using certified reference materials (Schimmelman A6). Delta notation is defined as δ
