 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we provide a fire reconstruction in the Pakistan Siwaliks tied to C
  <sub>4</sub>-grassland expansion by using PAHs preserved in paleosols as a molecular proxy for pyrogenic input. There is a strong correlation between PAH concentrations and 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C enrichment in 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes associated with C
  <sub>4</sub>-grassland expansion in South Asia, indicating C
  <sub>4</sub> grasslands were linked in both time and space to increased fire occurrence. Increased fire signatures at 10 Ma, accompanied by a decrease in conifer input, suggest that a fire-prone transition state preceded C
  <sub>4</sub> grasslands by 2 My. Fully developed seasonal C
  <sub>4</sub> ecosystems, as indicated by δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>carbonate</sub> evidence for increased seasonality as well as increased δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">n</span>-alkane
  </sub> values, coincided with highly elevated PAH abundances. The 10-fold greater PAH abundance clearly indicates that increased fire occurrence accompanied vegetation changes and landscape opening and provides robust evidence for a pronounced fire–grassland feedback in operation during the late Miocene grassland expansion. Our paleosol-based molecular fire reconstruction offers an approach that can reveal how fire affected the evolution of grassland ecosystems in other continental terrestrial archives.
