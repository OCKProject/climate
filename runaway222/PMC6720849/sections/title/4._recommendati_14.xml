 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Improving livelihoods, particularly rural livelihoods, is dependent on the implementation of a holistic and systematic approach such as the WEF nexus analytical livelihoods framework. Whilst food and nutrition security are a priority, especially in southern Africa, a WEF nexus approach would mitigate trade-offs and highlight vicious feedbacks with energy and water. Importantly, the WEF nexus approach provides a framework for sustaining rural resources, whilst maximising on the positive synergies, and identifies how best to build resilience into rural livelihoods and wellbeing. The following recommendations are proposed for improving resource management and livelihoods of poor rural people in southern Africa in the face of climate change, and at the same time, pursuing regional development goals, in a manner that integrates across the region, which enhance synergies and emergent properties: 
  <div list-type="simple" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <span class="label">▪</span>
    <p>Embracing a cross-sectoral nexus thinking in conceptualising, implementing and evaluating WEF resources planning and management. Specifically, this could be incorporated within a theory of change (TOC) model to establish the pathways to understanding the underlying logic, assumptions, influences, causal linkages, and expected outcomes of the WEF nexus analysis in uplifting rural livelihoods and building resilience to climate change.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <span class="label">▪</span>
    <p>Exploit the untapped abundant renewable green energy sources, like wind and solar, to increase energy availability and access, as well as to reduce energy costs and providing clean energy for poor rural people. Solar and wind energy can easily reach the rural population as they can be installed near the demand area, further reducing the environmental footprint and the unintended trade-offs and/or consequences for other sectors, such as water security or food production.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <span class="label">▪</span>
    <p>Explore conjunctive water use, through exploiting untapped groundwater resources for irrigation and domestic use to counter rainfall variability, and to supplement surface water resources. Currently, 80% of the cultivated area is rainfed, which is at great risk from climate change, and local access to groundwater resources to supplement rainwater, would enhance both household food security and household water security.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <span class="label">▪</span>
    <p>A combination of increased access and availability of water, combined with clean energy, would contribute significantly to uplifting the standard of living (nutrition, health, and well-being) among poor rural people, whilst countering the potential negative consequences of climate change on these. This is especially so for public health elements associated with malnutrition, water-borne diseases, and food preparation and heating with wood and paraffin.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <span class="label">▪</span>
    <p>Design and develop cross-sectoral governance structures at regional level like climate change policies, strategies, and adaptations plans. These should be aligned to regional institutions and policies to unlock the potential of the WEF nexus approach, and to effectively exploit the potential of transboundary resources. For example, the Regional Agriculture Policy (RAP) can be linked to the Water and Energy Policy, such that they can inform decision making as on sustainable agricultural expansion and development, reveal trade-offs across sectors, and reduce unintended consequences, especially for downstream users.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <span class="label">▪</span>
    <p>Investments in research, development and innovation, which promote the production of more with fewer resources, the reduction of waste, and minimising losses, for enhanced sustainability. This includes investments in efficient energy technologies to improve energy use efficiencies and productivity. Secondly, investments in smart and efficient irrigation technologies, including for local groundwater and storage capacity, would contribute to decreasing agricultural surface water use, and improved water productivity and access, and resilient household agricultural production. In addition, adoption of climate and water smart agricultural practices could reduce water and energy demand in agriculture.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <span class="label">▪</span>
    <p>Build resilience at the regional level and promote integration through the WEF nexus approach as it identifies opportunities for climate change adaptation and reduction of poverty and vulnerability through coordinated WEF infrastructure development, improved management of transboundary natural resources and maximising on regional competitive advantages for agricultural production. This has potential to improve regional resilience and resource use efficiency. This is particularly relevant for southern Africa as most resources are transboundary and, if not well managed they may become a cause of conflict [

    <span class="label">▪</span>
    <p>As the WEF nexus is at the heart of sustainable development, it is also central to regional dialogues on economic development and monitoring the performance of SDGs. Therefore, adopting the WEF nexus at the regional level promotes sustainable resource utilisation and inclusive economic development and, job creation, thereby improving the livelihoods and well-being of people. The WEF nexus is, thus, a tool capable of assessing and monitoring SDGs implementation and performance, particularly SDGs 2, 3, 6 and 7. For example, there is a strong case for a regional food security initiative as opposed to current national food security strategies, as this would maximise the region’s competitive advantages in crop and livestock production, whilst maximising household food security, and buffering the region against local droughts. This would also encourage new investments in areas that currently lack any, leading to job creation, and creating a virtuous circle for regional integration efforts.</p>

    <p>Link climate change scenario planning with the WEF nexus analytical livelihoods framework to enhance the reflexivity, resilience, responsiveness, and revitalisation of governance and adaptation strategies. Reflexivity is the capability to systematically and continuously deal with a variety of problems as they emerge; resilience is the ability to bounce back to the original basic state of function after a perturbation; responsiveness is the ability to deal with dynamic demands and expectations, and; revitalisation is the ability to reignite policies and ensure their continuous application [
     <a rid="B80-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80-ijerph-16-02970">80</a>]. These scenario planning include the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and the representative concentration pathways (RCPs), which are a set of pathways and frameworks developed to facilitate an integrated analysis of long-term and near-term modelling experiments for climate change to assess vulnerabilities and recommend adaptation and mitigation strategies [
