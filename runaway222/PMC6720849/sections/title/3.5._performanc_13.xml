  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f005">Figure 5</a> is a graphical representation of the current performance and status of the WEF resources in southern Africa, showing a clear imbalance and uneven resource allocation and distribution. The lowly sustainable integrated WEF nexus index of 0.145 is an indication that the performance of resources utilisation and management is very low, and exacerbating regional vulnerabilities. There is an over emphasis on food security (food self-sufficiency) at the expense of other sectors. This is mainly due to sectoral approaches in resources management, which do not provide opportunities to minimise trade-offs. Although a lot of effort has been made on food self-sufficiency, showing an index of 0.357, water allocation towards agriculture is affecting other competing sectors. Most efforts seem to be directed towards the agriculture sector, yet water and hydropower (the main source of energy) are in short supply. Thus, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f005">Figure 5</a> pinpoints urgent sectors for prioritising interventions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the exception of South Africa, the region depends on hydropower as the main source of energy, and, thus, energy and agriculture compete for scarce water resources [
  <a rid="B77-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-ijerph-16-02970">77</a>]. This places the region in a high vulnerable position because when there is drought, there is scarcity of water, energy, and food as these resources are climate sensitive, a three-way security threat. This was evident during the 2015/16 El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) induced drought, which caused insecurities of WEF resources [
  <a rid="B62-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-16-02970">62</a>]. The increasing frequency and intensity of recent cyclones are causing immense devastation on agriculture, infrastructure, and loss of human life as well as human health [
  <a rid="B62-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-16-02970">62</a>]. Still under such an imbalanced situation, the region intends to increase the irrigated area from 3.5% to 7% of the cultivated area. Whilst increasing the irrigated area is a noble idea as it enhances food security to some extent, there is also the need to consider a cross-sectoral approach to avoid transferring challenges to other sectors, and, thus, to achieve a more circular shape in the WEF nexus indices in the spider graph (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f005">Figure 5</a>). The shape of the spider graph indicates priority areas needing immediate intervention, i.e., all areas other than food self-sufficiency.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under such a scenario as presented in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f005">Figure 5</a>, the rural poor normally suffer the brunt of uncoordinated management of resources. Current resource management is unsustainably very low at 0.145. Although the region has improved agricultural production, as also indicated by previous studies [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-16-02970">18</a>], the region generally fails to meet the food requirements of its growing population (i.e., household food security), and usually relies on international aid to supplement local food deficits [
  <a rid="B62-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-16-02970">62</a>]. There is, therefore, a need for a paradigm shift from a sovereignty and silo mindset towards regional integration and cross-sectoral resources management for regional economic development, and to improve the livelihoods of people. This need is supported by the transboundary nature of resources in southern Africa, and similar challenges that span across countries, as climate change does not respect political boundaries [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The WEF nexus analytical tool is important for transforming livelihoods, as it identifies priority areas for intervention and ensures that rural areas are not left behind in regional, national, and local developmental projects. Prioritising rural development in southern Africa ensures gender and social inclusivity by improving the livelihoods of vulnerable groups such as women, children, and the youth who form the majority of rural communities [
  <a rid="B78-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78-ijerph-16-02970">78</a>,
  <a rid="B79-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79-ijerph-16-02970">79</a>]. The results indicate the need for regional planning, coordination and monitoring of resources in southern Africa, as resources are generally transboundary [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-16-02970">6</a>]. For southern Africa in particular, managing resources at a regional level is a catalyst for regional integration, and a pathway to improve rural livelihoods as well as attaining the 2030 agenda on sustainable development.
