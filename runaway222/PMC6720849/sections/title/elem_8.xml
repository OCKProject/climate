  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Southern Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change and variability because of multiple factors, such as reliance on climate sensitive sectors of agriculture and fisheries, lack of resources to adapt, poor infrastructure, and lack of institutional arrangements, as well as low adaptive capacity [

   <a rid="B76-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-ijerph-16-02970">76</a>]. The transformation of rural livelihoods and the sustainability of adaptation strategies is underpinned by the understanding of the role of the WEF nexus in framing effective policies and institutions.

These envisaged outcomes are achieved through the key adaptation strategies of governance (policies and plans), social equity (accelerating access for all), environmental sustainability (investing to sustain ecosystem services), and economic efficiency (increasing resource efficiency), as shown in the second component [
   <a rid="B1-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-16-02970">1</a>]. These four key adaptation components form the basis to meet sustainable targets of reducing poverty and building resilience, which result in the security of resources, and sustainable development. The targets define sustainability indicators (last component of the framework) that assess and monitor resource planning and management, and to ensure equitable resource distribution and inclusive development. WEF nexus sustainability indicators are measurable parameters that indicate the performance of resource development, and monitor how the development is impacting on livelihoods or vice-versa [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f005">Figure 5</a> is a graphical representation of the current performance and status of the WEF resources in southern Africa, showing a clear imbalance and uneven resource allocation and distribution. The lowly sustainable integrated WEF nexus index of 0.145 is an indication that the performance of resources utilisation and management is very low, and exacerbating regional vulnerabilities. There is an over emphasis on food security (food self-sufficiency) at the expense of other sectors. This is mainly due to sectoral approaches in resources management, which do not provide opportunities to minimise trade-offs. Although a lot of effort has been made on food self-sufficiency, showing an index of 0.357, water allocation towards agriculture is affecting other competing sectors. Most efforts seem to be directed towards the agriculture sector, yet water and hydropower (the main source of energy) are in short supply. Thus, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f005">Figure 5</a> pinpoints urgent sectors for prioritising interventions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the exception of South Africa, the region depends on hydropower as the main source of energy, and, thus, energy and agriculture compete for scarce water resources [
   <a rid="B77-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-ijerph-16-02970">77</a>]. This places the region in a high vulnerable position because when there is drought, there is scarcity of water, energy, and food as these resources are climate sensitive, a three-way security threat. This was evident during the 2015/16 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) induced drought, which caused insecurities of WEF resources [
   <a rid="B62-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-16-02970">62</a>]. The increasing frequency and intensity of recent cyclones are causing immense devastation on agriculture, infrastructure, and loss of human life as well as human health [
   <a rid="B62-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-16-02970">62</a>]. Still under such an imbalanced situation, the region intends to increase the irrigated area from 3.5% to 7% of the cultivated area. Whilst increasing the irrigated area is a noble idea as it enhances food security to some extent, there is also the need to consider a cross-sectoral approach to avoid transferring challenges to other sectors, and, thus, to achieve a more circular shape in the WEF nexus indices in the spider graph (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f005">Figure 5</a>). The shape of the spider graph indicates priority areas needing immediate intervention, i.e., all areas other than food self-sufficiency.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under such a scenario as presented in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f005">Figure 5</a>, the rural poor normally suffer the brunt of uncoordinated management of resources. Current resource management is unsustainably very low at 0.145. Although the region has improved agricultural production, as also indicated by previous studies [
   <a rid="B18-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-16-02970">18</a>], the region generally fails to meet the food requirements of its growing population (i.e., household food security), and usually relies on international aid to supplement local food deficits [
   <a rid="B62-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-16-02970">62</a>]. There is, therefore, a need for a paradigm shift from a sovereignty and silo mindset towards regional integration and cross-sectoral resources management for regional economic development, and to improve the livelihoods of people. This need is supported by the transboundary nature of resources in southern Africa, and similar challenges that span across countries, as climate change does not respect political boundaries [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The WEF nexus analytical tool is important for transforming livelihoods, as it identifies priority areas for intervention and ensures that rural areas are not left behind in regional, national, and local developmental projects. Prioritising rural development in southern Africa ensures gender and social inclusivity by improving the livelihoods of vulnerable groups such as women, children, and the youth who form the majority of rural communities [
