 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Southern Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change and variability because of multiple factors, such as reliance on climate sensitive sectors of agriculture and fisheries, lack of resources to adapt, poor infrastructure, and lack of institutional arrangements, as well as low adaptive capacity [

  <a rid="B62-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-16-02970">62</a>]. Water, energy and food are expected to be the sectors most affected by climate variability and change in the region [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-16-02970">6</a>]. The largest proportions of populations vulnerable to the vagaries of climate change are found on the African continent, where chronic water, food and energy insecurity and malnourishment remain endemic [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-16-02970">5</a>]. Rainfall variability threatens the production from more than 80% of agricultural land of the continent, as agriculture is mainly rainfed [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-16-02970">17</a>]. Climate projections for southern Africa indicate increased physical and/or economic water scarcity by as early as 2025 [
  <a rid="B63-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-ijerph-16-02970">63</a>]. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that between 75–250 million people and 350–600 million people in Africa will be at risk of increased water stress by 2020 and 2050, respectively [

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f003">Figure 3</a>). Reduced rainfall, coupled with increased temperatures, will reduce (a) the area suitable for agriculture, (b) the length of growing period, and (c) yield potential [

  <a rid="B64-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-ijerph-16-02970">64</a>]. By 2080, rainfall variability and longer dry spells would result in reduction of crop yields, rise in sea levels and coastal and low-lying areas would be affected by floods. Significant changes are already being experienced in sectors of agriculture, water, energy, biodiversity, and health [

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f003">Figure 3</a>). Climate models predict that Africa will be able to provide only 13% of its food requirements by 2050 if no measures are in place to reduce GHG emissions [
  <a rid="B65-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65-ijerph-16-02970">65</a>]. Population is anticipated to have increased to 2 billion during the same period. Current statistics indicate that only 290 million out of 915 million people have access to electricity, and the total number without access is rising due to increased population growth and lack of contingency plans to improve the current situation [
  <a rid="B66-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66-ijerph-16-02970">66</a>]. Extreme weather events as caused by climate change derail progress made so far in poverty alleviation, employment, housing, access to and provision of services, food security and potable water [

  <a rid="B67-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67-ijerph-16-02970">67</a>]. Health challenges caused by climate change will be highly noticeable in regions experiencing extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, storms, and fires. Other health risks resulting from climate change will be from changes in regional food yields, disruption of fisheries, loss of livelihoods, and population displacement due to sea-level rise, water shortages, loss of agricultural land, among others [
  <a rid="B68-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-ijerph-16-02970">68</a>]. Water, energy and food security are closely related to health, as food and water, for instance, have a direct impact on human health and the physical conditions of humans has a strong influence on their ability to work [

Without actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), temperatures are projected to rise more than 4 °C in southern African by 2100. Using the 1981–2000 base period, heatwaves have increased by over 3.5 fold to-date in the region [

Such changes in climate regimes, coupled with increased frequency and intensity of floods and droughts, are usually accompanied by health issues. The effects of extreme weather events transcends mortality and damage to property and crops, but also results in food and water insecurity, spread of disease, and mental health conditions [
