  <a rid="ijerph-16-02970-t003" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02970-t003">Table 3</a>. The diagonal elements are the values of unity (i.e., when an indicator is compared with itself the relationship is one). Since the matrix is also symmetrical, only the lower half of the triangle is filled in and the remaining cells are reciprocals of the lower triangle. As already alluded to, the relationships are established using a scale ranging between 1/9 and nine as given by Saaty [
