 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water, energy and food are vital resources for human well-being, poverty reduction and sustainable development [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-16-02970">1</a>,
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-16-02970">2</a>]. Demand for these resources is projected to increase significantly in the near future due to population growth and migration, economic development, international trade, urbanisation, diversifying diets, cultural and technological changes, as well as climate variability and change [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-02970">3</a>]. These current societal megatrends, coupled with environmental, technological, economic and demographic changes, continue exerting pressure on already scarce and depleting natural resources, threatening their sustainability, and, thereby, undermining the resilience communities [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-16-02970">4</a>]. The resultant challenge requires transdisciplinary and transformative approaches in resource management, development and utilisation, using integrative approaches such as the water–energy–food (WEF) nexus, which allows for inclusive and equitable development, as well as coordinated resource planning and management [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-16-02970">5</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The WEF nexus refers to the complex and inextricable interlinkages (synergies and trade-offs) that exist between water, energy, and food sectors, in pursuit of balanced and sustainable development. The WEF nexus approach takes into consideration cross-sectoral synergies and trade-offs among WEF sectors, while simultaneously mitigating duplication of activities. Development, management and use of resources through the WEF nexus is evidence-based, integrative, and ensures improvements in livelihoods and sustainability of resources for human well-being [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-16-02970">6</a>]. The current silo driven disproportionate use and allocation of WEF resources has created an imbalance in the physical and natural systems, to the extent that sustainability for future generations cannot be guaranteed [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-16-02970">7</a>,
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-16-02970">8</a>]. For example, agriculture accounts for 70% of total global freshwater withdrawals, making it the largest consumer of water [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-16-02970">9</a>]. Water is used for agricultural production, forestry and fisheries, yet the same water is also required to produce or transport energy in different forms [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-16-02970">9</a>]. Concurrently, the food production and supply chain consumes about 30% of total energy consumed globally [
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-16-02970">10</a>]. Continuing with the current siloed sectoral approach in resource management directly impacts on the livelihoods of the rural poor, and severely exacerbates their vulnerabilities as they generally lack resources to adapt to change [
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-02970">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Livelihood refers to the ability to obtain the basic needs in life, which include food, water, energy and clothing [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-16-02970">12</a>]. The sustainable rural livelihoods framework is the widely used approach in livelihoods studies, and emphasises on how people use their assets (natural, physical, social, human, and financial) to come up with livelihood strategies and positive outcomes [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-16-02970">13</a>]. In a livelihood approach, a detailed analysis of the factors that shape water, energy, and food security is done at local or community levels [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-16-02970">1</a>]. As livelihood approaches capture the processes and contextual factors that shape adaptive capacity, the WEF nexus analytical livelihoods framework can, thus, be integrated into livelihood analyses, as this framework is capable of assessing, monitoring and evaluating resource use and social development [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02970">14</a>]. In most rural areas of developing countries, these three basic needs, and their delivery by government, are limited, which results in rural populations turning to natural systems for basic survival, or emigrating from rural to urban areas [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-16-02970">15</a>]. As the WEF nexus is mainly concerned with integrating these three connected resources of water, energy, and food, as well as simplifying human understanding of the complex linkages among them, and at the same time, ensuring resource security for sustainability; the approach is envisaged to provide pathways that transform rural livelihoods and ensure their resilience [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02970">14</a>,
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-16-02970">16</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of southern Africa, 60% of the population still lives in rural areas with limited access to these basic needs [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-16-02970">6</a>]. As land is a readily available resource, people in rural areas have always been largely dependent on farming as the main livelihood activity. Seventy-five percent of the income of rural households in southern Africa is derived from small-scale farming [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-16-02970">5</a>] under rainfed agriculture, coupled with a poor resources base, exposes rural populations to climate variability and change [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-16-02970">17</a>,
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-16-02970">18</a>]. Other sources of income for people living in rural areas include non-farming natural resource based activities such as hunting and artisanal work, livelihood activities that are also climate sensitive [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-16-02970">19</a>]. All these factors contribute to the vulnerabilities of rural populations to the vagaries of extreme weather events and diseases [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-16-02970">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Presently, almost 240 million people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (or one person in every four) do not have access to nutritious food that guarantees a healthy and active life [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-16-02970">20</a>,
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-16-02970">21</a>]. Rising food prices, and the recurrence of extreme weather events like floods and droughts, are pushing more people into poverty and hunger, compromising human health and well-being [
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-16-02970">22</a>]. Africa’s population is anticipated to double to 2.4 billion by 2050, and already 38% of the people live in water scarce environments, as two-thirds of the continent is either arid or semi-arid [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-16-02970">23</a>,
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-02970">24</a>]. Smallholder farmers who rely on rainfed agriculture contribute about 90% of the agricultural produce [
  <a rid="B25-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-16-02970">25</a>], yet the level of food insecurity in the region is very high, affecting mostly rural populations [
  <a rid="B26-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-16-02970">26</a>]. Dependence on climate sensitive sectors by small-scale farmers who contribute the most to the agricultural produce, but lack of access to resources to adapt is the major driver of food insecurity in the region. As climate change is cross sectoral and multidimensional, the WEF nexus can play an important role in climate change adaptation as it offers cross-sectoral mitigation and adaptation opportunities to harmonise interventions and build resilience [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-16-02970">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The African Union Commission (AUC) through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) has earmarked to increase agricultural land by (i) extending area under sustainable land management and reliable water control systems, (ii) improving rural infrastructure and trade-related capacities for improved market access, (iii) increasing food supply and reducing hunger, and (iv) conducting research and development [
  <a rid="B27-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-16-02970">27</a>,
  <a rid="B28-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-16-02970">28</a>]. Implementing the WEF nexus enhances opportunities to achieve these targets as the approach can be used as a guide in decision making by assessing intervention mechanisms and balancing resource allocation to ensure equitable resource distribution [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02970">14</a>]. For example, it suggested that increasing the area equipped with irrigation could provide opportunities for farmers to sustainably increase yield and address food insecurity, and CAADP aims to increase the irrigated area to 20 million ha, at an estimated initial cost of US$37 billion with infrastructure operation and maintenance requiring a further US$31 billion [
  <a rid="B27-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-16-02970">27</a>]. Whilst this huge investment is capable of transforming the agriculture sector, the question that immediately arises is, “where is the water to meet these set targets?”
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although emphasis on large-scale water infrastructural projects may have apparent beneficial outcomes like producing hydropower and providing water storage for irrigation and urban uses, such investments may be at the expense of downstream agro-ecological systems with adverse social consequences, such as displacement or resettlement [
  <a rid="B29-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-16-02970">29</a>]. In this context, this study adapted the WEF nexus analytical model developed by Nhamo et al. [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02970">14</a>] to develop a WEF nexus analytical livelihoods framework (ALF), which was used to analyse and address the complex and interrelated nature of resource systems [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02970">14</a>]. The WEF nexus ALF is a systems approach that analyses and assesses the interactions between the natural environment and the biosphere, facilitating a more coordinated management and monitoring of resources [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-16-02970">5</a>]. As the WEF nexus ALF monitors the performance of resource development, it is also essential for assessing performance and progress of sustainable development goals (SDGs) that are directly related to the WEF nexus (goals 2, 3, 6 and 7). The WEF nexus analytical model was used to assess resource utilisation and performance in southern Africa, in the context of achieving the 2030 global agenda of SDGs, that is, how best to build resilient rural communities and enhance sustainable rural livelihoods.
