 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The development of the WEF nexus indicators and composite indices for southern Africa has highlighted the unsustainability of current resource utilisation and management in the region; this is mainly due to the siloed sectoral approach to resource management. Whilst more emphasis on food self-sufficiency may ensure national food security to some extent, there are risks to rural household food security and well-being, and transferring problems to other sectors when there is no balance and coordination in resource development and utilisation among sectors. The WEF nexus analytical livelihoods framework is a catalyst for managing resources and building resilient rural communities in a sustainable manner as it indicates priority areas needing immediate intervention. The numerical relationship among the WEF nexus indicators show an unbalanced resource management, a situation that increases risk and vulnerability. The transboundary distribution of resources in southern Africa favours the management of resources at a regional level; this would contribute to the regionâ€™s developmental targets and to achieving the 2030 Global Agenda on Sustainable Development. The study demonstrates the use and importance of the WEF nexus in providing decision makers with tools to holistically and systematically develop, manage and monitor resource use for sustainable development. We highlight the potential of the WEF nexus as an inclusive, transparent, intergovernmental approach for all stakeholders, supporting SDGs as well as promoting the formulation and use of scientifically enabled policies, monitoring, assessment, and cooperation. The link between the WEF indicators and SDGs indicators is an opportunity for further studies on assessing the performance of related SDGs using the WEF nexus analytical model. The tool is important for climate change adaptation strategies and for creating resilient communities through the coordinated resource management framework presented in the study. The analyses highlighted the gap in data availability at the household level, thus this study focused on regional level analyses. Future studies should focus on the household scale analyses as this will translate to greater impact. Most critically, our WEF nexus approach emphasises the trade-offs and unintended consequences of the current approaches, with direct negative consequences for poor rural households in terms of resource security and well-being, but, at the same time indicating priority areas for intervention.</p>
