To strengthen its agrarian economy, the region intends to increase agricultural production by increasing the irrigated area. Increasing agricultural production is envisaged to result in surplus yields that households of comparative advantage are able to supply regions of less potential, thereby ensuring food security and improving livelihoods. In this regard the region intends to double the irrigated area from 3.5% to 7% by 2025 [

The WEF nexus ALF is adapted from the work done by McMichael et al., (2006), which depicts the pathways by which climate change can affect population health. Several climatic-environmental manifestations of climate change are shown, which altogether portray an increase in complexity of causal processes having environmental consequences and, therefore, the likelihood that health effects will be exacerbated or protracted. In order to elicit the linkages among the causes and the effects of climate, we converted the McMichael’s schematic summary (see

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first part of the study relates to the impacts of climate change on WEF resources and proposes mitigation strategies through the WEF nexus ALF. We identify that, as people in rural areas generally depend on natural systems for their livelihoods, availability and accessibility to land and other natural resources are crucial for their survival. Then, secondly, the study demonstrates how the WEF nexus can be used as a decision support tool in addressing the pertinent issues, mainly transforming livelihoods and sustaining the environment. The premise is that resilience and adaptation must be decoupled from extensive use and depletion of natural resources and environmental damage, and promote sustainable means of production, investment, and consumption, along with enhanced resource efficiency and the reduction of waste, food losses, and pollution [
   <a rid="B45-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-16-02970">45</a>]. Adaptation through the WEF nexus ensures that vulnerable and marginalised populations are empowered through the removal of barriers that hinder balanced resource sharing and inclusive economic development [

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f002">Figure 2</a>) are addressed by strengthening resilience at the local and community level. Thus, the first and second parts of the methodological framework (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f002">Figure 2</a>) emphasise both mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation is tackling the root cause of climate change to alleviate further damage to the atmosphere, and adaptation is dealing with the impact of climate change, such as extreme weather events and depletion of resources [

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f002">Figure 2</a>), and applies the WEF nexus analytical livelihoods framework to understand the causes and effects on human well-being, and to develop guidelines to alleviate health effects brought about by climate change. Environmental sustainability and human well-being are linked to the conservation of nature and natural resources and the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems services and the WEF nexus plays an important role of guiding decision making [

Thus, sustainable livelihoods transformation cannot be separated from climate change adaptation and the WEF nexus based research, as the approach is a “fitting tool” in transforming livelihoods, providing evidence to policy and decision-making in adaptation strategies.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02970-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02970-f002">Figure 2</a> explains the WEF nexus analytical livelihoods framework and provides an understanding of the complex interrelationships among resources for livelihoods transformation, human health and well-being. The CLD provides a visual representation of multiple, interdependent effects of climate change and human actions on WEF resources. The Vensim PLE x32 software (
   <span xlink:href="www.ventanasystems.com" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ventanasystems.com</span>) was used to develop the CLD for the WEF analytical livelihoods framework. The CLD is a qualitative representation of the interlinkages between resources utilisation and management and their effects on livelihoods in the advent of climate variability and change. The arrows show the influence of one variable on another (a change in the cause leads to a change in the effect). The polarity of the arrows indicates the factual relationship between any two nodes, which illustrate the causal link. The interplay between balancing and reinforcing loops gives rise to a realistic multi-loop system that explains the behaviour of the WEF model and the nexus impact over time. The reinforcing loop, R1, indicates the pathway through which mitigation measures lead to adaptation, with reduced anthropogenic GHG emissions in an amplified manner between resource insecurities and climate change. R1 is the ultimate loop that the WEF nexus research has to achieve. One of the means to achieve this aim is through the ability to assess the nexus interactions (evidence-based interventions) with amplifying effects for adaptation as in R2, which is the aim of this study. Other vicious bottlenecks in the system include R3 (the vicious reinforcing interrelationship between water, energy, and food insecurities), R4 (environmental behavioural patterns that contribute to climate change) and R5 (heightened disease transmissibility pathways).

A range between one and nine represents an important relationship, and a range between 1/3 and 1/9 represents an insignificant relationship. A rating of nine indicates that in relation to the column factor, the row factor is nine times more important. Conversely, a rating of 1/9 indicates that relative to the column indicator, the row indicator is 1/9 less important. In cases where the column and row indicators are equally important, they have a rating of one.
