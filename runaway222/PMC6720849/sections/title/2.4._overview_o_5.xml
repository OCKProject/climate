 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The importance of the WEF nexus is to simplify human understanding of the complex relationships among the interlinked resources of water, energy, and food, explain those relationships through quantitative evidence, and ensure the security of the three resources [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02970">14</a>]. Factors that measure resource security include availability, accessibility, self-sufficiency, and productivity, from which we defined related indicators to measure the performance of the WEF resources [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02970">14</a>,
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-16-02970">49</a>]. 
  <a rid="ijerph-16-02970-t002" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02970-t002">Table 2</a> lists the defined indicators for the WEF resources, also providing an overview of the current status of the WEF nexus related indicators for southern Africa [
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-16-02970">50</a>]. The selection of the indicators is based on the criteria used by Nhamo et al. [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02970">14</a>] in which they considered the factors that determine resource security.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A multi-criteria decision method (MCDM) was used to integrate and establish numerical relationships among the WEF nexus indicators and calculate indices, applying the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which is an MCDM method [
  <a rid="B51-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-16-02970">51</a>,
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-16-02970">52</a>]. The AHP, developed by Saaty [
  <a rid="B53-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-ijerph-16-02970">53</a>], is a theory of measurement for deriving ratio scales from both discrete and continuous paired comparisons to set priorities and make the best decisions. The AHP comparison matrix is determined by comparing two indicators at a time using Saatyâ€™s scale, which ranges between 1/9 and nine [
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-16-02970">52</a>]. A range between one and nine represents an important relationship, and a range between 1/3 and 1/9 represents an insignificant relationship. A rating of nine indicates that in relation to the column factor, the row factor is nine times more important. Conversely, a rating of 1/9 indicates that relative to the column indicator, the row indicator is 1/9 less important. In cases where the column and row indicators are equally important, they have a rating of one. In the case of the WEF nexus, the index of an indicator in relation to others is determined by the impact of that particular indicator on its overall rating.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With help of expert advice, the indicator status given in 
  <a rid="ijerph-16-02970-t002" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02970-t002">Table 2</a> provides the basis to establish numerical relationships among the indicators through a pairwise comparison matrix (PCM) as proposed by Nhamo et al. [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02970">14</a>]. Using the AHP, the pairwise comparison matrix (PCM) is normalised to establish the composite indices for each indicator and an integrated WEF nexus index [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02970">14</a>]. The indicator values shown in 
  <a rid="ijerph-16-02970-t002" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02970-t002">Table 2</a> are not disaggregated between rural and urban areas, as they represent the whole of the southern Africa region. However, it is common knowledge that rural areas have always lagged behind urban areas, in as far as economic development, provision of basic services, and access to resources is concerned [
  <a rid="B54-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-16-02970">54</a>]. Therefore, if the performance of resources used were classified as unsustainable, it would mean a worse situation in rural areas.
