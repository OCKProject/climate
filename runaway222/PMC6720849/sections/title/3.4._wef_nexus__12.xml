  <a rid="ijerph-16-02970-t004" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02970-t004">Table 4</a> also provides the WEF nexus integrated index which is 0.145, a low index which reveals the unsustainability in performance of resource utilisation and management in the region, according to the classification by Nhamo et al. [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02970" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02970">14</a>]. The CR for the pairwise matrix is 0.08, which is within the acceptable range. The weighted average of all the indices is the composite WEF nexus integrated index.
