 <p id="p0040" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data presented is based on qualitative and quantitative research. Qualitative data were obtained based on literature studies to obtain awareness variables, as seen in 
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>. While quantitative data were obtained by distributing questionnaires to respondents. The survey method is considered as the right data collection method because it enables standardized data collection that allows researchers to produce information answering important variable questions that influence the awareness and success in implementing IT Governance. Respondents in the Indonesian country were selected for this study. To test the data, researchers propose a model where Risk Management, IT Resources, Budget, Stakeholder Involvement, Policy, Business Strategy, Organization, Commitment, Politics, Competence, Communication are outcome variables. The model proposed by the researcher must be tested for validity from the proposed model and to determine whether the data, which has been collected in the field, matches the proposed conceptual model. The quality of the measurement model is determined based on its validity and reliability

  <p id="p0050" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main data source (questionnaire) is used to collect data from respondents in the territory of Indonesia. The Microsoft Excel spreadsheet worksheet is used to enter all data and draw conclusions from the data obtained. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and Smart PLS software for structural equation modeling techniques (SEM) is used to record data and carry out the statistical analysis. In addition, Smart PLS supports exploratory and confirmation research; normal multivariate and good for small sample sizes.</p>

  <p id="p0060" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data presented in this article have implications for academics, for example, awareness directly influences the success of implementing IT governance in a positive and significant way as indicated by the path coefficient of (β = 0.515).</p>
  <p id="p0065" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore, for academics in the field of IT Governance, this discovery can enhance their understanding of the relationship between awareness and success of IT Governance. This is a useful contribution to be used as literature. On the practitioner's side, the board of directors and executive managers can benefit from the implications of this discovery. For example, there is a strong relationship between awareness and risk management (β = 0.560), executive managers must pay attention to risk management related to the use of methodology, monitoring of IT resources and evaluating weaknesses and strengths 
   <a rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib5">[5]</a>, 
   <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">[6]</a>. In addition, this data article offers implications for policymakers (board of directors) for the implementation of IT governance in order to improve company performance by paying attention to variables in consciousness. Thus, findings obtained from this research data collection can be used to generate new policies and assist in revising existing policies.
