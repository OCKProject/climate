    "This article presents raw inferential statistical data that determine the influence of awareness on the successful implementation of IT Governance. Data were collected from respondents in all regions of Indonesia. Quantitative research methods are used to analyze data. The structured questionnaire was distributed to respondents in all regions of Indonesia who understood the field of IT Governance whose reliability and validity were confirmed. Structural equation modeling (SEM) using Smart PLS software, version 3, is used to present data. SEM path analysis shows an estimate of the relationship of the main constructs in the data. The results obtained from this dataset show a positive relationship between Risk Management, IT Resources, Budget, Stakeholder Involvement, Policy, Business Strategy, Organization, Commitment, Competence, Communication to awareness and consciousness also has a significant influence on the success of IT Governance implementation. However, politics has proven to have a negative and insignificant influence on the awareness and success of implementing IT Governance."
