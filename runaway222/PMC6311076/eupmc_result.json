    "BACKGROUND:In Norway, a disproportionately high number of children receiving Child Welfare Services (CWS) struggle academically and drop out of school. Academic attainment is one of the strongest protective factors against societal marginalization. The present study is part of a knowledge translation project in collaboration with local CWS with the aim to develop, implement, and evaluate Enhanced Academic Support (EAS) for primary school children in CWS. METHODS/DESIGN:The study is a mixed-methods hybrid type 2 randomized, controlled pragmatic trial. The participants are approximately 120 children whose families receive support measures from three child welfare agencies in and around Oslo, Norway, and practitioners from these agencies. Families are randomly assigned to either the EAS condition or \"business as usual\" support. Primary outcomes are math and reading skills, parental involvement in school, and intervention fidelity. Questionnaires and academic tests are administered at baseline, post-intervention (after 6 months), and at follow-up (after 12 months). Implementation drivers are assessed before and after the trial period, and intervention fidelity is monitored during the trial through checklists and structured telephone interviews. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups are conducted after the trial. DISCUSSION:This hybrid study has two implications. (1) The effects of providing EAS to children in child welfare will be investigated. The study also explores how each core component of the intervention and the use of specific adaptations, implementation drivers, and other important child-level covariates moderate the overall effects. The results can provide valuable knowledge about how to deliver precise and effective academic support to increase academic skills and prevent dropout. In turn, this can promote academic completion and well-being, outcomes that are beneficial for both children and society at large. (2) The study also evaluates the feasibility of applying an Integrated Knowledge Translation model designed to develop, implement, and evaluate research-supported practice in health, care, and welfare services in less time than is usually the case. If deemed successful, this model will provide an efficient collaborative approach to translate the best available evidence into effective evidence-based practice, applicable in effectiveness research and quality improvement efforts.
