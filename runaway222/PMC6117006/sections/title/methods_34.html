      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test for voluntary response sampling bias, we (i) replicated the regression analysis,
         eliminating those sessions with low rates (&lt;30%) of usable cases to assess whether
         inclusion of sessions with low response rates influenced results; (ii) included the
         session-level response rate as a regressor in the analysis to test whether variation
         in response rate had a statistically significant effect on the gains in each construct;
         (iii) compared pre-survey values of constructs and gains in constructs for sessions
         with high response rates to those with low response rates to test whether biases associated
         with response rates influenced observed gains; and (iv) compared pre-survey construct
         values and sociodemographic characteristics for those who completed the post-survey
         to those who did not to test whether there were differences among those who only provided
         pre-surveys and those who provided both pre- and post-surveys.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second potential source of bias is self-selection of participants, as those choosing
         to participate may not be representative of broader populations. Forty-four percent
         of the sample participated in 
         <span>World Climate</span> because it was a required component of a course or program unrelated to climate change,
         ruling out selection bias for these participants. The rest (56%) had chosen to participate
         in a 
         <span>World Climate</span> session that was open to the public or had enrolled in a course in climate change
         or sustainability that included 
         <span>World Climate</span> (
         <a>Table 1</a>). These participants might have been more motivated to learn about climate change
         or to favor climate action than the population at large. To test for self-selection
         bias we replicated our analysis for the participants for whom 
         <span>World Climate</span> was a required component of their educational program.
