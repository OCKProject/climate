      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a pre-/post-survey design to assess the impact of 
         <span>World Climate</span>. To reduce the likelihood that external events influenced participants’ responses,
         the pre- and post-surveys were administered within a short time period (a few minutes
         to several days) before and after each session. The surveys are provided in the Supporting
         Information (
         <a>S2 Appendix</a>) and were approved by the institutional review boards of UMass Lowell and MIT (Protocols
         16-049-ROO-XPD and 1702833248, respectively). We obtained informed consent through
         both verbal and written statements. Participants were informed that survey completion
         was voluntary, the individual results confidential, and, if 
         <span>World Climate</span> was part of an academic course or program, that their responses had no influence
         on their academic standing (
         <a>S2 Appendix</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pre- and post-surveys include items designed to assess participants’ knowledge
         about climate change, their affective responses to it, their intent to learn and do
         more to address it, as well as questions on participants’ sociodemographic characteristics.
         The surveys include items used in prior work to assess knowledge of climate science
         and beliefs about the reality and causes of climate change [
         <a>40</a>]. Other knowledge-related items elicited participants’ beliefs about the impacts
         of climate change, and their understanding of the dynamics of CO
         <sub>2</sub> accumulation in the atmosphere, which prior research [
         <a>17</a>, 
         <a>33</a>, 
         <a>41</a>] shows to be widely misunderstood. We used semantic differential scales [
         <a>42</a>] to assess participants’ affective response to climate change by asking them to locate
         how they feel about climate change on scales spanning emotional poles, for example,
         hopeless to hopeful, discouraged to empowered, and indifferent to engaged. Participants’
         perceived socioeconomic status was assessed using language adapted from Goodman et
         al. [
         <a>43</a>, 
         <a>44</a>]. The post-survey included additional questions eliciting participants’ reactions
         to 
         <span>World Climate</span>, including whether it influenced their motivation to address climate change or their
         desire to learn more about climate science, technological solutions, economics, and
         policy options. The post-survey also included optional open-ended questions where
         participants could comment on how the simulation affected their understanding of climate
         change, their affective responses and motivation to address it. All survey questions
         were tested by soliciting feedback from five educators using 
         <span>World Climate</span>, two educational psychologists, and ten undergraduate students who had not participated
         in the simulation.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Respondents were included in the analysis if they reported no previous experience
         with 
         <span>World Climate</span>, answered ≥80% of the pre- and post-survey questions analyzed, and provided pre-
         and post-surveys that could be matched to each other. Across the 2,042 participants
         in our sample, 75% responded to the pre-survey (with a range of 24–100% per session),
         62% responded to the post-survey (range: 24–100%) and 42% of all participants met
         all of the criteria used to define ‘usable cases’ (range: 12–92%; 
         <a>Table 2</a>). The full dataset is available from the Dryad Digital Repository at
