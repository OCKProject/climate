      <div>Comparison of pre- and post-survey means and paired t-tests for constructs reflecting
         climate change affect (‘Urgency,’ and ‘Hope’), knowledge (‘Impacts,’ ‘Causes’, ‘Stock-flow
         task’), and intent to take action (‘Intent’) among participants who were required
         to participate in 
         <span>World Climate</span> as part of a program unrelated to climate change, environment or sustainability,
         ruling out self-selection bias.
