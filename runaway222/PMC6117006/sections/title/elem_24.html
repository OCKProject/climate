      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The information deficit model of science communication [
         <a>9</a>] suggests that gains in knowledge lead to behavior change, as represented in 
         <a>Fig 4</a> by the hypothesized links from 
         <span>Knowledge</span> to 
         <span>Intent to Act</span> and from 
         <span>Knowledge</span> to 
         <span>Desire to Learn</span>. Yet, research demonstrates the importance of affect in risk perception and action
         [
         <a>38</a>, 
         <a>39</a>]. Worry, interest, and hope were strongly associated with support for climate change
         policy in a nationally representative survey in the U.S. [
         <a>39</a>]. Similarly, Leiserowitz et al. [
         <a>38</a>] found affect to be a strong predictor of climate change risk perception. Under the
         information deficit model, gains in knowledge about climate change should be positively
         associated with gains in people’s desire to learn more about climate change and intent
         to take action. In contrast, under an affect-mediated model of learning, gains in
         the emotions people experience would be associated with gain in their desire to learn
         more and intent to act. Here we ask how the gains in each construct identified in
         the EFA are associated with gains in the others, and with a wide range of session-
         and participant-level attributes such as where the session was held and participant
         socio-demographic characteristics.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use multiple linear regression to assess associations among the constructs in the
            hypothesized learning model (
            <a>Fig 4</a>). The dependent variables are the gains, 
            <span>G</span>, between the pre- and post-surveys for each of the constructs, 
            <span>C</span>, identified through EFA, 
            <span>G</span> = 
            <span>C
               <sub>Post</sub></span> − 
            <span>C
               <sub>Pre</sub></span>. For each focal construct, (e.g., the gain in 
            <span>Intent</span>), the independent variables are the gains in the other constructs (e.g., gains in
            knowledge of climate change 
            <span>Impacts</span>, 
            <span>Urgency</span> and 
            <span>Hope</span>). We include a variety of controls, including the pre-survey value of the constructs
            to test for ceiling effects that might arise in cases with high pre-survey values,
            and fixed effects to control for potential influence of participant or session characteristics.
            Controls for participants’ sociodemographic characteristics include gender, age, education,
            parents’ education, and perceived socioeconomic status. Session-level controls include
            whether the session was held in a developed or developing country, in a secondary
            or post-secondary educational setting, and was run by an experienced facilitator or
            someone with no or minimal formal training in 
            <span>World Climate</span> (see 
            <a>Table 1</a>, 
            <a>S1</a> and 
            <a>S2</a> Tables). Pearson’s correlation coefficients across session- and participant-level
            variables are provided in 
            <a>S3 Table</a>. For all regressions, tests for collinearity and outliers included ensuring that
            all tolerance statistics were &gt; 0.2, variance inflation factors (VIF) were &lt; 10, and
            Cook’s distance values were &lt;4/N.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regression analysis revealed bidirectional associations between climate change knowledge
            and affect (
            <a>Fig 6</a>). A feedback is evident from gains in participants’ knowledge of climate change 
            <span>Impacts</span> to their feeling of 
            <span>Urgency</span> (
            <span>ß</span> = 0.28, 
            <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9) and from gains in 
            <span>Urgency</span> back to gains in 
            <span>Impacts</span> (
            <span>ß</span> = 0.26, 
            <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9). In contrast, learning more about the causes of climate change and the dynamics
            of CO
            <sub>2</sub> accumulation has no statistically significant association with participant feelings
            about the urgency of addressing climate change. Further, gains in participants’ feelings
            of 
            <span>Hope</span> have no association with gains in climate change knowledge and vice-versa. The regression
            results also show evidence for the impact of prior beliefs and affect. As expected,
            there are ceiling effects: participants with higher pre-survey values of each construct
            show smaller gains. More interesting, higher pre-survey levels of 
            <span>Urgency</span> are associated with greater gains in knowledge of climate change after the simulation:
            the more worried people are before 
            <span>World Climate</span>, the more they learn about the 
            <span>Impacts</span> of climate change (
            <span>ß</span> = 0.26, 
            <span>p</span> &lt; 1E-9). The results support prior work on the synergies between analytic and affective
            processing of information about climate change [
            <a>36</a>, 
            <a>37</a>, 
            <a>52</a>]. When the two processing systems are aligned, affective engagement motivates sustained
            commitment to solving difficult problems [
            <a>13</a>].

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the information deficit model, our results support an affect-mediated
            model of learning: gains in the key constructs 
            <span>Intent</span> and 
            <span>Desire to Learn More</span> are not statistically significantly associated with climate change knowledge (
            <span>Cause</span>, 
            <span>Impact</span>, 
            <span>Stock-Flow Understanding</span>) (
            <a>S1</a> and 
            <a>S2</a> Tables; 
            <a>Fig 6</a>). Instead, gains in participant affect are linked to gains in 
            <span>Intent</span> to act and 
            <span>Desire to Learn More</span>. Specifically, gains in both 
            <span>Urgency</span> and 
            <span>Hope</span> are linked to gains in both 
            <span>Desire to Learn More</span> (
            <span>ß</span> = 0.28, 
            <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9; and 
            <span>ß</span> = 0.17, 
            <span>p</span> = 1E-6 for 
            <span>Urgency</span> and 
            <span>Hope</span>, respectively) and 
            <span>Intent</span> (
            <span>ß</span> = 0.34, 
            <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9; and 
            <span>ß</span> = 0.19, 
            <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9 for 
            <span>Urgency</span> and 
            <span>Hope</span>, respectively) (
            <a>Fig 6</a>, 
            <a>S1</a> and 
            <a>S2</a> Tables). Similarly, higher pre-survey levels of 
            <span>Urgency</span> are associated with larger gains in 
            <span>Desire to Learn More</span> (
            <span>ß</span> = 0.36, 
            <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9) and 
            <span>Intent</span> (
            <span>ß</span> = 0.30, 
            <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9). These results align with prior research: for example, anger is associated
            with high levels of arousal [
            <a>53</a>], while moral outrage has been identified as a ‘guardian of justice’ because it prompts
            social activism [
            <a>54</a>]. 
            <span>Urgency</span> also includes participants’ degree of worry and feelings about the importance of
            climate change to them personally, both of which are linked to perceptions of risk,
            another driver of climate action [
            <a>55</a>].
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In almost all cases, sociodemographic factors, session settings, and facilitator training
            are not associated with gains in knowledge, affect, or intent, suggesting the simulation’s
            versatility (
            <a>S1</a> and 
            <a>S2</a> Tables). The exceptions were that gains in 
            <span>Intent</span> were larger for participants who were older and gains in 
            <span>Hope</span> were larger in sessions facilitated by the core team rather than self-taught facilitators.
            In other cases, the few fixed effects that attained statistical significance were
            inconsistent across models (e.g., the effect of age on gains in 
            <span>Hope</span> was statistically significant only when it was considered alone, but not when multiple
            fixed effects were included, Table D in 
            <a>S1 Table</a>).
