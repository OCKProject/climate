 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The information deficit model of science communication [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref009">9</a>] suggests that gains in knowledge lead to behavior change, as represented in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202877.g004" href="#pone.0202877.g004">Fig 4</a> by the hypothesized links from 
  <span class="italic">Knowledge</span> to 
  <span class="italic">Intent to Act</span> and from 
  <span class="italic">Knowledge</span> to 
  <span class="italic">Desire to Learn</span>. Yet, research demonstrates the importance of affect in risk perception and action [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref038">38</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref039">39</a>]. Worry, interest, and hope were strongly associated with support for climate change policy in a nationally representative survey in the U.S. [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref039">39</a>]. Similarly, Leiserowitz et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref038">38</a>] found affect to be a strong predictor of climate change risk perception. Under the information deficit model, gains in knowledge about climate change should be positively associated with gains in people’s desire to learn more about climate change and intent to take action. In contrast, under an affect-mediated model of learning, gains in the emotions people experience would be associated with gain in their desire to learn more and intent to act. Here we ask how the gains in each construct identified in the EFA are associated with gains in the others, and with a wide range of session- and participant-level attributes such as where the session was held and participant socio-demographic characteristics.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use multiple linear regression to assess associations among the constructs in the hypothesized learning model (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202877.g004" href="#pone.0202877.g004">Fig 4</a>). The dependent variables are the gains, 
   <span class="italic">G</span>, between the pre- and post-surveys for each of the constructs, 
   <span class="italic">C</span>, identified through EFA, 
   <span class="italic">G</span> =

    <sub>Post</sub>
   </span> − 
   <span class="italic">C
    <sub>Pre</sub>
   </span>. For each focal construct, (e.g., the gain in 
   <span class="italic">Intent</span>), the independent variables are the gains in the other constructs (e.g., gains in knowledge of climate change 
   <span class="italic">Impacts</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Urgency</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Hope</span>). We include a variety of controls, including the pre-survey value of the constructs to test for ceiling effects that might arise in cases with high pre-survey values, and fixed effects to control for potential influence of participant or session characteristics. Controls for participants’ sociodemographic characteristics include gender, age, education, parents’ education, and perceived socioeconomic status. Session-level controls include whether the session was held in a developed or developing country, in a secondary or post-secondary educational setting, and was run by an experienced facilitator or someone with no or minimal formal training in 
   <span class="italic">World Climate</span> (see

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regression analysis revealed bidirectional associations between climate change knowledge and affect (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202877.g006" href="#pone.0202877.g006">Fig 6</a>). A feedback is evident from gains in participants’ knowledge of climate change

   <span class="italic">Urgency</span> (
   <span class="italic">ß</span> = 0.28,

   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt;1E-9). In contrast, learning more about the causes of climate change and the dynamics of CO
   <sub>2</sub> accumulation has no statistically significant association with participant feelings about the urgency of addressing climate change. Further, gains in participants’ feelings of 
   <span class="italic">Hope</span> have no association with gains in climate change knowledge and vice-versa. The regression results also show evidence for the impact of prior beliefs and affect. As expected, there are ceiling effects: participants with higher pre-survey values of each construct show smaller gains. More interesting, higher pre-survey levels of 
   <span class="italic">Urgency</span> are associated with greater gains in knowledge of climate change after the simulation: the more worried people are before 
   <span class="italic">World Climate</span>, the more they learn about the

   <span class="italic">ß</span> = 0.26,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the information deficit model, our results support an affect-mediated model of learning: gains in the key constructs

   <span class="italic">Intent</span> to act and 
   <span class="italic">Desire to Learn More</span>. Specifically, gains in both 
   <span class="italic">Urgency</span> and

   <span class="italic">Desire to Learn More</span> (
   <span class="italic">ß</span> = 0.36,

   <span class="italic">ß</span> = 0.30, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt;1E-9). These results align with prior research: for example, anger is associated with high levels of arousal [
   <a rid="pone.0202877.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref053">53</a>], while moral outrage has been identified as a ‘guardian of justice’ because it prompts social activism [

   <span class="italic">Urgency</span> also includes participants’ degree of worry and feelings about the importance of climate change to them personally, both of which are linked to perceptions of risk, another driver of climate action [
