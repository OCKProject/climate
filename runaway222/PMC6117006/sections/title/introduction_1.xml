 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scientific evidence supporting an urgent need to mitigate anthropogenic climate change is clear [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref001">1</a>]. Yet, social science data are also clear: around the world, public understanding and concern over climate change are not commensurate with the risks we face [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref002">2</a>]. Although public opinion favoring action to mitigate climate change is increasing, it is not strong enough to generate the individual and governmental actions necessary to meet international climate goals [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref003">3</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref004">4</a>]. The decision by the US to withdraw from the Paris accord [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref005">5</a>] and shifts in US federal policy towards production of fossil fuels [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref006">6</a>] further threaten global efforts to mitigate climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref007">7</a>]. Communication tools that are both scientifically rigorous and that motivate informed action on climate change are urgently needed [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref008">8</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many efforts to communicate the risks of climate change are grounded, explicitly or implicitly, in the information deficit theory of risk communication, which posits that providing people with more and better information about the reality, causes, and risks of climate change should motivate them to take appropriate action [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref009">9</a>]. However, communication strategies based on the deficit model have failed to close the gap between scientific and public understanding for climate change and many other settings, (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref010">10</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref015">15</a>]). Three factors play a role: First, humans can only process the dynamic interactions of two to three variables at a time [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref016">16</a>]–a limitation clearly exceeded by the complexity of the climate system. While climate dynamics are strongly conditioned by feedbacks, accumulations, nonlinearities, and time delays, even highly educated adults are unable to infer the behavior of even the simplest dynamic systems [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref017">17</a>]. Second, affective responses—the type and intensity of emotions people experience—play an important role in risk perception and decision making. Typical presentations on the causes and risks of climate change often fail to elicit affective responses or motivate action to combat it [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref018">18</a>]. Third, social forces both enable and constrain individual action, especially in collective action settings such as climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref019">19</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref020">20</a>]. Individuals who share ties with members of social groups that dismiss climate change are also likely to dismiss it [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref020">20</a>], while the belief that other similar people take action increases behaviors to combat climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref019">19</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effective risk communication enables people to learn for themselves through experience and experimentation rather than being told by experts [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref009">9</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref021">21</a>]. Yet, for climate change and many other important issues, controlled experiments are impossible, unethical or prohibitively expensive. Long delays in the response of the climate to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions means experience will come too late. In such settings, simulation becomes the main—perhaps the only—way we can discover for ourselves how complex systems work and what the impact of different policies might be, thus integrating science into decision making. Effective simulation experiences should not only be rigorously grounded in the best available science but also engage the often messy, imperfectly rational, socially conditioned emotions and behavior of participants. For these reasons, simulations that integrate rigorous models of physical systems with role-plays that represent the social dynamics of decision-makers are now common in aviation, power plant operations, medicine, the military, and other high-risk settings [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref022">22</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref025">25</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we assess the impact of one such simulation, 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span>, in which participants take on the roles of UNFCCC negotiators and use the C-ROADS interactive computer model to get immediate feedback on the expected climate impacts of their decisions based on current scientific understanding [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref026">26</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref027">27</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> is widely used around the world—more than 42,000 people in 77 countries participated in it between August 2015 and May 2018 and it is designated as an official resource for schools in France [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref028">28</a>], Germany (Beule, personal communication) and South Korea [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref029">29</a>]—indicating the importance of an assessment of its impact. We explore whether participating in 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> is associated with gains in knowledge of climate science, affective responses to climate change, desire to learn more, and intent to mitigate climate change in the real world. We also examine whether increased desire to learn and act on climate change are associated with gains in knowledge or with gains in affect.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The paper is organized as follows: we first describe the 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> role-play, the C-ROADS climate policy simulation model, and the learning model we seek to test. We then describe the sample of 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> sessions we analyze and the pre- and post-simulation survey design. We use exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to develop constructs representing latent variables measured by the surveys, finding constructs relating to climate change knowledge, affect, desire to learn more about climate change, and intent to take action to combat it. We analyze the gains in these constructs by examining the differences in their values from the pre- to post-simulation survey and then analyze associations among gains in constructs using regression analyses. These analyses revealed that gains in affect, but not knowledge, are linked to a desire to learn and do more to address climate change. We describe the effect of political ideology on 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> outcomes, finding that participants who oppose government regulation of free markets gained at least as much as those who support regulation. We turn next to sensitivity analysis to examine threats to external validity potentially arising from (i) potential selection bias because individuals in some of the sample sessions chose to participate while others participated as part of a required curriculum unrelated to climate change, and (ii) potential bias associated with voluntary response sampling. We close with general discussion, including limitations and extensions.
