      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regression analysis revealed bidirectional associations between climate change knowledge
         and affect (
         <a>Fig 6</a>). A feedback is evident from gains in participants’ knowledge of climate change 
         <span>Impacts</span> to their feeling of 
         <span>Urgency</span> (
         <span>ß</span> = 0.28, 
         <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9) and from gains in 
         <span>Urgency</span> back to gains in 
         <span>Impacts</span> (
         <span>ß</span> = 0.26, 
         <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9). In contrast, learning more about the causes of climate change and the dynamics
         of CO
         <sub>2</sub> accumulation has no statistically significant association with participant feelings
         about the urgency of addressing climate change. Further, gains in participants’ feelings
         of 
         <span>Hope</span> have no association with gains in climate change knowledge and vice-versa. The regression
         results also show evidence for the impact of prior beliefs and affect. As expected,
         there are ceiling effects: participants with higher pre-survey values of each construct
         show smaller gains. More interesting, higher pre-survey levels of 
         <span>Urgency</span> are associated with greater gains in knowledge of climate change after the simulation:
         the more worried people are before 
         <span>World Climate</span>, the more they learn about the 
         <span>Impacts</span> of climate change (
         <span>ß</span> = 0.26, 
         <span>p</span> &lt; 1E-9). The results support prior work on the synergies between analytic and affective
         processing of information about climate change [
         <a>36</a>, 
         <a>37</a>, 
         <a>52</a>]. When the two processing systems are aligned, affective engagement motivates sustained
         commitment to solving difficult problems [
         <a>13</a>].

            <p>Results are for Model 1 (no participant- or session-level fixed effects; values for
               Models 2–4 with different sets of controls are similar). Lines with arrows depict
               statistically significant relationships between independent and dependent variables,
               with standardized beta coefficients for each relationship shown. See 
               <a>S1 Table</a> for detailed regression results. *** 
               <span>p</span> &lt; 1E-9 denotes statistical significance at α &lt; 0.001 after Bonferroni correction.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the information deficit model, our results support an affect-mediated
         model of learning: gains in the key constructs 
         <span>Intent</span> and 
         <span>Desire to Learn More</span> are not statistically significantly associated with climate change knowledge (
         <span>Cause</span>, 
         <span>Impact</span>, 
         <span>Stock-Flow Understanding</span>) (
         <a>S1</a> and 
         <a>S2</a> Tables; 
         <a>Fig 6</a>). Instead, gains in participant affect are linked to gains in 
         <span>Intent</span> to act and 
         <span>Desire to Learn More</span>. Specifically, gains in both 
         <span>Urgency</span> and 
         <span>Hope</span> are linked to gains in both 
         <span>Desire to Learn More</span> (
         <span>ß</span> = 0.28, 
         <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9; and 
         <span>ß</span> = 0.17, 
         <span>p</span> = 1E-6 for 
         <span>Urgency</span> and 
         <span>Hope</span>, respectively) and 
         <span>Intent</span> (
         <span>ß</span> = 0.34, 
         <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9; and 
         <span>ß</span> = 0.19, 
         <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9 for 
         <span>Urgency</span> and 
         <span>Hope</span>, respectively) (
         <a>Fig 6</a>, 
         <a>S1</a> and 
         <a>S2</a> Tables). Similarly, higher pre-survey levels of 
         <span>Urgency</span> are associated with larger gains in 
         <span>Desire to Learn More</span> (
         <span>ß</span> = 0.36, 
         <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9) and 
         <span>Intent</span> (
         <span>ß</span> = 0.30, 
         <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9). These results align with prior research: for example, anger is associated
         with high levels of arousal [
         <a>53</a>], while moral outrage has been identified as a ‘guardian of justice’ because it prompts
         social activism [
         <a>54</a>]. 
         <span>Urgency</span> also includes participants’ degree of worry and feelings about the importance of
         climate change to them personally, both of which are linked to perceptions of risk,
         another driver of climate action [
         <a>55</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In almost all cases, sociodemographic factors, session settings, and facilitator training
         are not associated with gains in knowledge, affect, or intent, suggesting the simulation’s
         versatility (
         <a>S1</a> and 
         <a>S2</a> Tables). The exceptions were that gains in 
         <span>Intent</span> were larger for participants who were older and gains in 
         <span>Hope</span> were larger in sessions facilitated by the core team rather than self-taught facilitators.
         In other cases, the few fixed effects that attained statistical significance were
         inconsistent across models (e.g., the effect of age on gains in 
         <span>Hope</span> was statistically significant only when it was considered alone, but not when multiple
         fixed effects were included, Table D in 
         <a>S1 Table</a>).
