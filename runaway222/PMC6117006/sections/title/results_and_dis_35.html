      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regression analyses excluding sessions with low survey response rates (&lt;30%) yielded
         results similar to those from the full sample (
         <a>S1</a> and 
         <a>S2</a> Tables). Comparison of results for sessions with high response rates (&gt;50%) to those
         with low response rates (&lt;50%) also showed no statistically significant differences
         (
         <a>S4 Table</a>). When session-level response rate was included as a regressor, it shows no statistically
         significant effect (
         <a>S1</a> and 
         <a>S2</a> Tables). The results show no evidence that differences in survey response rates explain
         the gains in construct values after participation in 
         <span>World Climate</span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With few exceptions, pre-survey responses for those who completed the post-survey
         reveal no statistically significant differences compared to those who chose not to
         complete the post-survey (
         <a>S5 Table</a>). Among sessions with high response rates (&gt;30%), the only difference is that participants
         who completed both surveys were, on average, younger than those who only provided
         pre-surveys (
         <a>S5 Table</a>). For all sessions, those who completed both surveys show no significant differences
         in pre-survey values for knowledge about climate change causes and CO
         <sub>2</sub> accumulation dynamics, 
         <span>Urgency</span>, and 
         <span>Hope</span>. However, they did have higher levels of education, higher pre-survey knowledge about
         climate change 
         <span>Impacts</span> and 
         <span>Intent</span> to act, and were more likely to have been in a session facilitated by our team and
         held at an institution of higher education (Table B in 
         <a>S5 Table</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results for participants who were required to participate in 
         <span>World Climate</span> as part of a curriculum unrelated to climate change or sustainability were similar
         to those who volunteered to participate, with statistically significant gains in all
         constructs (
         <a>S6 Table</a>). Overall, the gains in knowledge, affect, the desire to learn more and intent to
         take action after participating in 
         <span>World Climate</span> are similar for those who were required to participate in the simulation compared
         to those who chose to participate.
