 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> role-play simulation offers an approach to climate change communication that enables people to learn for themselves through a scientifically grounded and socially engaging experience. Across a diverse set of participants, 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> was associated with statistically significant gains in three areas: (i) knowledge of climate change causes, dynamics and impacts; (ii) affective engagement including greater feelings of urgency and hope; and (iii) a desire to learn more and intent to take action in the real world. The results are robust across diverse geographic, cultural, educational, and sociodemographic conditions, suggesting that 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> is a versatile and effective tool for motivating action informed by science.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results also suggest future work to extend the current study’s findings and address its limitations. First, although our sample includes people from eight nations and a wide range of socio-demographic backgrounds, extending the study to other nations and populations would further explore the robustness of the results. Second, all participants in the sample were asked to complete the pre-survey. We therefore cannot rule out priming effects from the pre-survey; an extension would randomly assign participants to a pre-survey or no pre-survey group. Third, although the risk communication and climate communication research shows that traditional lectures and presentations have little impact [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref009">9</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref014">14</a>], a potential extension would be to compare 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> to traditional modes of communication. Fourth, we present preliminary findings suggesting the potential for 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> to reach across political divides, but this important question deserves more attention, including sampling a broader spectrum of ideological views and measuring ideological orientation more robustly. Lastly, our results measure stated intentions to learn more and to take action. Assessing the extent to which participants follow through is an important issue for future work.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results show the importance of affective engagement in learning. In contrast with the information deficit model of communication [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref009">9</a>], greater climate change knowledge was not directly associated with increases in people’s desire to learn more or intentions to act. Rather, increases in people’s feelings of urgency and hope—the belief that change is possible and that what individuals do can matter—were associated with gains in people’s desire to learn more about climate change science, economics and policy issues, and their intention to take action in the real world, including reducing their personal carbon footprint, talking about climate change with friends and family, and becoming more politically active. Importantly, stronger gains in feelings of urgency were also associated with larger gains in climate knowledge: Those with stronger affective engagement appear to have been motivated to learn more and show higher gains in knowledge of the causes and impacts of climate change, indicating a feedback between affect and knowledge.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concerns that fearful messages about climate change may actually reduce risk perception and action have led to calls to avoid those messages and take a hopeful, solutions-oriented approach to climate change communication [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref058">58</a>]. In contrast, more recent work has indicated that hopeful messages about climate change reduce risk perception, while pessimistic messages increase motivation to mitigate [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref059">59</a>]. Similarly, we find that gains in 
  <span class="italic">Urgency</span>, which includes participants’ degree of fear about climate change, are associated with gains in knowledge, 
  <span class="italic">Intent</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Desire to Learn More</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202877.g004" href="#pone.0202877.g004">Fig 4</a>). We speculate that the positive association may arise because 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> does not present participants with fearful messages that may then provoke resistance and denial, as found in prior work [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref020">20</a>], but rather that participants feel more fearful as they experience for themselves the simulated consequences of their own decisions about global GHG emissions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The social aspect of 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> likely contributes to its impact on participants’ beliefs and emotional engagement around climate change. Social context strongly influences how information about climate change is perceived and used [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref020">20</a>], and the social identity of the messenger influences the efficacy of climate communication, with the most effective messengers being trusted individuals who share social group membership with their audience [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref060">60</a>]. The role of messenger in 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> is fulfilled primarily by the participants themselves. Participants spend most of the simulation time engaged in discussion with one another (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202877.g003" href="#pone.0202877.g003">Fig 3</a>), not passively receiving information presented by an authority, and 92% of the participants in our sample report that 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> is an engaging experience (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202877.g005" href="#pone.0202877.g005">Fig 5</a>). The results support calls to view climate change communication as an interactive dialogue, rather than information transmission from experts to the public [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref009">9</a>]. The results also suggest the potential of the simulation to reach across political divides, at least among participants in the US. Participants in sessions run in the US who oppose government regulation of the free market showed gains in knowledge, affect, desire to learn and intent to take action at least as large as the gains among others, a finding that is particularly important given the polarization of US public opinion about climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref006">6</a>].

  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> is designed to be easily and broadly adopted. All materials are freely available, including facilitation guides and videos, participant materials, facilitator slide decks, and the C-ROADS computer model. More than 42,000 people in 77 countries participated in 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> between August 2015 and May 2018. 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> has been externally reviewed by educators and scientists [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref061">61</a>], found to support the US Next Generation Science Standards [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref062">62</a>], and has been designated as an official resource for schools in Germany (Beule, personal communication), France [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref028">28</a>] and South Korea [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref029">29</a>]. We conclude that simulations like 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> may offer a scalable means to catalyze climate action that is informed by science.
