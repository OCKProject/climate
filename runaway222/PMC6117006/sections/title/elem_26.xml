 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regression analysis revealed bidirectional associations between climate change knowledge and affect (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202877.g006" href="#pone.0202877.g006">Fig 6</a>). A feedback is evident from gains in participants’ knowledge of climate change 
  <span class="italic">Impacts</span> to their feeling of 
  <span class="italic">Urgency</span> (
  <span class="italic">ß</span> = 0.28, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt;1E-9) and from gains in 
  <span class="italic">Urgency</span> back to gains in 
  <span class="italic">Impacts</span> (
  <span class="italic">ß</span> = 0.26, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt;1E-9). In contrast, learning more about the causes of climate change and the dynamics of CO
  <sub>2</sub> accumulation has no statistically significant association with participant feelings about the urgency of addressing climate change. Further, gains in participants’ feelings of 
  <span class="italic">Hope</span> have no association with gains in climate change knowledge and vice-versa. The regression results also show evidence for the impact of prior beliefs and affect. As expected, there are ceiling effects: participants with higher pre-survey values of each construct show smaller gains. More interesting, higher pre-survey levels of 
  <span class="italic">Urgency</span> are associated with greater gains in knowledge of climate change after the simulation: the more worried people are before 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span>, the more they learn about the 
  <span class="italic">Impacts</span> of climate change (
  <span class="italic">ß</span> = 0.26, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 1E-9). The results support prior work on the synergies between analytic and affective processing of information about climate change [

  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref052">52</a>]. When the two processing systems are aligned, affective engagement motivates sustained commitment to solving difficult problems [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the information deficit model, our results support an affect-mediated model of learning: gains in the key constructs 
  <span class="italic">Intent</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Desire to Learn More</span> are not statistically significantly associated with climate change knowledge (
  <span class="italic">Cause</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Impact</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Stock-Flow Understanding</span>) (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s001" href="#pone.0202877.s001">S1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s002" href="#pone.0202877.s002">S2</a> Tables; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202877.g006" href="#pone.0202877.g006">Fig 6</a>). Instead, gains in participant affect are linked to gains in 
  <span class="italic">Intent</span> to act and 
  <span class="italic">Desire to Learn More</span>. Specifically, gains in both 
  <span class="italic">Urgency</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Hope</span> are linked to gains in both 
  <span class="italic">Desire to Learn More</span> (
  <span class="italic">ß</span> = 0.28, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt;1E-9; and 
  <span class="italic">ß</span> = 0.17, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 1E-6 for 
  <span class="italic">Urgency</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Hope</span>, respectively) and 
  <span class="italic">Intent</span> (
  <span class="italic">ß</span> = 0.34, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt;1E-9; and 
  <span class="italic">ß</span> = 0.19, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt;1E-9 for 
  <span class="italic">Urgency</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Hope</span>, respectively) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202877.g006" href="#pone.0202877.g006">Fig 6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s001" href="#pone.0202877.s001">S1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s002" href="#pone.0202877.s002">S2</a> Tables). Similarly, higher pre-survey levels of 
  <span class="italic">Urgency</span> are associated with larger gains in 
  <span class="italic">Desire to Learn More</span> (
  <span class="italic">ß</span> = 0.36, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt;1E-9) and 
  <span class="italic">Intent</span> (
  <span class="italic">ß</span> = 0.30, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt;1E-9). These results align with prior research: for example, anger is associated with high levels of arousal [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref053">53</a>], while moral outrage has been identified as a ‘guardian of justice’ because it prompts social activism [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref054">54</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Urgency</span> also includes participants’ degree of worry and feelings about the importance of climate change to them personally, both of which are linked to perceptions of risk, another driver of climate action [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref055">55</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In almost all cases, sociodemographic factors, session settings, and facilitator training are not associated with gains in knowledge, affect, or intent, suggesting the simulation’s versatility (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s001" href="#pone.0202877.s001">S1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s002" href="#pone.0202877.s002">S2</a> Tables). The exceptions were that gains in 
  <span class="italic">Intent</span> were larger for participants who were older and gains in 
  <span class="italic">Hope</span> were larger in sessions facilitated by the core team rather than self-taught facilitators. In other cases, the few fixed effects that attained statistical significance were inconsistent across models (e.g., the effect of age on gains in 
  <span class="italic">Hope</span> was statistically significant only when it was considered alone, but not when multiple fixed effects were included, Table D in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s001" href="#pone.0202877.s001">S1 Table</a>).
