      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effects of political ideology on climate change beliefs are well established and,
         in the US, free market ideology has been linked to climate change denial [
         <a>12</a>, 
         <a>56</a>, 
         <a>57</a>]. Is 
         <span>World Climate</span> effective among those who oppose regulation and other collective action solutions
         for climate change?

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We test for potential effects of free-market beliefs on learning outcomes from 
            <span>World Climate</span> in three ways. First, we compared the means for each construct (pre- and post-simulation)
            for participants who opposed government regulation to those who favored it, using
            independent samples t-tests. This analysis assesses initial and post-workshop differences
            in the constructs capturing climate change knowledge, affect, and intent to take action.
            Second, we tested whether gains in each construct were statistically significant for
            participants in the US who were somewhat or strongly opposed to government regulation
            of free markets, using paired t-tests. Third, we repeated the regression analyses
            of the gains in each construct described above but adding free market views as a participant-level
            fixed effect. Statistically significant effects of free market views, along with their
            sign and effect size, indicate whether free market views are associated with differences
            in the gains in each construct.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results suggest 
            <span>World Climate</span> is effective with people holding free market worldviews. Forty percent of the US
            participants in the sample opposed government regulation (N = 162 usable cases). Compared
            to participants who favored regulation, those who opposed free market regulation began
            the simulation with a lower belief that climate change is caused by human activities
            (
            <span>Cause</span>, 
            <span>p =</span> 4E-6), a lower level of knowledge about CO
            <sub>2</sub> accumulation dynamics (
            <span>Stock-flow</span>, 
            <span>p =</span> 8E-5), and a lower sense of 
            <span>Urgency</span> (
            <span>p</span> = 4E-6; 
            <a>Table 7</a>). However, these participants experienced statistically significant gains in climate
            change knowledge (
            <span>Causes</span> [ES = 0.38, 
            <span>p</span> = 6E-6], 
            <span>Impacts</span> [ES = 0.34, 
            <span>p</span> = 2E-5], 
            <span>Stock-Flow Understanding</span> [ES = 0.41, 
            <span>p</span> = 2E-6]), 
            <span>Urgency</span> (ES = 0.62, 
            <span>p</span> &lt;1E-9), and 
            <span>Intent</span> (ES = 0.41, 
            <span>p</span> = 7E-7) (
            <a>Table 8</a>). These gains were large enough that those who oppose regulation showed no statistically
            significant differences in post-survey values of these constructs compared to those
            who favored government regulation (
            <a>Table 7</a>). Similarly, regression analyses indicated no association of free market views with
            gains in each construct (
            <a>S1</a> and 
            <a>S2</a> Tables). Large majorities of participants who oppose regulation also reported gains
            in their motivation to combat climate change (81%) and found the simulation to be
            an engaging (92%) and effective (92%) learning experience.
