      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results also revealed ceiling effects: gains in the constructs were not statistically
         significant for participants with high pre-survey values, while those with low pre-survey
         values showed statistically significant gains across all constructs, with moderate
         (
         <span>Impacts</span>: ES = 0.71; 
         <span>Hope</span>: ES = 0.61) to large effect sizes (

         <span>Intent</span>: ES = 0.85) (
         <a>Table 6</a>). By definition, there can be only small gains for participants who were already
         highly knowledgeable, concerned or intending to take action on climate change. Nevertheless,
         the gains in the constructs were statistically significant overall, with the effect
         driven by the large gains among those who were less knowledgeable, less concerned,
         and expressed low intent to act before the workshop. These results suggest the simulation
         was effective for participants who began with relatively little knowledge of or engagement
         with climate change.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The finding that 
         <span>World Climate</span> is associated with substantial and statistically significant gains in understanding
         of accumulation (the “carbon bathtub” [
         <a>21</a>, 
         <a>33</a>]) is particularly interesting. Limiting expected warming to 2 °C requires rapid stabilization
         of atmospheric GHG concentrations, which, in turn, requires emissions to fall until
         they equal net GHG removal from the atmosphere. However, experiments show that people,
         including highly educated adults with substantial STEM training have difficulty understanding
         the dynamics of accumulation, i.e., stocks and flows [
         <a>17</a>] even in everyday contexts such as filling a bathtub or managing a bank account.
         In the climate context, the stock of CO
         <sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere accumulates emissions less the net flux of CO
         <sub>2</sub> removed from the atmosphere by terrestrial and marine sinks. Emissions are currently
         approximately twice as large as net removals [
         <a>51</a>], causing the concentration of CO
         <sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere to rise. Stabilizing atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> requires emissions to fall until emissions and removal are equal. However, experiments
         show that many people erroneously believe that atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> can be stabilized by stabilizing emissions at or above current levels, even though
         emissions would then continually exceed the net removal of CO
         <sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere—a belief that violates mass balance [
         <a>33</a>]. The first round of negotiations in many 
         <span>World Climate</span> sessions yields global emissions that peak around 2030–2040, then fall slightly through
         2100. Many participants, expecting the drop in emissions will cause a drop in atmospheric
         CO
         <sub>2</sub>, note that the simulation shows a continued rise (
         <a>Fig 2B</a>), motivating them to ask why and leading to discussion of the process of accumulation,
         often using the “carbon bathtub” analogy. The large and statistically significant
         gain in participant understanding of these stock-flow dynamics suggests 
         <span>World Climate</span> is effective in building knowledge critical to understanding the conditions required
         to stabilize CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations and global average temperatures.
