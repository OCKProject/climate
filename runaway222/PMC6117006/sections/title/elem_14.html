      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of survey results to test the learning model
         (
         <a>Fig 4</a>), specifically, to test for the presence of constructs capturing knowledge of climate
         change, affective responses to the issue, and participant intent to take action to
         address it. EFA reduces the dimensionality of the dataset by identifying latent variables
         in the surveys, if any, [
         <a>45</a>] and enables us to assess whether they correspond to the constructs in the learning
         model.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We extracted factors separately from pre- and post-survey items, comparing results
            and testing whether the factors identified were consistent across the pre- and post-surveys.
            Separate pre- and post-survey factor extraction is warranted because pre- and post-responses
            from a given participant are not independent from each other. This approach also enabled
            development of constructs from questions that are only included in the post-survey,
            such as questions addressing participants’ desire to learn more about climate change.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used principal axis factoring with orthogonal (varimax) rotation for factor extraction
            and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy to assess the potential
            for extracting distinct, reliable factors. KMO measures &gt; 0.65 were considered to
            indicate that correlations among individual items were appropriate for factor analysis
            [
            <a>46</a>]. We used Bartlett’s test of sphericity to test whether correlations among items
            included in the EFA were significantly different from zero (
            <span>p</span> &lt; 0.05). The validity of extracted factors was tested using several methods, including
            the Kaiser criterion (i.e., eigenvalue &gt; 1; [
            <a>47</a>], a scree test [
            <a>48</a>], and the interpretability of factors given prior theory [
            <a>49</a>]). Individual items were retained in a given factor if (1) factor loading was &gt; 0.45
            for the focal item and &lt; 0.45 for other items [
            <a>49</a>], (2) reliability testing yielded Cronbach’s α &gt; 0.7; (3) deletion of an item did
            not result in an increase of Cronbach’s α; and (4) inclusion of the item was supported
            by separate factor extraction from both pre- and post-survey items.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used factor-based scores as a simple, intuitive approach to combine survey responses
            for all items that fell within a given construct [
            <a>49</a>]. The surveys include questions with responses that ranged from binary responses
            to five-point Likert scales. To weight each survey question equally, we recoded all
            responses to a scale of zero to one, with zero being the lowest possible response
            value and one being the highest possible response value for each item. Factor-based
            scales for each construct were then calculated by taking the mean of the recoded response
            values for all items that fell within that construct. Thus, each construct had a minimum
            possible value of zero and a maximum possible value of one.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Factor analysis revealed four factors common to both pre- and post-surveys (Tables
            
            <a>3</a> and 
            <a>4</a>). One, which we denote ‘
            <span>Impacts</span>,’ combines items assessing participant knowledge about the risks to ecosystems and
            human welfare posed by climate change. Two factors relate to affective responses to
            climate change. One, which we denote ‘
            <span>Urgency</span>,
            <span>’</span> includes six items assessing participants’ feelings of worry, guilt, fear, alarm,
            outrage and anger about climate change, and the extent to which climate change is
            personally important to them. The second affect-related factor, which we denote 
            <span>‘Hope</span>,
            <span>’</span> arises from items assessing whether people feel hopeful or hopeless, empowered or
            discouraged, that is, agency—whether they believe change is possible and individual
            action can make a difference. Survey items asking about the likelihood participants
            will take action to reduce their personal carbon footprint, discuss climate change
            with family, friends, or peers, or take political action on climate change loaded
            onto a factor we denote 
            <span>‘Intent</span>.
            <span>’</span> Lastly, the post-surveys include five items addressing whether the simulation altered
            participants’ desire to learn more about climate change, all of which loaded onto
            a fifth factor we denote 
            <span>‘Desire to Learn More’</span> (

            <a>4</a>). Further, knowledge of the human role in climate change did not load together with
            knowledge of CO
            <sub>2</sub> accumulation (the ability to infer how the stock of CO
            <sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere accumulates the flow of CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions less the net removal of CO
            <sub>2</sub> as it is taken up by the biosphere and ocean). However, the deficit model of risk
            communication suggests greater understanding that human activity is the primary cause
            of climate change should lead to greater desire to act and an understanding of CO
            <sub>2</sub> accumulation dynamics may be a predictor of preferences for strong climate action
            [
