      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our sample consisted of 39 
         <span>World Climate</span> sessions conducted between September 2015 and October 2017 in locations in North
         and South America, Europe and Africa, with a total of 2,042 participants (
         <a>Table 1</a>). These sessions are broadly representative of the wide spectrum of educational and
         cultural settings in which 
         <span>World Climate</span> is used, ranging from early secondary school to graduate school to sessions open
         to the public; participant ages from 11 to more than 75; and heterogeneous participant
         backgrounds from no prior education or interest in climate change to professionals
         whose career focus is climate change and sustainability.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a pre-/post-survey design to assess the impact of 
            <span>World Climate</span>. To reduce the likelihood that external events influenced participants’ responses,
            the pre- and post-surveys were administered within a short time period (a few minutes
            to several days) before and after each session. The surveys are provided in the Supporting
            Information (
            <a>S2 Appendix</a>) and were approved by the institutional review boards of UMass Lowell and MIT (Protocols
            16-049-ROO-XPD and 1702833248, respectively). We obtained informed consent through
            both verbal and written statements. Participants were informed that survey completion
            was voluntary, the individual results confidential, and, if 
            <span>World Climate</span> was part of an academic course or program, that their responses had no influence
            on their academic standing (
            <a>S2 Appendix</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pre- and post-surveys include items designed to assess participants’ knowledge
            about climate change, their affective responses to it, their intent to learn and do
            more to address it, as well as questions on participants’ sociodemographic characteristics.
            The surveys include items used in prior work to assess knowledge of climate science
            and beliefs about the reality and causes of climate change [
            <a>40</a>]. Other knowledge-related items elicited participants’ beliefs about the impacts
            of climate change, and their understanding of the dynamics of CO
            <sub>2</sub> accumulation in the atmosphere, which prior research [
            <a>17</a>, 
            <a>33</a>, 
            <a>41</a>] shows to be widely misunderstood. We used semantic differential scales [
            <a>42</a>] to assess participants’ affective response to climate change by asking them to locate
            how they feel about climate change on scales spanning emotional poles, for example,
            hopeless to hopeful, discouraged to empowered, and indifferent to engaged. Participants’
            perceived socioeconomic status was assessed using language adapted from Goodman et
            al. [
            <a>43</a>, 
            <a>44</a>]. The post-survey included additional questions eliciting participants’ reactions
            to 
            <span>World Climate</span>, including whether it influenced their motivation to address climate change or their
            desire to learn more about climate science, technological solutions, economics, and
            policy options. The post-survey also included optional open-ended questions where
            participants could comment on how the simulation affected their understanding of climate
            change, their affective responses and motivation to address it. All survey questions
            were tested by soliciting feedback from five educators using 
            <span>World Climate</span>, two educational psychologists, and ten undergraduate students who had not participated
            in the simulation.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Respondents were included in the analysis if they reported no previous experience

            and post-surveys that could be matched to each other. Across the 2,042 participants
