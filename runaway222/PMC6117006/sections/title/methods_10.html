      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sessions lasted between 1.5 and 3 hours. All sessions in our sample were face-to-face
         events with the exception of one synchronous online session (
         <a>Table 1</a>). Facilitators included the authors and other individuals who learned how to facilitate
         sessions after participating in 
         <span>World Climate</span> or learning about it online. Facilitators in all sessions used the same materials,
         including: two-page briefing memos for participants (provided in 
         <a>S1 Appendix</a>), with information about past and projected greenhouse gas emissions and a brief
         overview of each nation or bloc’s negotiating goals, public opinion about climate
         change, risks of climate impacts, and opportunities for climate action; slides to
         introduce and debrief sessions; and the C-ROADS computer model. All of these materials,
         including C-ROADS, a detailed facilitator’s guide, and a video explaining how to facilitate
         
         <span>World Climate</span> are freely available online (
         <span>https://www.climateinteractive.org/programs/world-climate/</span>).
