 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As described below, we test multiple hypotheses to examine whether participants experienced gains in knowledge, affect, and desire to learn and do more; how those gains were related to each other, if at all; the potential influence of political views; and potential threats to validity. We apply a Bonferroni correction to reduce the likelihood of erroneously finding statistically significant results when multiple hypotheses are tested. For any conventional threshold for statistical significance, α, the Bonferroni correction is α
  <sub>adjusted</sub> = α/N, where N is the number of tests carried out. We conduct a total of 104 tests for statistical significance across the full set of t-tests and regression analyses. The Bonferroni-adjusted significant levels for α = 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 are therefore

  <span class="sup">−4</span>, 
  <span class="italic">p &lt;</span> 9.6 x 10
  <span class="sup">−5</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">p &lt;</span> 9.6 x 10
  <span class="sup">−6</span>, respectively. That is, we reject the null hypothesis that 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> had no impact for each individual test we conduct only if the probability of erroneously doing so is 
  <span class="italic">p &lt;</span> 4.8 x 10
  <span class="sup">−4</span>
  <sub>.</sub> Doing so yields a familywise error rate—the probability of erroneously rejecting any true null hypothesis across the full set of tests conducted—of 0.05. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 24.
