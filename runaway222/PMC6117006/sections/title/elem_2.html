      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants in 
         <span>World Climate</span> take on the roles of parties to the UN climate negotiations and are challenged to
         create an international agreement that limits warming by 2100 to well below 2 °C above
         preindustrial levels. As in the UNFCCC process, participants specify Nationally Determined
         Contributions (NDCs) for the parties they represent while seeking to influence the
         other parties through face-to-face negotiations. Participants’ proposals are then
         entered into the C-ROADS climate policy model [
         <a>26</a>, 
         <a>27</a>], which provides immediate feedback about the expected climate outcomes of those
         decisions.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C-ROADS is a member of the family of simple climate models (SCMs) [
         <a>30</a>], consisting of a system of differential equations that represent the carbon cycle;
         budgets and stocks of GHGs, including CO
         <sub>2</sub>, CH
         <sub>4</sub>, N
         <sub>2</sub>O, SF
         <sub>6</sub>, PFCs, CFCs, HFCs, aerosols and black carbon; radiative forcing and the heat balance
         of the Earth; exchange and transport of carbon and heat between the atmosphere and
         ocean; and climate change impacts (
         <a>Fig 1</a>) [
         <a>26</a>, 
         <a>27</a>]. The carbon cycle includes compartments for stocks of carbon in the atmosphere,
         biosphere, soils, and the ocean (which is divided into four layers). Users specify
         a fossil fuel emissions pathway for the nation or bloc they represent, and policies
         to reduce deforestation or promote afforestation. C-ROADS enables participants to
         examine the expected effects of these decisions including atmospheric GHG concentrations,
         global temperature change, global mean sea level rise, and ocean acidification. C-ROADS
         can be configured to enable emissions inputs for one, three, six, or fifteen different
         nations and blocs of nations, in all cases collectively adding up to global emissions.
         
         <a>Fig 2</a> shows the C-ROADS user interface for six regions.

            <p>Panel A is the six-region 
               <span>World Climate</span> interface through which participants enter decisions, including the year they choose
               (if any) to halt the growth of emissions, begin to decline and the annual rate of
               decline (%), with changes in deforestation and afforestation (on scales of 0–100%,
               with 0 being business-as-usual and 100% being the maximum possible effort). The model
               immediately displays the resulting CO
               <sub>2</sub> emissions trajectories (panel A left), global mean surface temperature anomaly relative
               to pre-industrial levels (panel A right) and other impacts. B: Screenshot showing
               CO
               <sub>2</sub> emissions and net removals for the scenario entered in panel A (panel B left), illustrating
               the “carbon bathtub” [
               <a>33</a>], i.e., that the stock of CO
               <sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere accumulates anthropogenic CO
               <sub>2</sub> emissions less the net CO
               <sub>2</sub> flux from the atmosphere to biosphere and oceans. Users can carry out a wide range
               of sensitivity tests by choosing values for parameters affecting, e.g., climate sensitivity
               and the strength of both positive (e.g., Arctic methane) and negative (e.g., CO
               <sub>2</sub> fertilization) feedbacks in the climate system (panel B, bottom left). C: C-ROADS
               enables users to explore economic and population data linked to emissions (e.g., GHG
               emissions per capita shown in panel C, left), and to compare the fit between the model
               and historical data for GHG concentrations and to projected global surface temperature
               in CMIP5 models through 2100.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C-ROADS is designed to be transparent, to be accessible to non-specialists, and to
         enable users to build an understanding of the climate system rather than using the
         model as a black box. C-ROADS closely replicates historical data from 1850 and CMIP5
         model projections through 2100 across a wide range of Representative Concentration
         Pathways (RCPs) (
         <a>Fig 2C</a>) [
         <a>26</a>, 
         <a>31</a>]. Although model parameters are based on accepted peer-reviewed science, users are
         not compelled to accept the default values and can adjust assumptions including climate
         sensitivity, CO
         <sub>2</sub> fertilization feedbacks, and Arctic methane emissions so that they can explore the
         sensitivity of results to uncertainty (
         <a>Fig 2B</a>). Users can input any future emissions scenarios they wish and get immediate feedback
         on the expected global climate outcomes of those scenarios. C-ROADS has been used
         by policymakers [
         <a>32</a>], is freely available for online or offline use (
         <span>https://www.climateinteractive.org</span>), and runs in about one second on laptops and other devices–characteristics well
         suited for interactive exercises such as 
         <span>World Climate</span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All sessions in our sample followed the same protocol (
         <a>Fig 3</a>), described in detail in Sterman et al. [
         <a>34</a>]. Participants are first assigned to one of six delegations to the negotiation (the
         USA, European Union, China, India, Other Developed Nations, and Other Developing Nations)
         and receive the briefing memo for their nation or bloc (
         <a>S1 Appendix</a>). The facilitator, playing the role of the UN Secretary General or UNFCCC Executive
         Secretary, gives a brief overview on climate change, historical GHG emissions, the
         context of current UN climate negotiations, and expected consequences of business-as-usual
         emissions trajectories including sea level rise, ocean acidification, and increasing
         risks of extreme weather, crop yields and other impacts (
         <span>https://www.climateinteractive.org/programs/world-climate/instructor-resources/slide-sets/</span>). The facilitator then presents the key policy decisions participants are charged
         with: specifying their bloc or nation’s fossil fuel emissions pathway through 2100;
         their effort to protect against deforestation and/or promote afforestation; and how
         much money, if any, they will contribute to or seek from the UN Green Climate Fund
         [
         <a>35</a>]. None of the materials (briefing memos or presentation slides) are prescriptive.
         Rather, participants are free to make any decisions they wish as they engage in face-to-face
         negotiations with the other parties. A short video showing excerpts from a 
         <span>World Climate</span> session is available at 
         <span>https://www.climateinteractive.org/programs/world-climate/</span>.

      </div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first round of negotiations ends with a plenary session in which a representative
         from each delegation delivers a short speech describing their pledge and negotiating
         position, including concessions they seek from the other parties. The pledges are
         then entered into C-ROADS, which immediately displays the climate impacts expected
         to result from the collective emissions pathways chosen by the participants (
         <a>Fig 2A</a>). C-ROADS also enables the participants to see the impact of the emissions pathways
         of each bloc on emissions per capita, the emissions intensity of the economy, cumulative
         emissions, and other indicators that bear on the debate over the principle of “common
         but differentiated responsibilities”.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our experience, the first round of pledges always falls short of the emissions
         reductions required to limit expected warming to 2 °C and are often qualitatively
         similar to the actual pledges that emerged from the Paris Agreement, leading to warming
         of approximately 3.3 °C by 2100. Participants often express surprise that the impact
         of their pledges is not greater and ask many questions about the structure and dynamics
         of the climate system as they seek to understand why the simulation results differ
         from their expectations. C-ROADS is then used to show the “bathtub dynamics” of CO
         <sub>2</sub> accumulation in the atmosphere [
         <a>21</a>, 
         <a>33</a>], with atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations continuing to rise as long as emissions exceed the net flux of CO
         <sub>2</sub> from atmosphere to the ocean and biosphere (
         <a>Fig 2B</a>). The facilitator explains additional impacts expected at the level of warming obtained,
         for example, showing maps depicting sea level rise for coastal cities in different
         geographic areas and expected impacts on global food production, freshwater supplies,
         wildfires, biodiversity and other impacts (all described in the slide deck available
         with 
         <span>World Climate</span>). Participants then enter a second (and, if time allows, third) round of negotiation,
         each followed by simulation of the new proposals. The role-play concludes with a debriefing
         conversation in which participants are actively engaged with one another and with
         the C-ROADS model (
         <a>Fig 3</a>).
