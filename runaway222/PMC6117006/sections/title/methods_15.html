      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We extracted factors separately from pre- and post-survey items, comparing results
         and testing whether the factors identified were consistent across the pre- and post-surveys.
         Separate pre- and post-survey factor extraction is warranted because pre- and post-responses
         from a given participant are not independent from each other. This approach also enabled
         development of constructs from questions that are only included in the post-survey,
         such as questions addressing participants’ desire to learn more about climate change.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used principal axis factoring with orthogonal (varimax) rotation for factor extraction
         and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy to assess the potential
         for extracting distinct, reliable factors. KMO measures &gt; 0.65 were considered to
         indicate that correlations among individual items were appropriate for factor analysis
         [
         <a>46</a>]. We used Bartlett’s test of sphericity to test whether correlations among items
         included in the EFA were significantly different from zero (
         <span>p</span> &lt; 0.05). The validity of extracted factors was tested using several methods, including
         the Kaiser criterion (i.e., eigenvalue &gt; 1; [
         <a>47</a>], a scree test [
         <a>48</a>], and the interpretability of factors given prior theory [
         <a>49</a>]). Individual items were retained in a given factor if (1) factor loading was &gt; 0.45
         for the focal item and &lt; 0.45 for other items [
         <a>49</a>], (2) reliability testing yielded Cronbach’s α &gt; 0.7; (3) deletion of an item did
         not result in an increase of Cronbach’s α; and (4) inclusion of the item was supported
         by separate factor extraction from both pre- and post-survey items.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used factor-based scores as a simple, intuitive approach to combine survey responses
         for all items that fell within a given construct [
         <a>49</a>]. The surveys include questions with responses that ranged from binary responses
         to five-point Likert scales. To weight each survey question equally, we recoded all
         responses to a scale of zero to one, with zero being the lowest possible response
         value and one being the highest possible response value for each item. Factor-based
         scales for each construct were then calculated by taking the mean of the recoded response
         values for all items that fell within that construct. Thus, each construct had a minimum
         possible value of zero and a maximum possible value of one.
