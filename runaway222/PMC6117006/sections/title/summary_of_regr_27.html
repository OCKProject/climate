      <div>Summary of regression results, showing statistically significant relationships (arrows)
         among gains in constructs, including affect (
         <span>Urgency</span> and 
         <span>Hope</span>), knowledge about

      <p>Results are for Model 1 (no participant- or session-level fixed effects; values for
         Models 2–4 with different sets of controls are similar). Lines with arrows depict
         statistically significant relationships between independent and dependent variables,
         with standardized beta coefficients for each relationship shown. See 
         <a>S1 Table</a> for detailed regression results. *** 
         <span>p</span> &lt; 1E-9 denotes statistical significance at α &lt; 0.001 after Bonferroni correction.
         ** Beta coefficients were statistically significant at α &lt; 0.01 after Bonferroni correction,
         with 
         <span>p</span> &lt; 1E-6.
