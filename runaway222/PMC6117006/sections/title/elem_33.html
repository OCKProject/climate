      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We now consider two potential sources of bias. First, survey completion was optional,
         raising the potential of bias from voluntary response sampling if participants with
         more extreme prior views about climate change or who had the strongest reactions to
         
         <span>World Climate</span>, positive or negative, were more likely to complete the surveys than those indifferent
         to the experience. Second, approximately half the participants were required to participate
         in 
         <span>World Climate</span> as part of a course unrelated to climate change. However, the other half elected
         to participate, raising the possibility that these individuals were not representative
         of the populations in their nations.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test for voluntary response sampling bias, we (i) replicated the regression analysis,
            eliminating those sessions with low rates (&lt;30%) of usable cases to assess whether
            inclusion of sessions with low response rates influenced results; (ii) included the
            session-level response rate as a regressor in the analysis to test whether variation
            in response rate had a statistically significant effect on the gains in each construct;
            (iii) compared pre-survey values of constructs and gains in constructs for sessions
            with high response rates to those with low response rates to test whether biases associated
            with response rates influenced observed gains; and (iv) compared pre-survey construct
            values and sociodemographic characteristics for those who completed the post-survey
            to those who did not to test whether there were differences among those who only provided
            pre-surveys and those who provided both pre- and post-surveys.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second potential source of bias is self-selection of participants, as those choosing
            to participate may not be representative of broader populations. Forty-four percent
            of the sample participated in 
            <span>World Climate</span> because it was a required component of a course or program unrelated to climate change,
            ruling out selection bias for these participants. The rest (56%) had chosen to participate
            in a 
            <span>World Climate</span> session that was open to the public or had enrolled in a course in climate change
            or sustainability that included 
            <span>World Climate</span> (
            <a>Table 1</a>). These participants might have been more motivated to learn about climate change
            or to favor climate action than the population at large. To test for self-selection
            bias we replicated our analysis for the participants for whom 
            <span>World Climate</span> was a required component of their educational program.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regression analyses excluding sessions with low survey response rates (&lt;30%) yielded
            results similar to those from the full sample (
            <a>S1</a> and 
            <a>S2</a> Tables). Comparison of results for sessions with high response rates (&gt;50%) to those
            with low response rates (&lt;50%) also showed no statistically significant differences
            (
            <a>S4 Table</a>). When session-level response rate was included as a regressor, it shows no statistically
            significant effect (
            <a>S1</a> and 
            <a>S2</a> Tables). The results show no evidence that differences in survey response rates explain
            the gains in construct values after participation in 
            <span>World Climate</span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With few exceptions, pre-survey responses for those who completed the post-survey
            reveal no statistically significant differences compared to those who chose not to
            complete the post-survey (
            <a>S5 Table</a>). Among sessions with high response rates (&gt;30%), the only difference is that participants
            who completed both surveys were, on average, younger than those who only provided
            pre-surveys (
            <a>S5 Table</a>). For all sessions, those who completed both surveys show no significant differences
            in pre-survey values for knowledge about climate change causes and CO
            <sub>2</sub> accumulation dynamics, 
            <span>Urgency</span>, and 
            <span>Hope</span>. However, they did have higher levels of education, higher pre-survey knowledge about
            climate change 
            <span>Impacts</span> and 
            <span>Intent</span> to act, and were more likely to have been in a session facilitated by our team and
            held at an institution of higher education (Table B in 
            <a>S5 Table</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results for participants who were required to participate in 
            <span>World Climate</span> as part of a curriculum unrelated to climate change or sustainability were similar
            to those who volunteered to participate, with statistically significant gains in all
            constructs (
            <a>S6 Table</a>). Overall, the gains in knowledge, affect, the desire to learn more and intent to
            take action after participating in 
            <span>World Climate</span> are similar for those who were required to participate in the simulation compared
            to those who chose to participate.
