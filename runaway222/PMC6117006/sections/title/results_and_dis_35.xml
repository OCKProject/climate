 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regression analyses excluding sessions with low survey response rates (&lt;30%) yielded results similar to those from the full sample (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s001" href="#pone.0202877.s001">S1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s002" href="#pone.0202877.s002">S2</a> Tables). Comparison of results for sessions with high response rates (&gt;50%) to those with low response rates (&lt;50%) also showed no statistically significant differences (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s004" href="#pone.0202877.s004">S4 Table</a>). When session-level response rate was included as a regressor, it shows no statistically significant effect (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s001" href="#pone.0202877.s001">S1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s002" href="#pone.0202877.s002">S2</a> Tables). The results show no evidence that differences in survey response rates explain the gains in construct values after participation in 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With few exceptions, pre-survey responses for those who completed the post-survey reveal no statistically significant differences compared to those who chose not to complete the post-survey (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s005" href="#pone.0202877.s005">S5 Table</a>). Among sessions with high response rates (&gt;30%), the only difference is that participants who completed both surveys were, on average, younger than those who only provided pre-surveys (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s005" href="#pone.0202877.s005">S5 Table</a>). For all sessions, those who completed both surveys show no significant differences in pre-survey values for knowledge about climate change causes and CO
  <sub>2</sub> accumulation dynamics, 
  <span class="italic">Urgency</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Hope</span>. However, they did have higher levels of education, higher pre-survey knowledge about climate change 
  <span class="italic">Impacts</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Intent</span> to act, and were more likely to have been in a session facilitated by our team and held at an institution of higher education (Table B in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s005" href="#pone.0202877.s005">S5 Table</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results for participants who were required to participate in 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> as part of a curriculum unrelated to climate change or sustainability were similar to those who volunteered to participate, with statistically significant gains in all constructs (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202877.s006" href="#pone.0202877.s006">S6 Table</a>). Overall, the gains in knowledge, affect, the desire to learn more and intent to take action after participating in 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> are similar for those who were required to participate in the simulation compared to those who chose to participate.
