         <p>Panel A is the six-region 
            <span>World Climate</span> interface through which participants enter decisions, including the year they choose
            (if any) to halt the growth of emissions, begin to decline and the annual rate of
            decline (%), with changes in deforestation and afforestation (on scales of 0–100%,
            with 0 being business-as-usual and 100% being the maximum possible effort). The model
            immediately displays the resulting CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions trajectories (panel A left), global mean surface temperature anomaly relative
            to pre-industrial levels (panel A right) and other impacts. B: Screenshot showing
            CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions and net removals for the scenario entered in panel A (panel B left), illustrating
            the “carbon bathtub” [
            <a>33</a>], i.e., that the stock of CO
            <sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere accumulates anthropogenic CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions less the net CO
            <sub>2</sub> flux from the atmosphere to biosphere and oceans. Users can carry out a wide range
            of sensitivity tests by choosing values for parameters affecting, e.g., climate sensitivity
            and the strength of both positive (e.g., Arctic methane) and negative (e.g., CO
            <sub>2</sub> fertilization) feedbacks in the climate system (panel B, bottom left). C: C-ROADS
            enables users to explore economic and population data linked to emissions (e.g., GHG
            emissions per capita shown in panel C, left), and to compare the fit between the model
            and historical data for GHG concentrations and to projected global surface temperature
            in CMIP5 models through 2100.
