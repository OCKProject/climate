         the values of constructs or selected items from the pre- to post-surveys. The magnitude
         of differences between the post- and pre-survey means is assessed by Cohen’s

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preliminary data analysis raised the possibility that ceiling effects might limit
         the measured impact of 
         <span>World Climate</span> because pre-survey responses for some participants lay near the maximum possible
         value of a given construct. We therefore test for differences in gains in each construct
         between those participants who began the simulation with high pre-survey values compared
         to those with low pre-survey values by comparing the upper and lower thirds of the
         distribution of all usable cases. For each subsample and construct, we test for statistically
         and substantively significant pre- to post-survey gains using paired t-tests and Cohen’s
         
         <span>d</span> effect sizes.
