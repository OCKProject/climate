 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We test for potential effects of free-market beliefs on learning outcomes from 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> in three ways. First, we compared the means for each construct (pre- and post-simulation) for participants who opposed government regulation to those who favored it, using independent samples t-tests. This analysis assesses initial and post-workshop differences in the constructs capturing climate change knowledge, affect, and intent to take action. Second, we tested whether gains in each construct were statistically significant for participants in the US who were somewhat or strongly opposed to government regulation of free markets, using paired t-tests. Third, we repeated the regression analyses of the gains in each construct described above but adding free market views as a participant-level fixed effect. Statistically significant effects of free market views, along with their sign and effect size, indicate whether free market views are associated with differences in the gains in each construct.
