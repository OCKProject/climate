      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We test for potential effects of free-market beliefs on learning outcomes from 
         <span>World Climate</span> in three ways. First, we compared the means for each construct (pre- and post-simulation)
         for participants who opposed government regulation to those who favored it, using
         independent samples t-tests. This analysis assesses initial and post-workshop differences
         in the constructs capturing climate change knowledge, affect, and intent to take action.
         Second, we tested whether gains in each construct were statistically significant for
         participants in the US who were somewhat or strongly opposed to government regulation
         of free markets, using paired t-tests. Third, we repeated the regression analyses
         of the gains in each construct described above but adding free market views as a participant-level
         fixed effect. Statistically significant effects of free market views, along with their
         sign and effect size, indicate whether free market views are associated with differences
         in the gains in each construct.
