      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use multiple linear regression to assess associations among the constructs in the
         hypothesized learning model (
         <a>Fig 4</a>). The dependent variables are the gains, 
         <span>G</span>, between the pre- and post-surveys for each of the constructs, 
         <span>C</span>, identified through EFA, 
         <span>G</span> = 
         <span>C
            <sub>Post</sub></span> − 
         <span>C
            <sub>Pre</sub></span>. For each focal construct, (e.g., the gain in 
         <span>Intent</span>), the independent variables are the gains in the other constructs (e.g., gains in
         knowledge of climate change 
         <span>Impacts</span>, 
         <span>Urgency</span> and 
         <span>Hope</span>). We include a variety of controls, including the pre-survey value of the constructs
         to test for ceiling effects that might arise in cases with high pre-survey values,
         and fixed effects to control for potential influence of participant or session characteristics.
         Controls for participants’ sociodemographic characteristics include gender, age, education,
         parents’ education, and perceived socioeconomic status. Session-level controls include
         whether the session was held in a developed or developing country, in a secondary
         or post-secondary educational setting, and was run by an experienced facilitator or
         someone with no or minimal formal training in 
         <span>World Climate</span> (see 
         <a>Table 1</a>, 
         <a>S1</a> and 
         <a>S2</a> Tables). Pearson’s correlation coefficients across session- and participant-level
         variables are provided in 
         <a>S3 Table</a>. For all regressions, tests for collinearity and outliers included ensuring that
         all tolerance statistics were &gt; 0.2, variance inflation factors (VIF) were &lt; 10, and
         Cook’s distance values were &lt;4/N.
