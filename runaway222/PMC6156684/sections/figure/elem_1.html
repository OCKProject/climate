            Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation data (
            <a>38</a>), ERA reanalysis (12-h reforecast), and CRM simulation of the control case. The blue
            line is the mean of the three observations and reanalysis dataset. (
            <span>B</span>) Daily precipitation of the control case and two perturbed cases. Error bars indicate
            the SD among six ensemble members, which are different realizations with small random
            noise in the initial conditions (
