      <p>A useful starting hypothesis for predictions of changes in precipitation extremes
         with climate is that those extremes increase at the same rate as atmospheric moisture
         does, which is

         </div> following the Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) relation. This hypothesis, however, neglects
         potential changes in the strengths of atmospheric circulations associated with precipitation
         extremes. As increased moisture leads to increased precipitation, the increased latent
         heating may lead to stronger large-scale ascent and thus, additional increase in precipitation,
         leading to a super-CC scaling. This study investigates this possibility in the context
         of the 2015 Texas extreme precipitation event using the Column Quasi-Geostrophic (CQG)
         method. Analogs to this event are simulated in different climatic conditions with
         varying surface temperature (

         </div>) given the same adiabatic quasigeostrophic forcing. Precipitation in these events
         exhibits super-CC scaling due to the dynamic contribution associated with increasing
         ascent due to increased latent heating, an increase with importance that increases
         with

         </div>. The thermodynamic contribution (attributable to increasing water vapor; assuming
         no change in vertical motion) approximately follows CC as expected, while vertical
         structure changes of moisture and diabatic heating lead to negative but secondary
         contributions to the sensitivity, reducing the rate of increase.
