 <p>Changes in precipitation extremes under climate change are subject to substantial uncertainty. Atmospheric moisture increases alone would make extreme rain events heavier at a well-understood rate of

  </div>, but a component associated with storm dynamics is much less well-understood and can either amplify or reduce that moisture-driven intensification. This paper uses an idealized modeling framework to understand the coupling of these two components, simulating one actual heavy rain event in both the present climate and hypothetical perturbed climates. The increased heating due to increased moisture drives a dynamical increase in large-scale ascent, amplifying the moisture-driven response by as much as a factor of two for warmer climates.
