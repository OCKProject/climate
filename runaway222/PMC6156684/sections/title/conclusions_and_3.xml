 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have investigated the sensitivity of precipitation extremes to temperature using the extreme precipitation event of May 2015 in Texas and Oklahoma as an example and studied it with idealized CRM simulations on a small domain under the CQG method. The 2015 event was simulated under different climatic background conditions with varying

  </div> under the same adiabatic QG forcing. In the control case, under the actual climatic conditions in 2015, the model results reproduce the precipitation in observations reasonably well, while perturbed cases show that the extreme precipitation increases exponentially as

  </div> increases. The exponential growth rate exceeds CC scaling due to the positive contribution from the dynamic response due to increased large-scale ascent driven by increased diabatic heating. It is approximately equal to the relative changes of atmospheric moisture multiplying a diabatic heating amplification factor

  </div>, modified by a secondary term associated with the changes in the vertical structure of heating. While the thermodynamic contribution is nearly constant with warming, the diabatic heating feedback becomes stronger, leading to increasing extreme precipitation sensitivity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The super-CC scaling for extreme precipitation that we find here is consistent with some observational and GCM modeling studies (
  <a rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" href="#r10">10</a>, 
  <a rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" href="#r12">12</a>). Our results are strictly for a single event, but we view them as relevant to a larger set of events with a strong convective component as well as strong large-scale PV dynamics. Particularly interesting examples may include precipitation extremes in the subtropics during the summer half-year, including those caused by tropical–extratropical interaction (
  <a rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" href="#r41">41</a>), as well as monsoon depressions (
  <a rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" href="#r42">42</a>) and similar disturbances. Similar considerations may apply to a wider range of midlatitude precipitation systems accompanied by convection as well, although since the dynamic amplification that we find is greatest for the warmest climates, we might expect it to be smaller for winter storms.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CQG method allows us to analyze in detail the mechanisms by which the super-CC scaling comes about, providing perspective relevant to interpreting the different extreme precipitation sensitivities found in GCM simulations. Climate models with stronger diabatic heating feedback in simulations of the current climate are likely to produce greater sensitivity of extreme precipitation to climate change, such as has been found for the response of the North Atlantic storm track to warming in a regional model sensitivity study (
  <a rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" href="#r43">43</a>). The CQG method could be used to diagnose in more detail the mechanisms leading to different results in different climate models.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A significant limitation of this study is that we assume that the adiabatic QG forcing and the horizontal length scale associated with the disturbance remain constant as climate changes, so that all changes are driven directly by the changing thermodynamic environment. We view this as a reasonable starting point given the greater uncertainty in dynamic compared with thermodynamic components of climate change (
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>
  <a href="#r31">*</a>–
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>, 
  <a rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" href="#r34">34</a>). Other factors not considered here include, for instance, the effects of large-scale circulation pattern changes on local regions (
  <a rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" href="#r44">44</a>), the possible changes of eddy length scale (
  <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>), and the possible changes of frequencies of strong synoptic perturbations (
  <a rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" href="#r46">46</a>). All of these factors may also modify the sensitivity of extreme precipitation. Studies with comprehensive climate models suggest, in fact, that warming may lead to a reduction in the dynamic component of extreme precipitation in the region and season of interest here (
  <a rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" href="#r11">11</a>, 
  <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>). If so, our results suggest that this reduction is due to these other effects, with dynamic amplification due to increased heating (for a given

  </div> and wave number 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <div id="i176" class="math">
    <span class="mi">k</span>
   </div>
  </div>) still relevant and perhaps dominant in other regions. Efforts to analyze all of these effects more broadly using a hierarchy of numerical models would be valuable.
