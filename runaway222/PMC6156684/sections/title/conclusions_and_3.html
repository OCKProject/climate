      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have investigated the sensitivity of precipitation extremes to temperature using
         the extreme precipitation event of May 2015 in Texas and Oklahoma as an example and
         studied it with idealized CRM simulations on a small domain under the CQG method.
         The 2015 event was simulated under different climatic background conditions with varying

         </div> under the same adiabatic QG forcing. In the control case, under the actual climatic
         conditions in 2015, the model results reproduce the precipitation in observations
         reasonably well, while perturbed cases show that the extreme precipitation increases
         exponentially as

         </div> increases. The exponential growth rate exceeds CC scaling due to the positive contribution
         from the dynamic response due to increased large-scale ascent driven by increased
         diabatic heating. It is approximately equal to the relative changes of atmospheric
         moisture multiplying a diabatic heating amplification factor 
         
         <div>
            <div><span>α</span></div>
         </div>, modified by a secondary term associated with the changes in the vertical structure
         of heating. While the thermodynamic contribution is nearly constant with warming,
         the diabatic heating feedback becomes stronger, leading to increasing extreme precipitation
         sensitivity.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The super-CC scaling for extreme precipitation that we find here is consistent with
         some observational and GCM modeling studies (
         <a>10</a>, 
         <a>12</a>). Our results are strictly for a single event, but we view them as relevant to a
         larger set of events with a strong convective component as well as strong large-scale
         PV dynamics. Particularly interesting examples may include precipitation extremes
         in the subtropics during the summer half-year, including those caused by tropical–extratropical
         interaction (
         <a>41</a>), as well as monsoon depressions (
         <a>42</a>) and similar disturbances. Similar considerations may apply to a wider range of midlatitude
         precipitation systems accompanied by convection as well, although since the dynamic
         amplification that we find is greatest for the warmest climates, we might expect it
         to be smaller for winter storms.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CQG method allows us to analyze in detail the mechanisms by which the super-CC
         scaling comes about, providing perspective relevant to interpreting the different
         extreme precipitation sensitivities found in GCM simulations. Climate models with
         stronger diabatic heating feedback in simulations of the current climate are likely
         to produce greater sensitivity of extreme precipitation to climate change, such as
         has been found for the response of the North Atlantic storm track to warming in a
         regional model sensitivity study (
         <a>43</a>). The CQG method could be used to diagnose in more detail the mechanisms leading
         to different results in different climate models.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A significant limitation of this study is that we assume that the adiabatic QG forcing
         and the horizontal length scale associated with the disturbance remain constant as
         climate changes, so that all changes are driven directly by the changing thermodynamic
         environment. We view this as a reasonable starting point given the greater uncertainty
         in dynamic compared with thermodynamic components of climate change (
         <a>30</a><a>*</a>–
         <a>32</a>, 
         <a>34</a>). Other factors not considered here include, for instance, the effects of large-scale
         circulation pattern changes on local regions (
         <a>44</a>), the possible changes of eddy length scale (
         <a>45</a>), and the possible changes of frequencies of strong synoptic perturbations (
         <a>46</a>). All of these factors may also modify the sensitivity of extreme precipitation.
         Studies with comprehensive climate models suggest, in fact, that warming may lead
         to a reduction in the dynamic component of extreme precipitation in the region and
         season of interest here (
         <a>11</a>, 
         <a>45</a>). If so, our results suggest that this reduction is due to these other effects, with
         dynamic amplification due to increased heating (for a given 
         
         <div>
            <div><span>F</span></div>
         </div> and wave number 
         
         <div>
            <div><span>k</span></div>
         </div>) still relevant and perhaps dominant in other regions. Efforts to analyze all of
         these effects more broadly using a hierarchy of numerical models would be valuable.
