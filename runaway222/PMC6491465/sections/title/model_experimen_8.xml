 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify the uncertainty in tropical Pacific climate projections owing to internal climate variability, we examine multiple realizations (ensemble members) from a number of large ensemble experiments from different climate models. Ensemble members from each experiment are subject to identical external forcing but are started from different initial conditions. Our analysis is based on three different fully coupled climate models (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>): namely the Kiel Climate Model

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>, and CESM1-CAM5
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. These models employ different physical parameterizations and numerical schemes and have different ocean and atmosphere resolutions, which allow us to assess the robustness of the results to structurally different models.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We perform a millennial timescale control run with the KCM at approximately present-day CO
  <sub>2</sub> levels (348 ppm). Branching off from this control simulation we undertake three 22-member ensemble 100-year global warming experiments based on idealized transient radiative forcing according to a 1% per year (p.a.) CO
  <sub>2</sub> warming scenario
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. In the first ensemble set, integrations start from different oceanic and atmospheric initial conditions (ICs) at different times of the control run. These initial conditions cover a broad range of climate regimes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). This ensemble is termed KCM-ICs. The ICs indicates the method of the ensemble generation. In the second and the third ensemble set, the ensemble spread is produced by only perturbing the atmospheric initial conditions while the oceanic initial conditions remain fixed (i.e., from a single point in the control simulation; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). In this case, any spread is owing to atmospheric variability and nonlinear climate dynamics. In the second ensemble, termed as KCM-IPO-Cold, the oceanic initial state corresponds to negative phase of the IPO, whereas it matches the positive phase in the third ensemble, termed as KCM-IPO-Warm (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Comparison between the ICs and the latter ensemble sets allows us to estimate the contribution of the IPO initial state to the GMT projections and to isolate the uncertainty related to chaotic atmospheric fluctuations from those owing to the oceanic initial state

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the CSIRO-Mk3L, we undertake a 1100-year control run with constant CO
  <sub>2</sub> at preindustrial levels (280 ppm). Again, a 22-member ensemble with 1% p.a. increasing CO
  <sub>2</sub> is performed with a similar configuration to the KCM ensemble sets; i.e., with different oceanic and atmospheric initial conditions (termed Mk3L-ICs; Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) and fixed oceanic initial conditions in negative (termed Mk3L-IPO-Cold) and positive (termed Mk3L-IPO-Warm) phases of the IPO (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>; Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also analyze output from CESM1-CAM5 experiments. For this model a 1800-year control run at preindustrial CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration (280 ppm) was integrated. A single realization was integrated for 71 years with the external forcing according to that observed from 1850 to 1920. Thirty-five global warming experiments are undertaken by perturbing atmospheric initial conditions with the same oceanic state at 1920. They are then subject to historical radiative forcing from 1920 to 2005 and are extended according to the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5

  </span> scenario until 2100. This ensemble set is termed CESM1-Hind-Proj. Hind and Proj here refer to hincast and projection, respectively.

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The KCM and Mk3L global warming simulations (with 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> warming scenario) were performed as part of this project. The long control simulations predated this project (which is the reason for them being subject to different greenhouse levels representative of present day and preindustrial conditions). The CESM runs are pre-existing simulations that have been made available to the community
