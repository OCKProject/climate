 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The tropical Pacific covers a vast area, ~10%, of the Earth’s surface and is subject to intense ocean-atmosphere exchanges of momentum, heat, and moisture, thus playing a vital role in modulating regional and global climate

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. This region has undergone significant ocean and atmospheric changes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span> over two recent decades (1992–2011). During the latter half of this period and despite the steady buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the rate of global surface warming slowed, at the same time that there were persistently cold surface and subsurface temperature anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. This multi-decadal change is La Niña-like, in that the period also saw anomalously wet conditions and sea-level rise in the western Pacific, a cool and dry eastern Pacific, an intensified Indonesian Throughflow and an increase in wind-driven Ekman divergence away from the equator

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These changes were associated with an unprecedented intensification of the equatorial trade winds that form the surface component of the Pacific Walker Circulation (PWC)

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. More broadly, Pacific trade wind variations are associated with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, predominantly in the Niño 3.4 region (5°N–5°S, 170°W–120°W), basin-wide changes in sea-level pressure (SLP) and changes in upper-ocean thermal structure

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Large internal decadal variability is evident in the tropical Pacific in both observations and climate simulations, which can enhance or reduce the rate of globally averaged surface warming

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. On multi-decadal timescales, an ENSO-like pattern in anomalous SST, known as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), is observed and simulated in climate models

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>

  </span> (hereafter, termed the global mean temperature; GMT). For example, the anomalous decadal intensification of the Pacific trade winds between 1992 and 2011 was associated with a decadal shift from the warm to cold phase of the IPO during the late 1990 s or early 2000s
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Thus, understanding the causes of transitions in the IPO and improving its simulation in climate models is vital to enhancing our ability to make skillful decadal climate predictions

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sign and magnitude of Pacific trade winds response to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (GHGs) is still uncertain.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of tropical Pacific internal variability in the recent global surface warming slowdown is still unclear. Here, we investigate the influence of low-frequency changes in the Pacific climate in modulating GMT. Using multiple large ensembles of global warming simulations subject to identical external forcing, but starting from different initial conditions (Methods; Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), we explore the impacts of internal variability on tropical Pacific climate hindcasts and projections and its relationship to GMT. We mainly focus on 20-year timescale, which is beyond the target range of decadal prediction but not so long that multi-decadal variability is dominated by anthropogenic GHG forcing

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we mainly focus on the fluctuations of Pacific trade winds, among other elements of tropical Pacific climate variability. The wind forcing is an integral element of upper-ocean circulation, fundamentally altering the state of the ocean, both in the equatorial and off-equatorial regions. In particular, the surface wind stress field drives the redistribution of ocean heat content via the shallow meridional overturning cells and equatorial thermocline displacements. Wind forcing also alters the tropical Ekman transport that regulates ocean heat and water mass exchange between the tropics and subtropics over decadal timescales
