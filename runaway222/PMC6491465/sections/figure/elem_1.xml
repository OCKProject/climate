   </span>, observed wind stress is only shown after 1979. Shown in 
   <span class="bold">d</span> is the annual correlation coefficient between the GMT and Niño3.4 index (horizontal axis) and between the GMT and the zonal wind stress (vertical axis). 
   <span class="bold">e</span> 20-year trends in the zonal wind stress (Nm

   <span class="bold">d</span> and 
   <span class="bold">e</span>, blue (red) circles denote the individual ensemble members (observation). The vertical solid lines in 
   <span class="bold">e</span> indicate the mean ± Std of the trend in the wind stress and black solid lines denote the regression lines between GMT and wind stress trends. Also shown near the top-left corner of 
   <span class="bold">e</span> are the correlation between the wind stress and GMT trends (
   <span class="italic">R</span>) and the slope of the regression line (
   <span class="italic">a</span>). Please note that in 
   <span class="bold">d</span>, the linear trend was subtracted from all data sets prior to computing the correlation
