 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of how the curriculum is delivered, and even the practices of those who design the curriculum, Canadian education sometimes tends towards balance rather than evidence (
  <a ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pone.0218305.box002" href="#pone.0218305.box002">Box 2</a>). Being able to weigh the scientific merit of an argument is certainly a useful skill within scientific literacy, but should students be evaluating balance for issues where a scientific consensus already exists? Some members of society may see climate change as bad while others consider it beneficial, but the scientific evidence overwhelmingly points to negative outcomes both for humanity and the biosphere [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref033">33</a>], highlighting that additional warming entails more and longer heatwaves, more intense and more frequent extreme precipitation events, increased ocean acidification and increased sea level rise [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref020">20</a>]. With global temperatures threatening to cause extinction for one in six species [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref042">42</a>] and 250 000 human deaths per year predicted in the coming decades due to climate change under business as usual emissions [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref078">78</a>], an evidence-based approach would need to convey the seriousness of this issue. The desire of curriculum developers to take a balanced, neutral approach to topics that generate political debate is laudable, so long as the balance of evidence presented falls within the boundaries of scientific consensus.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several curriculum contributors firmly denied feeling any direct political pressure while writing the curriculum. While these interviews were retrospective, and perhaps subject to biases from self-evaluation, the results agree with our curriculum analysis, which shows no obvious relationship between a province’s politics and their approach to climate change. The current curriculum for British Columbia, which was the first province to institute a carbon tax [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref079">79</a>] and the only province where a Member of Parliament from the Green Party has been elected [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref080">80</a>] has a similar score in our framework as Alberta, which, until 2015, had the same conservative political party in leadership for over forty years [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref081">81</a>]. It is reassuring that we found no evidence for the effect of political intervention on curriculum development.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some curriculum developers noted a conflict between keeping content to a manageable level in courses and including a variety of topics. If climate change is to receive more coverage, especially in provinces which did not address it fully, then curriculum writers would need to be convinced that it truly merits special treatment. But overall, our interviewees report that the curriculum development process seems to function well, encourages a balanced approach, and relies on expert opinion from a variety of sources including researchers and university faculties of education. Combined with the tendency to follow other provinces that are showing leadership on subjects like climate change, we would suggest that this aspect of climate change education will continue to improve as curricula undergo their regular updates and revisions. Perhaps the central flaw with curriculum documents is their turnover time, often more than 15 years (Manitoba and New Brunswick’s curricula were written in 2001 and 2002 respectively). Learning objectives in these documents that run counter to the scientific consensus may be attributed more to age than to intentional misrepresentations. But for a subject like climate change where the science is improving so quickly, updates may be needed more frequently. Additionally, online resources based on the latest peer-reviewed knowledge could be updated with more ease, and professional development could help to bridge the gap between current science and teacher understanding.</p>
