 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This analysis does not provide a complete picture on climate change education in secondary schools in Canada. Only curriculum documents that were available on government websites were examined, which would exclude locally developed courses (courses which are created for a small area or even a single school). International Baccalaureate courses, which are offered at 156 of the 3400 (or 4%) secondary schools in Canada [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref071">71</a>], and Advanced Placement courses, which are taken by less than 1% of Canadian secondary students [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref072">72</a>], were also not considered. Finally, it should be noted when comparing the different curricula that a province which covers more core teaching topics is not necessarily giving a more thorough treatment of climate change than a province covering fewer topics. For instance, British Columbia covers three topics, but does so in a mandatory course, while Alberta covers four topics, but in a course that not every student will take. In some provinces climate change may have received a more detailed treatment in a different course, for instance in a geography or social science course, or prior to the secondary level. However, we only examined science courses.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyses such as this one also have temporal limitations: they are snapshots in time, and curriculum development is an ongoing effort. For instance, in June 2018 British Columbia published a major update to its science curriculum, with a full transition expected by the 2019/2020 school year [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref073">73</a>]. The three mandatory learning objectives shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218305.g001" href="#pone.0218305.g001">Fig 1</a> have been removed from Grade 10 in the draft documents for the new curriculum (though these objectives are retained at the elementary level) while new, optional courses in Grade 11 and 12 cover every core topic except for “Experts agree”. Some of these updates, such as acknowledging the importance of vegetarian diets to climate mitigation, are excellent examples of education making changes to reflect the latest scientific understanding [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref004">4</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref074">74</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref075">75</a>]. Because our interviews with curriculum writers referred to the old curriculum documents we make use of the old curriculum in our analysis, but provide details for the new draft documents in

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are also numerous ways of presenting climate change (or environmental education) in the curricula. Some provinces might attempt to infuse such a topic throughout many different courses and grade levels (“mainstreaming”), while others might design one course with a significant environmental component to cover all desired learning objectives. It is also possible that teachers spend more time on environmental issues in other subjects or use climate change as an example in other units in the science curriculum.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But there is some evidence that mainstreaming climate change produces inferior results, and it is better to have dedicated courses or units on important topics. When the Ontario government eliminated the environmental science course, intending for ecological concepts to be taught throughout the curriculum, teachers tended to neglect environmental science in favour of the core curriculum [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref076">76</a>]. Another, more recent study consisting of interviews with 11 educators teaching climate change in Alberta found that teachers were already wary of the subject of climate change, partially due to its inherently interdisciplinary nature and the perception of it being a fringe subject in the curriculum [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref077">77</a>]. Not all teachers have interdisciplinary training, so spreading environmental issues throughout many courses may result in them not properly addressing those issues. It also eliminates the credibility that the issue gains by being part of the explicit curriculum. Conversely, if teachers receive proper training and feel comfortable integrating these topics, it might prove to be a more effective method. One curriculum development interviewee, for instance, saw the integration of sustainability concepts throughout different grades and courses as a strong, positive characteristic of their province’s education system.
