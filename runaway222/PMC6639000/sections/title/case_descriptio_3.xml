 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Five million students are enrolled in public schools in Canada, with approximately 350 000 students graduating from secondary school in a typical year [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref029">29</a>]. Canada is divided into ten provinces and three territories, each of which controls its own educational system. (As the territories are sparsely populated and mostly borrow educational materials from nearby provinces, in this paper we sometimes reference only “provinces” for the sake of simplicity). Education can vary between the provinces, resulting in different curriculum documents, standardized tests, teacher education programs and so forth. Within these educational systems, science is split into ‘silo’ subjects; chemistry, biology and physics are common, while earth and space science or environmental science are less likely to be present at all grade levels. Teachers at the secondary level are subject specialists, meaning they are trained to teach a few specific subjects, rather than all subjects. Amongst science teachers, for example, some are qualified to teach chemistry, but not biology or physics. This is important for climate change, which is not a ‘silo’ subject, but is instead interdisciplinary in nature.
