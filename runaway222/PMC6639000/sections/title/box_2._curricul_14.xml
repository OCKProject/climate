 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 1: So is it, is it a political issue? Yeah, absolutely. How you deal with it–it has to be a very balanced approach.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 1: Like I said, you basically have to be fence-sitting even if you’re very passionate about these issues. And I know that it’s probably not that easy with some teachers, and it’s probably not even always easy with me on some issues because I get so passionate about them. I, you know, I weigh in on it. But at the end of the day it has to be a very neutral approach otherwise you’re going to introduce a bias into all of these documents that you’ve put together.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 2: I think we’ve sort of minimized the concern out there, and I’m sure there’s some groups would like a little more on climate change. But again, I’ll say to them, “Our job’s to open the door to talk about it, … our job as teachers isn’t to say climate change is good or bad, right?” It’s to say, “We want students to understand how scientists develop the information that they do.”</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 3: …so I think that, yes, the fact that people can have strong interests and can try to sway individuals for favour, for power, for money or whatever—we want students to be able to have the skills to be able to sift through information and make informed decisions that will enable them to survive better and flourish.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 4: I always tell my students, I may share my opinion, but it’s nothing more than, and I never ask them to agree with me. In fact, I would prefer for them—my goal is to say, “this is just one more piece of information that you have got to verify and agree or disagree with.”</p>
