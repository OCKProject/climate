 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All data were sampled at plot level, averaged to block level and analyzed using the statistical environment R (
  <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">R Development Core Team, 2016</a>). An exploratory analyses of the data was done using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) set to two dimensions with a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity test in the “vegan” package in R (
  <a rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-31">Oksanen et al., 2018</a>). NDMS allowed us to visualize and interpret the relationship between the climatic variables and our response variables with the use of rank orders. The exploratory variables used in the NMDS included all climatic variables (
  <a rid="table-2" ref-type="table" href="#table-2">Table 2</a>) except the extreme event variable (EE), because we recorded no extreme events except three episodes on the island of Rebbenes. We also included biomass measured in 2017 in the NMDS analyses and we assumed that, since 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> is a slow growing species, the biomass measured in 2017 was a good overall representative measure for each site.

  <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">Pinheiro et al., 2017</a>) were used with block as the random factor and mean shoot length or mean berry frequency as response variables. The choice of predictor variables was based on the exploratory NMDS results and Pearson correlation values between variables. We used Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to rank the models and chose the final model with the lowest AIC value (
