 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We selected through the Akaike information criterion (AIC) GDD+1C, out of all three growing degree day variables, in interaction with FD as the optimal predictor-variable combination since it had the lowest AIC. We used this combination for both mean shoot length and mean berry frequency as response variables.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results from the linear mixed effects models showed a significant interaction between FD and GDD+1 on both mean shoot length and mean berry production (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5" href="#supp-5">Table S2</a> ). Thus, during colder growing seasons there was a negative effect of an increase of FD on mean shoot length and milder negative effect on berry production, while under warmer growing seasons this negative effect was less apparent in shoot length and turned positive in the case of berry production (
