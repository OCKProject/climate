 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is taking place across all seasons. In tundra ecosystems in particular, there is evidence of a long term warming trend during winter, spring and summer (
  <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">Epstein et al., 2017</a>) resulting in longer growing seasons and varying snow cover conditions (
  <a rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-51">Xu et al., 2013</a>). An increase in extreme winter warming events, where snow melts in midwinter and exposes tundra vegetation to subsequent frost damage, has also been reported (
  <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">Bjerke et al., 2017</a>). Studying how dominant tundra species respond to this season-specific climatic variability, can help predict the potential resilience of tundra communities under climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species with traits providing reduced sensitivity to environmental variability, such as long-life span and seed bank accumulation (i.e., storage effects) (
  <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Chesson, 2000</a>), or with plastic growth rates (
  <a rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-21">Jump &amp; Penuelas, 2005</a>), are expected to have high overall resistance to climate change (
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Oliver et al., 2015</a>). Here we define resistance as the capacity of a species to remain stable in the face of environmental perturbations through persistence (i.e., positive growth and reproduction) (
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Oliver et al., 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">Ingrisch &amp; Bahn, 2018</a>). Thus, under the predicted climate warming scenario, a resistant species should grow and reproduce at a similar or higher rate under warmer conditions. For example, shrubs, which account for much of the biomass in tundra ecosystems (
  <a rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-46">Walker et al., 2005</a>), appear resistant to increasing summer temperatures, responding with increased biomass and flowering (
  <a rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-29">Myers-Smith et al., 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Buizer et al., 2012</a>). However, some shrubs display poor resistance signs, such as shoot death and low productivity, in response to changing winter conditions, e.g., extreme winter warming events (
  <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">Bjerke et al., 2014</a>). Hence, the overall resistance of tundra shrubs to climatic variability appears to be season-dependent and is currently not well understood.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A common approach for studying the impact of climate change on plant resistance is through manipulation experiments during the growing season (e.g.,  
  <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Elmendorf et al., 2012</a>). However, experimental studies have been found to under predict the effects of climate change (
  <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Wolkovich et al., 2012</a>). Further, there are calls for the integration of summer and winter conditions in climate studies, especially in seasonally snow-covered ecosystems (
  <a rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-41">Sanders-DeMott &amp; Templer, 2017</a>). Thus, observational studies encompassing a range of ongoing yet differing climate change developments during all seasons, can provide insight in to the long-term adaptive potential of species and help predict their resistance to climate change.

  <span class="italic">Empetrum nigrum</span> is an evergreen dwarf shrub that creates vast areas of monospecific vegetation in tundra ecosystems across the northern hemisphere (
  <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">Tybirk et al., 2000</a>). 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> is a niche constructing species and its ecosystem modifying properties are well documented (
  <a rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-47">Wardle et al., 1998</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">Tybirk et al., 2000</a>). For example, 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> has been linked to a reduction in species richness in tundra plant communities (
  <a rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-28">Mod et al., 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-11">Bråthen, Gonzalez &amp; Yoccoz, 2018</a>), and has been found to slow down the recovery of tundra heathland after simulated winter warming damage mainly due to its allelopathic properties (
  <a rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-1">Aerts, 2010</a>). Further, 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> has responded to warmer growing seasons with an increase in biomass, flowering, and fruiting in both manipulation experiments (
  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Buizer et al., 2012</a>) and observational studies (
  <a rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-11">Bråthen, Gonzalez &amp; Yoccoz, 2018</a>). However, there are also reports of decreasing reproductive and vegetative output caused by winter extreme events (
  <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Bokhorst et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-8">Bokhorst et al., 2011</a>) and outbreaks of the pathogenic fungus 
  <span class="italic">Arwidssonia empetri</span> under increased snow cover (
  <a rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-33">Olofsson et al., 2011</a>). Nevertheless, 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> thrives in a wide range of habitats, from exposed ridges to more sheltered depressions and appears to have high morphological plasticity to cope with varying snow cover conditions (
  <a rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-3">Bienau et al., 2014</a>), in addition to being resistant to ice encapsulation (
  <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Preece, Callaghan &amp; Phoenix, 2012</a>). Hence, the future abundance and distribution of 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> in tundra ecosystems under climate change is currently not well understood. Since 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> has a strong influence on plant community structure and diversity, hence reducing plant community resilience (
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Oliver et al., 2015</a>), understanding its response to climate change is imperative for making predictions of the vast areas where it is present.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The goal of our study was to investigate the resistance of 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> to fluctuations of temperature and precipitation over multiple winter and summer seasons along a steep climatic gradient. To achieve this, we measured over six years shoot growth, berry production, and vegetative cover in five 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> dominated tundra heathlands, in a total of 144 plots covering a 200-km gradient from oceanic to continental climate. Using soil-surface temperature loggers, we registered how often the vegetation was exposed to freezing temperatures (i.e., number of freezing days) in addition to fluctuations in growing season length, summer temperature and growing degree days. We expect 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> to be a species capable of persisting under varying environmental conditions because it has a broad ecological niche occurring along a gradient of temperature, moisture and bedrock types (
  <a rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-30">Norwegian Biodiversity Information Center (NBIC), 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-11">Bråthen, Gonzalez &amp; Yoccoz, 2018</a>), it is able to dominate heathlands under a range of climates (
  <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Büntgen et al., 2015</a>), and is a slow growing, long lived species (
  <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">Bell &amp; Tallis, 1973</a>). However, we still expect 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> fitness to be defined by climatic conditions across all seasons and hypothesize that shoot length and berry production will be dependent on an interaction of growing season and winter conditions. Further, we aim to confirm (a) that higher summer temperatures and longer growing seasons can give longer shoots and more berries (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Buizer et al., 2012</a>) and, (b) that freezing exposure (e.g.,  
  <a rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-9">Bokhorst et al., 2009</a>) or shallow snow cover (
  <a rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-3">Bienau et al., 2014</a>) can give shorter shoots or decrease 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> biomass and cover.
