   <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> dominated tundra heathlands in northern Norway between 69.17–70.02°N and 18.75–20.9°E (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>). The study sites were located at the 
   <span class="italic">Betula pubescens</span> tree line ecotone along a 200-km climatic gradient, ranging from oceanic to continental conditions. The sites were chosen due to their contrasting climatic conditions, that is, coastal sites are normally characterized by cool summers, mild winters and varying snow cover conditions, while continental sites have warm summers and extremely cold winters which allow for a stable and deep snow cover. Snow cover at the study sites usually remains until mid-June and bedrock is mainly gabbro (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In June 2011, ten blocks were established in each of the sites (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>). Blocks had at least 90% 
   <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> cover, a maximum slope of 5 degrees and were placed a minimum of five meters apart to avoid including the same 
   <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> individual in different blocks, since long-lived, clonally reproducing species can have multiple modular units (
   <a rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-26">Miller, 2012</a>). Each block consisted of three 50 cm × 50 cm permanently marked plots placed beside each other with a 40-cm separation. Two blocks were unfortunately dropped during the study due to diverse issues (one in Skibotn and one in Gukhesjávri, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>), hence we had a total of 48 blocks and 144 plots for vegetation analyses.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each year, all sites were sampled within one or two days from each other at the end of the growing season in late August. 
   <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> cover and berry production were measured with the use of a wooden frame (50 cm × 50 cm) divided in 16 subplots (0.0125 m
   <span class="sup">2</span> each) by registering presence/absence of live 
   <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> biomass and 
   <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> berries in the 16 subplots. Shoot length was measured by selecting five different annual shoots each year (i.e., shoots grown during that summer) in each plot (total of 15 shoots per block). In 2017, 
   <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> biomass per plot was measured using the point intercept method with 20 pins per plot (
   <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">Bråthen &amp; Hagberg, 2004</a>) and converting the total number of hits using established calibration functions (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature and precipitation based climatic variables were used in this study (
   <a rid="table-2" ref-type="table" href="#table-2">Table 2</a>). Three temperature loggers (Thermochron iButtons
   <span class="sup">®</span>) were placed at ground level at each site (i.e., one at the top, middle and bottom of study site) to measure soil surface temperature every 3 h all year round (during 2010–2016) and were used to calculate all temperature variables. Mean daily temperatures per site were calculated as the average of the three temperature loggers. Number of freezing days and annual climatic variables were calculated from sampling date to sampling date (i.e., from late August to late August next year) since 
   <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> flower and vegetative buds are fully formed at the end of the growing season and are therefore subjected to any climatic variability during the previous autumn/winter (
   <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">Bell &amp; Tallis, 1973</a>). Hence, the number of freezing days for each sampling year belongs to the previous winter season. We calculated three growing degree day variables by summing all daily mean temperatures above 1 °C (GDD+1), 2 °C (GDD+2) and 5 °C (GDD+5) starting from the date when the average daily logger temperature was above 1 °C, 2 °C or 5 °C respectively, for three or more consecutive days until the sampling date. Although the common threshold in northern climates to determine both growing season and growing degree days is set to &gt;5 °C (GDD+5) (
   <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Körner, 1999</a>), 
   <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> is known to both flower and start growing straight after snow melt (i.e., GDD+1 or GDD+2), and we were interested in testing this assumption. We further calculated the number of winter warming extreme events (EE) during December-March, by summing the periods of more than two days when air temperatures were above +2 °C (
   <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Bokhorst et al., 2012</a>) and soil surface temperatures were above +1 °C (suggesting absence of snow). Precipitation variables were gathered from publicly available maps and online databases (
   <a rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-42">seNorge, 2017</a>). The Continentality Index for each study site was calculated according to (
   <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Rivas-Martinez, Rivas-Saenz &amp; Penas, 2011</a>) (37), showing a range of 21.8 to 31 indicating a gradient from oceanic/maritime to continental climate.
