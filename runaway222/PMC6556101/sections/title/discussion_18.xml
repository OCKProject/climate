 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study illustrates how the common evergreen dwarf shrub 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> is resistant to fluctuating climatic conditions during the growing season and winter months by showing positive vegetative growth and reproductive output in all sites and in all years. Exposure to freezing temperatures during winter was correlated with shorter shoot growth and reduced berry production the following season, however, if the following season was warm and long it appeared to compensate for these negative effects. Thus, 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> fitness was affected by climatic conditions during both winter and spring/summer.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exposure to extreme low temperatures can damage vegetation either directly through freezing or winter desiccation, or indirectly through ice encasement after rain-on-snow episodes and refreezing of melted snow (

  <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">Bjerke et al., 2017</a>). Under varying snow cover conditions, evergreen dwarf shrub foliage is likely subjected to freezing temperatures, as their branches might protrude from the snowpack. In our study, 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> appeared to be regularly exposed to freezing temperatures during large parts of the winter months but was nevertheless able to grow and reproduce even during colder growing seasons, which suggests that this species is generally frost hardy and, as experimental studies have shown, possibly resistant to ice encapsulation (
  <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Preece, Callaghan &amp; Phoenix, 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Preece &amp; Phoenix, 2014</a>). In contrast to studies showing large mortality of 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> in tundra heathlands after extreme winter warming events (
  <a rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-9">Bokhorst et al., 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">Bjerke et al., 2014</a>), we did not find indications of browning episodes during the course of the study in spite of the low temperatures registered at most sites during the winter months. One possible explanation is that in contrast to winter warming episodes, we did not register above zero temperatures during the winter months (except for the three short episodes at the coastal site of Rebbenes) indicating spring-like development was not initiated and the plant remained dormant. 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> experiences deep dormancy during the winter months and has been found able to remain undamaged by temperatures down to −40 C (
  <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Körner, 1999</a>). Nevertheless, we did not see any indications of browning of the vegetation in our plots at the coastal site of Rebbenes the years it did experience winter warming episodes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean shoot lengths registered during our study were similar to those registered in other 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> studies (
  <a rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-49">Wipf, Rixen &amp; Mulder, 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-16">De Witte &amp; Stöcklin, 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-3">Bienau et al., 2014</a>). The small variation in shoot length between years confirms that 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> is a slow growing species with a conservative growth strategy. Thus, our assumption that the biomass measured in 2017 was an appropriate overall representation of biomass amounts of each site was supported by this finding. It is worth noting that 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> biomass was higher at continental sites, but the shoot length was the shortest. In shallow or varying snow cover conditions, 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> has been found to have short internodes and to form low mats close to the ground as to avoid having apical growth stems constantly exposed to the freezing temperatures (
  <a rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-3">Bienau et al., 2014</a>). This in turn could be a selective force on growth during summer, that is, sites with low snow cover might have densely structured dwarf shrubs with a larger number of shoots, as indicated by biomass amounts, but shorter as to be less exposed during winter months. Thus, winter conditions could affect 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> structure and hence modify the growth pattern during the summer months, reflecting the complex interactions between all seasons on this common tundra species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found a negative effect of increasing freezing days on mean shoot length, however, warmer growing season conditions appeared to compensate for this effect, confirming our hypothesis that the overall resistance of this species is defined by both spring/summer and winter conditions. The evergreen dwarf shrub 
  <span class="italic">Cassiope tetragona</span>, has recently been found to respond to damage by experimental winter freezing conditions with enhanced shoot growth (
  <a rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-27">Milner et al., 2016</a>). Though we did not monitor yearly shoot mortality or damage, our study suggests that 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> might respond in a similar manner to winter freezing exposure, by showing a plastic growth rate dependent also on spring and summer climatic conditions. Nevertheless, 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> showed positive shoot growth in all sites during all years indicating the resistance of this species to climatic variability.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Berry production was also found dependent on spring/summer and winter conditions and appeared to be specially promoted by warmer and longer summers, which could indicate that 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> berry production could increase under climate warming. However, we did also find a slight increase of berry frequency with continentality that also could be due to an increase in biomass, as berry frequency was mostly related with NMDS axis 2 which corresponded with biomass amounts. This would confirm, in line with previous studies, increasing amounts of biomass to be associated with higher flowering and fruiting (
  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Buizer et al., 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-22">Kaarlejarvi et al., 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-11">Bråthen, Gonzalez &amp; Yoccoz, 2018</a>). Thus, the increase in berry production associated with increasing freezing days and warmer summers could be a direct result of an increase in biomass due to compensatory shoot growth stimulated by freezing during the colder seasons. 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> flowering buds are formed during the previous autumn and both flower and berry production have been found unaffected by experimental winter warming treatments and icing episodes (
  <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Preece, Callaghan &amp; Phoenix, 2012</a>). Thus, a higher reproductive output might be expected if the growing season conditions are optimal (long and warm growing seasons as showed in this study) despite the colder winter conditions. Nevertheless, freezing or icing-induced enhancement of vegetative or reproductive output has important implications for climate change studies and as to avoid biased conclusions both winter and growing season conditions should be considered.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is worth noting that growing season length starting with +1 degrees Celsius explained most variation in both shoot length and berry productivity. Some evergreen species are known to break winter dormancy even before snow melt, as soon as light penetrates a shallow snow cover (
  <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Körner, 1999</a>). It appears 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> is able to start growth and reproduction very early during the growing season, which could be advantageous in light of the predicted earlier spring snowmelt following climate change (
  <a rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-48">Wipf, 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">Krab, Roennefarth &amp; Becher, 2018</a>). Hence, the predicted increase in growing season length with climate change could promote 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> encroachment in areas where it is dominant. Recent studies have particularly showed an encroachment of 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> in tundra areas (
  <a rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-44">Vowles et al., 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-45">Vuorinen et al., 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-25">Maliniemi et al., 2018</a>) which might be explained by its ability to respond to varying climatic conditions as shown here, and its niche construction ability (
  <a rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-11">Bråthen, Gonzalez &amp; Yoccoz, 2018</a>).
