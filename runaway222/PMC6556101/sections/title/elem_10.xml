 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both biotic and climatic variables varied between years and along the climatic gradient (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Figs. 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">3</a>). Mean shoot length varied among sites and was between 0.65 and 3.2 cm (mean of 1.3 cm across sites), with shorter shoots found in continental sites (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2A</a>). Shoot length varied little between years (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2B</a>). Mean berry frequency, in contrast, had a larger variation between years and among sites (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Figs. 2C</a>–
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">2D</a>). The cover of 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> during the six years was constant in all plots showing 16 out of 16 subplots with 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> live biomass (supplemental raw data). We did not register any large-scale mortality or browning during the study in any of our study plots (VT González, 2010–2016, pers. obs.). 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> biomass registered in 2017 increased with continentality index, finding more biomass in continental areas, whereas mean shoot length was on average shorter in continental areas (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was a sharp contrast in temperature between study sites along the climatic gradient during the winter months (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Fig. S1</a>), finding a fluctuating snow cover (i.e., soil surface temperature loggers registered below freezing temperatures) mainly at the two most continental sites (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Fig. S1</a>). Among the climatic variables, the number of freezing days (FD), non-growing season precipitation (NGSP) and growing season length (GSL) were contrasting between sites rather than between years, finding three times fewer freezing days and twice the precipitation at the coast (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">Figs. 3A</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">3K</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">3G</a>). The two most continental sites had many freezing days each year, registering on average seven months a year with freezing temperatures (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Fig. S1</a>), though FD were registered along the entire climatic gradient and in all years (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Fig. S1</a>). Mean summer temperature (ST) varied less among sites and more between years (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">Fig. 3F</a>), while growing degree days (GDD) and growing season precipitation (GSP) varied between both sites and years (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">Figs. 3C</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">3D</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">3I</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">3J</a>). No extreme winter warming episodes (EE) were registered except for the island of Rebbenes where three episodes occurred between 8–10 February 2012, between 4–5 December 2014, and finally between 15–18 of March in 2015.
