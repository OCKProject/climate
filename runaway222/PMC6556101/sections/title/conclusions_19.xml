 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, our study highlights the synergistic effect of all seasons on the growth and reproduction of the common evergreen dwarf shrub 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span>. The findings presented here, suggest that 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> is frost hardy and able to persist under varying winter temperature conditions by showing increased reproductive and vegetative output under warmer growing season conditions, thus further perpetuating the positive feedback surrounding shrub expansion in the tundra in connection with climate change (
