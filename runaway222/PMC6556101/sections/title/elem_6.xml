 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature and precipitation based climatic variables were used in this study (
  <a rid="table-2" ref-type="table" href="#table-2">Table 2</a>). Three temperature loggers (Thermochron iButtons
  <span class="sup">®</span>) were placed at ground level at each site (i.e., one at the top, middle and bottom of study site) to measure soil surface temperature every 3 h all year round (during 2010–2016) and were used to calculate all temperature variables. Mean daily temperatures per site were calculated as the average of the three temperature loggers. Number of freezing days and annual climatic variables were calculated from sampling date to sampling date (i.e., from late August to late August next year) since 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> flower and vegetative buds are fully formed at the end of the growing season and are therefore subjected to any climatic variability during the previous autumn/winter (
  <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">Bell &amp; Tallis, 1973</a>). Hence, the number of freezing days for each sampling year belongs to the previous winter season. We calculated three growing degree day variables by summing all daily mean temperatures above 1 °C (GDD+1), 2 °C (GDD+2) and 5 °C (GDD+5) starting from the date when the average daily logger temperature was above 1 °C, 2 °C or 5 °C respectively, for three or more consecutive days until the sampling date. Although the common threshold in northern climates to determine both growing season and growing degree days is set to &gt;5 °C (GDD+5) (
  <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Körner, 1999</a>), 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> is known to both flower and start growing straight after snow melt (i.e., GDD+1 or GDD+2), and we were interested in testing this assumption. We further calculated the number of winter warming extreme events (EE) during December-March, by summing the periods of more than two days when air temperatures were above +2 °C (
  <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Bokhorst et al., 2012</a>) and soil surface temperatures were above +1 °C (suggesting absence of snow). Precipitation variables were gathered from publicly available maps and online databases (
  <a rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-42">seNorge, 2017</a>). The Continentality Index for each study site was calculated according to (
  <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Rivas-Martinez, Rivas-Saenz &amp; Penas, 2011</a>) (37), showing a range of 21.8 to 31 indicating a gradient from oceanic/maritime to continental climate.
