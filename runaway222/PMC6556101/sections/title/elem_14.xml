 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) exploratory analyses had a stress value of 0.09 indicating a good fit of the data with the number of selected dimensions (i.e., two). Mean shoot length was mainly related to NMDS axis 1 and partly to axis 2, whereas berry frequency was largely related to axis 2. Further, the response variables differed in their correlation with the ordination space (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>) finding that berry frequency had a low correlation value (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.01) while mean shoot length was better correlated with the ordination space (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.43). The climatic variables varied also in the relation with the NMDS axes. The first axis was strongly related with FD, followed by GSP and NGSP (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" href="#fig-5">Fig. 5</a>). The second axis was related with all other variables, that is, growing season length (GSL), summer temperature (ST), all three growing degree day variables (GDD+1, GDD+2, GDD+3) and biomass (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" href="#fig-5">Fig. 5</a>). Overall, from the first NMDS axis, FD was the best correlated variable with the ordination space (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" href="#fig-5">Fig. 5</a>) while from the second NMDS axis, although biomass appeared as the strongest variable, the effect of all variables was small and similar (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" href="#fig-5">Fig. 5</a>). Further, all sampling years appeared to be climatically similar (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3" href="#supp-3">Fig. S2A</a>) and there was a climatic overlapping among sites, except for the two most continental sites (continentality index (CI) of 30.1 and 31) and the mid-continental site (CI of 24.2) (

   <p>The plot illustrates the relationship between response variables (green arrows): mean shoot length (Shoot) and mean berry frequency (Berry) and predictor variables (in blue) with the ordination space: freezing days (FD), growing degree days (GDD), summer temperature (ST), growing season length (GSL), growing season precipitation (GSP) and non-growing season precipitation (NGSP).</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Pearson correlation tests among the predictor variables selected by the NMDS, showed that several variables were correlated to each other (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4" href="#supp-4">Table S1</a>). A main finding was that FD was correlated with all other variables except GDD (all three). Further, GDD (all three) were strongly positively correlated with ST and GSL (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4" href="#supp-4">Table S1</a>). Thus, to test the main hypothesis of our study (i.e., understanding the effect of climatic fluctuations during all seasons on 
  <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> resistance), the NMDS results and Pearson correlation values suggested the best climatic variables were the number of freezing days (FD) and the growing degree variables (GDD+1, GDD+2, GDD+5), which represented winter and spring/summer seasons respectively.
