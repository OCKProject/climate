  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both biotic and climatic variables varied between years and along the climatic gradient (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Figs. 2</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">3</a>). Mean shoot length varied among sites and was between 0.65 and 3.2 cm (mean of 1.3 cm across sites), with shorter shoots found in continental sites (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2A</a>). Shoot length varied little between years (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2B</a>). Mean berry frequency, in contrast, had a larger variation between years and among sites (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Figs. 2C</a>–
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">2D</a>). The cover of 
   <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> during the six years was constant in all plots showing 16 out of 16 subplots with 
   <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> live biomass (supplemental raw data). We did not register any large-scale mortality or browning during the study in any of our study plots (VT González, 2010–2016, pers. obs.). 
   <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> biomass registered in 2017 increased with continentality index, finding more biomass in continental areas, whereas mean shoot length was on average shorter in continental areas (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was a sharp contrast in temperature between study sites along the climatic gradient during the winter months (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Fig. S1</a>), finding a fluctuating snow cover (i.e., soil surface temperature loggers registered below freezing temperatures) mainly at the two most continental sites (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Fig. S1</a>). Among the climatic variables, the number of freezing days (FD), non-growing season precipitation (NGSP) and growing season length (GSL) were contrasting between sites rather than between years, finding three times fewer freezing days and twice the precipitation at the coast (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">Figs. 3A</a>, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">3K</a>, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">3G</a>). The two most continental sites had many freezing days each year, registering on average seven months a year with freezing temperatures (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Fig. S1</a>), though FD were registered along the entire climatic gradient and in all years (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Fig. S1</a>). Mean summer temperature (ST) varied less among sites and more between years (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">Fig. 3F</a>), while growing degree days (GDD) and growing season precipitation (GSP) varied between both sites and years (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">Figs. 3C</a>, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">3D</a>, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">3I</a>, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">3J</a>). No extreme winter warming episodes (EE) were registered except for the island of Rebbenes where three episodes occurred between 8–10 February 2012, between 4–5 December 2014, and finally between 15–18 of March in 2015.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) exploratory analyses had a stress value of 0.09 indicating a good fit of the data with the number of selected dimensions (i.e., two). Mean shoot length was mainly related to NMDS axis 1 and partly to axis 2, whereas berry frequency was largely related to axis 2. Further, the response variables differed in their correlation with the ordination space (
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>) finding that berry frequency had a low correlation value (
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.01) while mean shoot length was better correlated with the ordination space (
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.43). The climatic variables varied also in the relation with the NMDS axes. The first axis was strongly related with FD, followed by GSP and NGSP (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" href="#fig-5">Fig. 5</a>). The second axis was related with all other variables, that is, growing season length (GSL), summer temperature (ST), all three growing degree day variables (GDD+1, GDD+2, GDD+3) and biomass (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" href="#fig-5">Fig. 5</a>). Overall, from the first NMDS axis, FD was the best correlated variable with the ordination space (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" href="#fig-5">Fig. 5</a>) while from the second NMDS axis, although biomass appeared as the strongest variable, the effect of all variables was small and similar (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" href="#fig-5">Fig. 5</a>). Further, all sampling years appeared to be climatically similar (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3" href="#supp-3">Fig. S2A</a>) and there was a climatic overlapping among sites, except for the two most continental sites (continentality index (CI) of 30.1 and 31) and the mid-continental site (CI of 24.2) (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3" href="#supp-3">Fig. S2B</a>).

    <p>The plot illustrates the relationship between response variables (green arrows): mean shoot length (Shoot) and mean berry frequency (Berry) and predictor variables (in blue) with the ordination space: freezing days (FD), growing degree days (GDD), summer temperature (ST), growing season length (GSL), growing season precipitation (GSP) and non-growing season precipitation (NGSP).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Pearson correlation tests among the predictor variables selected by the NMDS, showed that several variables were correlated to each other (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4" href="#supp-4">Table S1</a>). A main finding was that FD was correlated with all other variables except GDD (all three). Further, GDD (all three) were strongly positively correlated with ST and GSL (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4" href="#supp-4">Table S1</a>). Thus, to test the main hypothesis of our study (i.e., understanding the effect of climatic fluctuations during all seasons on 
   <span class="italic">E. nigrum</span> resistance), the NMDS results and Pearson correlation values suggested the best climatic variables were the number of freezing days (FD) and the growing degree variables (GDD+1, GDD+2, GDD+5), which represented winter and spring/summer seasons respectively.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We selected through the Akaike information criterion (AIC) GDD+1C, out of all three growing degree day variables, in interaction with FD as the optimal predictor-variable combination since it had the lowest AIC. We used this combination for both mean shoot length and mean berry frequency as response variables.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results from the linear mixed effects models showed a significant interaction between FD and GDD+1 on both mean shoot length and mean berry production (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5" href="#supp-5">Table S2</a> ). Thus, during colder growing seasons there was a negative effect of an increase of FD on mean shoot length and milder negative effect on berry production, while under warmer growing seasons this negative effect was less apparent in shoot length and turned positive in the case of berry production (
