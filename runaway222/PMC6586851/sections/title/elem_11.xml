    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>

   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) and is surrounded by the Bay of Bengal to the East and the Indian peninsula to the west. The region has a tropical climate resulting in high surface temperature during the months of April and May even leading to heat waves. On a climatological basis, most of the state has a mean temperature &gt;26 °C annually with lower temperatures observed over high altitude locations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Odisha experiences an annual average rainfall of ~1500 mm primarily from the south-west monsoon during June to September
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
   </span>. In addition, it is also influenced by the monsoon depressions and tropical cyclones that makes landfall from the Bay of Bengal both during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons.

  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A combination of station, satellite and reanalysis datasets over the past 30 years (1981 to 2010) are used to identify changes in surface temperature and its relationship to land use and land cover (LULC). The identification of LULC forced changes is based on the widely used observation minus reanalysis (OMR) technique. To characterize the change in temperature, we have used measurements of daily mean, maximum and minimum temperature at 29 stations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> and Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). In addition, we have also used daily gridded datasets from IMD

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>

The premise here is that observational trends are modulated by all processes including large scale (modern climate change) and local forcing such as LULC change, but the NNR product includes large scale forcing but not LULC change. Therefore, the difference in their trends will highlight the impact of LULC change.

The observed changes/trends in station datasets are compared with both gridded and satellite retrieved products depending on availability and accessibility of the datasets during the study period for consistency.</p>
