 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that the observations and inferences made based on annual and decadal timescales are also applicable to seasonal timescales and indicate that the changes in temperature are forced on large spatial and temporal scales. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> indicates that between 1981 and 1990 the temperature reduced by 0.3 to 0.9 °C depending on season and this is evident both on annual and seasonal scales.

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the region has warmed up since 1991 (~0.4 to 0.9 °C). It may be noted that analysis based on both gridded and station datasets show similar trends on cooling and warming during the first and subsequent two decades respectively. However the magnitude of the trends differ. The largest rate of increase in temperature is observed in the June to August (JJA) and September to November (SON) periods whilst the least is observed for December to February (DJF) period. Similar characteristics are also evident in the trends in maximum and minimum temperatures and that, irrespective of season, the minimum temperature is increasing at a much faster rate than the maximum temperature since 1991 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Studies have shown that the rapid rate of change in minimum temperature over more than 70% of the global land surface could be linked to climate change

  </span>. However, those changes arising out of LULC are expected to be more localized in space and we therefore explore these temperature changes and their spatial patterns to assess the potential influence of land use.
