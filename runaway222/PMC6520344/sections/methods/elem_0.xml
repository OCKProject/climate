  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore possible futures of global environmental change and climate policy, the scientific community has developed the so-called SSPs. The narratives behind these scenarios have been described in qualitative terms
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
   </span> and were recently quantified in integrated assessment models
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>. Designed to cover the challenges space for mitigation and adaptation, they describe five consistent pathways along which the world could develop and address all relevant aspects from population, economic development, education and health, and environmental awareness to international cooperation (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). In this study, we focus on SSP1, SSP2, and SSP3 (SSP4 and SSP5 shown in Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>), which describe a world of low, medium, and high challenges to both mitigation and adaptation, respectively. The sustainability scenario SSP1 is characterized by low population  growth, fast and inclusive economic growth, respect for environmental boundaries, low environmental impact of consumption, fast technological development, and global cooperation. SSP2 shows continuation of current trends in all aspects, whereas the regional rivalry scenario SSP3 is dominated by high population growth, slow economic development, larger environmental impact of consumption, slow technological progress, and regional fragmentation and trade barriers.
  </p>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The development of land use in these scenarios is determined by trends in the factors described below; as model results change when the input of these factors changes according to the SSP-specific storyline, these were varied in this sensitivity analysis.</p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">POP describes the population development per region over the scenario period and was quantified for the SSPs by ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
   </span>. SSP1 has lower population growth in most regions, whereas population growth in SSP3 is high in developing regions and low in developed regions.
  </p>
  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GDPpc describes the regional income per year and per capita, over the scenario period, and as derived for the SSPs  by a  long-term growth model
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
   </span> based on the population projections described above. Per-capita income grows faster in SSP1 than in SSP2, also due to faster demographic transition, whereas growth is slower in SSP3.
  </p>
  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CON describes a range of consumer preferences with respect to environmental impact of food consumption. In SSP1, orientation toward lower resource intensity leads to reduced demand for livestock products and to a reduction of waste in the food system, whereas in SSP3 an opposite development dominates.</p>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PRD describes changes in the productivity of agricultural systems over the scenario period. In SSP1, faster technological development and respect for environmental boundaries leads to increased efficiency in agricultural systems, including higher crop yields and more efficient livestock systems, whereas in SSP3 technological process in agricultural systems is rather slow.</p>
  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">LUR describes land-use regulation as part of the SSP scenarios. In SSP1, land-use regulation is described as rather strong and weak in SSP3, which is reflected both in the area designated for nature conservation, but also in the ease of conversion from natural to agricultural land.</p>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TRD describes how international trade develops over the scenario period. SSP1 is characterized by globalized trade and low trade barriers, but also by increased preference for regional production in food consumption. Contrary, SSP3 is characterized by higher trade barriers and regional fragmentation.</p>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The precise implementation of these six sets of assumptions across the three SSP scenarios varies in the six models (see further below). These sets are referred to as sensitivity factors, as each represents a collection of related scenario features relevant to the sensitivity. Bioenergy demand is not included in this analysis and does not vary across the SSP scenarios of one specific model.</p>

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
   </span> is a large-scale computer simulation model and represents the energy and land systems in one computable general equilibrium (CGE) structure. Supply, demand, investment, and trade are described by individual behavioral functions that respond to changes in the prices of production factors and commodities, as well as changes in technology and preference parameters. Production functions are formulated as multi-nested constant elasticity substitution functions. Household demand is formulated as a linear expenditure system function. A single international trade market is assumed for each traded commodity and substitution between domestic and imported commodities is based on the Armington assumption. Allocation of land by sector is formulated as a multi-nominal logit function
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
   </span>. The model contains 17 regions and 42 sectors, including 10 agricultural ones.
  </p>
  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GCAM
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span> is an integrated assessment model comprising modules for the economy, the energy system, the agriculture and land-use system, and for climate. The agriculture and land-use component
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
   </span> determines supply, demand, and prices for crops, livestock, forest products, and bioenergy in an iterative procedure to achieve market equilibrium, in interaction with agents and prices of the economy and energy system. Supply and land use is resolved for 283 world regions, and within each of the these model regions land is allocated economically based on profit maximization with an assumption of nonlinear distributions of profits for each competing use. Demand for agricultural commodities is resolved for 32 world regions, based on population, income, and price levels. GCAM allows for global trade in crops, forestry, and bioenergy. GCAM distinguishes 12 crop and forestry categories, 6 animal categories, and bioenergy, in 32 or 283 world regions for demand and production, respectively.
  </p>
  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GLOBIOM
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
   </span> is the land component of the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM integrated assessment model. It is a global partial equilibrium model covering agriculture, forestry, and bioenergy as the three main competing land-use sectors. For its production processes, the model uses detailed grid-cell information on biophysical and technical cost information. Final demand is computed for households, industry, and services through own-price elasticities demand curves specific to each product. GLOBIOM has a spatial equilibrium modeling approach and represents bilateral trade based on cost competitiveness. The model has been used for integrated assessment of climate change impact and mitigation policies in land-based sectors, agricultural and timber markets foresight, analysis of food security in the long term, and its trade-offs with environmental indicators. The global version of GLOBIOM covers 30 regions and 25 agricultural commodities (18 crops and 7 livestock commodities), as well as bioenergy products.

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span>. It links information from climate models (Earth System Models), crop simulation models (e.g., Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer), and water models to a core global, partial equilibrium, multimarket model focused on the agriculture sector. Future production is influenced by price-driven changes in productivity and land use, as well as by external trends of productivity and land dynamics. Demand for agricultural commodities is a function of the price of the commodity and the prices of other competing commodities, per-capita income, total population, and consumer preferences, which are represented by price and income elasticities of demand, based originally on estimates by the United States Department of Agriculture, and adjusted to represent various future dietary scenarios and to satisfy Engel’s and Bennett’s Laws. Trade is represented as pooled trade and IMPACT distinguishes 62 primary and processed commodities, and 159 countries (for demand) and 320 Food Producing Regions.

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span> and also address specific issues of implementation in the various models (Supplementary Data 1). The quantification of drivers is described further below.
  </p>
  <p id="Par038" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GDP per capita (GDPpc) is implemented in strongly different ways across the models. Partial equilibrium models (GCAM, GLOBIOM, IMPACT and MAgPIE) have GDPpc only influencing the consumer income and therefore the demand part of the model. Contrary, the general equilibrium models (AIM and MAGNET) have GDP influence not only income but also technological change and thus also the overall structure of the economy and the supply side. Therefore, these models estimated shifters of technology change (capital and labor productivity) according to the exogenous GDP (i.e., GDPpc × population) and compute technological change endogenously. This procedure is applied in the scenario of GDPpc (_GDPpc) and POP (_POP), as both types of scenarios change total GDP and technological change.</p>
  <p id="Par039" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population (POP) according to the SSP-specific projections
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
   </span> is implemented straightforward in the partial equilibrium models GCAM, GLOBIOM, and IMPACT, and affects the entire demand system and interaction with price effects and production and trade. In MAgPIE, demand per capita is not effected by population changes due to absent price feedbacks in the demand system
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
   </span>. In the CGE models AIM and MAGNET, population size also changes the total GDP, via scenario-specific GDPpc, and thus the technological change calibrated to meet this total GDP; in these models, population affects the agricultural system both via the demand side and also the technology side.
  </p>
  <p id="Par040" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consumption preferences (CON) are described in the SSP storylines as differences in consumer behavior toward environmental impact of food consumption via food waste and share of animal products in the diet. The implementation of food waste is straightforward in all models, although with varying fractions of waste reduction. In addition, the consumption of animal products was reduced in all models in SSP1 and increased for SSP3 in some models, mostly via preference factors. Some models also included health guidelines in defining their diets for SSP1. In addition to different food-demand assumptions, the MAgPIE implementation of CON includes assumptions on soil nitrogen uptake efficiency and environmental flow protection. In CON for SSP1, the latter limits the available water for irrigation and leads to a substantial decrease in crop yields and larger crop area. For this reason, MAgPIE results were excluded from Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par041" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agricultural productivity (PRD) is characterized by fast technological change and respect for environmental boundaries for SSP1 and slower technological change in agricultural systems in SSP3. For crop systems, models mostly adjusted the progress in (potential) crop yields to reflect the storylines or linked this progress to scenario-specific GDP growth. For livestock systems, whose efficiencies are much more difficult to compare, they followed a similar approach or adjusted the speed in which systems can catch up to the most efficient ones.</p>
  <p id="Par042" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Land-use regulation (LUR) was varied across SSPs in some of the models, either by changing the areas for nature conservation or areas otherwise protected from conversion to agriculture, or by modifying the ease by which non-agricultural land can be converted to agriculture. The diversity in model approaches makes it difficult to compare level of LUR across models.</p>
  <p id="Par043" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trade development (TRD) in agricultural commodities is affected in several models by (current) trade barriers such as import taxes or export subsidies and their modification toward the future. Some other models have so-called self-sufficiency ratios, which they change to reflect the storylines.</p>

  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attributing the differences between SSP scenario results to the specific input factors is a non-trivial problem, as input factors interact in a complex system. A recently developed methodology
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
   </span> allows to identify the individual effects of an input factor and its summary interaction with other factors, with a limited number of model experiments, although at the expense of missing individual interactions. This sensitivity methodology was recently applied to CO
   <sub>2</sub> emission pathways in the SSP framework
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span> and is also used here. The model inputs that vary between the various scenarios are grouped into scenario factors and the scenario results are described to be a function of a set of these input factors (here, the six driving factors POP, GDPpc, CON, PRD, LUR and TRD described above). Varying factors between a base-case (SSP2) and the alternative scenario (SSP1, SSP3 and also SSP4 and SSP5), we derive the sensitivity of results to these drivers (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> and Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). The individual effect of one factor is derived by replacing for this factor of interest the value in the reference case (here SSP2) by the values in the alternative case (SSPX); the final effect (with opposite sign) is derived by changing all factors but the one of interest (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The difference between the individual effect and the final effect is described as the interaction effect, and describes to what extent the effect of a factor is influenced by other scenario factors. This approach does not explicitly elucidate interaction between single factors, for which much more permutations of factors would be required, but reduces the number of required model runs to identify bulk interaction of one factor with the other factors. It has been shown that this computational shortcut is an adequate approximation to the full matrix of interactions, at the expense of ignoring each single interaction term

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
   </span>. In general, and as a plausibility test, the sum of individual effects is larger than the total difference between two scenarios and the sum of final effects is smaller than the total difference between two scenarios.

  <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The advantage of the sensitivity approach applied here
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>

In order to quantify the size of a driver compared with SSP2, we use the most proximate result variable. For example, to estimate the size of the dietary transition and consumption preferences (CON) in SSP1 compared with SSP2, we use the change in food consumption of livestock products per capita in the scenario SSP2_CON1, i.e., the individual effect of the factor CON on the most proximate result variable, namely per capita consumption of livestock products. Likewise, we use the change in total trade volume for the driver trade development (TRD), in the scenario SSP2_TRD1, where only the TRD setting has been shifted toward SSP1. As for the sensitivity methodology, we derive both individual and final effect. All variables and scenarios to derive the size of change per driver are listed in Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a> and the resulting quantification is shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. To determine the sensitivities independent of driver sizes, we relate the change in output variable to the size of the driver, compared with SSP2.
