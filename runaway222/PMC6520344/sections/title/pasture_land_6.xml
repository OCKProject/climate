 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pasture area is most sensitive to PRD, CON, and LUR, although the strength of the effect across the drivers is very heterogeneous across models (Supplementary Fig.Â 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). One model (GLOBIOM) projects a decrease in pasture in SSP3 compared with SSP2, mainly due to a reduction in total production, which is caused by lower GDPpc, lower PRD, and TRD effects. In other models, the tendency toward increasing pasture through lower productivity and higher consumption and production dominates.
