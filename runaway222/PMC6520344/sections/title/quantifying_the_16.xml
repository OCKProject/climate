 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The change in most drivers compared with the SSP2 default case differs across models, as only GDP per capita (GDPpc) and population (POP) had been harmonized for the SSPs

  </span>. The quantification of all other storyline elements was done by the modeling groups individually. In order to quantify the size of a driver compared with SSP2, we use the most proximate result variable. For example, to estimate the size of the dietary transition and consumption preferences (CON) in SSP1 compared with SSP2, we use the change in food consumption of livestock products per capita in the scenario SSP2_CON1, i.e., the individual effect of the factor CON on the most proximate result variable, namely per capita consumption of livestock products. Likewise, we use the change in total trade volume for the driver trade development (TRD), in the scenario SSP2_TRD1, where only the TRD setting has been shifted toward SSP1. As for the sensitivity methodology, we derive both individual and final effect. All variables and scenarios to derive the size of change per driver are listed in Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a> and the resulting quantification is shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. To determine the sensitivities independent of driver sizes, we relate the change in output variable to the size of the driver, compared with SSP2.
