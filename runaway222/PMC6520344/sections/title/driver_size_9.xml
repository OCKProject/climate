 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SSP1 and SSP3 do not differ equally from SSP2, not in terms of total results and not in terms of sensitivity to drivers (Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5 and  7</a>). This can be due to nonlinear model dynamics, but is also caused by driver sizes for SSP1 and SSP3 not differing equally from SSP2 (Supplementary Fig. 6). Driver sizes also differ across models, as they were quantified independently and as they are influenced by modelers’ interpretation and current knowledge about possible future developments, e.g., in agricultural technology (Supplementary Fig. 6). To analyze the effect of driver sizes on the sensitivity analysis results, we relate for each sensitivity test the change in output to change in driver magnitude, so that a general elasticity of output variables to driver inputs can be assessed across models and scenarios (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). An increase in population and livestock consumption (CON) leads to an increase in cropland area and an increase of crop productivity leads to a reduction of cropland area with a relative effectiveness of more than 50% on average. Interpretation of the effectiveness of land-use regulation (LUR) is difficult due to problems in measuring the size of the driver and needs to be improved in future assessments. Although analysis of these elasticities reveal additional insights into model behavior and how sensitivities to a driver propagate through the individual models, it however does not inform on possible future variation, e.g., GDPpc seems to have a very limited effect compared with population (POP), but the possible variation over the next 50 years in GDPpc is much larger than for population, as also reflected in the SSP projections.

    <p>Elasticity of cropland area change to a change in scenario driver. The elasticity indicates how a relative change in the driver, e.g., population, translates to a relative change in output variables, in this case cropland area. For example, we see that if PRD would increase in GCAM by 10%, cropland area would be decreased by about 8% (elasticity of −0.8), whereas the same change of 10% in PRD in IMPACT would lead to a reduction of about only 2% (elasticity of −0.2). Data points per model and scenario show average across final and individual effects. Drivers’ abbreviations: CON: consumption preference, GDPpc: economic development, LUR: land-use change regulation, POP: population, PRD: agricultural productivity growth, TRD: trade development. We excluded data points of which the underlying changes were very small (&lt;0.5%)</p>
