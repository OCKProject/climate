 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spread in model results for land use and the agricultural system is large but some common patterns emerge (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). In all models, cropland area in 2050 is lower in SSP1 (−13% on average) and higher in SSP3 (+8% on average), compared with SSP2 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). This is consistent with the storylines that describe more sustainability and regard for environmental boundaries in SSP1, and stronger environmental degradation in SSP3. Similarly, out of the five models reporting pasture area, four find a decrease in SSP1 (−8% on average) and four find an increase in SSP3 (+2% on average), compared with SSP2 until 2050. Due to lower economic growth in SSP3, per-capita food demand decreases in SSP3 for five of the six models, by up to 10% compared with SSP2 until 2050. The picture is more heterogeneous for SSP1 with three models reporting an increase in 2050 and three a decrease compared with SSP2. As a combined effect of population, per-capita food demand, and other scenario-specific drivers, crop production (for food and feed) decreases for five models in SSP1 (−10% on average) and increases in SSP3 for four models (+2% on average). These projections are consistent with those observed in Popp et al.
