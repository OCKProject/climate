 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Change in crop production in SSP3 compared with SSP2 is largely explained by population (POP) and economic development (GDPpc) (Supplementary Fig.Â 4). Where consumption preference (CON) or trade development (TRD) has a large effect, the decrease in SSP1 can be more than 10%, mostly due to reduced consumption of livestock commodities or trade shifts to more efficient production systems, and consequently reduced feed demand. Faster progress in agricultural productivity (PRD) triggers higher demand and production of crops, mediated via reduced prices. The interaction effect between groups of drivers is large in some cases. For example, a strong individual effect of GDPpc on total production is much less important when consumption preferences change toward less livestock products (GLOBIOM). Although agricultural production is projected to decrease in SSP1 compared with SSP2 in almost all models, the direction of change is less clear for SSP3, as the increasing effect of population and dietary preferences is counterbalanced by the reducing effects of GDPpc and agricultural productivity. In cases where a decrease of crop production is projected for SSP3, a large sensitivity to agricultural productivity is present (GLOBIOM and IMPACT).</p>
