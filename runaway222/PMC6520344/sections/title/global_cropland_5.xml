 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sensitivity analysis on cropland shows that the most important drivers are population (POP), consumption preferences (CON), and agricultural productivity growth (PRD) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Economic growth (GDPpc) has a smaller effect and shows an opposite effect to the other scenario factors in SSP1 and SSP3 on crop area (e.g., lower population in SSP1 results in lower cropland area, yet GDPpc is higher in SSP1, which has the opposite effect). The impact of the various factors depend on the driver sizes (across models and across scenarios), as analyzed further below. The change in cropland area as a result of agricultural productivity growth (PRD) varies across models, as they differ in how agricultural technological improvement affects either area use or consumption volumes. Land-use regulation (LUR) can have a substantial contribution to changes in cropland area, as seen in IMAGE/MAGNET and IMPACT. The apparently small sensitivity of scenario outcomes to LUR in other models is related to little or no changes in this driver compared with SSP2, as shown by the analysis of drivers size (Supplementary Fig. 6), and models vary largely in their implementation of land-use regulation (Supplementary Data 
  <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">1</a>). Through availability of area for food production, LUR also affects agricultural production and food demand (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), and up to 60% of the theoretical production change through limited crop area is compensated by increased agricultural efficiencies. The spread in model results is mostly explained by diverging effects of CON and PRD on cropland area in the various models, and by one model (MAgPIE) expecting large differences between scenarios due to trade development (TRD).
