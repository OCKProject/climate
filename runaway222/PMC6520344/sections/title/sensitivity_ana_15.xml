   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> and is also used here. The model inputs that vary between the various scenarios are grouped into scenario factors and the scenario results are described to be a function of a set of these input factors (here, the six driving factors POP, GDPpc, CON, PRD, LUR and TRD described above). Varying factors between a base-case (SSP2) and the alternative scenario (SSP1, SSP3 and also SSP4 and SSP5), we derive the sensitivity of results to these drivers (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> and Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). The individual effect of one factor is derived by replacing for this factor of interest the value in the reference case (here SSP2) by the values in the alternative case (SSPX); the final effect (with opposite sign) is derived by changing all factors but the one of interest (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The difference between the individual effect and the final effect is described as the interaction effect, and describes to what extent the effect of a factor is influenced by other scenario factors. This approach does not explicitly elucidate interaction between single factors, for which much more permutations of factors would be required, but reduces the number of required model runs to identify bulk interaction of one factor with the other factors. It has been shown that this computational shortcut is an adequate approximation to the full matrix of interactions, at the expense of ignoring each single interaction term

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span>. In general, and as a plausibility test, the sum of individual effects is larger than the total difference between two scenarios and the sum of final effects is smaller than the total difference between two scenarios.

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> is that it requires less simulations than full-factorial analysis (GCAM, &gt;30,000 simulations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
