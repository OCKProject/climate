 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population (POP) and economic development (GDPpc) are the most important determinants for food demand in SSP1 (SSP3), with lower (higher) population and higher (lower) economic growth leading to more (less) per-capita demand. Population increases pushes down per-capita consumption due to higher food prices, as high population growth increases pressure on land and production. Thus, for per-capita consumption, trends of POP and GDPpc work in the same direction, while they have a compensating effect in all other variables where the size of the population plays a role (e.g., total production and total land use). Stricter regulation of land use (LUR)  appears in several models as an effective measure to limit agricultural area (see above) but leads to lower food consumption in SSP1, thus increasing the risks to food security. The interaction effect, e.g., in IMAGE/MAGNET, however, shows that the additional scenario drivers of SSP1 (consumption change (CON) and higher agricultural productivity (PRD)) reduce this adverse effect of LUR, while maintaining the beneficial effect on cropland extent. The storylines explicitly describe lower (higher) environmental impact of food consumption in SSP1 (SSP3), reflected in lower (higher) meat consumption and food waste, respectively. Caloric consumption per capita in SSP1 is very sensitive to these assumptions on consumption preferences (CON), but less so in SSP3, as this element of the storyline was implemented less stringently in SSP3 (Supplementary Fig. 6). Differences in trade development (open, globalized trade in SSP1 and restricted, regionalized trade in SSP3) hardly affect caloric consumption per capita (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Faster progress in agricultural productivity (PRD) improves caloric consumption in SSP1, whereas slower progress decreases it in SSP3, in the models with endogenous food demand response to prices. Evaluating caloric consumption separately for crops and livestock products (Supplementary Fig. 2) reveals that models show a rather homogenous picture in livestock consumption as an effect of consumer preference changes, at the global level, but diverge on per-capita consumption of crops as a result of diverse assumptions on waste reduction and products substituting animal-sourced food.
