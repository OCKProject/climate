 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of our sensitivity analysis (individual effect, final effect, and interaction effect by driver) are presented to understand changes in cropland (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) and food consumption (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), for SSP1 and SSP3. Pasture and food production are also provided in the 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">Supplementary Information</a> (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). Supplementary results for trade, prices, livestock consumption, and productivities are also provided in the Supplementary Fig. 5 but not covered by our discussion.

    <p>Sensitivity of cropland area to groups of drivers. Changes refer to change in cropland area in 2050 when moving from SSP2 to either SSP1 (SSP2- &gt; SSP1) or SSP3 (SSP2- &gt; SSP3). Individual effects (wide, light-colored bars), final effects (thin, dark-colored bars), and interaction effects (wide, very-light-colored bars) are shown for each of the six driver groups (CON: consumption preference, GDPpc: economic development, LUR: land-use regulation, POP: population, PRD: agricultural productivity growth, TRD: trade development), together with the total difference between SSP1 and SSP3, respectively, and SSP2 (TOT). The factor CON in MAgPIE also includes restrictions to irrigation (see
