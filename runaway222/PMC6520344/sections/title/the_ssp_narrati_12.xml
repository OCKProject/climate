 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore possible futures of global environmental change and climate policy, the scientific community has developed the so-called SSPs. The narratives behind these scenarios have been described in qualitative terms
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> and were recently quantified in integrated assessment models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Designed to cover the challenges space for mitigation and adaptation, they describe five consistent pathways along which the world could develop and address all relevant aspects from population, economic development, education and health, and environmental awareness to international cooperation (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). In this study, we focus on SSP1, SSP2, and SSP3 (SSP4 and SSP5 shown in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>), which describe a world of low, medium, and high challenges to both mitigation and adaptation, respectively. The sustainability scenario SSP1 is characterized by low population  growth, fast and inclusive economic growth, respect for environmental boundaries, low environmental impact of consumption, fast technological development, and global cooperation. SSP2 shows continuation of current trends in all aspects, whereas the regional rivalry scenario SSP3 is dominated by high population growth, slow economic development, larger environmental impact of consumption, slow technological progress, and regional fragmentation and trade barriers.

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The development of land use in these scenarios is determined by trends in the factors described below; as model results change when the input of these factors changes according to the SSP-specific storyline, these were varied in this sensitivity analysis.</p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">POP describes the population development per region over the scenario period and was quantified for the SSPs by ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. SSP1 has lower population growth in most regions, whereas population growth in SSP3 is high in developing regions and low in developed regions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GDPpc describes the regional income per year and per capita, over the scenario period, and as derived for the SSPs  by a  long-term growth model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> based on the population projections described above. Per-capita income grows faster in SSP1 than in SSP2, also due to faster demographic transition, whereas growth is slower in SSP3.
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CON describes a range of consumer preferences with respect to environmental impact of food consumption. In SSP1, orientation toward lower resource intensity leads to reduced demand for livestock products and to a reduction of waste in the food system, whereas in SSP3 an opposite development dominates.</p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PRD describes changes in the productivity of agricultural systems over the scenario period. In SSP1, faster technological development and respect for environmental boundaries leads to increased efficiency in agricultural systems, including higher crop yields and more efficient livestock systems, whereas in SSP3 technological process in agricultural systems is rather slow.</p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">LUR describes land-use regulation as part of the SSP scenarios. In SSP1, land-use regulation is described as rather strong and weak in SSP3, which is reflected both in the area designated for nature conservation, but also in the ease of conversion from natural to agricultural land.</p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TRD describes how international trade develops over the scenario period. SSP1 is characterized by globalized trade and low trade barriers, but also by increased preference for regional production in food consumption. Contrary, SSP3 is characterized by higher trade barriers and regional fragmentation.</p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The precise implementation of these six sets of assumptions across the three SSP scenarios varies in the six models (see further below). These sets are referred to as sensitivity factors, as each represents a collection of related scenario features relevant to the sensitivity. Bioenergy demand is not included in this analysis and does not vary across the SSP scenarios of one specific model.</p>
