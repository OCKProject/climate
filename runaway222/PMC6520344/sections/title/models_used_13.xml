   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> (either the full IAM or its land component). These models are state-of-the-art global climate–energy–economy models including a land-use component. Their quantification of land-use futures
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AIM
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span> is a large-scale computer simulation model and represents the energy and land systems in one computable general equilibrium (CGE) structure. Supply, demand, investment, and trade are described by individual behavioral functions that respond to changes in the prices of production factors and commodities, as well as changes in technology and preference parameters. Production functions are formulated as multi-nested constant elasticity substitution functions. Household demand is formulated as a linear expenditure system function. A single international trade market is assumed for each traded commodity and substitution between domestic and imported commodities is based on the Armington assumption. Allocation of land by sector is formulated as a multi-nominal logit function
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. The model contains 17 regions and 42 sectors, including 10 agricultural ones.
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GCAM
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span> is an integrated assessment model comprising modules for the economy, the energy system, the agriculture and land-use system, and for climate. The agriculture and land-use component
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span> determines supply, demand, and prices for crops, livestock, forest products, and bioenergy in an iterative procedure to achieve market equilibrium, in interaction with agents and prices of the economy and energy system. Supply and land use is resolved for 283 world regions, and within each of the these model regions land is allocated economically based on profit maximization with an assumption of nonlinear distributions of profits for each competing use. Demand for agricultural commodities is resolved for 32 world regions, based on population, income, and price levels. GCAM allows for global trade in crops, forestry, and bioenergy. GCAM distinguishes 12 crop and forestry categories, 6 animal categories, and bioenergy, in 32 or 283 world regions for demand and production, respectively.
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GLOBIOM
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span> is the land component of the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM integrated assessment model. It is a global partial equilibrium model covering agriculture, forestry, and bioenergy as the three main competing land-use sectors. For its production processes, the model uses detailed grid-cell information on biophysical and technical cost information. Final demand is computed for households, industry, and services through own-price elasticities demand curves specific to each product. GLOBIOM has a spatial equilibrium modeling approach and represents bilateral trade based on cost competitiveness. The model has been used for integrated assessment of climate change impact and mitigation policies in land-based sectors, agricultural and timber markets foresight, analysis of food security in the long term, and its trade-offs with environmental indicators. The global version of GLOBIOM covers 30 regions and 25 agricultural commodities (18 crops and 7 livestock commodities), as well as bioenergy products.

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">IMAGE-MAGNET identifies land-use scenarios from the integrated assessment model IMAGE
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span> using the CGE model MAGNET
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span> to represent the agricultural economy. MAGNET is a multi-regional, multi-sectoral, applied general equilibrium model based on neo-classical microeconomic theory, and it is an extension of the standard GTAP model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. The agricultural sector is represented in high detail compared with standard CGE models. Land supply, suitability, and potential agricultural yields are evaluated on a grid-scale in IMAGE and provided to MAGNET and used to model land as a production factor described by a land supply curve
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. Other production factors are labor, capital, and chemical inputs. Household demand depends on population, income, and income and price elasticities, whereby price elasticities change with increasing incomes, and are also influenced by consumer preferences. Trade is modeled bilaterally using the Armington assumption
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>. IMAGE and MAGNET use 26 world regions and 10 agricultural commodities.
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">IMPACT is a partial equilibrium model used to analyze long-term challenges and opportunities for food, agriculture, and natural resources at global and regional scales
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. It links information from climate models (Earth System Models), crop simulation models (e.g., Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer), and water models to a core global, partial equilibrium, multimarket model focused on the agriculture sector. Future production is influenced by price-driven changes in productivity and land use, as well as by external trends of productivity and land dynamics. Demand for agricultural commodities is a function of the price of the commodity and the prices of other competing commodities, per-capita income, total population, and consumer preferences, which are represented by price and income elasticities of demand, based originally on estimates by the United States Department of Agriculture, and adjusted to represent various future dietary scenarios and to satisfy Engel’s and Bennett’s Laws. Trade is represented as pooled trade and IMPACT distinguishes 62 primary and processed commodities, and 159 countries (for demand) and 320 Food Producing Regions.
