  <p>Sensitivity of cropland area to groups of drivers. Changes refer to change in cropland area in 2050 when moving from SSP2 to either SSP1 (SSP2- &gt; SSP1) or SSP3 (SSP2- &gt; SSP3). Individual effects (wide, light-colored bars), final effects (thin, dark-colored bars), and interaction effects (wide, very-light-colored bars) are shown for each of the six driver groups (CON: consumption preference, GDPpc: economic development, LUR: land-use regulation, POP: population, PRD: agricultural productivity growth, TRD: trade development), together with the total difference between SSP1 and SSP3, respectively, and SSP2 (TOT). The factor CON in MAgPIE also includes restrictions to irrigation (see
