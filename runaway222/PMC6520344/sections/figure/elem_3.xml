  <p>Elasticity of cropland area change to a change in scenario driver. The elasticity indicates how a relative change in the driver, e.g., population, translates to a relative change in output variables, in this case cropland area. For example, we see that if PRD would increase in GCAM by 10%, cropland area would be decreased by about 8% (elasticity of −0.8), whereas the same change of 10% in PRD in IMPACT would lead to a reduction of about only 2% (elasticity of −0.2). Data points per model and scenario show average across final and individual effects. Drivers’ abbreviations: CON: consumption preference, GDPpc: economic development, LUR: land-use change regulation, POP: population, PRD: agricultural productivity growth, TRD: trade development. We excluded data points of which the underlying changes were very small (&lt;0.5%)</p>
