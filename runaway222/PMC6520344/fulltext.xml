Long-term climate foresight studies have structured their recent analyses around five socio-economic pathways (SSPs), with consistent storylines of future macroeconomic and societal developments; however, model quantification of these scenarios shows substantial heterogeneity in land-use projections. Here we build on a recently developed sensitivity approach to identify how future land use depends on six distinct socio-economic drivers (population, wealth, consumption preferences, agricultural productivity, land-use regulation, and trade) and their interactions. Spread across models arises mostly from diverging sensitivities to long-term drivers and from various representations of land-use regulation and trade, calling for reconciliation efforts and more empirical research. Most influential determinants for future cropland and pasture extent are population and agricultural efficiency. Furthermore, land-use regulation and consumption changes can play a key role in reducing both land use and food-security risks, and need to be central elements in sustainable development strategies.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">There lacks model comparison of global land use change projections.

The exploration of future global land use in international assessments started in the 1990s (SRES)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and gained increasing importance in environmental outlooks and assessments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. During the last decade, the number of studies and models on global land-use projections has increased tremendously, reflecting concerns about land scarcity, climate change impacts or bioenergy threatening food security<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, loss of natural areas and biodiversity, and sustainable development in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, despite the central role of land use in future environmental change, the modeling and systematic model comparison of global land-use projections is still in its infancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and the uncertainty in results is large<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Land use results from multiple interactions between regionally specific demand and supply systems, numerous feedback processes, and smaller-scale factors such as land-use regulation and land ownership, and therefore projecting land-use change is highly complex. As an example, although agricultural production has increased by about 60% during the last 40 years, global cropland area has increased by only 5% as a result of increased agricultural productivity (intensification)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, the intricate interplay between demand and production, and agricultural intensification is a core determinant of future land use. To account for the range of possible developments in these drivers, long-term projections are often dealt with following a scenario approach, where fundamental uncertainties in socio-economic factors are explicitly varied along so-called storylines to explore contrasting futures. However, the range of model outcomes for such scenarios tends to be large and results may depend equally on model characteristics as on storylines and assumptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Given the importance of land-use projections for informing policy makers in the areas of climate change, food security, and biodiversity protection, it is important to investigate the spread across storylines and model results, to better understand the possible evolution of land use and the food system.</p><p id="Par4">Here we use the scenario framework of the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and their implementation by integrated assessment and agricultural models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, to explore how long-term drivers determine projections of land use and food availability. We follow a sensitivity methodology recently applied to projections of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the SSP scenarios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> to assess the contribution of each driver to the scenario outcomes. This allows us to explain model spread and results and, more importantly, to identify the key determinants of future land use, their relative importance, and interactions. Although single model studies have identified factors that determine future land use and support a transition to a sustainable land and food system, this study allows a systematic comparison across factors and models, and identifies the interaction between factors. Furthermore, the discussion highlights gaps and shortcomings in the current modeling of global land use to guide future research priorities.</p><p id="Par5">The SSP scenario framework consists of five contrasting storylines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, with SSP2 representing a baseline development with continuation of current trends, a sustainability scenario (SSP1), a regional rivalry scenario (SSP3), a fragmentation scenario (SSP4), and a fossil fuel scenario (SSP5). Here we focus on the socio-economic developments of SSP1, SSP2, and SSP3 as their land-use implications were initially explored in most detail and by the largest number of models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Results related to SSP4 and SSP5 are however also available. The SSP scenarios play a crucial role in the ongoing assessment and reports&#x000a0;by The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, in the agricultural modeling community AGMIP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and in the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project ISIMIP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and also in assessments of biodiversity within IPBES<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and probably a range of future assessments of sustainable development. The SSP narratives represent contrasting global developments with respect to population growth, economic development, technological change, consumption preferences, environmental protection, and international cooperation (see Methods and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref>). Although projections for &#x000a0;population and GDP were harmonized in quantitative terms within the SSP process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, all other storyline elements were translated into scenario drivers by each team separately, because differences in model structure hampered quantitative harmonization.</p><p id="Par6">Our analysis covers all five models that participated in the initial quantification of land use in the SSPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, namely AIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, GCAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, GLOBIOM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, IMAGE-MAGNET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and MAgPIE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, plus an additional model, IMPACT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, frequently used in agricultural assessments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">To determine the sensitivity of scenario outcomes to the scenario drivers, we rely on a sensitivity analysis protocol, which allows to identify the interaction between drivers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and which was previously applied to the analysis of CO<sub>2</sub> emission trajectories as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We distinguish six groups of scenario drivers: population growth (POP), economic growth in gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc), land-use regulation (LUR), agricultural productivity growth (PRD), consumption preferences (CON), and trade development&#x000a0; (TRD). Using a matrix of scenario experiments, the deviation of other SSPs from the SSP2 baseline is attributed to these six driver groups, showing their individual, final, and interaction effect (Supplementary Fig. 1). The individual effect describes how scenario results change if a single factor of SSP2 baseline is replaced by the one used in SSP1 (or SSP3) and the final effect shows how results in the full SSP1 (or SSP3) scenario change if this single factor is changed back to the SSP2 default setting; the interaction effect is computed as the difference between individual and final effect, and shows how other factors interact with this single factor, i.e., reduce the individual effect to the final effect (see Methods). In order to analyze how sensitivity results depend on the quantity of a driver, we derive from the experiments the size of the drivers and relate them to the change in outputs.</p><p id="Par8">We find that spread-across models arises from diverging sensitivities to long-term drivers and from various representations of land-use regulation and trade, showing the need for reconciliation and more empirical research. We identify population and agricultural efficiency as most influential drivers and show that land-use regulation and consumption changes can play a key role in reducing both land-use and food-security risks. The analysis of interactions between factors reveals that efficiencies, land-use regulation, and consumption change are most effective when ccombined, and all three need to be central elements in sustainable development strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Spread in model results</title><p id="Par9">The spread in model results for land use and the agricultural system is large but some common patterns emerge (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In all models, cropland area in 2050 is lower in SSP1 (&#x02212;13% on average) and higher in SSP3 (+8% on average), compared with SSP2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This is consistent with the storylines that describe more sustainability and regard for environmental boundaries in SSP1, and stronger environmental degradation in SSP3. Similarly, out of the five models reporting pasture area, four find a decrease in SSP1 (&#x02212;8% on average) and four find an increase in SSP3 (+2% on average), compared with SSP2 until 2050. Due to lower economic growth in SSP3, per-capita food demand decreases in SSP3 for five of the six models, by up to 10% compared with SSP2 until 2050. The picture is more heterogeneous for SSP1 with three models reporting an increase in 2050 and three a decrease compared with SSP2. As a combined effect of population, per-capita food demand, and other scenario-specific drivers, crop production (for food and feed) decreases for five models in SSP1 (&#x02212;10% on average) and increases in SSP3 for four models (+2% on average). These projections are consistent with those observed in Popp et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Key characteristics of global agriculture and land use in SSP1, SSP2 and SSP3.

Economic growth (GDPpc) has a smaller effect and shows an opposite effect to the other scenario factors in SSP1 and SSP3 on crop area (e.g., lower population in SSP1 results in lower cropland area, yet GDPpc is higher in SSP1, which has the opposite effect). The impact of the various factors depend on the driver sizes (across models and across scenarios), as analyzed further below. The change in cropland area as a result of agricultural productivity growth (PRD) varies across models, as they differ in how agricultural technological improvement affects either area use or consumption volumes. Land-use regulation (LUR) can have a substantial contribution to changes in cropland area, as seen in IMAGE/MAGNET and IMPACT. The apparently small sensitivity of scenario outcomes to LUR in other models is related to little or no changes in this driver compared with SSP2, as shown by the analysis of drivers size (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;6), and models vary largely in their implementation of land-use regulation (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Through availability of area for food production, LUR also affects agricultural production and food demand (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), and up to 60% of the theoretical production change through limited crop area is compensated by increased agricultural efficiencies. The spread in model results is mostly explained by diverging effects of CON and PRD on cropland area in the various models, and by one model (MAgPIE) expecting large differences between scenarios due to trade development&#x000a0;(TRD).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Pasture land</title><p id="Par12">Pasture area is most sensitive to PRD, CON, and LUR, although the strength of the effect across the drivers is very heterogeneous across models (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). One model (GLOBIOM) projects a decrease in pasture in SSP3 compared with SSP2, mainly due to a reduction in total production, which is caused by lower GDPpc, lower PRD, and TRD effects. In other models, the tendency toward increasing pasture through lower productivity and higher consumption and production dominates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Food demand</title><p id="Par13">Population (POP) and economic development (GDPpc) are the most important determinants for food demand in SSP1 (SSP3), with lower (higher) population and higher (lower) economic growth leading to more (less) per-capita demand. Population increases pushes down per-capita consumption due to higher food prices, as high population growth increases pressure on land and production. Thus, for per-capita consumption, trends of POP and GDPpc work in the same direction, while they have a compensating effect in all other variables where the size of the population plays a role (e.g., total production and total land use). Stricter regulation of land use (LUR)&#x000a0; appears in several models as an effective measure to limit agricultural area (see above) but leads to lower food consumption in SSP1, thus increasing the risks to food security. The interaction effect, e.g., in IMAGE/MAGNET, however, shows that the additional scenario drivers of SSP1 (consumption change (CON) and higher agricultural productivity (PRD)) reduce this adverse effect of LUR, while maintaining the beneficial effect on cropland extent. The storylines explicitly describe lower (higher) environmental impact of food consumption in SSP1 (SSP3), reflected in lower (higher) meat consumption and food waste, respectively. Caloric consumption per capita in SSP1 is very sensitive to these assumptions on consumption preferences (CON), but less so in SSP3, as this element of the storyline was implemented less stringently in SSP3 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;6). Differences in trade development (open, globalized trade in SSP1 and restricted, regionalized trade in SSP3) hardly affect caloric consumption per capita (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Faster progress in agricultural productivity (PRD) improves caloric consumption in SSP1, whereas slower progress decreases it in SSP3, in the models with endogenous food demand response to prices. Evaluating caloric consumption separately for crops and livestock products (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;2) reveals that models show a rather homogenous picture in livestock consumption as an effect of consumer preference changes, at the global level, but diverge on per-capita consumption of crops as a result of diverse assumptions on waste reduction and products substituting animal-sourced food.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Crop production</title><p id="Par14">Change in crop production in SSP3 compared with SSP2 is largely explained by population (POP) and economic development (GDPpc) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;4). Where consumption preference (CON) or trade development (TRD) has a large effect, the decrease in SSP1 can be more than 10%, mostly due to reduced consumption of livestock commodities or trade shifts to more efficient production systems, and consequently reduced feed demand. Faster progress in agricultural productivity (PRD) triggers higher demand and production of crops, mediated via reduced prices. The interaction effect between groups of drivers is large in some cases. For example, a strong individual effect of GDPpc on total production is much less important when consumption preferences change toward less livestock products (GLOBIOM). Although agricultural production is projected to decrease in SSP1 compared with SSP2 in almost all models, the direction of change is less clear for SSP3, as the increasing effect of population and dietary preferences is counterbalanced by the reducing effects of GDPpc and agricultural productivity. In cases where a decrease of crop production is projected for SSP3, a large sensitivity to agricultural productivity is present (GLOBIOM and IMPACT).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Driver size</title><p id="Par15">SSP1 and SSP3 do not differ equally from SSP2, not in terms of total results and not in terms of sensitivity to drivers (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5 and&#x000a0; 7</xref>). This can be due to nonlinear model dynamics, but is also caused by driver sizes for SSP1 and SSP3 not differing equally from SSP2 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;6). Driver sizes also differ across models, as they were quantified independently and as they are influenced by modelers&#x02019; interpretation and current knowledge about possible future developments, e.g., in agricultural technology (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;6). To analyze the effect of driver sizes on the sensitivity analysis results, we relate for each sensitivity test the change in output to change in driver magnitude, so that a general elasticity of output variables to driver inputs can be assessed across models and scenarios (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). An increase in population and livestock consumption (CON) leads to an increase in cropland area and an increase of crop productivity leads to a reduction of cropland area with a relative effectiveness of more than 50% on average. Interpretation of the effectiveness of land-use regulation (LUR) is difficult due to problems in measuring the size of the driver and needs to be improved in future assessments. Although analysis of these elasticities reveal additional insights into model behavior and how sensitivities to a driver propagate through the individual models, it however does not inform on possible future variation, e.g., GDPpc seems to have a very limited effect compared with population (POP), but the possible variation over the next 50 years in GDPpc is much larger than for population, as also reflected in the SSP projections.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Elasticity of cropland area change to a change in scenario driver. The elasticity indicates how a relative change in the driver, e.g., population, translates to a relative change in output variables, in this case cropland area. For example, we see that if PRD would increase in GCAM by 10%, cropland area would be decreased by about 8% (elasticity of &#x02212;0.8), whereas the same change of 10% in PRD in IMPACT would lead to a reduction of about only 2% (elasticity of &#x02212;0.2).

These future developments will have multiple implications for greenhouse gas emission, biodiversity, and potential for carbon uptake and bioenergy production. Decomposing drivers of change, we find that the most influential ones would be changes in agricultural productivity, consumption preferences, and population development. Land-use regulation also has a large potential to affect future land use, but is currently underrepresented in models and should receive more attention in future assessments. The possibly beneficial effects of increased trade on global land use are uncertain and partly contradict earlier findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and also require further research. Some other drivers included in the SSPs storylines may also deserve scrutiny, but are not yet quantified by global land-use models, due to technical difficulties in quantifying their impact (urban migration, inequalities, farming structure, and governance). Beyond the global dynamics addressed here, regionally diverging trends may lead to smaller effects (e.g., for dietary change due to leakage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>), or to different results for the controversial land-saving of higher crop yields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Furthermore, consistent with the SSP scenario logic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, we considered here only socio-economic drivers and did not include climate impact and mitigation elements, such as yield impacts from change in temperature and precipitation, CO<sub>2</sub> prices, or afforestation deployment for carbon sequestration. Analysis elsewhere has shown the potentially large area demand of land-based mitigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, higher intensification of croplands, and possible interaction with the food and agricultural system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">Differences across models can be explained by two main causes. First, modelers have differing quantitative interpretation of storylines. Each modeling team follows their own assumptions in terms of future productivity change, extent of diet shifts, or area protection, depending on their own assessment of past developments and possible future evolution. In some cases, drivers are not or poorly represented, such as land-use regulation, although it has a large potential to restrict future agricultural land expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Currently, global models tend to only exclude certain areas from agricultural conversion, mostly focusing on official protected areas and their assumed expansion according to international targets, but ignore specific national and sub-national regulations on land-use zoning or deforestation rates (e.g., sugar cane zoning and forest code land reserve quotas in Brazil) and, as also shown here, land-use regulation is necessary to assure the land-saving effect of agricultural intensification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Although the effectiveness of such approaches can be poor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, these regulations and land-tenure aspects are relevant to short- and medium-term conversion quantities and locations. Therefore, future model development should include more explicitly land-use regulation and its facets at various spatial scales, and also its interaction with agricultural productivity and food security. Changes in international trade is another example of parsimonious implementation, with some models considering solely adjustments to current tariffs, whereas some others assume more fundamental restrictions and amplification of global trade in a long-term perspective.</p><p id="Par18">The second cause for differences in model results comes from parameterization choices and input data selection. These would gain from being further compared, harmonized, and improved through model intercomparison exercises<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, differences in model design also play a role and reflect the various areas of focus between the tools (geochemical cycles, agricultural markets, and economy-wide analysis) and the representation of system behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. For instance, drivers behind land productivity change (prices, research investments, technology adoption, etc.) can greatly vary depending on whether the model is primarily dealing with agricultural development or deforestation. Demand feedback<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> can be omitted in models focusing on production optimization, but in this analysis we see that the spread in results also arises from diverging sensitivities in demand feedbacks, even missing in one of the models. To cope with diversity of model views, use of ensemble analyses is recommended rather than single model assessments and these now became mainstream in climate policy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and biodiversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, and in the SSP analysis of future land use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This study highlights the different sensitivity of the model responses to scenario drivers and could be used to improve the model design in the future, develop recommendation and best practices, and guide users of the model results when comparing individual model results against the whole ensemble.</p><p id="Par19">Although global land-use models have the ambition to include the relevant drivers and processes to project future large-scale land-use dynamics, the identification of key determinants of future land use needs to account for aspects currently poorly addressed by the models. Local land-management regulations, as discussed above for protected areas, are poorly represented in current models, although they can play important roles at fine scale. Land tenure, processes of intensification and technology transfer, and integration of crop cultivation and livestock with forestry and other land uses (urbanization, recreational areas, and mining) are other underrepresented factors relevant for future land projections. To identify the gaps and shortcomings in global-scale models, more rigorous model validation and evaluation on smaller scales are necessary.</p><p id="Par20">Some of the factors that we identified as key elements for future land use have been analyzed earlier. Single model studies have highlighted the importance of dietary transitions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, increased crop yields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, and livestock efficiencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, or have shown the combined effects of demand side, production, and land-use regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Beyond these earlier studies, this systematic multi-model analysis allows to compare the relative effect across the drivers and across the models. Furthermore, this study adds an analysis of interactions between factors: an increase in agricultural efficiency can reduce demand for cropland but can also trigger higher demand. Yield increase is therefore shown to be more effective in reducing land use when combined with land-use regulation and consumption changes. Similarly, land-use regulation can decrease expansion into cropland but may form a risk to food security, if not bundled with increased productivity and consumption shifts.</p><p id="Par21">Consumption changes, better land management, and increased agricultural productivity therefore appear robust and effective measures to reduce the demand for agricultural land, in particular when bundled together. As land-use development is closely tied to challenges related to biodiversity, food security, or climate, the targeting of these measures appear as a key component of the long-term sustainability agenda.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>The SSP narratives</title><p id="Par22">To explore possible futures of global environmental change and climate policy, the scientific community has developed the so-called SSPs.

Production functions are formulated as multi-nested constant elasticity substitution functions. Household demand is formulated as a linear expenditure system function. A single international trade market is assumed for each traded commodity and substitution between domestic and imported commodities is based on the Armington assumption. Allocation of land by sector is formulated as a multi-nominal logit function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

Supply and land use is resolved for 283 world regions, and within each of the these model regions land is allocated economically based on profit maximization with an assumption of nonlinear distributions of profits for each competing use. Demand for agricultural commodities is resolved for 32 world regions, based on population, income, and price levels. GCAM allows for global trade in crops, forestry, and bioenergy.

Final demand is computed for households, industry, and services through own-price elasticities demand curves specific to each product. GLOBIOM has a spatial equilibrium modeling approach and represents bilateral trade based on cost competitiveness.

The quantification of drivers is described further below.</p><p id="Par038">GDP per capita (GDPpc) is implemented in strongly different ways across the models. Partial equilibrium models (GCAM, GLOBIOM, IMPACT and MAgPIE) have GDPpc only influencing the consumer income and therefore the demand part of the model. Contrary, the general equilibrium models (AIM and MAGNET) have GDP influence not only income but also technological change and thus also the overall structure of the economy and the supply side. Therefore, these models estimated shifters of technology change (capital and labor productivity) according to the exogenous GDP (i.e., GDPpc&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;population) and compute technological change endogenously. This procedure is applied in the scenario of GDPpc (_GDPpc) and POP (_POP), as both types of scenarios change total GDP and technological change.</p><p id="Par039">Population (POP) according to the SSP-specific projections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> is implemented straightforward in the partial equilibrium models GCAM, GLOBIOM, and IMPACT, and affects the entire demand system and interaction with price effects and production and trade. In MAgPIE, demand per capita is not effected by population changes due to absent price feedbacks in the demand system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. In the CGE models AIM and MAGNET, population size also changes the total GDP, via scenario-specific GDPpc, and thus the technological change calibrated to meet this total GDP; in these models, population affects the agricultural system both via the demand side and also the technology side.</p><p id="Par040">Consumption preferences (CON) are described in the SSP storylines as&#x000a0;differences in consumer behavior toward environmental impact of food consumption via food waste and share of animal products in the diet. The implementation of food waste is straightforward in all models, although with varying fractions of waste reduction. In addition, the consumption of animal products was reduced in all models in SSP1 and increased for SSP3 in some models, mostly via preference factors. Some models also included health guidelines in defining their diets for SSP1. In addition to different food-demand assumptions, the MAgPIE implementation of CON includes assumptions on soil nitrogen uptake efficiency and environmental flow protection. In CON for SSP1, the latter limits the available water for irrigation and leads to a substantial decrease in crop yields and larger crop area.

A recently developed methodology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> allows to identify the individual effects of an input factor and its summary interaction with other factors, with a limited number of model experiments, although at the expense of missing individual interactions. This sensitivity methodology was recently applied to CO<sub>2</sub> emission pathways in the SSP framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and is also used here. The model inputs that vary between the various scenarios are grouped into scenario factors and the scenario results are described to be a function of a set of these input factors (here, the six driving factors POP, GDPpc, CON, PRD, LUR and TRD described above). Varying factors between a base-case (SSP2) and the alternative scenario (SSP1, SSP3 and also SSP4 and SSP5), we derive the sensitivity of results to these drivers (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The individual effect of one factor is derived by replacing for this factor of interest the value in the reference case (here SSP2) by the values in the alternative case (SSPX); the final effect (with opposite sign) is derived by changing all factors but the one of interest (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The difference between the individual effect and the final effect is described as the interaction effect, and describes to what extent the effect of a factor is influenced by other scenario factors. This approach does not explicitly elucidate interaction between single factors, for which much more permutations of factors would be required, but reduces the number of required model runs to identify bulk interaction of one factor with the other factors. It has been shown that this computational shortcut is an adequate approximation to the full matrix of interactions, at the expense of ignoring each single interaction term<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. In general, and as a plausibility test, the sum of individual effects is larger than the total difference between two scenarios and the sum of final effects is smaller than the total difference between two scenarios.</p><p id="Par41">The advantage of the sensitivity approach applied here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> is that it requires less simulations than full-factorial analysis (GCAM, &#x0003e;30,000 simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>), and compared with simpler approaches such as a Kaya decomposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> it can account for interaction between drivers and is not path-dependent as the regularly applied stepwise scenario approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Quantifying the size of the drivers</title><p id="Par42">The change in most drivers compared with the SSP2 default case differs across models, as only GDP per capita (GDPpc) and population (POP) had been harmonized for the SSPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The quantification of all other storyline elements was done by the modeling groups individually. In order to quantify the size of a driver compared with SSP2, we use the most proximate result variable. For example, to estimate the size of the dietary transition and consumption preferences (CON) in SSP1 compared with SSP2, we use the change in food consumption of livestock products per capita in the scenario SSP2_CON1, i.e., the individual effect of the factor CON on the most proximate result variable, namely per capita consumption of livestock products. Likewise, we use the change in total trade volume for the driver trade development (TRD), in the scenario SSP2_TRD1, where only the TRD setting has been shifted toward SSP1. As for the sensitivity methodology, we derive both individual and final effect. All variables and scenarios to derive the size of change per driver are listed in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and the resulting quantification is shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;6. To determine the sensitivities independent of driver sizes, we relate the change in output variable to the size of the driver, compared with SSP2.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
