 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clean ITS1 sequences were obtained from raw sequences after quality control filtering using QIIME v. 1.7.0 (Caporaso et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0016">2010</a>). Quality control included removing low‐quality reads with no valid primer or barcode sequence, containing ambiguous bases, or an average quality score &lt;20. The ITS1 region of each remaining sequence was extracted using the fungal ITSX software package (Bengtsson‐Palme et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0011">2013</a>), and potential chimeras were subsequently detected using the chimera.uchime command in Mothur version 1.31.2 (Schloss et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0073">2009</a>) by comparison with entries in the unified system for the DNA‐based fungal species linked to the classification (UNITE) database (Kõljalg et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0047">2013</a>). Nonchimeric ITS1 sequences were clustered into different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% sequence similarity level based on the UPARSE pipeline using the USEARCH version 8.0 after discarding replicated sequences and singletons (Edgar, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0028">2013</a>). A representative sequence (the most abundant) of each OTU was selected and searched against the international nucleotide sequence databases collaboration (INSDC) and UNITE databases, using a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). Fungal OTUs were identified following Tedersoo et al. (
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0081">2014</a>). Briefly, &lt;e
  <span class="sup">−50</span> values of BLASTn search results were deemed sufficiently reliable for robustly assigning sequences to the fungal kingdom, sequences yielding values between e
  <span class="sup">−20</span> and e
  <span class="sup">−50</span> were manually checked against the 10 best matches for accurate assignment, and those with &gt;e
  <span class="sup">−20</span> values were excluded. Sequence identities of 90%, 85%, 80%, and 75% were used as criteria for assigning OTUs to genera, families, orders, and classes, respectively. All Glomeromycota were considered to be arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and taxa were considered to be EM fungi if they best matched any sequences of known EM lineages (Tedersoo &amp; Smith, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0084">2013</a>). If different functional categories were present within a specific genus, we chose the dominant group (i.e., if &gt;75% of species were assigned to a specific category) or considered its ecology unknown (if ˂75% of species were assignable to a single category). Fungal OTUs were assigned to six functional groups; AM, EM, saprotrophic, pathogenic, animal parasitic, and mycoparasitic following Tedersoo et al. (
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0081">2014</a>) and the most updated list in FunGuild (Nguyen, Song, et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0059">2016</a>; Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0002">S2</a>). The number of sequences per sample was normalized to the smallest sample size using the sub.sample command in Mothur to eliminate the effect of different read numbers. Representative fungal OTU sequences have been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under Accession nos.
