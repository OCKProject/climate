 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After removing 280,429 sequences that did not meet the quality criteria, the remaining nonchimeric ITS1 sequences (8,427,416 in total) were clustered into 25,757 nonsingleton OTUs at a 97% sequence similarity level. Of these 25,757 OTUs, 18,171 (representing 8,078,161 reads) were identified as fungal. As the fungal read numbers ranged from 5,290 to 88,715 in the 240 samples, the dataset was normalized to 5,290, resulting in a normalized dataset containing 14,911 fungal OTUs (1,267,912 reads; Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0002">S2</a>). The represented fungi included 8,640 Ascomycota, 4,791 Basidiomycota, 200 Cryptomycota, 647 Zygomycota, 123 Glomeromycota, 117 Chytridiomycota, and 393 unknown fungi (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S1</a>a). Of the 14,911 fungal OTUs, 10,021 were assigned to six fungal functional groups, that is, saprotrophic fungi (6,149), EM fungi (2,709), pathogenic fungi (724), animal parasitic fungi (194), AM fungi (123), and mycoparasitic fungi (122) (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S1</a>b). The abundant fungal functional groups, such as saprotrophic, EM, and pathogenic fungi, were included in further analysis. Rarefaction curves of the observed fungal OTU richness did not reach an asymptote in any site (Figure
