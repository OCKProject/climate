 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variation partitioning showed that 29.1%–31.9%, 33.1%–44.3%, 10.0%–42.1%, and 25.1%–35.5% of the variance of total, saprotrophic, pathogenic, and EM fungal community compositions were explained by paleoclimatic and contemporary environmental variables in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests (Figure

  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S3</a>). Furthermore, paleoclimate explained higher variance in community compositions of total (31.6% vs. 13.8%), saprotrophic (30.8% vs. 10.3%), pathogenic (10.3% vs. 10.1%), and EM (29.0% vs. 14.1%) fungi in temperate forest than in tropic–subtropical forest (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35247-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35247-fig-0003">3</a>; Figure 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S3</a>). Some contemporary environmental variables explaining total and functional group fungal community compositions were different in temperate and tropic–subtropical forests (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S3</a>). For example, in addition to soil PC1, geographic distance, current climate and total plant community composition, total, and saprotrophic fungal community compositions were explained by soil PC2 in temperate forest but by soil PC3 and PC4 in tropic–subtropical forest (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S3</a>). Besides soil PC1, geographic distance, and current climate, pathogenic fungal community composition was related to total plant community composition, soil PC3, and PC4 in tropic–subtropical forest but not in temperate forest (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S3</a>). In addition to EM plant community composition, current climate, and geographic distance, EM fungal community composition was related to non‐EM plant community composition, soil PC1, and PC2 in tropic–subtropical forest but not in temperate forest (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S3</a>).

   <p>Relative contribution of the different predictors used to model total and functional group fungal community compositions in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests. Panels represent results from variation partitioning modelling aiming to identify the percentage variance of total, saprotrophic, pathogenic, and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal community compositions explained by paleoclimatic and contemporary environmental (current climate, space, plant, and soil) variables in the temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests. Unique and shared variance from the current climate, spatial, plant, and soil variables in predicting total, saprotrophic, pathogenic, and EM fungal community compositions were merged in this figure for simplicity. Note that the variation explained by “paleoclimate + contemporary environment” is additional to the one explained either by paleoclimate only or contemporary environment only. An alternative version of this figure showing the unique and shared variance of each group of predictors can be found in Figure

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PerMANOVA for samples from temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests types revealed that 89.6%–94.6%, 89.4%–94.2%, 42.6%–87.4%, and 57.2%–78.6% of the variance of total, saprotrophic, pathogenic, and EM fungal community compositions were explained by paleoclimatic and contemporary environmental variables (Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0003">S4</a>). Furthermore, paleoclimate explained higher variance in community compositions of total (89.6% vs. 0.4%), saprotrophic (89.5% vs. 2.6%), pathogenic (42.6% vs. 3.2%), and EM (48.6% vs. 4.6%) fungi in temperate forest than in tropic–subtropical forest (Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0003">S4</a>). Some contemporary environmental variables explaining total and functional group fungal community compositions were different in temperate and tropic–subtropical forests (Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0003">S4</a>). For example, in addition to total plant community composition, saprotrophic fungal community composition was explained by soil PC2 in temperate forest but not in tropic–subtropical forest (Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0003">S4</a>). Pathogenic fungal community composition was explained by total plant community composition, PCNM (PCNM1‐3), and soil (PC1‐3) in tropic–subtropical forest but not in temperate forest (Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0003">S4</a>). In addition to EM plant community composition, EM fungal community composition was explained by non‐EM plant community composition and PCNM (PCNM1‐3) in tropic–subtropical forest, but not in temperate forest (Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0003">S4</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The final SEMs for samples from temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests types demonstrated that paleoclimate, current climate, and space had direct effects on total, saprotrophic, pathogenic, and EM fungal community compositions (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35247-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35247-fig-0004">4</a>; Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S5</a>). Furthermore, for samples from temperate and tropic–subtropical forests paleoclimate, current climate and space had indirect effects on total and saprotrophic fungal community compositions through total plant community composition and soil (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35247-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35247-fig-0004">4</a>; Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S5</a>). The same trend was observed when all forest types were analyzed together (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35247-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35247-fig-0004">4</a>; Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S5</a>). EM fungal community composition was affected indirectly by paleoclimate, current climate, and space through EM and non‐EM plant community compositions and soil in tropic–subtropical and all forests, but through EM plant community composition and soil (via EM plant community composition) in temperate forest (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35247-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35247-fig-0004">4</a>; Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S5</a>). Pathogenic fungal community composition was affected indirectly by paleoclimate, current climate, and space through total plant community composition and soil in tropic–subtropical and all forests, but not in temperate forest (Figure
