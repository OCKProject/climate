 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study has shown that the richness of total soil fungi and various functional groups were not affected by late Quaternary climate change. While there is a paucity of studies to compare this to, it has been shown that fungal richness in the sediment of two European lakes was not related to the past two millennia of paleoclimatic variations (Capo et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0015">2016</a>). Some fungal taxa increased in richness but some decreased in richness under late Quaternary climate change which might result in the overall fungal richness remaining unchanged, as expectation that different fungal taxa have different response to climatic changes (Newsham et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0058">2016</a>). This is different from the effect of Quaternary climate change on bacterial species richness in a global scale (Delgado‐Baquerizo, Bissett, et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0022">2017</a>). The difference might be explained partly by the different traits between fungi and bacteria. Soil fungi are more resistant to climatic changes than bacteria (Barnard, Osborne, &amp; Firestone, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0009">2013</a>; De Vries et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0020">2012</a>; De Vries &amp; Shade, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0021">2013</a>). This trait of fungi may reduce species' vulnerability to range loss, avoid extinction risk, and improve persistent ability of fungi encountering the late Quaternary climate change, resulting that fungal richness was not related to late Quaternary climate change. Alternatively, bacterial research was conducted in a global scale, but this study was carried out in a regional scale, as the response of microbial richness depends on biogeographical scales (Bahram et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0005">2016</a>; Martiny, Eisen, Penn, Allison, &amp; Horner‐Devineet, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0056">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that total and functional group fungal richness were significantly affected by contemporary environmental factors, such as soil nutrients, pH, and/or plant species richness in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests, as reported in some previous studies (Gao et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0033">2017</a>; Glassman et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0037">2017</a>; Peay, Baraloto, &amp; Fine, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0063">2013</a>; Prober et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0069">2015</a>; Tedersoo et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0081">2014</a>). However, total and functional group fungal richness were affected by some different contemporary environmental factors in temperate and tropic–subtropical forests, as reported in Tedersoo et al. (
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0081">2014</a>). For example, we found that the interaction between total plant species richness and soil (nutrients and pH) affected the total and saprotrophic fungal richness in tropic–subtropical forest. It is highly possible that plants can modify soil environments through litter or root exudates and soil environments can affect plants in ways resulting in plant–soil feedback that can influence total and saprotrophic fungal richness in tropic–subtropical forest (Erlandson, Wei, Savage, Cavender‐Bares, &amp; Peay, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0029">2018</a>). In addition, the soil C effect on pathogenic fungal richness in tropic–subtropical forests may be because soil C was linked to the plant species diversity in tropic forests (Hooper et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0043">2000</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results showed that total and functional group fungal community compositions were affected by late Quaternary climate change in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests. Similarly, fungal community composition in the sediment of two European lakes was related to the past two millennia of paleoclimatic variations (Capo et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0015">2016</a>). The relationship between late Quaternary climate change and soil fungal community composition may be caused by altering the relative abundance of fungi (Capo et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0015">2016</a>), as reported in previous studies that regions where the late Quaternary climate oscillations were similar tend to promote assemblages with similar certain community compositions (Svenning et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0076">2015</a>). This also suggests that Quaternary climatic oscillations may produce disequilibrium with current climate if species that were favored under historical conditions but not the current conditions are extirpated slowly, or if species favored by the new conditions are slow to colonize (Svenning &amp; Sandel, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0077">2013</a>). Alternatively, the influence of late Quaternary climate change was mediated by effects on the plant community (Feng et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0031">2016</a>; Kissling et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0046">2012</a>) and soil (Delgado‐Baquerizo, Eldridge, et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0023">2017</a>), which in turn drive changes in fungal community composition (Nguyen, Williams, et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0060">2016</a>; Tedersoo et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0081">2014</a>), as our SEMs demonstrated (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35247-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35247-fig-0004">4</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, we found that late Quaternary climate change had a higher effect on the total and functional group fungal community compositions in temperate forest than in tropic–subtropical forest, which is consistent with the effect of late Quaternary climate change on macroorganism community composition (Feng et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0032">2014</a>; Svenning et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0076">2015</a>). This may be because late Quaternary climate change was stronger in temperate regions than in tropic–subtropical areas (Feng et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0031">2016</a>, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0032">2014</a>; Ruddiman, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0071">2014</a>). Across the study sites, paleoclimatic variations (MAT velocity, MAP velocity, MAT anomaly, and MAP anomaly) were 83.6%–148% higher in temperate forest than in tropic–subtropical forest (Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S6</a>), which can directly exert greater effects on soil fungal community composition in temperate forest than in tropic–subtropical forest. Furthermore, the complex topography in tropic–subtropical forests may have buffered this region against historical climate changes (López‐Pujol &amp; Ren, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0053">2010</a>), resulting in a smaller effect of late Quaternary climate change on the fungal community composition. Besides, higher Quaternary climate oscillations in the unstable areas would result in a more phylogenetically clustered plant community (Kissling et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0046">2012</a>), which influences soil fungal community composition (Barberán et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0007">2015</a>). The importance of this result lies in the fact that late Quaternary climate change can be used to better understand and predict the response of soil fungal community composition to future climate changes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to late Quaternary climate change, we found that contemporary environmental factors, such as plant community composition, soil, current climate, and space, affected total and functional group fungal community compositions in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests, as reported in previous studies (e.g., Barberán et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0007">2015</a>; Gao et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0033">2017</a>; Tedersoo et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0080">2016</a>; Talbot et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0079">2014</a>). However, some different contemporary environmental variables affected total and functional group fungal community compositions in temperate and tropic–subtropical forests. For example, we found that total, saprotrophic, pathogenic, and EM fungal community compositions were related to soil C or no variables in temperate forest, but to soil nutrients, PSD, or pH in tropic–subtropical forest. In the study sites, the range of soil C concentration (3.08–30.39 g/kg vs. 1.4–24.78 g/kg) was wider in temperate forest than in tropic–subtropical forest, but the ranges of soil nutrient concentrations (0.23–33.93 g/kg vs. 0.02–14.53 g/kg), pH (3.31–6.87 vs. 4.4–7.22), and PSD (2.44–2.72 vs. 2.42–2.68) were wider in tropic–subtropical forest than in temperate forest. The wider ranges of soil variables would provide more niche spaces to promote species coexistence of fungal community in different forest ecosystems (Peay et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0066">2017</a>). In addition to soil variables, pathogenic fungal community composition was related to plant community composition in tropic–subtropical forests in this study. It is possible that pathogenic fungi as host‐specific enemies would have stronger effect in plant species‐rich tropic–subtropical regions than in plant species‐poor temperate areas (Johnson, Beaulieu, Bever, &amp; Clay, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0044">2012</a>). Furthermore, we found that EM fungal community composition was related to non‐EM plant community composition in tropic–subtropical forest. In the study sites, there are higher non‐EM plant species richness and abundance (on average, 83.7% vs. 66.2% of plant species and 74.3% vs. 48.3% of plant individuals) in tropic–subtropical forest than in temperate forest (Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S6</a>), and these EM plant individuals are surrounded by a large number of the non‐EM plants to form many small tree islands which prevent the spread of EM fungi through underground hyphae in tropic–subtropical forest (Gao et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0034">2015</a>; Tedersoo, Sadam, Zambrano, Valencia, &amp; Bahram, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0083">2010</a>).
