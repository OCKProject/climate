 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed the effect of contemporary (plant, soil, current climate, and geographic distance) and paleoclimatic environmental factors on the richness and composition of total soil fungi and the various functional groups in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forest ecosystems. All statistical analyses were carried out in R version 3.3.1 (R Development Core Team, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0070">2017</a>). The 
  <span class="italic">p</span>‐values were corrected using the Bonferroni method (
  <span class="italic">p</span>
  <sub>adj</sub>). To reduce the ten measured soil variables to a convenient number, principal component (PC) analysis was applied, using the rda function in the VEGAN package (Oksanen et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0062">2007</a>). The first four soil PCs (largely reflecting variables of each PC in parentheses) explained 86.8% of the total variation of soil variables: PC1 (total P, C: P ratio, N: P ratio, total Ca, total Mg, and pH) 47.5%, PC2 (total C and C: N ratio) 19.7%, PC3 (total N and PSD) 10.3%, and PC4 (N: P ratio) 9.3% (Table 
  <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S3</a>). The spatial principal coordinate of neighbor matrices (PCNM) vectors with positive eigenvalues were obtained based on the transformation of geographic distance (latitude and longitude) using the PCNM command in the PCNM package (Dray, Legendre, &amp; Peres‐Neto, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0026">2006</a>). Rarefaction curves of the observed fungal OTUs were calculated in each plot (including 20 quadrats), using the specaccum function in the VEGAN package (Oksanen et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0062">2007</a>). In order to estimate the importance of paleoclimatic (MAT velocity, MAP velocity, MAT anomaly, and MAP anomaly) and contemporary environmental (species richness and basal area of total, EM and non‐EM plants, soil PC1–PC4, MAP, MAT, spatial PCNM vectors, and altitude) variables to fungal richness, we conducted random forest models analysis using the randomforest package (Liaw &amp; Wiener, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0051">2002</a>). We also assessed the significance of both the model and each predictor with the rfutilities (Evans &amp; Murphy, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0030">2016</a>) and rfpermute (Archer, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0002">2016</a>) packages, respectively. To quantify the effects of paleoclimatic, contemporary environmental variables, and their interactions on richness of total soil fungi and the various functional groups, we employed linear mixed‐effects models to control for the random effect of sites, using the LME4 package (De Boeck et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0019">2011</a>). Given the large number of potential predictor variables relative to the number of sites, we employed forward stepwise model selection to obtain a reduced model.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pairwise modified Raup‐Crick dissimilarity matrices were calculated to depict the community compositions that were independent of the variation in richness of fungi and plants (Chase, Kraft, Smith, Vellend, &amp; Inouye, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0017">2011</a>). Pairwise Euclidean dissimilarity matrices were calculated for the plant (species richness and basal area of total, EM and non‐EM plants), spatial (altitude and geographic distance), soil (PC1‒PC4), current climatic (MAP and MAT), and paleoclimatic (MAT velocity, MAP velocity, MAT anomaly, and MAP anomaly) variables. The fungal and plant dissimilarity matrices were subjected to principal coordinate (PCo) analysis using the cmdscale command in the VEGAN package (Oksanen et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0062">2007</a>). We selected the PCo vectors that could cumulatively explain 100% of the variation of the fungal and plant dissimilarity matrices for variation partitioning (Gower, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0039">1966</a>; Legendre &amp; Anderson, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0049">1999</a>). The variations of total composition of soil fungi and the various functional groups (PCo vectors) were partitioned among the plant, soil, current climatic, paleoclimatic, and spatial (altitude and PCNM vectors) variables using the varpart command in the VEGAN package (Oksanen et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0062">2007</a>). The variables within each category were forward‐selected using the forward.sel command in the PACKFOR package (Dray, Legendre, &amp; Blanchet, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0025">2009</a>), then subjected to variation partitioning (Legendre &amp; Legendre, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0050">2012</a>). In addition, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA) using the adonis command in the VEGAN package (Oksanen et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0062">2007</a>) was performed to disentangle the relative effect of paleoclimate, plant, current climate, soil, space (altitude and PCNM vectors), and their interactions between these variables on total soil fungi and the various functional groups.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, we constructed structural equation models (SEMs) to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of paleoclimate, plant, current climate, soil, and space on richness and composition of the total soil fungi and the various functional groups. For the fungal richness, we constructed the SEMs using multilevel SEM (Shipley, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0074">2009</a>) implemented in the PIECEWISESEM package (Lefcheck, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0048">2016</a>). This approach integrates a set of linear mixed‐effects models to test the direct and indirect effects. Basis set construction, goodness‐of‐fit tests and parameter estimation were conducted using functions from the PIECEWISESEM package. For the fungal community composition, we constructed the SEMs using Shipley's d‐separation method of generalized causal path analysis (Shipley, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0074">2009</a>) based on the multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM) according to Barnes et al. (
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0010">2016</a>). All the paleoclimatic and contemporary environmental matrices were subjected to MRM, with forward selection until 
  <span class="italic">p</span>
  <sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.05 for all variables using the MRM function in the ECODIST package (Goslee &amp; Urban, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0038">2007</a>). In order to construct the path model, we identified the basis set 
  <span class="italic">B
   <sub>U</sub>
  </span> of independence claims that were implied by a hypothetical causal model. The independence claims in 
  <span class="italic">B
   <sub>U</sub>
  </span> describe the 
  <span class="italic">p
   <sub>i</sub>
  </span> probability that variable pairs (
  <span class="italic">X
   <sub>i</sub>
  </span>, 
  <span class="italic">X
   <sub>j</sub>
  </span>) are independent conditional on the variable set 
  <span class="italic">Z</span>, which is a direct cause of either 
  <span class="italic">X
   <sub>i</sub>
  </span> or 
  <span class="italic">X
   <sub>j</sub>
  </span>. The combined 
  <span class="italic">p
   <sub>i</sub>
  </span> of the full model was calculated as follows:

   <div id="nlm-math-1" class="math">
    <div class="mrow">
     <span class="mi">C</span>
     <span class="mo">=</span>
     <span class="mo">-</span>
     <span class="mn">2</span>
     <div class="munderover">
      <span movablelimits="false" class="mo">∑</span>
      <div class="mrow">
       <span class="mi">i</span>

       <span class="mi">i</span>
      </div>
      <span stretchy="false" class="mo">)</span>
     </div>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>where 
  <span class="italic">C</span> value was then compared with a chi‐square (
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>) distribution with 2
  <span class="italic">k</span> degrees of freedom (Shipley, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0074">2009</a>). The resulting probability, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>, indicates whether the data depart significantly from what would be expected under such a causal model. A model is rejected if the resulting 
  <span class="italic">p</span> is smaller than the specified α‐level (in this case, 
  <span class="italic">α</span> = 0.05). As such, if 
  <span class="italic">p </span>&gt; 0.05, the causal model is considered to provide a good fit to the data (Shipley, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0074">2009</a>). All MRM models were performed with 10,000 permutations to ensure stable estimations of the 
  <span class="italic">p</span>‐values that were used to calculate the 
  <span class="italic">C</span> statistic in the path models. To assess the relative importance of paleoclimatic and contemporary environmental variables for driving the composition of total soil fungal communities and the various functional groups, we calculated range‐standardized coefficients for each predictor variable (Grace, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0040">2006</a>). Specifically, this is a standardization of raw coefficients 
  <span class="italic">β
   <sub>xy</sub>
  </span> expressing the effect of x on y, whereby the range‐standardized coefficient 
  <span class="italic">β</span>std
  <span class="italic">
   <sub>xy</sub>
  </span> = 
  <span class="italic">β
   <sub>xy</sub>
  </span> × (
  <span class="italic">x</span>
  <sub>max</sub> − 
  <span class="italic">x</span>
  <sub>min</sub>)/(
  <span class="italic">y</span>
  <sub>max</sub> − 
  <span class="italic">y</span>
  <sub>min</sub>), where the maximum and minimum values are the largest and smallest calculated dissimilarity values from the distance matrices. This method of coefficient standardization yields dimensionless coefficients that can be interpreted as the proportional change in 
  <span class="italic">y</span> across the range of 
  <span class="italic">x</span> after controlling for all other predictors in the model.
