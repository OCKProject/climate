   <a rid="ece35247-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35247-fig-0001">1</a>). Longitude, latitude, and altitude at the sites were provided by the Chinese Forest Biodiversity Monitoring Network (CForBio), and estimates of the mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) were obtained from the WorldClim global climate data (

In each site, one permanent forest plot (varying from 15–25 ha) was constructed by the CForBio. In each plot, all trees with a diameter ≥1 cm at breast height have been mapped, identified, and measured. During June to October in 2014, 20 quadrats (20 × 20 m) in each plot were randomly selected, and ten soil cores (10 cm in depth, 5 cm in diameter) were randomly collected and mixed as one composite sample in each quadrat. A total of 240 soil samples were therefore used in this study. Soil samples were immediately packed in an ice box and transported to the laboratory. Fresh soil samples were sieved through a 2‐mm sieve to remove roots and debris. Subsamples for DNA extraction were stored at −80°C until analysis, and the remaining subsamples were air‐dried for soil analysis. The information of geographic and current climatic variables of each study site is summarized in Table

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genomic DNA was extracted from 0.25 g frozen soil using the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA concentration of each sample was measured using a NanoDrop ND‐1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). The fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region was amplified using a two‐step PCR procedure for Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The first amplification of the entire ITS region with primers ITS1F (White, Bruns, Lee, &amp; Taylor, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0088">1990</a>) and ITS4 (Gardes &amp; Bruns, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0036">1993</a>) was carried out in a final 25 μl reaction solution including 2.5 μl 10 × buffer, 1.5 mM MgSO
   <sub>4</sub>, 200 μM of each dNTP, 0.75 μM of each primer, 0.5 U KOD‐plus‐Neo polymerase (Toyobo), and 
   <span class="italic">ca</span>. 10 ng of template DNA. The thermal cycling consisted of an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 50 s, annealing at 52°C for 1 min, and extension at 68°C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 68°C for 10 min. The product of the first amplification was diluted (×40) with sterilized deionized water and used as the template for the second PCR using the ITS5 and ITS2 primers (White et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0088">1990</a>) linked to a barcode sequence (6 base pairs (bp) in length). Conditions for the nested PCR were the same as the first‐round PCR. PCR products were purified using a gel purification kit (Axygen), and 50 ng of DNA from each of the 240 samples was pooled and adjusted to 10 ng/µl. A sequencing library was constructed by adding Illumina sequencing adaptor (5′‐GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCACATCACGATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG‐3′) to the PCR products using an Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR‐Free Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) following the manufacturer's instructions. The library was then sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq PE250 instrument (running the 2 × 250 bp chemistry) in the Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sequence processing</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clean ITS1 sequences were obtained from raw sequences after quality control filtering using QIIME v. 1.7.0 (Caporaso et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0016">2010</a>). Quality control included removing low‐quality reads with no valid primer or barcode sequence, containing ambiguous bases, or an average quality score &lt;20. The ITS1 region of each remaining sequence was extracted using the fungal ITSX software package (Bengtsson‐Palme et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0011">2013</a>), and potential chimeras were subsequently detected using the chimera.uchime command in Mothur version 1.31.2 (Schloss et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0073">2009</a>) by comparison with entries in the unified system for the DNA‐based fungal species linked to the classification (UNITE) database (Kõljalg et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0047">2013</a>). Nonchimeric ITS1 sequences were clustered into different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% sequence similarity level based on the UPARSE pipeline using the USEARCH version 8.0 after discarding replicated sequences and singletons (Edgar, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0028">2013</a>). A representative sequence (the most abundant) of each OTU was selected and searched against the international nucleotide sequence databases collaboration (INSDC) and UNITE databases, using a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). Fungal OTUs were identified following Tedersoo et al. (
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0081">2014</a>). Briefly, &lt;e
   <span class="sup">−50</span> values of BLASTn search results were deemed sufficiently reliable for robustly assigning sequences to the fungal kingdom, sequences yielding values between e
   <span class="sup">−20</span> and e
   <span class="sup">−50</span> were manually checked against the 10 best matches for accurate assignment, and those with &gt;e
   <span class="sup">−20</span> values were excluded. Sequence identities of 90%, 85%, 80%, and 75% were used as criteria for assigning OTUs to genera, families, orders, and classes, respectively. All Glomeromycota were considered to be arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and taxa were considered to be EM fungi if they best matched any sequences of known EM lineages (Tedersoo &amp; Smith, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0084">2013</a>). If different functional categories were present within a specific genus, we chose the dominant group (i.e., if &gt;75% of species were assigned to a specific category) or considered its ecology unknown (if ˂75% of species were assignable to a single category). Fungal OTUs were assigned to six functional groups; AM, EM, saprotrophic, pathogenic, animal parasitic, and mycoparasitic following Tedersoo et al. (
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0081">2014</a>) and the most updated list in FunGuild (Nguyen, Song, et al.,

   <a rid="ece35247-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0002">S2</a>). The number of sequences per sample was normalized to the smallest sample size using the sub.sample command in Mothur to eliminate the effect of different read numbers. Representative fungal OTU sequences have been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under Accession nos.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Late Quaternary climate change data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the late Quaternary climate change variables, the velocity of MAT and MAP is a measure of the local rate of displacement of climatic conditions over Earth's surface (Loarie et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0052">2009</a>; Sandel et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0072">2011</a>); the anomaly of MAT and MAP represents temporal difference in extreme events such as extreme high or low in temperature and precipitation (Garcia, Cabeza, Rahbek, &amp; Araújo, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0035">2014</a>). The velocity and anomaly of MAP and MAT metrics have been widely applied to examine the effect of late Quaternary climate change on macroorganisms (Feng et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0032">2014</a>; Garcia et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0035">2014</a>; Sandel et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0072">2011</a>). Therefore, we used the velocity and anomaly of MAT and MAP as representatives of the late Quaternary climate change variables. We computed the velocity and anomaly for MAT and MAP between the last glacial maximum (LGM; ~21,000 years ago) and the present (1950–2000), with a resolution of 2.5 arc minutes (Sandel et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0072">2011</a>). Velocity and anomaly calculations require estimates of climate (at least two time points). To summarize LGM climate, we used estimates of past MAT and MAP from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase II (Braconnot et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0013">2007</a>), using the means of the CCSM3 (Collins et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0018">2006</a>) and MIROC3.2 (K‐1 model developers,

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed the effect of contemporary (plant, soil, current climate, and geographic distance) and paleoclimatic environmental factors on the richness and composition of total soil fungi and the various functional groups in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forest ecosystems. All statistical analyses were carried out in R version 3.3.1 (R Development Core Team, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0070">2017</a>). The 
   <span class="italic">p</span>‐values were corrected using the Bonferroni method (
   <span class="italic">p</span>
   <sub>adj</sub>). To reduce the ten measured soil variables to a convenient number, principal component (PC) analysis was applied, using the rda function in the VEGAN package (Oksanen et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0062">2007</a>). The first four soil PCs (largely reflecting variables of each PC in parentheses) explained 86.8% of the total variation of soil variables: PC1 (total P, C: P ratio, N: P ratio, total Ca, total Mg, and pH) 47.5%, PC2 (total C and C: N ratio) 19.7%, PC3 (total N and PSD) 10.3%, and PC4 (N: P ratio) 9.3% (Table 
   <a rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece35247-sup-0001">S3</a>). The spatial principal coordinate of neighbor matrices (PCNM) vectors with positive eigenvalues were obtained based on the transformation of geographic distance (latitude and longitude) using the PCNM command in the PCNM package (Dray, Legendre, &amp; Peres‐Neto, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0026">2006</a>). Rarefaction curves of the observed fungal OTUs were calculated in each plot (including 20 quadrats), using the specaccum function in the VEGAN package (Oksanen et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0062">2007</a>). In order to estimate the importance of paleoclimatic (MAT velocity, MAP velocity, MAT anomaly, and MAP anomaly) and contemporary environmental (species richness and basal area of total, EM and non‐EM plants, soil PC1–PC4, MAP, MAT, spatial PCNM vectors, and altitude) variables to fungal richness, we conducted random forest models analysis using the randomforest package (Liaw &amp; Wiener, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0051">2002</a>). We also assessed the significance of both the model and each predictor with the rfutilities (Evans &amp; Murphy, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0030">2016</a>) and rfpermute (Archer, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0002">2016</a>) packages, respectively. To quantify the effects of paleoclimatic, contemporary environmental variables, and their interactions on richness of total soil fungi and the various functional groups, we employed linear mixed‐effects models to control for the random effect of sites, using the LME4 package (De Boeck et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0019">2011</a>). Given the large number of potential predictor variables relative to the number of sites, we employed forward stepwise model selection to obtain a reduced model.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pairwise modified Raup‐Crick dissimilarity matrices were calculated to depict the community compositions that were independent of the variation in richness of fungi and plants (Chase, Kraft, Smith, Vellend, &amp; Inouye, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0017">2011</a>). Pairwise Euclidean dissimilarity matrices were calculated for the plant (species richness and basal area of total, EM and non‐EM plants), spatial (altitude and geographic distance), soil (PC1‒PC4), current climatic (MAP and MAT), and paleoclimatic (MAT velocity, MAP velocity, MAT anomaly, and MAP anomaly) variables. The fungal and plant dissimilarity matrices were subjected to principal coordinate (PCo) analysis using the cmdscale command in the VEGAN package (Oksanen et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0062">2007</a>). We selected the PCo vectors that could cumulatively explain 100% of the variation of the fungal and plant dissimilarity matrices for variation partitioning (Gower, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0039">1966</a>; Legendre &amp; Anderson, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0049">1999</a>). The variations of total composition of soil fungi and the various functional groups (PCo vectors) were partitioned among the plant, soil, current climatic, paleoclimatic, and spatial (altitude and PCNM vectors) variables using the varpart command in the VEGAN package (Oksanen et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0062">2007</a>). The variables within each category were forward‐selected using the forward.sel command in the PACKFOR package (Dray, Legendre, &amp; Blanchet, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0025">2009</a>), then subjected to variation partitioning (Legendre &amp; Legendre, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0050">2012</a>). In addition, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA) using the adonis command in the VEGAN package (Oksanen et al., 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0062">2007</a>) was performed to disentangle the relative effect of paleoclimate, plant, current climate, soil, space (altitude and PCNM vectors), and their interactions between these variables on total soil fungi and the various functional groups.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, we constructed structural equation models (SEMs) to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of paleoclimate, plant, current climate, soil, and space on richness and composition of the total soil fungi and the various functional groups. For the fungal richness, we constructed the SEMs using multilevel SEM (Shipley, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0074">2009</a>) implemented in the PIECEWISESEM package (Lefcheck, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0048">2016</a>). This approach integrates a set of linear mixed‐effects models to test the direct and indirect effects. Basis set construction, goodness‐of‐fit tests and parameter estimation were conducted using functions from the PIECEWISESEM package. For the fungal community composition, we constructed the SEMs using Shipley's d‐separation method of generalized causal path analysis (Shipley, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0074">2009</a>) based on the multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM) according to Barnes et al. (
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0010">2016</a>). All the paleoclimatic and contemporary environmental matrices were subjected to MRM, with forward selection until

   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0038">2007</a>). In order to construct the path model, we identified the basis set 
   <span class="italic">B

   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0074">2009</a>). All MRM models were performed with 10,000 permutations to ensure stable estimations of the 
   <span class="italic">p</span>‐values that were used to calculate the 
   <span class="italic">C</span> statistic in the path models. To assess the relative importance of paleoclimatic and contemporary environmental variables for driving the composition of total soil fungal communities and the various functional groups, we calculated range‐standardized coefficients for each predictor variable (Grace, 
   <a rid="ece35247-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0040">2006</a>). Specifically, this is a standardization of raw coefficients 
   <span class="italic">β
    <sub>xy</sub>
   </span> expressing the effect of x on y, whereby the range‐standardized coefficient 
   <span class="italic">β</span>std
   <span class="italic">
    <sub>xy</sub>
   </span> = 
   <span class="italic">β
    <sub>xy</sub>
   </span> × (
   <span class="italic">x</span>
   <sub>max</sub> − 
   <span class="italic">x</span>
   <sub>min</sub>)/(
   <span class="italic">y</span>
   <sub>max</sub> − 
   <span class="italic">y</span>
   <sub>min</sub>), where the maximum and minimum values are the largest and smallest calculated dissimilarity values from the distance matrices. This method of coefficient standardization yields dimensionless coefficients that can be interpreted as the proportional change in 
   <span class="italic">y</span> across the range of 
   <span class="italic">x</span> after controlling for all other predictors in the model.
