 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genomic DNA was extracted from 0.25 g frozen soil using the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA concentration of each sample was measured using a NanoDrop ND‐1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). The fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region was amplified using a two‐step PCR procedure for Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The first amplification of the entire ITS region with primers ITS1F (White, Bruns, Lee, &amp; Taylor, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0088">1990</a>) and ITS4 (Gardes &amp; Bruns, 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0036">1993</a>) was carried out in a final 25 μl reaction solution including 2.5 μl 10 × buffer, 1.5 mM MgSO
  <sub>4</sub>, 200 μM of each dNTP, 0.75 μM of each primer, 0.5 U KOD‐plus‐Neo polymerase (Toyobo), and 
  <span class="italic">ca</span>. 10 ng of template DNA. The thermal cycling consisted of an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 50 s, annealing at 52°C for 1 min, and extension at 68°C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 68°C for 10 min. The product of the first amplification was diluted (×40) with sterilized deionized water and used as the template for the second PCR using the ITS5 and ITS2 primers (White et al., 
  <a rid="ece35247-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35247-bib-0088">1990</a>) linked to a barcode sequence (6 base pairs (bp) in length). Conditions for the nested PCR were the same as the first‐round PCR. PCR products were purified using a gel purification kit (Axygen), and 50 ng of DNA from each of the 240 samples was pooled and adjusted to 10 ng/µl. A sequencing library was constructed by adding Illumina sequencing adaptor (5′‐GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCACATCACGATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG‐3′) to the PCR products using an Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR‐Free Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) following the manufacturer's instructions. The library was then sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq PE250 instrument (running the 2 × 250 bp chemistry) in the Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.
