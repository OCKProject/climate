  <p>Structural equation models (SEMs) accounting for the direct and indirect effects of contemporary environment on fungal richness. (a)–(c) are the SEMs results showing the direct and indirect effects of contemporary environment on total, saprotrophic, pathogenic, and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal richness in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests, respectively. The width of the lines represents the strength of the relationship (

   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> values represent the proportion of variance explained. Soil PC1, total phosphorus (P), total carbon (C): P ratio, total calcium (Ca), total magnesium (Mg), and pH. Soil PC2, total C, and C: total nitrogen (N) ratio
