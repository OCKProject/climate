  <p>Structural equation models (SEMs) accounting for the direct and indirect effects of paleoclimate and contemporary environment on fungal community composition. (a)–(c) are the SEMs results showing the direct and indirect effects of paleoclimate and contemporary environment (current climate, space, plant, and soil) on total, saprotrophic, pathogenic, and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal community compositions in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests, respectively. The width of the lines represents the strength of the relationship (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). Numbers above and below the lines indicate path coefficients, and only the path coefficients between current climate, paleoclimate, plant, soil, and fungal community composition were shown in this figure. 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> values represent the proportion of variance explained. We grouped the different categories of predictors (soil, paleoclimate, current climate, and space) in the same box for graphical simplicity. Other details can be found in the Table
