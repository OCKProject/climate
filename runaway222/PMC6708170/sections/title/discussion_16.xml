 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The goal of this study was to assess the psychometric characteristics and provide validation evidence for use of the ICS in SUD treatment settings. The ICS showed strong internal consistency reliability and acceptable fit for the overall factor structure. In addition, the pattern of correlations with other measures supported the construct validity of the ICS and were consistent our hypotheses. Taken together, these findings suggest that SUD organizations who make EBP implementation a priority also emphasize giving high quality service to clients, providing performance feedback to providers, involving employees in decision making, making sure work is done efficiently, and planning for organizational change while also reducing uncertainty around change.</p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the results supported the use of the ICS in SUD organizations. To date, the majority of research on EBP implementation in SUD has targeted molar organizational climate particularly through the development and use of the ORC. Although the ORC is helpful in assessing general organizational functioning [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>], its application in EBP implementation remains unclear [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. Having a brief, reliable, and valid tool to assess the extent to which the organization’s climate is supportive of EBP implementation provides more focus than the constructs assessed by the ORC. Thus, the use of the ICS allows organizations to understand the extent to which their orgnaizational environment aligns with implementation efforts, and to identify specific areas related to implementation to possibly target for leadership and organizaitonal interventions. Additionally, the availability of this measure provides researchers with a brief and pragmatic measure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>] with which to understand the factors that are related to the development of an EBP implementation climate and the organizational and implementation outcomes that result when EBP implementaiton climate levels are high [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The availability of a brief, and valid, tool that organizations and researchers can access to assess EBP implementation climate is particularly relevant for SUD treatment systems which have historically maintained a particularly wide science and practice gap. Very few studies on the dissemination and implementation of EBPs in SUD treatment have utilized valid measures of implementation, let alone measures of implementation climate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Contributions by Damschroder and Hagedorn have recommended increased consideration of outer and inner context factors influencing EBP implementation in SUD treatment systems. Such factors include policies and incentives/rewards for implementation, engagement of implementation leaders/champions, and organizational culture for implementation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>]. Ongoing formative evaluation is critical for any implementation effort [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. The application of a tool such as the ICS to measure EBP implementation climate in SUD treatment systems can help to guide successful EBP implementation efforts, serving to narrow this science and practice gap [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the general pattern of results was supportive of the measure as a whole, it is notable that the findings for the Rewards dimension were not as strong as for the other dimensions. For instance, the within-unit agreement was lowest for the Rewards subscale, and the correlations between the Rewards subscale and the other dimensions were lower than the correlations among the other five dimensions. Furthermore, as shown in Tables 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a> and 
  <a rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" href="#Tab6">6</a>, the Rewards subscale had the weakest correlations with the measures included to provide construct validity evidence, including at both the individual and team levels of analysis. These results are in line with what was found when this scale was validated in child welfare settings [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>], such that the scale performed less well in these settings than in the mental health setting where the measure was originally developed [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. There are several plausible explanations for the poorer performance of the Rewards dimension in this SUD services sample compared to mental health setting. One possibility is the generally limited availability of funds for any sort of financial reward, particularly in often underesourced SUD treatment agencies. With such a low base rate for rewards, the scale properties are affected for all subsequent analyses. In contrast, the Recognition subscale, which addresses non-financial recognition of providers for implementation efforts, performed better across most analyses. It is also possible this Rewards dimension performs more poorly in SUD services due to the fact many SUD service providers are in recovery themselves and are strongly motivated to be of service to others. A tenet of many 12-step programs often endorsed by individuals in recovery is to carry the message of the 12-steps forward to others in need. As a result, financial rewards may be interpreted as inappropriate, or incongruent, with this recovery-oriented perspective.
 </p>
 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The question then becomes whether the scale should simply be removed for use in SUD settings. In our own work with organizations, we have found that there are creative ways to use small financial rewards to reinforce implementation efforts in a manner that is consistent with the values of SUD service providers. The inclusion of the Rewards scale could encourage management to consider what options may be available to them if implementing EBPs with fidelity is indeed a high priority for the organization, if appropriate. Further, as SUD agencies consider how best to create a positive EBP implementation climate, the base rate for the use of rewards may increase. Thus, although the ICS may perform better for research purposes without the inclusion of the Rewards subscale, there are practical reasons to use it for applied purposes.</p>
 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some limitations of the study should be noted. Although the Selection for EBP subscale generally performed well across the various analyses that were conducted, its ICC(1) value was negative, which can occur when the between group variability is smaller than the variability within groups. Given the relatively high levels of within-group agreement for this scale (based on the 
  <span class="italic">a</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">wg(j)</span>
  </sub> values), this suggests that although individuals generally agree about this issue within their teams, the team means tended to be quite similar across the sample. A larger sample of organizations and teams would likely show more variability in whether experience with EBPs is considered in hiring systems. On a related note, because the sample came from three, relatively large SUD agencies, the findings may not be consistent with smaller agencies, particularly in more rural areas. More research with broader sampling is needed to support generalizability of the measure in these more rural SUD treatment contexts. Another limitation of the study is that the focus of the measure is EBPs in general, rather than a specific EBP. If SUD organizations are implementing multiple EBPs at any given time, the overall climate for EBP implementation is likely to be particularly relevant. In contrast, if the entire organization is focused on a single implementation, the presence of a climate for that specific EBP may emerge. Future research should consider this possibility and compare the measurement and relationships with other variables for these two different approaches to assessing implementation climate.
