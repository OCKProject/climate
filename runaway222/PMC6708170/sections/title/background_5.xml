 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) is critical for improving care in the public health and allied health sectors such as substance use disorder (SUD) treatment settings. Although EBPs are known to researchers as efficacious practices supported by research evidence, there is still a discrepancy between the knowledge that EBPs are available and the usage of EBPs by providers (i.e., clinicians) with their clients [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. This discrepancy is apparent in SUD services, and can be partly attributed to the addiction field’s historical roots of development outside of mainstream health care [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, implementation of EBPs for SUD has received less attention than for mental health [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. The unique development of SUD treatment systems, which evolved separately from mainstream health care and from mental health treatment systems has contributed to this science to practice gap in SUD services [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Through the mid-1900s, individuals with SUD were socially stigmatized and were refused treatment from most practitioners and hospitals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. This resulted in an emergence of alternative treatment offered primarily through “compassionate peers who were themselves in recovery” ([
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>], p. 26). As time progressed, a chronic illness/disease model was accepted for alcohol use disorders, and subsequently for other drug use disorders, though SUD treatment remained segregated from medical and mental health services. A lack of centralized, federal, policies governing the SUD system resulted in each state designing individual public SUD health care systems with varying organizational and financing structures [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. Differences emerged between SUD and mental health with regard to insurance coverage, such that clients may have coverage that provides mental health services but excluded SUD treatment [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. SUD treatment providers, programs, and systems grew more strongly loyal to particular treatment models, often with limited scientific evidence for efficacy [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Specifically, SUD treatment practices continued to be influenced by the experiences of people in recovery, primarily through Alcoholics Anonymous and related 12-step programs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At present, the literature reflects a general openness of SUD professionals to learning new practices [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Additionally, federal and state initiatives have made efforts to advance SUD EBP implementation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. For example, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Blue Ribbon Task Force encouraged an increase in funded studies examining substance use EBPs and their dissemination, implementation, and sustainment in real-world settings [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. Within SUD health care systems, instability and closure of treatment programs is common and further warrants investigation of EBP implementation in such systems [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within implementation research, there has been an increasing interest in the organizational context within treatment agencies and how the environment within which providers work impacts the successful uptake and implementation of EBPs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. As a guide for the factors that may affect implementation in public service sectors, Aarons and colleagues [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>] developed the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) multilevel implementation framework, which characterizes four phases of the implementation process and categorizes implementation factors into outer (system) and inner (organizational) context. Within SUD treatment settings, researchers have identified several outer system factors which impact successful EBP implementation, including interagency collaborations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>] and network connectedness with non-criminal justice agencies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. Moreover, several inner organizational factors have also been identified as playing a pivotal role in whether EBPs are successfully implemented, such as leadership [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>], counselor attitudes toward EBP [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>], and perceptions of organizational readiness for change [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The focus of the present study is on one particular indicator of the inner organizational context for EBP implementation: organizational climate. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in examining the influence of organizational climate on the EBP implementation process (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]). Organizational climate has been defined as “the shared meaning organizational members attach to the events, policies, practices, and procedures they experience and the behaviors they see being rewarded, supported, and expected” ([
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>], p. 69). Research on organizational climate has been categorized by two primary approaches: those addressing molar climate and those addressing a more specific or focused climate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. Generic or molar climates capture the overall organizational environment and employees’ experiences in an organization as a whole. In contrast, focused climates capture factors that are relevant to attaining specific strategic outcomes, such as customer service [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>] and safety [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the SUD treatment research targeting the role of the organizational context in EBP implementation, generic or molar organizational climate has typically been the focus, measured as part of the Organizational Readiness for Change (ORC) assessment [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. The ORC is posited as a comprehensive appraisal of organizational functioning which includes four domains: 1) motivation for change, 2) resources, 3) staff attributes, and 4) organizational climate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. Within the organizational climate domain of the ORC are six scales: clarity of mission and goals, staff cohesiveness, staff autonomy, openness of communication, stress, and openness to change. In line with molar climate measures, these scales capture general organizational functioning and are not specific to a specific strategic imperative (such as implementation). A recent review found the ORC was used in multiple studies examining the influence of organizational readiness for change on EBP implementation in SUD treatment programs; however, the application of ORC findings in the process of implementing quality improvement initiatives remains unclear [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although much of the current research examining the impact of organizational climate on the implementation of EBPs has focused on molar climate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>], researchers are now investigating the role of specific, focused climates, including the organization’s climate for EBP implementation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. Strategic climates develop depending on how employees gauge management’s interpretation of the climate, and observing the degree to which leaders expect, support, and reward the use of certain targeted clinical and service strategies such as EBPs. Strategic EBP implementation climate develops when the organization and its leaders communicate and demonstrate their values regarding the importance of implementing EBPs. In organizations where EBP implementation climate is high, employees perceive that the organization supports the implementation of EBPs. In turn, employees also focus their attention on EBP implementation, and model these perceived organizational values. The presence of a strong EBP implementation climate should ultimately result in enhanced EBP specific outcomes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>].

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Building on foundational research on implementation climate by Klein, Conn, and Sorra [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>] and Schein’s work on climate/culture embedding mechanisms [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>], Ehrhart, Aarons, and Farahnak [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>] defined an EBP implementation climate as “employees’ shared perceptions of the importance of EBP implementation within the organization” (p. 2). To measure the EBP implementation climate, they drew from past literature on implementation climate and other focused climates as well as subject matter expert input to develop the Implementation Climate Scale (ICS). The ICS identifies the following six factors that contribute to successful implementation climate: 1) the team/agency focus on EBP, 2) providing education support for EBP, 3) recognizing staff for utilizing EBP, 4) providing rewards to staff for employing EBP, 5) selecting staff who have prior EBP experience, and 6) selecting staff for general openness. Research on the ICS has shown that it is positively related with a variety of implementation-related outcomes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. Although this measure has been validated in mental health [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>] and child welfare [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>] settings, it has not been validated in SUD settings.
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric characteristics of the ICS in a sample of SUD service organizations. Although there are limited studies to date on implementation of EBPs in SUD as compared to mental health services, research on mental health EBP implementation can serve a useful guide [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. As such, we hypothesized that the psychometric properties and factor structure of the ICS in SUD settings would be similar to what has been found in past research in examining the ICS in mental health services. Aligned with previous validation studies of the ICS [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>], we evaluated construct-based validity with similar and relevant constructs to EBP implementation climate. We hypothesized that the ICS would have moderate positive correlations with another focused climate, service climate, which evaluates the organization’s emphasis on providing high quality services. Organizations that emphasize high quality service are likely also to place an emphasis on EBP implementation, but the distinct focus of each type of climate should mean that the measures are not completely overlapping. We hypothesized a weak positive correlation between the ICS and general molar climate, which is related to aspects of generally effective work units. Teams that are generally well-functioning may also be more likely to place an emphasis on EBP implementation, but the measures should be distinct because the content of molar climate is not implementation specific. We hypothesized a weak positive correlation between the ICS and planned organizational change, because even though organizations that place a strong emphasis on EBP implementation are likely to be undergoing change, the measure includes aspects of innovation and flexibility that are not central to EBP implementation. A weak negative correlation with uncertainty of organizational change was also hypothesized. Because teams with a strong implementation climate would have a structure and processes for successful implementation, we expect less uncertainty about change in such environments.
