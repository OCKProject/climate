 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implementation climate was measured using the Implementation Climate Scale (ICS; 43). Providers reported about their team’s (i.e., their work group’s) implementation climate. Specifically, the referent for the respondent was the team, which was determined based on the service provider’s direct supervisor. The ICS is comprised of 18 items with and respondents are asked to respond regarding the degree to which they agree with each statement using response anchors from 0 (‘not at all’) to 4 (‘to a very great extent’). Items fall into six subscales: 1) Focus on EBP (

  <span class="italic">α</span> = .84), 3) Recognition for EBP (
  <span class="italic">α</span> = .78), 4) Rewards for EBP (
  <span class="italic">α</span> = .81), 5) Selection for EBP (
  <span class="italic">α</span> = .89), and 6) Selection for openness (
  <span class="italic">α</span> = .85). The mean of the subscales was computed to create the ICS score (
  <span class="italic">α</span> = .90). The complete ICS measure including scoring instructions can be found in the “additional files” accompanying the original measurement development study [
