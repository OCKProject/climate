 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our sample consisted of 326 SUD service providers employed in three publicly funded, non-profit SUD organizations in California and New York. Of the 363 eligible providers, 327 (90.1%) participated in the survey. Of the 327 participants, one participant was not included in the analytic sample due to missing data for the entire ICS measure, resulting in a final analytic sample of 326. Of the 326 participants, 166 (50.9%) were from one organization (all in CA), another 107 (32.8%) from a second organization (54 in CA and 53 in NY), and 53 (16.3%) from a third organization (all in CA). Providers were organized into 65 teams (i.e., providers who report to the same supervisor), with an average team size of 5.02 (SD = 3.1; range = 1–13). Consistent with other research in SUD service settings [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>], the sample was predominately female (62.9%) with an average age of 46.49 years (SD = 11.61, range 21–71). The racial distribution of the sample was 59.7% ‘Caucasian’, 18.9% ‘African-American’, 1.3% ‘Native-American’, 2.8% ‘Asian-American or Pacific Islander’, and 17.3% ‘Other’, with 28.5% of participants identifying as ‘Hispanic/Latino.’ The majority of participants completed at least some college education (90.5%), and 9.5%% indicating they had less than a college education.
