 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the psychometric properties of the ICS, confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were conducted using Mplus statistical software [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. A confirmatory factor analysis allows researchers to test whether the proposed structure of the data (i.e., the loading of items on particular subscales or factors) aligns with the actual data collected [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>]. We accounted for the nested data structure using the ‘CLUSTER’ command, and used maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors to adjust the standard error and chi-square values for non-normality. Although minimal, missing data were accounted for using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation. In order to assess model fit, several descriptive fix indexes and recommended cutoffs were utilized, with comparative fit index (CFI) greater than .95, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) less than .06, and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) less than .08 indicating strong model fit [

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cronbach’s alpha was also assessed for each of the subscales and overall ICS to evaluate internal consistency reliability. Intraclass correlations (ICC[1]s) and the average correlation within team (

   <span class="italic">wg(j)</span>
  </sub>) for each subscale were calculated to evaluate the aggregation of the individual-level responses to the unit (i.e., team) level. Higher values on both ICC(1) and 
  <span class="italic">a</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">wg(j)</span>
  </sub> suggest that aggregation to the unit level is appropriate. ICC(1) values ranging from .05–.20 are typically seen in applied research [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>]. Three of the 65 teams were not included in the aggregation analyses as they were comprised of only one provider. Lastly, individual and team level construct-based validity of the ICS was examined by comparing the correlations with service climate, molar climate, and organizational change.
