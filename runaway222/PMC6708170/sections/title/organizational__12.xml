 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Molar organizational climate was measuring using the Organizational Climate Measure (OCM; [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>]). The OCM in its entirety consists of 17 scales capturing a broad range of molar organizational climate. Consistent with the original measurement development study [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>], three of the 17 scales were used to examine construct-based validity. The three scales included in this study assessed climate for performance feedback (
  <span class="italic">α</span> = .89, five items), involvement (
  <span class="italic">α</span> = .88, six items), and efficiency (
  <span class="italic">α</span> = .89, four items). OCM items were scored on a 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“definitely true”) scale.
