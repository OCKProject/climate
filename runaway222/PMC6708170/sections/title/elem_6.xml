  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our sample consisted of 326 SUD service providers employed in three publicly funded, non-profit SUD organizations in California and New York. Of the 363 eligible providers, 327 (90.1%) participated in the survey. Of the 327 participants, one participant was not included in the analytic sample due to missing data for the entire ICS measure, resulting in a final analytic sample of 326. Of the 326 participants, 166 (50.9%) were from one organization (all in CA), another 107 (32.8%) from a second organization (54 in CA and 53 in NY), and 53 (16.3%) from a third organization (all in CA). Providers were organized into 65 teams (i.e., providers who report to the same supervisor), with an average team size of 5.02 (SD = 3.1; range = 1–13). Consistent with other research in SUD service settings [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>], the sample was predominately female (62.9%) with an average age of 46.49 years (SD = 11.61, range 21–71). The racial distribution of the sample was 59.7% ‘Caucasian’, 18.9% ‘African-American’, 1.3% ‘Native-American’, 2.8% ‘Asian-American or Pacific Islander’, and 17.3% ‘Other’, with 28.5% of participants identifying as ‘Hispanic/Latino.’ The majority of participants completed at least some college education (90.5%), and 9.5%% indicating they had less than a college education.

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to recruitment, initial contact with agency executives was made to gain approval to proceed and to verify that the organization had recent, if not current, experience implementing an EBP. Upon approval, supervisors were then contacted via email to schedule a call presenting the study to their staff. During those calls, the research team provided further information about the definition of, and ensured staff familiarity with, EBP.</p>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected via online (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 222) and paper-and-pencil (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 104) surveys depending on feasibility, and the survey took approximately 20–30 min to complete. A comparison of the means on the ICS subscales revealed no significant differences in the ICS measure based on the method of survey completion (online versus paper-and-pencil). This study was approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Boards and participants provided informed consent prior to survey administration, and received a $15 gift certificate for their participation. For online surveys each participant was emailed a unique password and username, in addition to the link to the survey. For in-person data collection the research team reserved an hour during a regularly occurring team meeting. Participants were ensured that their responses to the survey would be completely confidential and individually identifiable data would not be provided back to their supervisors. If participants were not able to complete the survey in-person and collecting data online was not practical, surveys were left or mailed to the participating agencies and returned to the research team via mail.

   <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implementation climate was measured using the Implementation Climate Scale (ICS; 43). Providers reported about their team’s (i.e., their work group’s) implementation climate. Specifically, the referent for the respondent was the team, which was determined based on the service provider’s direct supervisor. The ICS is comprised of 18 items with and respondents are asked to respond regarding the degree to which they agree with each statement using response anchors from 0 (‘not at all’) to 4 (‘to a very great extent’). Items fall into six subscales: 1) Focus on EBP (
    <span class="italic">α</span> = .90), 2) Educational support for EBP (
    <span class="italic">α</span> = .84), 3) Recognition for EBP (
    <span class="italic">α</span> = .78), 4) Rewards for EBP (
    <span class="italic">α</span> = .81), 5) Selection for EBP (
    <span class="italic">α</span> = .89), and 6) Selection for openness (
    <span class="italic">α</span> = .85). The mean of the subscales was computed to create the ICS score (

We accounted for the nested data structure using the ‘CLUSTER’ command, and used maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors to adjust the standard error and chi-square values for non-normality. Although minimal, missing data were accounted for using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation. In order to assess model fit, several descriptive fix indexes and recommended cutoffs were utilized, with comparative fit index (CFI) greater than .95, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) less than .06, and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) less than .08 indicating strong model fit [
