 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to recruitment, initial contact with agency executives was made to gain approval to proceed and to verify that the organization had recent, if not current, experience implementing an EBP. Upon approval, supervisors were then contacted via email to schedule a call presenting the study to their staff. During those calls, the research team provided further information about the definition of, and ensured staff familiarity with, EBP.</p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected via online (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 222) and paper-and-pencil (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 104) surveys depending on feasibility, and the survey took approximately 20–30 min to complete. A comparison of the means on the ICS subscales revealed no significant differences in the ICS measure based on the method of survey completion (online versus paper-and-pencil). This study was approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Boards and participants provided informed consent prior to survey administration, and received a $15 gift certificate for their participation. For online surveys each participant was emailed a unique password and username, in addition to the link to the survey. For in-person data collection the research team reserved an hour during a regularly occurring team meeting. Participants were ensured that their responses to the survey would be completely confidential and individually identifiable data would not be provided back to their supervisors. If participants were not able to complete the survey in-person and collecting data online was not practical, surveys were left or mailed to the participating agencies and returned to the research team via mail.
