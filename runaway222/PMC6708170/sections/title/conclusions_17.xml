 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the organizational context for implementation is a critical factor in setting the foundation for implementation success. Having a tool that is valid and reliable, in addition to being brief and practical for applied use, allows SUD organizations to better understand how to build a climate to support implementation and allows substance abuse researchers to better understand the role of climate in implementation effectiveness. Future research should expand on the study of this measure with additional constructs as well as establishing criterion-related validity evidence by showing its relationship with key implementation outcomes.</p>
