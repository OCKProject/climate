  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> provides the ICS scale reliabilities, item means, standard deviations, and the aggregation statistics. The ICS range of means for subscales was 1.86 to 2.63 on the 0–4 response scale, with the exception of Rewards for EBP, which was notably lower at .64. This pattern was similar to that reported by Ehrhart, Aarons, and Farahnak [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>] with the biggest difference being for the Focus on EBP dimension, which had a mean of 2.63 in this sample versus 2.28 in a mental health sample.

 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cronbach’s alpha reliabilities for the subscales and ICS total score ranged from .78–.90, demonstrating strong internal consistency reliability and in line with the findings of Ehrhart, Aarons, and Farahnak [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. The 
  <span class="italic">a</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">wg(j)</span>
  </sub> values for the total ICS scale were strong, ranging from .76 to .80, except for the Rewards subscale which was notable lower at .62. In order to determine the amount of dependency among observations within teams, intraclass correlations, specifically ICC(1) values, were calculated. The ICC(1) for the overall ICS scale was .04. The ICC(1) values for the subscales ranged from −.02 to .15; all values were .03 or larger except for the value for the Selection for EBP subscale. Overall, the 
  <span class="italic">a</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">wg(j)</span>
  </sub> values were similarly strong as in the Ehrhart, Aarons, and Farahnak [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>] paper, but the ICC(1) values were not as strong. Although this pattern of aggregation statistics supports the use of the ICS subscales and total scale as unit-level constructs in SUD treatment settings, it does suggest that there may be less within team variability in the implementation climate levels of SUD treatment settings relative to mental health settings.

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Correlations for the ICS total score and its six subscales with all of the proposed validity measures at the individual and team-levels can be found in Tables 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a> and 
  <a rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" href="#Tab6">6</a>, respectively. For brevity’s sake, the primary focus was on the results for the ICS total score. As hypothesized, service climate was moderately to strongly correlated with ICS total score at both the individual (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.57, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) and team levels (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.62, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01). Findings were somewhat mixed for the three dimensions of molar organizational climate relationships with EBP implementation climate. All of the dimensions had statistically significant but weak to moderate correlations with the overall ICS scale score at the individual level (performance feedback: 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.39, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01; involvement:

  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.28, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01). At the team level, correlations were slightly lower and the correlation with efficiency was not significant (performance feedback: 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.33, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01; involvement:

  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.23, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05). EBP implementation climate was positively related to perceptions of planned change (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.30, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) and negatively related to perceptions of uncertainty (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = − 0.24, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) at the individual level, with a similar pattern at the team level (planned change:

  <span class="italic">r</span> = − 0.38,
