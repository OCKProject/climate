While climate change has gathered global momentum and is taught frequently, the extent to which the relationships between climate change and health are taught remains uncertain. Education provides an opportunity to create public engagement on these issues, but the extent to which historical implementation of climate health education could be leveraged is not well understood. To address this gap, we propose to conduct a scoping review of all forms of teaching that have been used to illustrate the health effects of climate change between 2005 and 2017, coinciding with a turning point in the public health and climate change agendas following the 2005 Group of 7/8 (G7/8) Summit.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Using Arksey/O&#x02019;Malley&#x02019;s and Levac&#x02019;s methodological framework, MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Education Resource Information Centre, Web of Science, Global Health, Health Management Information Consortium, Georef, Ebsco and PROSPERO will be systematically searched. Predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria will be applied by two independent reviewers to determine study eligibility. Studies published in English and after 2005 only will be examined. Following selection of studies, data will be extracted and analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>No ethical approval is required as exclusively secondary data will be used.

Digital technology and education, in the form of social media, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and other forms of digital dissemination form an opportunity to leverage broad reach and impact of sharing information to the public. Expertise in how to use the latest evidence on the impact of health and climate change to inform how to effectively engage the public via digital platforms requires specialist knowledge due to the rapidly changing nature of this medium.</p><p>Through the acquisition of knowledge and skills, education represents a key asset to combat climate change.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> According to the UNESCO, successful mitigation and adaptation may be achieved through scientific teaching and learning.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The Lancet advocates that tackling climate change could be the biggest global health opportunity of the 21st century;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> through the application of the Lancet Health and Climate Change Commission&#x02019;s multidisciplinary recommendations pertaining to education, research, collaborative actions and political commitment, seizing a global engagement opportunity through public resonance will be feasible.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Education will play a pivotal role in the achievement of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 which strives to &#x02018;take urgent action to tackle climate change and its impacts&#x02019;.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Following the use of educational platforms and other means to achieve SDG 13, it is predicted that the accomplishment of other climate-related SDGs such as SDG 2 and SDG 6 which strive to &#x02018;End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture&#x02019;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and &#x02018;Ensure access to water and sanitation for all&#x02019;,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> respectively will be facilitated. For example, epigenetics has demonstrated that environmental conditions can lead to modifications in the DNA of individuals adapting to changing climates;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> instruction and training can be an enabler to assist in such transitions to anticipated climates. Education creates a platform for learners to make informed decisions and build communities of practice centred on these issues, thereby strengthening, in the long run, resilience to climate change. Such democratisation of science and enhancement of societal relations may be achieved through engagement of the public in debate on issues and governmental decision-making.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p><p>While there are many benefits to be derived from the use of climate-themed education, explaining the risks and ambiguities surrounding climate change to lay citizens remains a challenge for scientists.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In addition to educators and institutions finding it challenging to teach,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> learners find the underlying science associated with climate change difficult to understand.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> While guidelines have been developed for climate change communication, further evidence is required to understand effectiveness.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> As a way to address this engagement gap, digital learning has been shown to be more efficient than traditional learning approaches in promoting achievement and motivation in learners.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Challenges in communicating the public health implications of climate change may, therefore, be addressed through the application of digital learning in the climate change and health education agenda.</p><p>Minimal attention has been given to the public health implications of climate change before 2005.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In fact, during the G7/8 Summit in 2005, the need for the international community to respond to climate change was addressed.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A renewed commitment to climate change was illustrated through the encouragement of global cooperation and responsibility.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Due to the growing interest of the international community in climate change and health, it is expected that halting human-made harm is achievable through implementation of successful educational platforms. Despite the detrimental health effects of climate change, the extent to which they are actively taught and communicated to the public remains unclear.

The study findings will enable the understanding of improved and effective educational approaches, materials, tools and content on climate change and health that may enhance civic engagement through empowerment of the public with the required skills and tools to overcome this global challenge. In addition to developing recommendations that align the needs of learners and educators, approaches for vulnerable populations, which remain to be targeted, will be considered and disseminated. The results will be used by the EIT Health-Knowledge and Innovation Communities to assist in the development of a forthcoming MOOC on the health effects of climate change.</p><p>As data collection for the scoping review methodology uses exclusively secondary data, no ethical approval is required. Review findings will be disseminated through educational materials and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Aspiring to tackle the greatest global health challenge of our time,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> we aim to use the knowledge gained from the review to develop for citizens, industry and universities key concepts for further development of learning infrastructure that will enable positive global change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e273" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-020330.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e274" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-020330.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Imperial College medical librarian for advising us on methods required to conduct a systematic search strategy.
