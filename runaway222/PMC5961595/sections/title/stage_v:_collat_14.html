      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Systematic scoping reviews provide an overview by answering broad questions.
         <a>20</a> Following data extraction, results will be presented: (1) numerically—synopsis of
         the amount and type of included studies and (ii) narratively—a synthesis of all included
         studies. The authors will discuss implications of the findings on future research,
         practice and policy.
         <a>19</a> To provide a holistic analysis, the structure of the intervention of interest (all
         teaching forms used to teach learners the relationship between climate change and
         health) will be captured by recording pedagogy, course content and learning outcomes.
         This will consist of data including, but not limited to educational method, educational
         content, length/duration, outcome measures, outcome results and financial support.
         We believe that this approach will allow us to determine the educational experience
         of learners and educators as the needs of learners, learner–educator interactions,
         learner–learner interactions, contributions of the department and use of information
         to nudge behaviours and improve decision-making skills will be considered. Details
         of Stage V remain in progress and will be finalised in November 2017. However, they
         may be reiterated or updated if reviewers see fit.
