 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Systematic scoping reviews provide an overview by answering broad questions.
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">20</a> Following data extraction, results will be presented: (1) numerically—synopsis of the amount and type of included studies and (ii) narratively—a synthesis of all included studies. The authors will discuss implications of the findings on future research, practice and policy.
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">19</a> To provide a holistic analysis, the structure of the intervention of interest (all teaching forms used to teach learners the relationship between climate change and health) will be captured by recording pedagogy, course content and learning outcomes. This will consist of data including, but not limited to educational method, educational content, length/duration, outcome measures, outcome results and financial support. We believe that this approach will allow us to determine the educational experience of learners and educators as the needs of learners, learner–educator interactions, learner–learner interactions, contributions of the department and use of information to nudge behaviours and improve decision-making skills will be considered. Details of Stage V remain in progress and will be finalised in November 2017. However, they may be reiterated or updated if reviewers see fit.
