      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a consequence of human activities affecting the climate, extreme weather events,
         warming trends and reductions in Arctic sea ice are predicted to continue over the
         coming decades causing irreversible consequences.
         <a>1 2</a> Climate change causes significant detrimental direct
         <a><span>i</span></a> and indirect
         <a><span>ii</span></a> effects on human life, highlighting the importance of improving knowledge of its
         impact while acquiring essential skills.
         <a>3</a> Modifiable environmental factors are responsible for 23% of worldwide mortality and
         26% of deaths attributed to children under the age of 5 years, according to the WHO.
         <a>4</a> As a rapid expansion in the knowledge pertaining to health behaviours has been gained
         over the last two decades,
         <a>5</a> a dynamic exchange between learners and educators has the potential to improve environmental
         outcomes as well as individual and population-based health outcomes. Digital technology
         and education, in the form of social media, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and
         other forms of digital dissemination form an opportunity to leverage broad reach and
         impact of sharing information to the public. Expertise in how to use the latest evidence
         on the impact of health and climate change to inform how to effectively engage the
         public via digital platforms requires specialist knowledge due to the rapidly changing
         nature of this medium.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through the acquisition of knowledge and skills, education represents a key asset
         to combat climate change.
         <a>6</a> According to the UNESCO, successful mitigation and adaptation may be achieved through
         scientific teaching and learning.
         <a>7</a> The Lancet advocates that tackling climate change could be the biggest global health
         opportunity of the 21st century;
         <a>8</a> through the application of the Lancet Health and Climate Change Commission’s multidisciplinary
         recommendations pertaining to education, research, collaborative actions and political
         commitment, seizing a global engagement opportunity through public resonance will
         be feasible.
         <a>8</a> Education will play a pivotal role in the achievement of the Paris Agreement and
         the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 which strives to ‘take urgent action to
         tackle climate change and its impacts’.
         <a>9</a> Following the use of educational platforms and other means to achieve SDG 13, it
         is predicted that the accomplishment of other climate-related SDGs such as SDG 2 and
         SDG 6 which strive to ‘End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and
         promote sustainable agriculture’
         <a>9</a> and ‘Ensure access to water and sanitation for all’,
         <a>9</a> respectively will be facilitated. For example, epigenetics has demonstrated that
         environmental conditions can lead to modifications in the DNA of individuals adapting
         to changing climates;
         <a>10</a> instruction and training can be an enabler to assist in such transitions to anticipated
         climates. Education creates a platform for learners to make informed decisions and
         build communities of practice centred on these issues, thereby strengthening, in the
         long run, resilience to climate change. Such democratisation of science and enhancement
         of societal relations may be achieved through engagement of the public in debate on
         issues and governmental decision-making.
         <a>11</a></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While there are many benefits to be derived from the use of climate-themed education,
         explaining the risks and ambiguities surrounding climate change to lay citizens remains
         a challenge for scientists.
         <a>12</a> In addition to educators and institutions finding it challenging to teach,
         <a>12 13</a> learners find the underlying science associated with climate change difficult to
         understand.
         <a>14</a> While guidelines have been developed for climate change communication, further evidence
         is required to understand effectiveness.
         <a>12</a> As a way to address this engagement gap, digital learning has been shown to be more
         efficient than traditional learning approaches in promoting achievement and motivation
         in learners.
         <a>15</a> Challenges in communicating the public health implications of climate change may,
         therefore, be addressed through the application of digital learning in the climate
         change and health education agenda.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Minimal attention has been given to the public health implications of climate change
         before 2005.
         <a>16</a> In fact, during the G7/8 Summit in 2005, the need for the international community
         to respond to climate change was addressed.
         <a>17</a> A renewed commitment to climate change was illustrated through the encouragement
         of global cooperation and responsibility.
         <a>16 17</a> Due to the growing interest of the international community in climate change and
         health, it is expected that halting human-made harm is achievable through implementation
         of successful educational platforms. Despite the detrimental health effects of climate
         change, the extent to which they are actively taught and communicated to the public
         remains unclear. As there is limited understanding of the evidence of the teaching
         forms applied in climate change and health, the proposed review will address this
         gap, enabling the opportunity to apply them in using digital technology to encourage
         sustainable action.
