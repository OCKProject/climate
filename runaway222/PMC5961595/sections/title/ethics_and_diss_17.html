      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following successful completion of the review, educational approaches applied over
         the last 12 years in the teaching of the health effects of climate change will be
         determined. The study findings will enable the understanding of improved and effective
         educational approaches, materials, tools and content on climate change and health
         that may enhance civic engagement through empowerment of the public with the required
         skills and tools to overcome this global challenge. In addition to developing recommendations
         that align the needs of learners and educators, approaches for vulnerable populations,
         which remain to be targeted, will be considered and disseminated. The results will
         be used by the EIT Health-Knowledge and Innovation Communities to assist in the development
         of a forthcoming MOOC on the health effects of climate change.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As data collection for the scoping review methodology uses exclusively secondary data,
         no ethical approval is required. Review findings will be disseminated through educational
         materials and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Aspiring to tackle the greatest
         global health challenge of our time,
         <a>8</a> we aim to use the knowledge gained from the review to develop for citizens, industry
         and universities key concepts for further development of learning infrastructure that
         will enable positive global change.
