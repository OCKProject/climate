      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EndNote software will be used to remove duplicates. 
         <a>Table 2</a> outlines the study’s inclusion criteria. Based on the review’s predetermined inclusion
         and exclusion criteria, titles and abstracts of papers will then be independently
         screened by two reviewers, to ensure no bias occurs.
         <a>19</a> Ineligible papers will be eliminated. Titles and abstracts that appear to meet the
         review’s eligibility criteria will be subjected to full-text reading. A third reviewer
         will assist in the selection process if the two primary reviewers cannot reach a consensus
         on study eligibility. A PRISMA flow diagram will be used to demonstrate the review’s
         selection process and exclusion reasons, demonstrating replicability and transparency.
         This stage will represent an iterative process, incorporating search of the literature,
         refinement of search strategies and selection of articles.
