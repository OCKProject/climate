 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following preliminary research on climate change and health, it became apparent that evidence on the education approach concerning the relationship of climate change and health was insufficient for understanding best practice in course development, thus illustrating an evidence gap. Considering this deficiency, the reviewâ€™s research question in 
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">table 1</a> was developed.
