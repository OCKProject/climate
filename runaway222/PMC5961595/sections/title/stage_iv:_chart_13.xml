 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predetermined data charting forms will be used to retrieve data from included papers. Extracted data will include author, study type, publication date, study characteristics (location, educational setting (eg, medicine or life sciences department in universities), use of control), learner characteristics (profession, number of participants, age), educator characteristics (number, age, profession), intervention details (educational method, educational content, length/duration, outcome measures, outcome results, financial support). The review will map the educational approaches used between 2005 and 2017 in climate change and health literature. To assure that all relevant data are collected adequately, the forms used for data extraction will be reviewed by the research team prior to implementation. Data extraction will be conducted independently by two reviewers before comparing forms. Differences will be discussed (if necessary with a third reviewer) before producing a single form containing the required data.</p>
