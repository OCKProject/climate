      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Systematic scoping reviews aim to rapidly synthesise evidence on crucial concepts
         associated with broad research topics in addition to identifying the central sources
         and forms of evidence available. Despite methodological frameworks developed by Arksey
         and O’Malley
         <a>18</a> and Levac 
         <span>et al,</span><a>19</a> methods employed in the conduction of scoping reviews remain flexible to enable clarification
         of concepts and research questions following familiarisation with the literature.
         <a>20</a> Systematic scoping reviews are beneficial in areas with emerging evidence, where
         evidence paucity prevents execution of systematic reviews.
         <a>19</a> Also, by incorporating different study design, scoping reviews allow researchers
         to answer questions outside intervention effectiveness.
         <a>19</a> The rapid changes in the use of digital technology in learning, combined with recent
         advancements in the application of climate change and health in education, correlate
         to this methodological choice. The flexibility of this review method will allow the
         authors to broadly explore the literature on the learning methods used to educate
         learners on the relationship between climate change and health between 2005 and 2017,
         while structuring findings in a repeatable manner.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The review will combine knowledge resulting from different study designs in peer-reviewed
         literature. Although quality assessment is not always conducted in scoping reviews,
         <a>19</a> the methodology applied to synthesise knowledge is systematic, thereby accessible
         for critical analysis. Additionally, as the intent of the review is to survey learning
         provided, therefore quality assessment is not applicable as we are not reviewing the
         quality of learning in course design. The authors intend to complete the review in
         February 2018.

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following preliminary research on climate change and health, it became apparent that
               evidence on the education approach concerning the relationship of climate change and
               health was insufficient for understanding best practice in course development, thus
               illustrating an evidence gap. Considering this deficiency, the review’s research question
               in 
               <a>table 1</a> was developed.

                  Health Management Information Consortium, Georef, Ebsco and PROSPERO. Following the
                  development of MeSH terms, subject headings and keywords used to index articles, the
                  search strategy will be reviewed by an Imperial College medical librarian. Search
                  terms will include MeSH and keywords related to (1) teaching, (2) learning, (3) education,
                  (4) climate change and (5) health. Publication status, publication date and language
                  will be subjected to limits. Hence, searches will be restricted to papers published
                  in English between 2005 and 2017. As minimal attention was attributed to the public
                  health implications of climate change before 2005,
                  <a>16</a> papers published after 2005 only will be considered. Following the MEDLINE/PubMed
                  search, the search strategy will be converted and applied to the remaining databases.

                  imported to EndNote, a bibliographic software. Bibliographic citations of included

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Systematic scoping reviews provide an overview by answering broad questions.
               <a>20</a> Following data extraction, results will be presented: (1) numerically—synopsis of
               the amount and type of included studies and (ii) narratively—a synthesis of all included
               studies. The authors will discuss implications of the findings on future research,
               practice and policy.
               <a>19</a> To provide a holistic analysis, the structure of the intervention of interest (all
               teaching forms used to teach learners the relationship between climate change and
               health) will be captured by recording pedagogy, course content and learning outcomes.
               This will consist of data including, but not limited to educational method, educational
               content, length/duration, outcome measures, outcome results and financial support.
               We believe that this approach will allow us to determine the educational experience
               of learners and educators as the needs of learners, learner–educator interactions,
               learner–learner interactions, contributions of the department and use of information
               to nudge behaviours and improve decision-making skills will be considered. Details
               of Stage V remain in progress and will be finalised in November 2017. However, they
               may be reiterated or updated if reviewers see fit.

               Care &amp; Public Health, Imperial College’s and the London School of Economics’ Grantham
               Institute (a renowned authority on climate change and the environment), Oxford University
               and Université Grenoble Alpes, will be consulted, thus providing valuable insights
               beyond what has been captured through literature search.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A workshop in July 2018 at the European Scientific Institute defined public priorities
            and experiences. At this session, members of the public identified and prioritised
            areas of interest which were used to construct the parameters of this search.
