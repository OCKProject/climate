      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed and projected impacts of climate change on human health are significant.
         While climate change has gathered global momentum and is taught frequently, the extent
         to which the relationships between climate change and health are taught remains uncertain.
         Education provides an opportunity to create public engagement on these issues, but
         the extent to which historical implementation of climate health education could be
         leveraged is not well understood. To address this gap, we propose to conduct a scoping
         review of all forms of teaching that have been used to illustrate the health effects
         of climate change between 2005 and 2017, coinciding with a turning point in the public
         health and climate change agendas following the 2005 Group of 7/8 (G7/8) Summit.
