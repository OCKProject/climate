         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following electronic databases will be systematically searched: MEDLINE/PubMed,
            Embase, Scopus, Education Resource Information Centre, Web of Science, Global Health,
            Health Management Information Consortium, Georef, Ebsco and PROSPERO. Following the
            development of MeSH terms, subject headings and keywords used to index articles, the
            search strategy will be reviewed by an Imperial College medical librarian. Search
            terms will include MeSH and keywords related to (1) teaching, (2) learning, (3) education,
            (4) climate change and (5) health. Publication status, publication date and language
            will be subjected to limits. Hence, searches will be restricted to papers published
            in English between 2005 and 2017. As minimal attention was attributed to the public
            health implications of climate change before 2005,
            <a>16</a> papers published after 2005 only will be considered. Following the MEDLINE/PubMed
            search, the search strategy will be converted and applied to the remaining databases.
            Details pertaining to the review’s searching strategy for MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase and
            Scopus may be found in online 
            <a>supplementary appendices 3–5</a>. Additional search strategies may be requested at a later stage (once completed)
            from the review’s first author. Results of the database searches will be subsequently
            imported to EndNote, a bibliographic software. Bibliographic citations of included
            studies will be searched to identify any additional relevant studies.
