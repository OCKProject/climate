 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a consequence of human activities affecting the climate, extreme weather events, warming trends and reductions in Arctic sea ice are predicted to continue over the coming decades causing irreversible consequences.
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">1 2</a> Climate change causes significant detrimental direct

  <a ref-type="fn" rid="fn2" href="#fn2">
   <span class="sup">ii</span>
  </a> effects on human life, highlighting the importance of improving knowledge of its impact while acquiring essential skills.
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">3</a> Modifiable environmental factors are responsible for 23% of worldwide mortality and 26% of deaths attributed to children under the age of 5 years, according to the WHO.
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a> As a rapid expansion in the knowledge pertaining to health behaviours has been gained over the last two decades,
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">5</a> a dynamic exchange between learners and educators has the potential to improve environmental outcomes as well as individual and population-based health outcomes. Digital technology and education, in the form of social media, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and other forms of digital dissemination form an opportunity to leverage broad reach and impact of sharing information to the public. Expertise in how to use the latest evidence on the impact of health and climate change to inform how to effectively engage the public via digital platforms requires specialist knowledge due to the rapidly changing nature of this medium.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through the acquisition of knowledge and skills, education represents a key asset to combat climate change.
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">6</a> According to the UNESCO, successful mitigation and adaptation may be achieved through scientific teaching and learning.
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">7</a> The Lancet advocates that tackling climate change could be the biggest global health opportunity of the 21st century;
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">8</a> through the application of the Lancet Health and Climate Change Commission’s multidisciplinary recommendations pertaining to education, research, collaborative actions and political commitment, seizing a global engagement opportunity through public resonance will be feasible.
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">8</a> Education will play a pivotal role in the achievement of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 which strives to ‘take urgent action to tackle climate change and its impacts’.
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">9</a> Following the use of educational platforms and other means to achieve SDG 13, it is predicted that the accomplishment of other climate-related SDGs such as SDG 2 and SDG 6 which strive to ‘End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture’
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">9</a> and ‘Ensure access to water and sanitation for all’,
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">9</a> respectively will be facilitated. For example, epigenetics has demonstrated that environmental conditions can lead to modifications in the DNA of individuals adapting to changing climates;
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">10</a> instruction and training can be an enabler to assist in such transitions to anticipated climates. Education creates a platform for learners to make informed decisions and build communities of practice centred on these issues, thereby strengthening, in the long run, resilience to climate change. Such democratisation of science and enhancement of societal relations may be achieved through engagement of the public in debate on issues and governmental decision-making.
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">11</a>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While there are many benefits to be derived from the use of climate-themed education, explaining the risks and ambiguities surrounding climate change to lay citizens remains a challenge for scientists.
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">12</a> In addition to educators and institutions finding it challenging to teach,
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">12 13</a> learners find the underlying science associated with climate change difficult to understand.
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">14</a> While guidelines have been developed for climate change communication, further evidence is required to understand effectiveness.
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">12</a> As a way to address this engagement gap, digital learning has been shown to be more efficient than traditional learning approaches in promoting achievement and motivation in learners.
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">15</a> Challenges in communicating the public health implications of climate change may, therefore, be addressed through the application of digital learning in the climate change and health education agenda.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Minimal attention has been given to the public health implications of climate change before 2005.
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">16</a> In fact, during the G7/8 Summit in 2005, the need for the international community to respond to climate change was addressed.
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">17</a> A renewed commitment to climate change was illustrated through the encouragement of global cooperation and responsibility.
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">16 17</a> Due to the growing interest of the international community in climate change and health, it is expected that halting human-made harm is achievable through implementation of successful educational platforms. Despite the detrimental health effects of climate change, the extent to which they are actively taught and communicated to the public remains unclear. As there is limited understanding of the evidence of the teaching forms applied in climate change and health, the proposed review will address this gap, enabling the opportunity to apply them in using digital technology to encourage sustainable action.
