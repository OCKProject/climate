 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fire size distributions by time period aggregated all simulated fires for the three transects. We used Welch two sample t-test on log-transformed fire sizes to compare the static and dynamic fire size distributions. To scale simulation results from our transects to the entire Sierra Nevada, we calculated area-weighted estimates by applying area-weighted mean values by vegetation type from the three transects to the entire mountain range (3.4 × 10
