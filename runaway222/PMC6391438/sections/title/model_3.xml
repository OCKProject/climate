We used projections from CNRM CMS (Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques Coupled Global Climate Model), CCSM3 (National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model), and GFDL CM2.1 (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab coupled model). These climate models performed well in capturing both climate variability and seasonality over the historical period in California

When an ignition occurs in a grid cell, a draw from the fire probability distribution determines if the ignition becomes a fire. We used the same distribution as Liang

  </span>. Area burned is modeled using generalized Pareto distributions of log-area burned from fires occurring from (1984–2014), conditional on cumulative monthly moisture deficit from climate projections and biomass simulated for the historic period. For our dynamic simulations, which account for area burned in the prior decade, we updated biomass every ten years with simulated biomass from the dynamic vegetation model forced with simulated climate and fire. At each decadal time-step, we used the aboveground biomass layer from the prior decade’s simulation as an input to the fire size distribution model. This iterative approach resulted in decadal fire size distributions that were either a function of projected climate (static) or projected climate and prior area burned (dynamic). Prior fire events impact both the distribution of live and dead biomass and the fuel model associated with a burned grid cell. Non-forested grid cells are assigned a fuel model that has a rate-of-spread associated with grassland vegetation.
