 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As temperature has increased in the western US, forested area burned has increased by more than 1200% over the past four decades
  <span class="sup">

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changing climate alone can alter forest composition and productivity through the combined effects of higher temperature and drought
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. Under projected climate, fire can act as a catalyst for forest change because climatic tolerance differs among species and can vary as a function of age for trees, with juveniles typically having a narrower climate niche
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Thus, the effects of the climate-fire interaction on vegetation are likely to create feedbacks to subsequent fire size and emissions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The forests of the Sierra Nevada of California were historically shaped by fire, with low- and mid-elevation forests having fire return intervals on the order of years to decades and high-elevation forests on the order of decades to centuries
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. When a forest burns at higher frequency, fires tend to be less severe and the resultant emissions are lower
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Further, fire-induced tree mortality is lower and the amount of carbon taken up and stored by ecosystems for a sustained period is higher
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. However, many of the fire-prone forests in the Sierra are in a higher biomass state as a result of fire-exclusion, and this has increased the proportion of the landscape that is impacted by more severe fire
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. When a forested area experiences high-severity fire, it has an increased probability of a subsequent fire being high-severity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>; which has implications for both future carbon uptake and emissions if the post-fire community that develops has a lower biomass density
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior research in the Sierra Nevada has demonstrated that climate-wildfire interactions have the potential to fundamentally alter the distribution of tree species, the extent of forest cover, and carbon dynamics
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. To improve the linkage between prior and future fire events as moderated by vegetation and quantify the influence of this feedback on carbon dynamics and wildfire emissions in the Sierra Nevada, we used a process-based forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) to simulate forest and fire dynamics for three transects across the Sierra Nevada Mountains under projected climate (see Methods, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). We conducted simulations that assumed climate only affected area burned distributions via fuel flammability (static) and area burned distributions that accounted for the interaction of climate and prior fire events on both fuel flammability and availability (dynamic) using climate projections from three climate models forced with the medium-high, A2 emission scenario. The dynamic simulations used biomass layers that were impacted by fires simulated in the prior decade to re-estimate fire size distributions for the subsequent decade. Prior fire events impacted both the distribution of biomass and the fuel model that contributes to the determination of fire spread characteristics.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Accounting for the bottom-up control on area burned exerted by the effect of prior wildfire on vegetation available to burn, we found reductions in cumulative area burned ranging from −9.8 to −21.8% across the three transects (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Scaled to the mountain range, this equates to a reduction in area-weighted mean cumulative area burned of 2563.7 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> through 2100, a −14.3% change in cumulative area burned when accounting for the effects of prior wildfires on fire size.

 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cumulative area burned results were driven by the effect of prior burns on limiting the size of individual fire events because we held all other parameters constant between the two scenarios. The north transect showed a larger decrease in area burned under the dynamic scenario than the central and south transects because the north transect is less topographically diverse and a larger fraction of the land area is in lower elevation vegetation types that are available to burn over a larger proportion of the year. There was no statistical difference between fire size distributions during the first three decades of the simulation period, with means of 1060 ha for dynamic and 1105 ha for static simulations (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). However, by the final three decades of the simulation period (2070–2099), accounting for the influence of prior fires on subsequent fire size yielded a 20.9% reduction in mean fire size for the dynamic simulations (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Accounting for the vegetation-fire feedback had the largest effect on the upper quartile of fire size, with this distribution being significantly lower under the dynamic scenario during mid- and late-century periods (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The distributions of the largest wildfires, which are often the most costly in terms of fire suppression efforts, were only significantly different during the mid-century period (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). During the early-century period, the mean percentage of area burned was similar for the dynamic (15.2%) and static (15.7%) simulations. Accounting for the influence of prior area burned demonstrates the constraints imposed on the size of upper quartile and largest wildfires are substantial.

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emissions under the dynamic scenario, when area-weighted for the entire mountain range, were substantially lower than the static scenario (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Nonetheless, median cumulative CO
  <sub>2</sub> and methane (CH
  <sub>4</sub>) emissions for the dynamic scenario were 257.7 Tg and 0.9 Tg, respectively. The 2013 Rim fire, which burned more than 1040 km

Even when accounting for the prior area burned feedback in estimating future fire size, these results suggest that California will continue to be challenged by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases and criteria air pollutants with climate change.

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While our results demonstrate that accounting for the vegetation-fire feedback leads to a lower rate of increase in area burned with changing climate, area burned remains likely to increase. Our simulations estimate that the vegetation-fire feedback is only responsible for 7.5% of the cumulative area burned because vegetation re-growth happens with sufficient speed that the fuel limitation effects from fire are short-lived
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. While accounting for this feedback does help constrain future wildfire projections, it does not account for the severity of fire that occurs or the effect a fire has on the ecosystem.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fire alters forest C stocks and rates of uptake, with C stock loss and the length of time a forest is a C source increasing with increasing fire severity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. The severity with which a forest fire burns is a function of fuels (forest structure and biomass density), topography, and weather
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Given that we held the fire weather distribution constant between the scenarios, the only potential influence on fire severity was the effects of prior fire events on fuels. As a result, we found little difference in mean fire severity between the two scenarios (Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>–
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>) Thus, area burned was the sole factor influencing C storage on the landscape. Total ecosystem carbon (TEC) did not begin to deviate between the two scenarios until mid-century (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>). By 2100, the dynamic scenario mean TEC was 729 Tg (±7.9, 95% CI) and the static scenario mean was 717 Tg (±10.6, 95% CI). This is largely driven by the fact that even with the vegetation-fire feedback, 44% of the mountain range burns over the simulation period.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the emissions challenges on-going climate change poses to California, increasing area burned, especially if the fraction of high-severity fire increases, presents additional challenges for meeting the State’s climate mitigation target. However, this is not a foregone conclusion. Prior research has shown that managing the low- and mid-elevation forests in the Sierra Nevada with frequent burning can significantly reduce the area burned by high-severity wildfire and wildfire emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. The rate at which these treatments are applied can significantly alter the amount of C emitted to the atmosphere as area burned by wildfire increases through this century. Given we found no difference in area burned through 2039 for our two scenarios and the potential for regular burning to alter the way wildfire interacts with forests, early action to reduce the chance of high-severity fire could yield significant gains in reducing emissions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results demonstrate the importance of adequately characterizing the relationship between climate, ecosystems, and area burned over large landscapes for understanding how additional climate warming will alter future wildfire and carbon. Future wildfire and carbon trajectories in the Sierra Nevada will be the result of complex interactions between climate and weather, ecosystem and disturbance processes, and land management, all driven by accelerating climate change. Past experience provides inadequate analogues for interactions between climate-driven increases in disturbance magnitude and frequency. Our results demonstrate that by incorporating dynamic vegetation feedbacks to fire and carbon, we can better constrain our understanding of potential futures in the Sierra Nevada. However, the potential for extreme climatic events and their effect on disturbance processes such as widespread beetle and drought-related tree mortality, subsequent wildfire, and resulting forest succession pathways, assure us of surprises ahead.</p>
