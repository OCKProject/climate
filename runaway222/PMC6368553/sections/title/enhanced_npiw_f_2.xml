 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our HS-1 experiment (see Methods), when the North Atlantic freshwater perturbation (FWP) starts, the AMOC slows down rapidly, while the North Pacific ventilation gradually intensifies (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d, e</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). In the following, we define the averaged state of 301-400 model years as the HS-1 state. It yields a quasi-equilibrium state of the substantially weakened AMOC with less than 5 Sverdrup (Sv, 1 Sv = 10

  </span>, and a sustained maximum of NPIW formation with ~3.8 Sv (see Methods for the calculation of AMOC and NPIW strengths). In parallel, a N–S ocean transect along 180°E exhibits significantly lower salinities down to 2300 m depths, compared to the LGM state (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). This indicates a stronger NPIW rather than NPDW formation, in line with paleoceanographic evidence

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. Moreover, our simulated LGM and HS-1 states reveal deepened winter (i.e. mean of January, February and March) mixed layer depths (wMLD) in the middle of the Okhotsk and the western Bering Seas, compared to the rest of the subarctic Pacific Ocean and its marginal seas (Figs.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our experiments characterize the middle of the Okhotsk and the western Bering Seas by higher sea surface salinities (SSS) and deepened wMLD in HS-1 compared to the LGM state, while the winter sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the same area are not colder than during the LGM (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>f, 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a–c</a>). Here, we attribute the stronger NPIW formation of HS-1 to the enhanced convection in the middle of Okhotsk and the western Bering Seas, controlled by a weakened surface halocline superimposed on the cold glacial surface ocean.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our results, the weakened surface halocline in the middle of the Okhotsk and western Bering Seas correlates with an intensified Aleutian Low-pressure system during HS-1. Once the AMOC weakens, the Aleutian Low intensifies simultaneously (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). This rapid atmospheric teleconnection from the North Atlantic to subarctic Pacific occurs via tropical latitudes with higher SSTs in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific acting as a pivot in the mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>), as discussed in previous modelling studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. Over the mid-latitude North Pacific, the stronger Aleutian Low causes stronger Westerlies and thus accelerates the North Pacific surface circulation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). As a consequence, larger amounts of subtropical-sourced, saline water are transported northwards, leading to the higher SSS in the subarctic Pacific Ocean and its marginal seas (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). Moreover, relative to the LGM, the strengthened Aleutian Low of HS-1 generates an anomalous cyclonic atmospheric circulation over the subarctic Pacific (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). This pattern transports drier air masses from the East Siberian continent to the Okhotsk and western Bering Seas. Such a process acts to additionally increase the SSS of the Okhotsk and western Bering Seas and thus weakens the surface halocline during HS-1 by reducing the regional net precipitation, in line with drier conditions in the Far East region during millennial-scale cold periods of the deglaciation as indicated by terrestrial proxies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, the anomalous cyclonic atmospheric circulation over the subarctic Pacific of HS-1 drives a stronger subarctic Pacific gyre at the AMOC off-mode (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). This results in a stronger upwelling of relatively warmer, more saline water from subsurface depths, by enhancing the Ekman pumping effect. In the surface ocean, the thermal buoyancy of these upwelled subsurface water is counteracted by a heat loss to the cold surface atmosphere; however, the water remains saline and thus further weakens the surface stratification. Overall, our results suggest that the intensified Aleutian Low of HS-1 weakens the surface halocline in the Okhotsk and Bering Seas via multiple processes in the atmosphere-ocean coupled system. Here, our results provide modelling support to previous hypotheses about the effective role of Aleutian Low in changing glacial NPIW formation, beyond earlier broad conceptual assumptions

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our results, the stronger convection in the Okhotsk and Bering Seas of HS-1 is initiated when the surface halocline becomes weakened while the SSTs in the same region are below 0 °C and similar to the LGM conditions. Therefore, our results suggest that the presence of a surface-ocean halocline prevents the NPIW from a higher formation during the LGM, although the cold winter SSTs should be conducive to a stronger NPIW production. This resembles the known low-salinity barrier that constrains the modern NPIW formation in the Okhotsk Sea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>, and is also in line with previous modelling results about the dependence of glacial NPIW formation on the subpolar Pacific stratification
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. Notably, our simulated stronger NPIW formation in HS-1 occurs on the basis of the continued existence of a halocline between the surface and intermediate ocean since the LGM, although such halocline becomes relatively weaker in HS-1 (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>d–f). At the onset of the stronger NPIW formation during HS-1, the stronger convection transports more surface water with relatively lower salinities down to the intermediate-depth ocean, while it in turn ventilates the relatively more saline water from the intermediate to surface ocean. This process thus works to further weaken the halocline, acting as a positive feedback (salinity feedback, thereafter) for the NPIW intensification during HS-1. Here, our results indicate that a weakening, instead of a complete removal
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>, of the surface halocline triggers the stronger NPIW formation during HS-1 in conjunction with cold glacial surface ocean, and is also favoured by the salinity feedback.
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Notably, our results show that the stronger northward transport of subtropical-sourced warmer and more saline surface water does not lead to a warmer surface ocean in the NW Pacific and its marginal seas during HS-1 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>), in line with previous paleoceanographic evidences
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. In our results, the absence of a warmer NW Pacific in HS-1 is a result of the competition between atmospheric cooling impact and ocean warming potential. At the AMOC off-mode, the anomalous cyclonic atmospheric circulation of the stronger Aleutian Low transports a larger amount of cold air masses from the East Siberian continent to the Okhotsk and western Bering Seas. This process cools down the regional surface ocean, acting as the atmospheric cooling impact. In parallel, the oceanic warming potential correlates to the stronger northward advection of subtropical warmer water into the high latitudes North Pacific and the upwelling of relatively warmer water from the subsurface layer (due to the stronger ventilation and subarctic Pacific gyre). In the NW Pacific and its marginal seas, the atmospheric cooling impact and ocean warming potential work to change the SSTs in opposite ways, with their competition results determining the ultimate change in the SSTs from the LGM to HS-1. Here, these two competitive processes have important implication in understanding the distinct behaviours of the Atlantic-Pacific thermal seesaw in previous modelling studies: when the atmospheric cooling impact acts as the dominant control, the North Pacific shows lower SSTs in HS-1

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>; while when the ocean warming potential becomes in charge, the subarctic Pacific turns to warmer conditions against the cooling in the North Atlantic at the AMOC off-mode, thus constituting an Atlantic-Pacific thermal seesaw
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. In this study, a case of close contest between the atmospheric cooling impact and oceanic warming potential results in the SSTs of HS-1 to be overall comparable with the LGM values in the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). This explains the same climatic signals in the paleo temperature reconstructions from this region
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. Moreover, our modelling results characterize a non-uniform SST change in the vast area of the subarctic Pacific and its marginal seas from the LGM to HS-1. This is attributed to the spatial inconsistence of the competing amounts of the atmospheric cooling impact vs. oceanic warming potential. Here, our mechanism provides a unifying explanation for the regional heterogeneity among the previous paleoceanographic upper-ocean temperature reconstructions in the NW Pacific and its marginal seas

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. In essence, the Atlantic-Pacific thermal seesaw is not a uniform feature of the high latitudes North Pacific in response the AMOC slow-down according to our modelling results, thus regionally decoupling it from the Atlantic-Pacific MOC seesaw
