 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The last deglacial atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> rise has been attributed to the release of deep, sequestered carbon out of the global ocean, likely linked to abrupt, millennial-scale changes of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. In particular, the rapid atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> rise during the AMOC off-mode in Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS-1, 17.5-14.9 ka) is thought to be mainly induced by the CO
  <sub>2</sub> outgassing from the Southern Ocean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span> and a lower efficiency of the biological carbon pump globally
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. In parallel, studies have indicated a large storage of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the North Pacific deep waters (NPDW, the water mass below ~2500 m depth) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 23-18 ka)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. However, studies based on various marine proxies gave contradicting evidence that deep-ocean carbon was released from the North Pacific during HS-1 or, in contrast, remained isolated in a deep marine reservoir
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Specifically, such conflicting views revolve around whether or not the subarctic Pacific ventilation in HS-1 became deep and intense enough to connect to the deep ocean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. Once convection down to the deep ocean is established, the subarctic Pacific ventilation will be able to exchange properties, such as deep-ocean DIC, into intermediate depths, and then ventilate to the surface ocean for a potential CO
  <sub>2</sub> release. Thus, the abrupt change of deglacial subarctic Pacific ventilation and the corresponding deep-ocean stratification are the two physical characteristics that determine the role of North Pacific Ocean in the global carbon cycle system during the last glacial termination.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under modern climate conditions, the North Pacific ventilation mainly occurs in the Okhotsk Sea and produces the North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW), dominantly controlled by brine rejection during winter sea ice growth
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Accordingly, paleoceanographic studies have hypothesized a role of potential sea ice expansion in causing a deeper ventilation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>a–c) and probably stronger NPIW formation in HS-1 than during the LGM
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>, besides a direct control of a colder surface ocean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. In parallel, modelling studies have ascribed the stronger NPIW or NPDW formation of HS-1 to either intensified northward advection of warm, saline waters from the subtropical to the subarctic Pacific Ocean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>, a removal of the subpolar North Pacific halocline
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> or a colder and more saline surface subarctic Pacific Ocean during the North Atlantic cold events
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Nevertheless, a common characteristic of these otherwise partially exclusive explanations involves a breakdown of the surface-ocean density stratification in the subarctic Pacific Ocean. Regarding the maxima depths of deglacial North Pacific ventilation, there is hypothesized overturning throughout intermediate depths and down to the deep ocean of ~3000 m
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. In contrast, some other studies have argued that the deep-ocean water is decoupled from the mid depths (~2000 m) and thus a continued isolation of the NPDW during HS-1

Our work aims to complement the limitations of currently available proxy evidence in identifying the paleo-physical mechanisms of the HS-1 intensified North Pacific ventilation and development of North Pacific deep-ocean stratification. Our modelling results provide evidence for stronger NPIW formation during HS-1, triggered by increased surface salinity and strengthened by a positive temperature feedback. In conjunction with paleoceanographic evidence, we suggest an enhanced NPIW-to-NPDW stratification due to stronger NPIW formation during HS-1.
