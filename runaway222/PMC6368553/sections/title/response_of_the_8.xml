 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies have shown that the response of stronger NPIW formation to a off-mode AMOC is attributed to various mechanisms on the basis of the LGM state

  </span>. In our modelling results, the sea ice concentration is characterized by relatively lower values in the southern part of the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea. On the other hand, the sea ice edge in our FWP experiment with 0.8 Sv is in line with the HS-1 sea ice area indicated by palaeoceanographic evidences
