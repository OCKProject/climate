 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our modelling results characterize the NPIW by lower densities in HS-1 compared to the LGM, meanwhile the NPDW shows only insignificant change (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). This leads to a larger contrast in the vertical density gradients and thus a strengthened NPIW-to-NPDW stratification during HS-1 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1g</a>). More specifically, our results reveal that lower densities of NPIW in HS-1 are attributed to its lower salinities and higher temperatures compared to the LGM (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b–d</a>). When the AMOC weakens in our experiment, a stronger halocline between the intermediate and deep ocean develops due to the salinity feedback. This constrains the impact of relatively colder deep ocean water on the intermediate depths by limiting the vertical water exchange, thus retaining the warmer characteristic within NPIW during HS-1 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). In turn, this process also enhances the deep ocean stratification by enhancing the thermocline between the intermediate and deep ocean, thus creating a positive feedback (temperature feedback, thereafter) in developing an intensified intermediate-to-deep ocean stratification during HS-1.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our results, the NPIW change from the LGM to HS-1 is characterized not only in the subarctic Pacific, but is also advected southwards via the mid-depth ocean circulation. This thus provides lower salinities and higher temperatures to the lower latitudes (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). In Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>, W-E transect at 53°N across the entire North Pacific Ocean shows a stronger-than-LGM southward transport of low-salinity water at intermediate depths during HS-1. This is attributed to the coeval stronger southward ocean flow mainly between 500 and 2000 depths (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5b, f, j</a>), thus it depicts a stronger advection of NPIW to lower-latitude Pacific during HS-1. Along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska, our results characterize a relatively warmer surface ocean, and a warmer and less saline intermediate ocean during HS-1 compared to the LGM (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5d, f</a>). These are in line with previously reported paleoceanographic evidence based on oxygen isotopes from foraminifera in this area

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the sensitivity of our results to the amount of North Atlantic FWP, we also performed additional experiments with a half (0.4 Sv) or twice (1.6 Sv) the strength of the freshwater fluxes. In these experiments, our results give the same qualitative results of the enhanced NPIW-to-NPDW stratification along with the stronger NPIW formation under the HS-1 climate conditions (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). In these two alternate experiments, a stronger North Atlantic FWP indeed leads to stronger NPIW formation and a further development of the NPIW-to-NPDW stratification, due to the correspondingly intensified Aleutian Low (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). Moreover, a reanalysis of previous modelling results
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span> using a different Earth System Model also suggested a similar connection between the NPIW intensification and NPIW-to-NPDW stratification development at AMOC off-mode, although the previous modelling results presented a higher sensitivity to the North Atlantic FWP (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). Therefore, we demonstrate that the development of North Pacific deep ocean stratification along with stronger NPIW formation is independent from the AMOC slow-down process, as long as the AMOC reaches an off-mode state. Furthermore, we have performed an additional experiment with a stepwise increase in FWP (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). This experiment shows that the North Pacific responses to the AMOC off-mode is robust for basic LGM AMOC background states that can be weaker or stronger than in our simulated pre-industrial (PI) state. These background strengths are comparable to other estimates for the LGM AMOC states

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our North Atlantic FWP experiments apply the LGM level of 193 ppm CO
  <sub>2</sub>, thus lower than the recorded HS-1 atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> increase in the ice cores
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. To avoid an unintended impact of the higher CO
  <sub>2</sub> during HS-1 to our proposed physics, we additionally conducted an experiment applying the 0.8 Sv FWP together with a 240-ppm atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration. In such experiment, although the NPIW production rate becomes relatively lower than that under the 193 ppm CO
  <sub>2</sub> conditions, it remains significantly stronger than the LGM conditions, while the AMOC also remains in an off-mode of less than 5 Sv (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). Thus, we argue that the AMOC slow-down exerts a decisive control on the physical response of the stronger NPIW formation and corresponding intermediate-to-deep stratification, aligning with the concept of Atlantic-Pacific MOC seesaw

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our deglacial North Atlantic FWP experiments with a complex Earth System Model show a stronger NPIW formation and coeval enhancement of NPIW-to-NPDW stratification during HS-1. In our results, the NPIW formation maxima during HS-1 are attributed to the intensified North Pacific convection in the middle of Okhotsk and western Bering Seas, controlled by a significantly weakened surface halocline in conjunction with cold glacial SSTs and favoured by a salinity feedback. This stronger NPIW formation of HS-1 subducts a large amount of surface relatively less saline water down to the intermediate depths, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>. This process determines the lower densities of the NPIW during HS-1. In parallel, our results yield no significant changes in NPDW densities from the LGM to HS-1. By enlarging the vertical density gradient, this results in an enhanced NPIW-to-NPDW stratification during HS-1. As a consequence, a deep-ocean thermocline develops due to constrained impact of the relatively colder deep ocean to the intermediate depths. In turn, such a deep-ocean thermocline also contributes to the development of the NPIW-to-NPDW density stratification during HS-1, acting as a positive feedback.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our modelling results provide the physical paleoceanographic mechanisms to explain earlier hypotheses that postulates a stratification development between the NPIW and NPDW during HS-1, as shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>. In these marine proxy studies, the NW Pacific ventilation age decreased at intermediate depths

 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On a broader scale, our modelling findings have implications for scenarios of the North Pacific deep-ocean CO
  <sub>2</sub> release during the last deglaciation, by showing constrained NPDW formation in response to the AMOC off-mode in HS-1. The inferred physical changes in the configuration of the North Pacific intermediate ocean overturning would significantly enhance and prolong any existing isolation of glacial Pacific deep waters and foster the persistence of a deep pool of sequestered carbon, which was ultimately released from the ocean to atmosphere in other locations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. As we hypothesize that NPIW and NPDW salinities are key factors in controlling the deglacial ocean ventilation, paleo-salinity reconstructions in future proxy studies would be desirable to further develop the understanding of the physical determinants of the Pacific deep-ocean stratification and carbon pool evolution, in particular during past deglacial warming episodes.
