 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Paleoclimate modelling studies have presented diverse results in term of the AMOC strength of the LGM compared to the PI conditions

  </span>. In this study, our simulation of the LGM climate has the AMOC of ~28 Sv, stronger than the ~24.5 Sv in the PI control experiment (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Here, we also included an experiment with a 0.2 Sv FWP firstly and then a stronger hosing of 0.8 Sv. As shown in the Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1e</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>, the 0.2 Sv FWP weakened the AMOC from the LGM ~28 Sv to a quasi-equilibrium state of ~20 Sv. Here, we use the LGM state (28 Sv AMOC) and LGM with 0.2 Sv FWP (20 Sv AMOC) as the representatives for the LGM with stronger- and weaker-than-PI AMOC background, respectively. In this new experiment, the NPIW strength showed insignificant change when the AMOC slowed down to the 20 Sv due to the 0.2 Sv FWP, compared to the LGM state of ~28 Sv (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1f</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9b</a>). On the other hand, when the following 0.8 Sv FWP collapsed AMOC to an off mode (less than 5 Sv), the NPIW rapidly increased to ~2.8 Sv. Therefore, the NPIW response to the off-mode AMOC based on the LGM state with 0.2 Sv FWP (i.e. the case for the LGM with weaker-than-PI AMOC background) is in line with the NPIW intensification due to the AMOC collapse based on the LGM state of a stronger-than-PI AMOC (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d, e</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9b</a>). Accordingly, although based on a single model, our results indicated that the response of the NPIW intensification to the collapsed AMOC during HS-1 is independent from the LGM AMOC background.
