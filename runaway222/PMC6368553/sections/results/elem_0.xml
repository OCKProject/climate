  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our HS-1 experiment (see Methods), when the North Atlantic freshwater perturbation (FWP) starts, the AMOC slows down rapidly, while the North Pacific ventilation gradually intensifies (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d, e</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). In the following, we define the averaged state of 301-400 model years as the HS-1 state. It yields a quasi-equilibrium state of the substantially weakened AMOC with less than 5 Sverdrup (Sv, 1 Sv = 10

   </span>, and a sustained maximum of NPIW formation with ~3.8 Sv (see Methods for the calculation of AMOC and NPIW strengths). In parallel, a N–S ocean transect along 180°E exhibits significantly lower salinities down to 2300 m depths, compared to the LGM state (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). This indicates a stronger NPIW rather than NPDW formation, in line with paleoceanographic evidence

  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our experiments characterize the middle of the Okhotsk and the western Bering Seas by higher sea surface salinities (SSS) and deepened wMLD in HS-1 compared to the LGM state, while the winter sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the same area are not colder than during the LGM (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>f, 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a–c</a>). Here, we attribute the stronger NPIW formation of HS-1 to the enhanced convection in the middle of Okhotsk and the western Bering Seas, controlled by a weakened surface halocline superimposed on the cold glacial surface ocean.
  </p>
  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our results, the weakened surface halocline in the middle of the Okhotsk and western Bering Seas correlates with an intensified Aleutian Low-pressure system during HS-1. Once the AMOC weakens, the Aleutian Low intensifies simultaneously (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). This rapid atmospheric teleconnection from the North Atlantic to subarctic Pacific occurs via tropical latitudes with higher SSTs in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific acting as a pivot in the mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>), as discussed in previous modelling studies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
   </span>. Over the mid-latitude North Pacific, the stronger Aleutian Low causes stronger Westerlies and thus accelerates the North Pacific surface circulation (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). As a consequence, larger amounts of subtropical-sourced, saline water are transported northwards, leading to the higher SSS in the subarctic Pacific Ocean and its marginal seas (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). Moreover, relative to the LGM, the strengthened Aleutian Low of HS-1 generates an anomalous cyclonic atmospheric circulation over the subarctic Pacific (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). This pattern transports drier air masses from the East Siberian continent to the Okhotsk and western Bering Seas. Such a process acts to additionally increase the SSS of the Okhotsk and western Bering Seas and thus weakens the surface halocline during HS-1 by reducing the regional net precipitation, in line with drier conditions in the Far East region during millennial-scale cold periods of the deglaciation as indicated by terrestrial proxies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
   </span>. Furthermore, the anomalous cyclonic atmospheric circulation over the subarctic Pacific of HS-1 drives a stronger subarctic Pacific gyre at the AMOC off-mode (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). This results in a stronger upwelling of relatively warmer, more saline water from subsurface depths, by enhancing the Ekman pumping effect. In the surface ocean, the thermal buoyancy of these upwelled subsurface water is counteracted by a heat loss to the cold surface atmosphere; however, the water remains saline and thus further weakens the surface stratification. Overall, our results suggest that the intensified Aleutian Low of HS-1 weakens the surface halocline in the Okhotsk and Bering Seas via multiple processes in the atmosphere-ocean coupled system. Here, our results provide modelling support to previous hypotheses about the effective role of Aleutian Low in changing glacial NPIW formation, beyond earlier broad conceptual assumptions

  </p>
  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our results, the stronger convection in the Okhotsk and Bering Seas of HS-1 is initiated when the surface halocline becomes weakened while the SSTs in the same region are below 0 °C and similar to the LGM conditions. Therefore, our results suggest that the presence of a surface-ocean halocline prevents the NPIW from a higher formation during the LGM, although the cold winter SSTs should be conducive to a stronger NPIW production. This resembles the known low-salinity barrier that constrains the modern NPIW formation in the Okhotsk Sea
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>, and is also in line with previous modelling results about the dependence of glacial NPIW formation on the subpolar Pacific stratification
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span>. Notably, our simulated stronger NPIW formation in HS-1 occurs on the basis of the continued existence of a halocline between the surface and intermediate ocean since the LGM, although such halocline becomes relatively weaker in HS-1 (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>d–f). At the onset of the stronger NPIW formation during HS-1, the stronger convection transports more surface water with relatively lower salinities down to the intermediate-depth ocean, while it in turn ventilates the relatively more saline water from the intermediate to surface ocean. This process thus works to further weaken the halocline, acting as a positive feedback (salinity feedback, thereafter) for the NPIW intensification during HS-1. Here, our results indicate that a weakening, instead of a complete removal
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
   </span>, of the surface halocline triggers the stronger NPIW formation during HS-1 in conjunction with cold glacial surface ocean, and is also favoured by the salinity feedback.
  </p>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Notably, our results show that the stronger northward transport of subtropical-sourced warmer and more saline surface water does not lead to a warmer surface ocean in the NW Pacific and its marginal seas during HS-1 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>), in line with previous paleoceanographic evidences
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
   </span>. In our results, the absence of a warmer NW Pacific in HS-1 is a result of the competition between atmospheric cooling impact and ocean warming potential. At the AMOC off-mode, the anomalous cyclonic atmospheric circulation of the stronger Aleutian Low transports a larger amount of cold air masses from the East Siberian continent to the Okhotsk and western Bering Seas. This process cools down the regional surface ocean, acting as the atmospheric cooling impact. In parallel, the oceanic warming potential correlates to the stronger northward advection of subtropical warmer water into the high latitudes North Pacific and the upwelling of relatively warmer water from the subsurface layer (due to the stronger ventilation and subarctic Pacific gyre). In the NW Pacific and its marginal seas, the atmospheric cooling impact and ocean warming potential work to change the SSTs in opposite ways, with their competition results determining the ultimate change in the SSTs from the LGM to HS-1. Here, these two competitive processes have important implication in understanding the distinct behaviours of the Atlantic-Pacific thermal seesaw in previous modelling studies: when the atmospheric cooling impact acts as the dominant control, the North Pacific shows lower SSTs in HS-1
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
   </span>; while when the ocean warming potential becomes in charge, the subarctic Pacific turns to warmer conditions against the cooling in the North Atlantic at the AMOC off-mode, thus constituting an Atlantic-Pacific thermal seesaw
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
   </span>. In this study, a case of close contest between the atmospheric cooling impact and oceanic warming potential results in the SSTs of HS-1 to be overall comparable with the LGM values in the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). This explains the same climatic signals in the paleo temperature reconstructions from this region
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
   </span>. Moreover, our modelling results characterize a non-uniform SST change in the vast area of the subarctic Pacific and its marginal seas from the LGM to HS-1. This is attributed to the spatial inconsistence of the competing amounts of the atmospheric cooling impact vs. oceanic warming potential. Here, our mechanism provides a unifying explanation for the regional heterogeneity among the previous paleoceanographic upper-ocean temperature reconstructions in the NW Pacific and its marginal seas

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our modelling results characterize the NPIW by lower densities in HS-1 compared to the LGM, meanwhile the NPDW shows only insignificant change (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). This leads to a larger contrast in the vertical density gradients and thus a strengthened NPIW-to-NPDW stratification during HS-1 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1g</a>). More specifically, our results reveal that lower densities of NPIW in HS-1 are attributed to its lower salinities and higher temperatures compared to the LGM (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b–d</a>). When the AMOC weakens in our experiment, a stronger halocline between the intermediate and deep ocean develops due to the salinity feedback. This constrains the impact of relatively colder deep ocean water on the intermediate depths by limiting the vertical water exchange, thus retaining the warmer characteristic within NPIW during HS-1 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). In turn, this process also enhances the deep ocean stratification by enhancing the thermocline between the intermediate and deep ocean, thus creating a positive feedback (temperature feedback, thereafter) in developing an intensified intermediate-to-deep ocean stratification during HS-1.

  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our results, the NPIW change from the LGM to HS-1 is characterized not only in the subarctic Pacific, but is also advected southwards via the mid-depth ocean circulation. This thus provides lower salinities and higher temperatures to the lower latitudes (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). In Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>, W-E transect at 53°N across the entire North Pacific Ocean shows a stronger-than-LGM southward transport of low-salinity water at intermediate depths during HS-1. This is attributed to the coeval stronger southward ocean flow mainly between 500 and 2000 depths (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5b, f, j</a>), thus it depicts a stronger advection of NPIW to lower-latitude Pacific during HS-1. Along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska, our results characterize a relatively warmer surface ocean, and a warmer and less saline intermediate ocean during HS-1 compared to the LGM (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5d, f</a>). These are in line with previously reported paleoceanographic evidence based on oxygen isotopes from foraminifera in this area

  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the sensitivity of our results to the amount of North Atlantic FWP, we also performed additional experiments with a half (0.4 Sv) or twice (1.6 Sv) the strength of the freshwater fluxes. In these experiments, our results give the same qualitative results of the enhanced NPIW-to-NPDW stratification along with the stronger NPIW formation under the HS-1 climate conditions (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). In these two alternate experiments, a stronger North Atlantic FWP indeed leads to stronger NPIW formation and a further development of the NPIW-to-NPDW stratification, due to the correspondingly intensified Aleutian Low (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). Moreover, a reanalysis of previous modelling results
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
   </span> using a different Earth System Model also suggested a similar connection between the NPIW intensification and NPIW-to-NPDW stratification development at AMOC off-mode, although the previous modelling results presented a higher sensitivity to the North Atlantic FWP (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). Therefore, we demonstrate that the development of North Pacific deep ocean stratification along with stronger NPIW formation is independent from the AMOC slow-down process, as long as the AMOC reaches an off-mode state. Furthermore, we have performed an additional experiment with a stepwise increase in FWP (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). This experiment shows that the North Pacific responses to the AMOC off-mode is robust for basic LGM AMOC background states that can be weaker or stronger than in our simulated pre-industrial (PI) state. These background strengths are comparable to other estimates for the LGM AMOC states

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). Thus, we argue that the AMOC slow-down exerts a decisive control on the physical response of the stronger NPIW formation and corresponding intermediate-to-deep stratification, aligning with the concept of Atlantic-Pacific MOC seesaw

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our deglacial North Atlantic FWP experiments with a complex Earth System Model show a stronger NPIW formation and coeval enhancement of NPIW-to-NPDW stratification during HS-1. In our results, the NPIW formation maxima during HS-1 are attributed to the intensified North Pacific convection in the middle of Okhotsk and western Bering Seas, controlled by a significantly weakened surface halocline in conjunction with cold glacial SSTs and favoured by a salinity feedback. This stronger NPIW formation of HS-1 subducts a large amount of surface relatively less saline water down to the intermediate depths, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>. This process determines the lower densities of the NPIW during HS-1. In parallel, our results yield no significant changes in NPDW densities from the LGM to HS-1. By enlarging the vertical density gradient, this results in an enhanced NPIW-to-NPDW stratification during HS-1. As a consequence, a deep-ocean thermocline develops due to constrained impact of the relatively colder deep ocean to the intermediate depths. In turn, such a deep-ocean thermocline also contributes to the development of the NPIW-to-NPDW density stratification during HS-1, acting as a positive feedback.
