  <p>Modelled anomalies in the vertical profiles of the North Pacific Ocean and its marginal seas. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Northward salt flux averaged at 53°N across the entire North Pacific basin. The salt flux is calculated by multiplying salinity and meridional velocity, with the northward flux in positive values (see change in salinities and velocities at 53°N in Supplementary Fig.
