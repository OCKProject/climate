   <span class="bold">c</span> HS-1. OKS and BS mean the Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea, respectively. The white-bluish-black colours indicate an increase in salinities and also densities. In the subarctic Pacific region, denser circles indicate a stronger gyre circulation. In 
   <span class="bold">c</span>, the red circle of the NPIW water indicates relatively warmer conditions during HS-1 compared to the LGM conditions
