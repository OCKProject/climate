  <p>Vertical wind shear from left panels: CMIP5 multi-model mean representing the radiatively forced changes between two different time periods for historical (top, 1971–2005 minus 1871–1905), rcp4.5 (middle, 2070–2099 minus 1971–2000) and rcp8.5 (bottom, 2070–2099 minus 1971–2000) and right panels: composite based on positive AMV years minus negative AMV years for the historical, rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 integrations. Units are in m/s and the stippling indicates 75% of the models or ensemble members having the same sign changes.</p>
