 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first isolate the VWS and SST patterns that are externally forced due to radiative forcing change from those due to natural climate variability. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> shows the observed VWS and SST linearly regressed to the external radiative forcing component and the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) for the period 1950 to 2015. The external radiative forcing and AMV here are defined using the signal-to-noise maximizing empirical orthogonal function (SNEOF) analysis

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>. We also confirm the results in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> using the CESM-LE historical simulations with a total of 42 ensemble members started from slightly different initial conditions

  </span> (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Results in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> (and that in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>) indicate that the observed VWS dipole pattern during the peak hurricane season (August, September and October, or ASO), with enhanced shear along the U.S. East Coast and suppressed shear in the tropical North Atlantic, is primarily due to the positive phase of AMV. The contribution from anthropogenic and natural radiative forcing to the dipole pattern is rather weak during this period. The SST anomalies in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> indicate a basin-wide warming due to anthropogenic forcing and a horseshoe pattern with stronger warming in the tropical and midlatitude North Atlantic compared to that in the subtropical North Atlantic during AMV positive phase. Previous studies have shown that the warmer the SST the stronger the hurricane PI

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Thus Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> implies that when anthropogenic warming is combined with the positive phase of AMV, PI increases in the entire tropical North Atlantic. While the suppressed VWS in MDR enhances the possibility of hurricane formation and intensification, the stronger VWS along the U.S. East Coast suppresses the intensification rate in that region, consistent with Kossin
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. In contrast, when the anthropogenic warming is combined with the negative phase of AMV, the SST warming in the basin is slightly dampened while the intensification rate along the U.S. coast is enhanced due to the suppressed VWS. In summary, AMV modulates considerably the hurricane activity in both the tropical North Atlantic where hurricanes often form, and the U.S. East Coast where hurricanes make landfall. When hurricane activity is enhanced in the MDR region during the positive phase of AMV, the intensification along the U.S. East Coast is often suppressed due to stronger VWS and less SST warming there, and vice versa. Thus the AMV-related dipole pattern in VWS and SST provides a natural protective barrier for the U.S. East Coast from strong hurricane intensification and landfalls.

The winds and SST are taken from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and NOAA ERSST, respectively, for the period 1948 to 2015. Units are m/s per °C of SST index for VWS and °C per °C of SST index for SST. The stippling indicates statistical significance of the regression coefficients at the 5% level using 2-sided Student’s t-test.
