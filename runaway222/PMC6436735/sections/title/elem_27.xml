   <div class="title">A summary of selected vulnerable regions for Nicaragua (NIC) and Vietnam (VNM), with a reference to the “main drivers” (Sensitivity and Exposure) behind the vulnerability and the respective Adaptive Capacity (AC).</div>
   <p>A crop is classified as sensitive to climate change when climate suitability decline is equivalent to an index (see 
    <a rid="pone.0213641.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t003">Table 3</a>) of 0.25 (-5 - -24%), 0.5 (-25 - -49%) or 1 (-50 - -100%) for the respective administrative area. An indicator is listed in Exposure when the administrative area is in the top 25% of most affected administrative areas for the respective indicator (Nicaragua: Highest (1)–Lowest (154), Vietnam: Highest (1)–Lowest (692)) with the rank documented in the table. Adaptive Capacity (AC) is shown as a single index for Nicaragua documented as Low (0–0.3), medium (0.3–0.6) and high (0.6–1). In Vietnam, AC Index is displayed as low (0.535–0.661), medium (0.662–0.771) and high (0.772–1) and also the individual indicators which are in the bottom 25% when ranked lowest to highest with the recorded rank are documented (Vietnam Lowest (1)–Highest (692)).
