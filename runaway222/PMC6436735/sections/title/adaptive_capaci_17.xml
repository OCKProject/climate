 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the adaptive capacity component we compiled shapefile datasets (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>) for each of our respective indicators (education, poverty, organizational capacity, health care, accessibility/ infrastructure) and normalized all values from 0 to 1. In the case of poverty, we inverted the gini coefficient index so that values of 1 signified total equality, whilst a value of 0 indicated maximal inequality. This is because we assume that high levels of inequality equate to low adaptive capacity. In regard to the health indicator (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>) we created an average of the input datasets and then normalized from 0–1, we subsequently inverted the data so that values near to 1 indicated positive health care provision, whilst a value near 0 suggested low health care provision. For example, in the case of Vietnam the districts with high values for health care possessed less incidence of underweight, stunting and wasting (

Once all the shapefile indicators are normalized from 0–1, we calculate the average, thereby producing a final adaptive capacity index where 0 equates to no adaptive capacity and a value of 1 indicates absolute adaptive capacity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The adaptive capacity index’s resolution corresponds to the finest resolution of all the indicators used and drives the resolution of the overall vulnerability output. For each variable of adaptive capacity, there are many indicators that can be used depending on data limitation or the adopted definitions in the country of interest. In the case of Vietnam (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s005" href="#pone.0213641.s005">S1 Fig</a>), adaptive capacity is divided into 5 variables (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>); whilst in Uganda a total of 4 variables were included, as a lack of data on organizational capacity prevented its inclusion. The datasets used to capture adaptive capacity cover the full extent of the respective country and are available at a resolution that enables sub national analysis (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). In the case of Nicaragua adaptive capacity has been calculated based on data generated by Bouroncle et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref007">7</a>]. In the aforementioned study adaptive capacity was mapped as a function of three conditions: satisfaction of basic needs, resources for innovation and resources for transforming innovation into actions. A series of indicators were compiled (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s003" href="#pone.0213641.s003">S3 Table</a>). The indicators were normalized with values linearly to a 0–1 interval based on their minimum and maximum values in each municipality in order to avoid biases due to wide variations of socioeconomic development [
