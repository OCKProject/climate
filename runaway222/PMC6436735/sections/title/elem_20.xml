 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the following section we will present in detail the results of the CRVA for Vietnam using maize as an example to display the adaptive capacity, sensitivity, exposure and overall vulnerability of the cropping system to climate change (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213641.g002" href="#pone.0213641.g002">Fig 2</a>). Although we will focus on maize, the overall vulnerability index for rice and coffee Robusta in Vietnam are displayed in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s006" href="#pone.0213641.s006">S2 Fig</a>. We will then present the final vulnerability index for each country and highlight for Vietnam and Nicaragua, where expert validation has been provided, three areas of comparatively high vulnerability and the indicators driving the elevated scores.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive capacity for the maize growing areas is lowest in the central highland areas, and also in Muong Te district in Lai Chau province (north western Vietnam), additionally, Bao Lac, Ha Quang and Trung Khanh districts, in Cao Bang province also possessed low AC. In regard to sensitivity a number of districts in the Mekong delta and also northern regions of Vietnam experienced a decline in suitability. Exposure for maize was highest in the Mekong delta, due to the presence of flooding and drought, the central coastal zones due to the presence of tropical cyclones, flooding and also drought, and finally in Muong la and Quynh Nhai district (Son La province), due to soil erosion risk and flooding.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maize is important in Vietnam both as a cash crop, as it is used as a feed for the poultry and livestock industry, and for food security, especially in mountainous areas where it has in the past replaced rice in times of shortages [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref093" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref093">93</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref094" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref094">94</a>]. The overall vulnerability map for maize suggests that the districts in the Mekong river delta are vulnerable to climate change, due to a loss in the climatic suitability of maize, the presence of multiple natural hazards (flooding, drought and some expected sea level rise) and also the relatively low AC in certain districts. Additional districts of high vulnerability were found in Dong Bac province (north east Vietnam) and Dong Nam province in central south eastern Vietnam. The overall vulnerability map for maize can be used to stimulate conversation amongst interested stakeholders and policy makers in regard to investing in climate change adaptation strategies.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we have calculated an overall vulnerability index based on the aggregate of the respective analysed cropping systems in each country. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213641.g003" href="#pone.0213641.g003">Fig 3</a> highlights the relative and country specific vulnerability of the agriculture sector for each of the countries to climate change.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The causes of vulnerability can be attributed to different drivers and are specific to each country (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s004" href="#pone.0213641.s004">S4 Table</a>). Vulnerability in Nicaragua was found to be high in a number of municipalities, notably Wiwili de Nueva Segovia (region 1), Siuna and Bonanza (region 2), and Rancho Grande, Matiguas, Muy Muy and Boaco (region 3). In the case of Vietnam we also identified three regions of high vulnerability, notably: the north west (region 1), the central highlands (region 2) and finally the Mekong Delta (region 3). These regions for both case studies are displayed on the final vulnerability index map (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213641.g003" href="#pone.0213641.g003">Fig 3</a>). The drivers behind the vulnerability vary for the respective regions. For instance, the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, was identified as vulnerable to climate change due to the loss of climatic suitability for rice and maize, combined with high exposure to flooding, sea level rise and drought (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s004" href="#pone.0213641.s004">S4 Table</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some areas in Vietnam are less vulnerable than may have been expected. For example, the overall vulnerability of districts in Ha Giang province, north Vietnam, are generally low or medium (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213641.g003" href="#pone.0213641.g003">Fig 3</a>). This can be attributed to relatively high scores in adaptive capacity, contributed to by strong scores in organisational capacity and also medium range scores in education (See Adaptive Capacity map in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s005" href="#pone.0213641.s005">S1 Fig</a>). Additionally, the impacts of climate change on the analysed crops are projected to be less severe in this region, for instance, in the case of Qung Ba district (Ha Giang province) only maize is expected to become less climatically suitable (-0.25%). Additionally, the score for exposure is generally comparatively low in Ha Giang. Sea level rise, tropical cyclones and to a lesser extent drought and flooding were not threats according to the data we used in the study. Future studies could include additional natural hazards such as land-slides which may affect the results and increase the relative vulnerability of mountainous areas, including Ha Giang.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indicators for the CRVA</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following section will discuss the indicators used to capture vulnerability as part of this study. It is important to understand that vulnerability is not a measurable phenomenon, it is instead a dynamic state which is the result of multiple interacting variables [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>]. As vulnerability cannot be measured directly [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref095">95</a>], a number of indicators which are presumed to affect vulnerability are aggregated to provide an indication, or an index of vulnerability. This is a relative scale which shows the spatial distribution of vulnerability within the respective unit of analysis, which in our case is the respective countries. The vulnerability cannot be compared between the countries as they use different indicators, instead, one can deduce a sense of which areas at the sub national scale are more or less vulnerable within the country of analysis.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CRVA provides a list of indicators for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity (see 
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a> in methods) that can be used to determine the vulnerability of a location, at the national, regional, or local scale. As noted by Hinkel [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref096">96</a>], there is a huge amount of inherent complexity when assessing vulnerability, with the economic, environmental and socio-economic fabric of the particular country determining which indicators are relevant. Schroter et al [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref090">90</a>] has highlighted the need to select indicators which would be understood by the stakeholders, as an emphasis should be placed on science that is robust but also understandable for the policy maker or the end target audience. Hinkel [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref097" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref097">97</a>] note that vulnerability assessments are often devised to inform policy rather than advance knowledge in an intrinsic sense and Erikson and Kelly [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref098" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref098">98</a>] noted that data limitations regarding quality and also availability direct the selection of indicators. In spite of the clear data limitations in some regions, Fussel and Klein [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref099" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref099">99</a>] note that there is a move within vulnerability assessments to include more variables in an attempt to capture the complex realities which determine vulnerability. Schroter et al [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref079">79</a>] however, note that care must be taken when choosing which indicators are important, for instance, the same indicator may not be relevant for countries with varying levels of development. Setting the indicators therefore requires an understanding of the country wide drivers of vulnerability, which can be achieved through consultation of the wider literature, discussion with national experts and meetings with stakeholders [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref017">17</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The selected indicators (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>, see 
   <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">methods</a>) we chose are commonly used measures of agricultural vulnerability [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>]. The indicators capture both the regions of high biophysical and climate risks (Exposure), resilience of the crop production systems (Sensitivity) and societal capacity to respond (Adaptive Capacity). The indicators for exposure are natural hazards (sea level rise, flooding, drought, tropical cyclone) and hazardous processes (soil erosion). These indicators have been included in previous multi hazard vulnerability assessments [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref100" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref100">100</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In respect to adaptive capacity, the indicators listed in 
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a> have been recommended in previous vulnerability methodologies [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>]. It is important to note that in the case of Vietnam and Uganda we used indicators from 
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a> for adaptive capacity, whilst in the case of Nicaragua (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s003" href="#pone.0213641.s003">S3 Table</a>), the adaptive capacity index was based on the livelihoods approach from Bouroncle et al [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref007">7</a>]. In order to capture the respective adaptive capacity in Vietnam we focus on the education, poverty, health care, organizational capacity and accessibility/ infrastructure of the particular administrative unit, whilst in Uganda we use the same indicators with the exception of organizational capacity. It is important to note that we have not undertaken household surveys or primary data collection and instead rely on readily available and pre existing datasets that are aggregated to the administrative unit and cover the full extent of the respective countries (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). Due to data limitations a degree of flexibility is required in order to represent these indicators. For example, in regard to education we use the ‘Primary net intake rate’ in Uganda whilst in Vietnam we use the ‘Percentage of graduates compared with total upper secondary candidates’, both datasets were obtained from the respective government statistics office, cover the full extent of the country and are at a high resolution (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). In respect to health care, in Vietnam we created an average of the underweight, stunting and wasting datasets [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref073">73</a>] which were available at the province level for the entirety of the country. These input datasets were developed as part of a 2010 National Nutrition Survey [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref073">73</a>]. In respect to Uganda, data on the health of the population was derived from a government dataset [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref069">69</a>] that captures both access to health care, sanitation and immunization at the district level across the full extent of Uganda (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). In regards to organizational capacity we were not able to obtain reliable data for Uganda. In Vietnam, we used government data at the province level for the number of agricultural unions over the number of farms for the year 2005 (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). Both in Vietnam and Uganda, poverty was represented by the Gini income inequality index, whereby the administrative units with greater levels of inequality were deemed to have lower adaptive capacity. Finally, the accessibility/ infrastructure indicator was derived from a global dataset [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref074">74</a>] that estimates the travel time in hours from urban areas (&gt;50,000 inhabitants) based on a number of friction layers (road networks, railway networks, navigable rivers, major water bodies, shipping lanes, national borders, land cover, urban areas, elevation, and slope) at a resolution of 30 arc seconds (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). We calculated an average travel time in hours for the respective districts in Vietnam and Uganda using our administrative shapefile and the raster dataset [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref074">74</a>]. The districts with greater travel times were deemed to have lower adaptive capacity.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To summarise, data for the exposure and sensitivity indicators are freely available to download at national scales (

   <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">methods</a>). Adaptive capacity data for Uganda and Vietnam was attained from government sources (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t003">Table 3</a>), whilst in Nicaragua, as noted, data from a previous study was utilised [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref007">7</a>]. In regard to selecting datasets to represent the indicators we sought open source data for the most recent year available, at the finest resolution, and covering the full extent of the country. The datasets used are obtained from a variety of sources and are specific to the case study countries (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The novel aspect of the CRVA</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CRVA builds upon previous studies [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref029">29</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref032">32</a>] which integrate socio-economic, geographical and biophysical data into the vulnerability concept. Nevertheless, the integration of multiple natural hazards such as soil erosion, sea level rise and meteorological stresses such as flooding, tropical cyclones and drought into climate change vulnerability assessments focusing on agriculture remains novel [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref018">18</a>]. The CRVA attempts to address this gap in vulnerability assessments through integrating a broader list of natural hazard stresses within the framework. In our study we develop upon the recent work of Bouroncle et al [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref007">7</a>], which provided a detailed assessment of vulnerability of the agriculture sector in Central America to climate change, integrating multiple crops and the assessment of adaptive capacity through the livelihoods approach. Hence, the CRVA builds upon this recent study, using a similar methodology but with the inclusion of the natural hazards component within the vulnerability framework. A study by Yusuf and Fransisco [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref029">29</a>] undertook a vulnerability assessment for South East Asia which included hazard indicators, but at a coarse resolution and without a focus on agriculture. Nonetheless, studies such as Cutter et al [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref101" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref101">101</a>] have stressed the need to integrate the social vulnerability with natural hazard risk. Therefore the CRVA answers these calls and offers a more integrative approach through combining natural hazards within agricultural vulnerability to climate change.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CRVA can be implemented in locations lacking comprehensive national data, as was recently displayed in the Union of the Comoros, with global and regional datasets integrated to provide an insight into the vulnerability of key agricultural commodity value chains to climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref102" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref102">102</a>]. The CRVA framework integrates global, regional and when available national datasets from a range of sources (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>: see 
   <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">methods</a>). The utilised datasets are open source, published, and at a resolution that enables sub national level analysis. Furthermore, the vulnerability methodology enables the inclusion of the most important crops for food security. This goes beyond previous studies [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref023">23</a>] which focused on single crop systems. The CRVA proposed therefore provides a more complete understanding of overall agricultural vulnerability to climate change.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Improvements in spatial data provide constantly evolving opportunities to assess vulnerability at the sub national scale. Nevertheless, despite the current “Big Data” revolution in agriculture [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref103" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref103">103</a>], a lack of datasets with sufficient geographical coverage and historical records to undertake dynamic vulnerability assessments looking at more complex interaction between variables persists [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref018">18</a>]. Calls to understand and capture the interaction between variables which determine vulnerability is inhibited not only by a lack of data but also an understanding of the interaction between variables [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref018">18</a>]. The CRVA proposes a simplified approach, in that it does not consider dynamic interactions between variables.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When undertaking a spatial vulnerability assessment it is necessary to identify a research area and the unit of analysis. Fekete et al [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref104" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref104">104</a>] definition of sub national, referring to the administrative unit at which government agencies allocate resources has been used. The “research area” for our study is the respective country. Fekete et al [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref104" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref104">104</a>] note that policy makers need results at a unit which they understand. The aim is to provide outputs which are useful for policy makers. Therefore a review of government literature and available datasets, in conjunction with input from policy makers and local experts is recommended, in order to understand the administrative structure of the respective country and identify a unit of analysis that respects both data limitations and policy decision and planning structures.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adopting recognised administrative units is one mechanism to help ensure that the output from vulnerability assessments can be integrated into strategic government plans. Fritzsche [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>] notes that information that is generated at a policy relevant administrative level can empower decision makers and non-governmental organisations to more effectively direct human and monetary investment to vulnerable communities most likely to be affected by climate change.

   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref033">33</a>] that vulnerability is equal to: 50% potential impact (sensitivity and exposure) and 50% adaptive capacity. It is possible that greater weight could be attributed to adaptive capacity, if for instance, human capital rather than the presence of natural hazards (exposure) or loss of climatic suitability for cropping systems (sensitivity) drives vulnerability. Future studies could focus on the impacts on vulnerability of increasing the weight of AC for instance. Furthermore we aggregated the indicators within the three components of vulnerability using a deductive approach [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref105" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref105">105</a>] with multiple indicators that are thought to influence vulnerability selected and weighted equally. It is possible however to prioritise indicators [

   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref107" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref107">107</a>] tested 6 global models used to derive flood hazard and found that agreement between the models for the African continent was roughly 30–40%, thus highlighting the discrepancies between models when extracted to a reduced coverage.

However, there is a chance that at very fine resolutions (&lt;1km) and in areas where flash floods, complex topography, peri-urban landscapes and varying technological and management capacity exist; discrepancies between the model and reality are likely [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref107" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref107">107</a>]. Additionally, the datasets are historic snapshots and may not capture the current trend, for instance, the flooding data [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate suitability modelling results for the current conditions have been verified by experts. They largely capture the known locations where the crop is grown. However, there is uncertainty attached to the future projections of climate suitability which are based on a single RCP (8.5) [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref092">92</a>] and are dependent upon the ensemble of 33 GCMs. Using a mean of the GCMs has been adopted to reduce the uncertainty inherent in using a single GCM [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref092">92</a>], but the EcoCrop and Maxent models do not cater for the standard deviation between the GCMs. A further assumption is in the use of the representative concentration pathway 8.5, which is a high emission scenario. Using a less aggressive scenario (for example, RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5) would likely reduce the impacts of climate change on climatic crop suitability under the future conditions and this is likely to affect the final crop vulnerability results. Further research could quantify the impacts of using different RCPs on the climate suitability component of the CRVA. Another potential avenue for selecting a future climate scenario is to identify the RCP which is used by the respective ministry in the country of interest, this will likely result in greater uptake of the final vulnerability recommendations.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also acknowledge that the GIS analysis may possess some biases which influence the final outputs. Notably we have undertaken the study at a policy unit which is fine resolution. It is notable that several of the administrative units which possess smaller areas tend to have higher vulnerability, for example, in the case of Uganda, we see that the sub county of Pader TC, located in the district of Pader, northern Uganda is in the “highest” vulnerability category, whilst all the surrounding sub counties are “high” vulnerability. The sub county is 64 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>, which is below the average sub county area (250km
   <span class="sup">2</span>), and smaller than the surrounding sub county’s. Nevertheless, besides the adaptive capacity data for poverty and education (district level) the utilised datasets were either at the sub county level or at a resolution of roughly 1km (

   <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">methods</a>), which therefore enables sub county analysis, including those at &lt;100km
   <span class="sup">2</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have also made assumptions regarding the indicators used to represent the components of vulnerability. A recent study by Cinner et al [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref109" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref109">109</a>] propose an alternative approach to understanding adaptive capacity that includes the willingness and capability to turn resources into adaptation action and suggest additional criteria, beyond wealth, education and organizational capacity (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>) that can be used to determine the capacity to respond to change. We have assumed simplistically that adaptive capacity is homogenous across the analysed cropping systems for the respective countries based on a number of indicators (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). We acknowledge the complexity of capturing adaptive capacity and understand that it may vary depending on the community or farming system being analysed, for instance, it may be that wealthier farmers grow cash crops and therefore have greater resistance to climate change, or that the adaptive capacity of coffee farmers is driven by different indicators to that of rice farmers. Furthermore, we understand that farmers are constantly responding to changes in the climate, whilst in our study we have compiled spatially explicit secondary data on the current adaptive capacity of the population which does not capture the fluid and responsive nature of adaptation to climate change. Our methodology is intended to capture the general patterns of vulnerability to climate change at a national extent through an agricultural lens. We spatially identify the vulnerability of administrative areas to climate change using secondary data, but we do not have the local scale data required to capture the responsiveness of individual farmers to climate stresses. We can accept this as a limitation of our study but one that is necessary due to the pan tropical extent of our research. Future studies could undertake primary data collection at a fine temporal (daily) and spatial resolution (house hold) for administrative areas that we have identified as vulnerable in order to identify how farmers respond on a daily basis to climate challenges. The updates in the conceptualization and measure of adaptive capacity provides an opportunity to develop a more responsive and complex representation of vulnerability that goes beyond the traditional indicators.
