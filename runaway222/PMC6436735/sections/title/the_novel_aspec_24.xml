 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The novel aspect of the CRVA</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CRVA builds upon previous studies [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref029">29</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref032">32</a>] which integrate socio-economic, geographical and biophysical data into the vulnerability concept. Nevertheless, the integration of multiple natural hazards such as soil erosion, sea level rise and meteorological stresses such as flooding, tropical cyclones and drought into climate change vulnerability assessments focusing on agriculture remains novel [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref018">18</a>]. The CRVA attempts to address this gap in vulnerability assessments through integrating a broader list of natural hazard stresses within the framework. In our study we develop upon the recent work of Bouroncle et al [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref007">7</a>], which provided a detailed assessment of vulnerability of the agriculture sector in Central America to climate change, integrating multiple crops and the assessment of adaptive capacity through the livelihoods approach. Hence, the CRVA builds upon this recent study, using a similar methodology but with the inclusion of the natural hazards component within the vulnerability framework. A study by Yusuf and Fransisco [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref029">29</a>] undertook a vulnerability assessment for South East Asia which included hazard indicators, but at a coarse resolution and without a focus on agriculture. Nonetheless, studies such as Cutter et al [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref101" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref101">101</a>] have stressed the need to integrate the social vulnerability with natural hazard risk. Therefore the CRVA answers these calls and offers a more integrative approach through combining natural hazards within agricultural vulnerability to climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CRVA can be implemented in locations lacking comprehensive national data, as was recently displayed in the Union of the Comoros, with global and regional datasets integrated to provide an insight into the vulnerability of key agricultural commodity value chains to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref102" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref102">102</a>]. The CRVA framework integrates global, regional and when available national datasets from a range of sources (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>: see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">methods</a>). The utilised datasets are open source, published, and at a resolution that enables sub national level analysis. Furthermore, the vulnerability methodology enables the inclusion of the most important crops for food security. This goes beyond previous studies [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref023">23</a>] which focused on single crop systems. The CRVA proposed therefore provides a more complete understanding of overall agricultural vulnerability to climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Improvements in spatial data provide constantly evolving opportunities to assess vulnerability at the sub national scale. Nevertheless, despite the current “Big Data” revolution in agriculture [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref103" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref103">103</a>], a lack of datasets with sufficient geographical coverage and historical records to undertake dynamic vulnerability assessments looking at more complex interaction between variables persists [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref018">18</a>]. Calls to understand and capture the interaction between variables which determine vulnerability is inhibited not only by a lack of data but also an understanding of the interaction between variables [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref018">18</a>]. The CRVA proposes a simplified approach, in that it does not consider dynamic interactions between variables.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When undertaking a spatial vulnerability assessment it is necessary to identify a research area and the unit of analysis. Fekete et al [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref104" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref104">104</a>] definition of sub national, referring to the administrative unit at which government agencies allocate resources has been used. The “research area” for our study is the respective country. Fekete et al [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref104" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref104">104</a>] note that policy makers need results at a unit which they understand. The aim is to provide outputs which are useful for policy makers. Therefore a review of government literature and available datasets, in conjunction with input from policy makers and local experts is recommended, in order to understand the administrative structure of the respective country and identify a unit of analysis that respects both data limitations and policy decision and planning structures.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adopting recognised administrative units is one mechanism to help ensure that the output from vulnerability assessments can be integrated into strategic government plans. Fritzsche [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>] notes that information that is generated at a policy relevant administrative level can empower decision makers and non-governmental organisations to more effectively direct human and monetary investment to vulnerable communities most likely to be affected by climate change.
