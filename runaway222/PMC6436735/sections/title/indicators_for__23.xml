 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following section will discuss the indicators used to capture vulnerability as part of this study. It is important to understand that vulnerability is not a measurable phenomenon, it is instead a dynamic state which is the result of multiple interacting variables [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>]. As vulnerability cannot be measured directly [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref095">95</a>], a number of indicators which are presumed to affect vulnerability are aggregated to provide an indication, or an index of vulnerability. This is a relative scale which shows the spatial distribution of vulnerability within the respective unit of analysis, which in our case is the respective countries. The vulnerability cannot be compared between the countries as they use different indicators, instead, one can deduce a sense of which areas at the sub national scale are more or less vulnerable within the country of analysis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CRVA provides a list of indicators for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity (see 
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a> in methods) that can be used to determine the vulnerability of a location, at the national, regional, or local scale. As noted by Hinkel [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref096">96</a>], there is a huge amount of inherent complexity when assessing vulnerability, with the economic, environmental and socio-economic fabric of the particular country determining which indicators are relevant. Schroter et al [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref090">90</a>] has highlighted the need to select indicators which would be understood by the stakeholders, as an emphasis should be placed on science that is robust but also understandable for the policy maker or the end target audience. Hinkel [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref097" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref097">97</a>] note that vulnerability assessments are often devised to inform policy rather than advance knowledge in an intrinsic sense and Erikson and Kelly [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref098" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref098">98</a>] noted that data limitations regarding quality and also availability direct the selection of indicators. In spite of the clear data limitations in some regions, Fussel and Klein [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref099" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref099">99</a>] note that there is a move within vulnerability assessments to include more variables in an attempt to capture the complex realities which determine vulnerability. Schroter et al [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref079">79</a>] however, note that care must be taken when choosing which indicators are important, for instance, the same indicator may not be relevant for countries with varying levels of development. Setting the indicators therefore requires an understanding of the country wide drivers of vulnerability, which can be achieved through consultation of the wider literature, discussion with national experts and meetings with stakeholders [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref017">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The selected indicators (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>, see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">methods</a>) we chose are commonly used measures of agricultural vulnerability [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>]. The indicators capture both the regions of high biophysical and climate risks (Exposure), resilience of the crop production systems (Sensitivity) and societal capacity to respond (Adaptive Capacity). The indicators for exposure are natural hazards (sea level rise, flooding, drought, tropical cyclone) and hazardous processes (soil erosion). These indicators have been included in previous multi hazard vulnerability assessments [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref100" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref100">100</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In respect to adaptive capacity, the indicators listed in 
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a> have been recommended in previous vulnerability methodologies [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>]. It is important to note that in the case of Vietnam and Uganda we used indicators from 
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a> for adaptive capacity, whilst in the case of Nicaragua (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s003" href="#pone.0213641.s003">S3 Table</a>), the adaptive capacity index was based on the livelihoods approach from Bouroncle et al [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref007">7</a>]. In order to capture the respective adaptive capacity in Vietnam we focus on the education, poverty, health care, organizational capacity and accessibility/ infrastructure of the particular administrative unit, whilst in Uganda we use the same indicators with the exception of organizational capacity. It is important to note that we have not undertaken household surveys or primary data collection and instead rely on readily available and pre existing datasets that are aggregated to the administrative unit and cover the full extent of the respective countries (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). Due to data limitations a degree of flexibility is required in order to represent these indicators. For example, in regard to education we use the ‘Primary net intake rate’ in Uganda whilst in Vietnam we use the ‘Percentage of graduates compared with total upper secondary candidates’, both datasets were obtained from the respective government statistics office, cover the full extent of the country and are at a high resolution (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). In respect to health care, in Vietnam we created an average of the underweight, stunting and wasting datasets [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref073">73</a>] which were available at the province level for the entirety of the country. These input datasets were developed as part of a 2010 National Nutrition Survey [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref073">73</a>]. In respect to Uganda, data on the health of the population was derived from a government dataset [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref069">69</a>] that captures both access to health care, sanitation and immunization at the district level across the full extent of Uganda (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). In regards to organizational capacity we were not able to obtain reliable data for Uganda. In Vietnam, we used government data at the province level for the number of agricultural unions over the number of farms for the year 2005 (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). Both in Vietnam and Uganda, poverty was represented by the Gini income inequality index, whereby the administrative units with greater levels of inequality were deemed to have lower adaptive capacity. Finally, the accessibility/ infrastructure indicator was derived from a global dataset [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref074">74</a>] that estimates the travel time in hours from urban areas (&gt;50,000 inhabitants) based on a number of friction layers (road networks, railway networks, navigable rivers, major water bodies, shipping lanes, national borders, land cover, urban areas, elevation, and slope) at a resolution of 30 arc seconds (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). We calculated an average travel time in hours for the respective districts in Vietnam and Uganda using our administrative shapefile and the raster dataset [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref074">74</a>]. The districts with greater travel times were deemed to have lower adaptive capacity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To summarise, data for the exposure and sensitivity indicators are freely available to download at national scales (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>, see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">methods</a>). Adaptive capacity data for Uganda and Vietnam was attained from government sources (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t003">Table 3</a>), whilst in Nicaragua, as noted, data from a previous study was utilised [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref007">7</a>]. In regard to selecting datasets to represent the indicators we sought open source data for the most recent year available, at the finest resolution, and covering the full extent of the country. The datasets used are obtained from a variety of sources and are specific to the case study countries (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>).
