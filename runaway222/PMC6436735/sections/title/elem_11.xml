  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exposure assessment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We divide exposure into two components: exposure 1 refers to the changes in temperature and precipitation between current conditions and the future projection (decade 2050). To estimate the current conditions we use Worldclim, a set of global climatic layers that utilise weather stations from sources such as the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) and FAO, with records dating from 1950 to 2000 [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref057">57</a>]. Using the thin plate spine algorithm [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref082">82</a>] the climate data has been interpolated at a spatial resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes (~ 5 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> at the equator) for monthly total rainfall, and maximum, mean and minimum temperature. For the future climate data we use the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP), characterised by increasing green-house gas emissions, high rates of population growth, modest GDP growth and low rates of technological development and uptake [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref083">83</a>]. This is the most severe (~1370 ppm CO
   <sub>2</sub> eq by 2100) of the future scenarios which were documented in The Fifth Assessment Report [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref004">4</a>] of the IPCC. The future period selected for this study is the decade 2050 (representing 204–2069), corresponding to a medium term horizon [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref084">84</a>]. In order to simulate the future climate and atmosphere we used the mean ensemble of 32 General Circulation Models (GCMs) under RCP 8.5. The spatial resolution of GCMs is too coarse to analyse the direct impacts on farmers’ production. We therefore used downscaled data based on the sum of interpolated anomalies for each GCM against the current climate baseline data [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref085">85</a>], creating a smoothed climate surface at 2.5 arc minutes for future climate conditions. The changes in precipitation and temperature were estimated by subtracting current to future climate, using the downscaled datasets in order to describe changes in temperature and precipitation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, exposure 2 includes natural hazards (sea level rise, flooding, drought and tropical cyclones) and hazardous processes (soil erosion and land degradation) which are deemed to present significant risk to the agricultural sector [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref086">86</a>] and have been used in previous studies to develop disaster risk and vulnerability indexes [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref087">87</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>]. We do not model the aforementioned hazards and instead rely on previous studies that developed spatially aggregated datasets (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). A number of those included (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>) are acquired from the Global Data Risk Platform [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref088">88</a>] which provides spatially referenced hazard data at a high resolution and extensive coverage. In regards to flooding and drought, the climate risks are derived from historical records and statistical modelling that spatially infers extreme events that go beyond the natural variability in the system [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref089">89</a>]. Due to the different geographical and meteorological contexts of the respective case study countries, the selection of which natural hazard variables to include requires literature review and validation from local experts. The approach to Exposure 2 varied between the three case studies. In Vietnam, we undertook a workshop in Hanoi, attended by agronomists from the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), representatives from our government partners, notably the Institute of Agriculture and Environment (IAE) and the National Institute of Agricultural Planning and Projection (NIAPP), the Institute of Geography from the University of Science and Technology also attended, as did a number of non-governmental organizations including the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). The attendees brought a variety of focuses and expertise that covered the length and breadth of Vietnam and this was necessary to ensure accurate validation of our input data. During this workshop we undertook an exercise with the participants to confirm which of the natural hazards (exposure) affects each of the respective crops (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s007" href="#pone.0213641.s007">S1 File</a>). The natural hazard data is spatially explicit and covers the full extent of Vietnam (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). We used this information to create exposure specific indexes for each of the crops. The purpose was to develop a more refined Potential Impact indices by focusing on the relevant natural hazards that affect the respective cropping system. In the case of Uganda and Nicaragua, meetings were undertaken with experts and government partners to identify natural hazards and also identify suitable datasets, but due to limited access to agronomists on the respective crops, the crop specific exposure index was not calculated. Therefore, we assumed that the respective natural hazards (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>) affected all cropping systems equally.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of Vietnam we estimated potential soil erosion based on the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). We calculated the potential erosion using available data from different sources (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s002" href="#pone.0213641.s002">S2 Table</a>) and combined it by using raster calculator in ArcMap 10.3. In the case of Nicaragua we used the pre-existing erosion map [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref071">71</a>] whilst for Uganda we used an existing land degradation map [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref070">70</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to calculate the exposure index for Uganda and Nicaragua we extracted the values of each of the natural hazards with the administrative boundary shapefile, rescaled all the values between 0 and 1 and calculated the average of all natural hazard variables at the administrative scale for the full extent of the country (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213641.g001" href="#pone.0213641.g001">Fig 1</a>). As mentioned, in the case of Vietnam we created a crop specific exposure index, this involved undertaking the same process of extracting and rescaling the natural hazards from 0 to 1, but the average is confined to those natural hazards that affect the respective crop. Thereby, in Vietnam we created one exposure index for each crop whilst in the case of Uganda and Nicaragua we have one exposure index applied to all respective crops.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sensitivity assessment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For this study sensitivity is understood as the change in the climatic suitability of an area to grow a crop. We estimated this change by subtracting the current climatic suitability from the future suitability. We used the MaxEnt Model [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref090">90</a>] for the modelling of coffee and rice, as the model [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref090">90</a>] performs well for crops that are often irrigated (rice) or grow at particular elevational ranges (coffee Arabica and Robusta). In Vietnam we are focused on coffee Robusta, whilst in Nicaragua we are concerned with coffee Arabica (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t001">Table 1</a>). For modelling of maize in Vietnam we used the Ecocrop model, a crop niche prediction model with the same name as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Ecocrop database [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref091" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref091">91</a>]. The basic model uses environmental ranges [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref092">92</a>] as inputs to determine climatic suitability. 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s007" href="#pone.0213641.s007">S1 File</a> displays which model was used to simulate current and future crop suitability across our three case study countries.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to calibrate the model and ensure valid results we rely on a combination of academic literature, government statistics and expert feedback. We first produce climate suitability maps for the respective crop under current conditions. We identify an expert who understands and works with the respective crop and we request feedback on the accuracy of the climate suitability map for the respective crop and the input parameters used. In certain cases the expert will identify areas where the model is not performing well, we subsequently re-run the model and send the updated results, we repeat this process until the current climate crop suitability maps capture the current distribution of the respective crop. Feedback on the crop parameters and maps are crucial in order to improve the validity of the sensitivity mapping. Once the current suitability maps have been approved by experts and compared to national production statistics and the wider literature, the future data (2050), using 33 GCMs with RCP 8.5 climatic data can be used as inputs for the niche crop model to generate 33 projected suitability outputs. From this, we calculate the average and the standard deviation in order to analyse the variability of the GCMs. Another validation step is to mask out the regions with low production data or when current suitability values are lower than 20%. We finally calculate the change between current and projected suitability, extract the values for each administrative unit and classify them into a sensitivity index (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive capacity assessment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the adaptive capacity component we compiled shapefile datasets (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>) for each of our respective indicators (education, poverty, organizational capacity, health care, accessibility/ infrastructure) and normalized all values from 0 to 1. In the case of poverty, we inverted the gini coefficient index so that values of 1 signified total equality, whilst a value of 0 indicated maximal inequality. This is because we assume that high levels of inequality equate to low adaptive capacity. In regard to the health indicator (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>) we created an average of the input datasets and then normalized from 0–1, we subsequently inverted the data so that values near to 1 indicated positive health care provision, whilst a value near 0 suggested low health care provision. For example, in the case of Vietnam the districts with high values for health care possessed less incidence of underweight, stunting and wasting (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s005" href="#pone.0213641.s005">S1 Fig</a>). Once all the shapefile indicators are normalized from 0–1, we calculate the average, thereby producing a final adaptive capacity index where 0 equates to no adaptive capacity and a value of 1 indicates absolute adaptive capacity.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The adaptive capacity index’s resolution corresponds to the finest resolution of all the indicators used and drives the resolution of the overall vulnerability output. For each variable of adaptive capacity, there are many indicators that can be used depending on data limitation or the adopted definitions in the country of interest. In the case of Vietnam (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s005" href="#pone.0213641.s005">S1 Fig</a>), adaptive capacity is divided into 5 variables (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>); whilst in Uganda a total of 4 variables were included, as a lack of data on organizational capacity prevented its inclusion. The datasets used to capture adaptive capacity cover the full extent of the respective country and are available at a resolution that enables sub national analysis (
   <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). In the case of Nicaragua adaptive capacity has been calculated based on data generated by Bouroncle et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref007">7</a>]. In the aforementioned study adaptive capacity was mapped as a function of three conditions: satisfaction of basic needs, resources for innovation and resources for transforming innovation into actions. A series of indicators were compiled (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s003" href="#pone.0213641.s003">S3 Table</a>). The indicators were normalized with values linearly to a 0–1 interval based on their minimum and maximum values in each municipality in order to avoid biases due to wide variations of socioeconomic development [

We used this weighted equation for Vietnam in order to give more importance to the final overall vulnerability to prioritise where the crop is present and grown in greater quantities (harvested area). Data for harvested area was not available for Uganda or Nicaragua at the sub county level. We present the equation used to calculate the overall vulnerability in Vietnam. The analysis was conducted in ArcGIS 10.3 software (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, California).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of Vietnam and Nicaragua expert validation was obtained at various stages of the vulnerability methodology (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213641.g001" href="#pone.0213641.g001">Fig 1</a>). In Vietnam a planning workshop with government partners, agronomists and stakeholders provided feedback on the indicators (datasets) used to determine the components of vulnerability. In the case of Nicaragua experts were consulted in order to obtain the indicators of adaptive capacity. In the case of Uganda, time constraints and data limitations meant that the same level of scrutiny of the data was not undertaken. Therefore the results for Uganda should be shared with experts in order to gauge the reliability of the input data. Finally, the combination of the indicators within the three components of vulnerability was undertaken without weighting due to a lack of production data, expertise on the importance of each indicator and limited feedback from crop experts.
