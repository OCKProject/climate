 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We divide exposure into two components: exposure 1 refers to the changes in temperature and precipitation between current conditions and the future projection (decade 2050). To estimate the current conditions we use Worldclim, a set of global climatic layers that utilise weather stations from sources such as the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) and FAO, with records dating from 1950 to 2000 [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref057">57</a>]. Using the thin plate spine algorithm [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref082">82</a>] the climate data has been interpolated at a spatial resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes (~ 5 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> at the equator) for monthly total rainfall, and maximum, mean and minimum temperature. For the future climate data we use the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP), characterised by increasing green-house gas emissions, high rates of population growth, modest GDP growth and low rates of technological development and uptake [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref083">83</a>]. This is the most severe (~1370 ppm CO
  <sub>2</sub> eq by 2100) of the future scenarios which were documented in The Fifth Assessment Report [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref004">4</a>] of the IPCC. The future period selected for this study is the decade 2050 (representing 204–2069), corresponding to a medium term horizon [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref084">84</a>]. In order to simulate the future climate and atmosphere we used the mean ensemble of 32 General Circulation Models (GCMs) under RCP 8.5. The spatial resolution of GCMs is too coarse to analyse the direct impacts on farmers’ production. We therefore used downscaled data based on the sum of interpolated anomalies for each GCM against the current climate baseline data [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref085">85</a>], creating a smoothed climate surface at 2.5 arc minutes for future climate conditions. The changes in precipitation and temperature were estimated by subtracting current to future climate, using the downscaled datasets in order to describe changes in temperature and precipitation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, exposure 2 includes natural hazards (sea level rise, flooding, drought and tropical cyclones) and hazardous processes (soil erosion and land degradation) which are deemed to present significant risk to the agricultural sector [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref086">86</a>] and have been used in previous studies to develop disaster risk and vulnerability indexes [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref087">87</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>]. We do not model the aforementioned hazards and instead rely on previous studies that developed spatially aggregated datasets (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). A number of those included (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>) are acquired from the Global Data Risk Platform [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref088">88</a>] which provides spatially referenced hazard data at a high resolution and extensive coverage. In regards to flooding and drought, the climate risks are derived from historical records and statistical modelling that spatially infers extreme events that go beyond the natural variability in the system [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref089">89</a>]. Due to the different geographical and meteorological contexts of the respective case study countries, the selection of which natural hazard variables to include requires literature review and validation from local experts. The approach to Exposure 2 varied between the three case studies. In Vietnam, we undertook a workshop in Hanoi, attended by agronomists from the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), representatives from our government partners, notably the Institute of Agriculture and Environment (IAE) and the National Institute of Agricultural Planning and Projection (NIAPP), the Institute of Geography from the University of Science and Technology also attended, as did a number of non-governmental organizations including the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). The attendees brought a variety of focuses and expertise that covered the length and breadth of Vietnam and this was necessary to ensure accurate validation of our input data. During this workshop we undertook an exercise with the participants to confirm which of the natural hazards (exposure) affects each of the respective crops (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s007" href="#pone.0213641.s007">S1 File</a>). The natural hazard data is spatially explicit and covers the full extent of Vietnam (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). We used this information to create exposure specific indexes for each of the crops. The purpose was to develop a more refined Potential Impact indices by focusing on the relevant natural hazards that affect the respective cropping system. In the case of Uganda and Nicaragua, meetings were undertaken with experts and government partners to identify natural hazards and also identify suitable datasets, but due to limited access to agronomists on the respective crops, the crop specific exposure index was not calculated. Therefore, we assumed that the respective natural hazards (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>) affected all cropping systems equally.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of Vietnam we estimated potential soil erosion based on the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). We calculated the potential erosion using available data from different sources (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s002" href="#pone.0213641.s002">S2 Table</a>) and combined it by using raster calculator in ArcMap 10.3. In the case of Nicaragua we used the pre-existing erosion map [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref071">71</a>] whilst for Uganda we used an existing land degradation map [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref070">70</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to calculate the exposure index for Uganda and Nicaragua we extracted the values of each of the natural hazards with the administrative boundary shapefile, rescaled all the values between 0 and 1 and calculated the average of all natural hazard variables at the administrative scale for the full extent of the country (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213641.g001" href="#pone.0213641.g001">Fig 1</a>). As mentioned, in the case of Vietnam we created a crop specific exposure index, this involved undertaking the same process of extracting and rescaling the natural hazards from 0 to 1, but the average is confined to those natural hazards that affect the respective crop. Thereby, in Vietnam we created one exposure index for each crop whilst in the case of Uganda and Nicaragua we have one exposure index applied to all respective crops.
