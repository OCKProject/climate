 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have developed a new modeling framework for analyzing the costs and benefits of the co-reductions in air pollutant emissions that result from CO
  <sub>2</sub> policy. We find that these impacts have a critical role in determining optimal decarbonization rates, as the potential health co-benefits that result from improved air quality are large, occur quickly enough to be economically important, outweigh the near-term co-harms from lost cooling, and are concentrated in developing regions. This remains true even with high discount rates and relatively conservative valuations of improved health. However, as the size of the health co-benefits will be partially determined by future air quality policies, decision makers should jointly plan both types of interventions. Depending on how society values health, it may be economically optimal to limit temperature rise to 2 °C or lower, thus corroborating the climate targets from the Paris Agreement. Overall, optimal mitigation results in immediate net benefits globally.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings should be interpreted in light of several factors. First, our sensitivity analyses identified key variables that meaningfully affect the optimal level of decarbonization in RICE + AIR. These include the shape and magnitude of the exposure-response functions that relate PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> exposure to mortality, the assumed relationship between CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions and air pollutant emissions, the discount rate, and the valuation of the health benefits. The first two factors are largely amenable to empirical inquiry, whereas the latter two depend partially on ethical judgements; all have a strong bearing on how much society should mitigate, and when.
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, we follow standard convention in assuming a uniform global carbon price in our optimal policy calculations. Economists prefer this assumption because a uniform price minimizes the cost to the global economy of any particular level of emissions reductions, and is thus a necessary part of the first-best approach to climate policy. However, another necessary part of first-best policy is a non-climate equity policy involving redistribution to address the large economic inequalities that exist throughout the world; in the absence of such an equity-focused policy, a uniform global carbon price would ignore equity considerations, and arguably impose an unjustifiably heavy burden on developing countries. An important feature of our results relevant to this issue is that health co-benefits provide the most incentive for additional decarbonization in lower- and middle-income regions. An interesting extension of our research would explore how co-benefits affect mitigation policies in a range of different burden-sharing regimes and in second-best climate policy calculations

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, we follow common practice in the co-benefits literature in assuming that there is a background appetite for air pollution policy that is independent of climate policy, such that the same background levels of investment will be made in air quality regardless of CO
  <sub>2</sub> reductions (and so policies will ratchet up insofar as greater CO
  <sub>2</sub> reductions make the antecedent level of air quality mitigation less expensive); this is the basic assumption behind the co-reductions we estimate in our main results. As reported above in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, we also co-optimize air quality and climate policies, which is another scenario (with different properties) in which there would be co-benefits from CO
  <sub>2</sub> reductions. A limitation is that other scenarios are also possible, such as CO
  <sub>2</sub> reductions in a context involving a fixed cap and trade regime for air pollutants where the cap remains fixed at the same level in conjunction with new CO
  <sub>2</sub> reductions; in this scenario, it is possible that there would not be many co-benefits from CO
  <sub>2</sub> reductions

 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fourth, we were not able to fully assess uncertainties around key aerosol processes. For example, the aerosol indirect effect may be the single largest source of uncertainty in radiative forcing assessments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. New evidence continues to accrue about key factors that contribute to the formation of new particles from precursor gases, and there are likely to be complex feedback mechanisms that occur in response to future temperature changes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. Some of these processes are not yet adequately represented in even the most sophisticated Earth system models, let alone reduced-form versions. A related concern is that we have used separate models to estimate the health effects (TM5-FASST) and climate effects (Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse gas Induced Climate Change 6 (MAGICC6)) of air pollutant emissions, a decoupling that may also introduce uncertainty. Nevertheless, MAGICC and TM5 have distinct strengths that we harness accordingly; MAGICC takes account of the full aerosol load of the whole atmosphere, top to bottom, and at the level of hemispheres, while TM5 tells us about the concentration at ground level, where people live and breathe, in principle at much higher resolution. Both models work with the same global emission inventories.
 </p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fifth, we have only explored the effect of co-reducing air pollutant emissions on PM
  <sub>2.5</sub>-related mortality. Other co-benefits may occur, which would likely push further in the direction of increased decarbonization; these include morbidity impacts from PM
  <sub>2.5</sub>—which are generally minor compared to those from mortality—as well as other more indirect impacts such as potential increases in crop yields, improvements in visibility, and health impacts from changing exposure to tropospheric ozone

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. In addition, cost-benefit models also miss some other impacts of reduced climate change, including the effects of methane on ozone, the effects of ocean acidification, and others

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the uncertainties inherent in our modeling framework, we expect the accuracy of quantitative estimates of the co-harms and co-benefits of optimal climate policy to sharpen over time, particularly as our understanding of atmospheric science progresses. Nevertheless, the novel modeling approach described here offers important new insights into how much we should mitigate and over what time period, and the sensitivity tests above indicate that we should not expect the qualitative story told by our results to change in light of improved empirical estimates. Our methods also enable investigation of other key questions beyond the scope of this study, including how the inclusion of health co-benefits influences optimal climate policy under different burden-sharing regimes and different worldviews about how much to prioritize the poor, future people, and citizens of other countries.</p>
