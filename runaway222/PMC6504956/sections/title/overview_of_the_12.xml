 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this section, we provide a general overview of how we developed the AIR module, with a technical description—including all equations—in the sections that follow.</p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Broadly speaking, our approach consists of five steps. First, we estimate the baseline (before carbon mitigation) emissions of five air pollutant species (primary PM
  <sub>2.5</sub>, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, organic carbon, and black carbon). Emissions are estimated for each region-time pair with income-dependent emission intensity projections (emissions per unit GDP) based on the Greenhouse gas and Air pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model and specifically the ECLIPSE emission scenarios
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. Our central case assumes air pollutant emissions in the coming decades follow the ECLIPSEV5a baseline scenario, which includes current and planned air quality legislation but no climate policy. In sensitivity analyses we alter this assumption, allowing for faster or slower independent air quality cleanup, including a case where we simultaneously co-optimize both air quality and climate policy. This co-optimization introduces policy levers for end-of-pipe technologies that act on individual air pollutants. These levers require associated cost curves that are also drawn from the GAINS model.
 </p>
 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the second step, we determine the change in air pollutant emissions that would result from a change in CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions using information from the SSP project
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. This provides an estimate of co-reductions based on empirically realistic projections about the regionally differentiated interaction between future climate and air pollution policies, and is consistent with theoretical results from economics that show that co-benefit effects could be different in scenarios with different properties
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. Emission information in the SSPs is estimated from bottom-up integrated assessment modeling that includes regionally differentiated, spatially explicit representations of energy production and structure and, like in RICE, assumes that CO
  <sub>2</sub> policy occurs through a single global carbon price.
 </p>
 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, we link changes in air pollutant emissions to changes in estimated average human exposure to PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> by applying the source-receptor matrix (SRM) from the TM5-FASST air quality model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>. The TM5-FASST SRM was computed from simulations of the full TM5 chemical transport model for 56 source regions, which were aggregated to approximate the RICE regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>. Once exposure is estimated, it is possible to calculate the number of life-years gained attributable to (reduced) air pollution by combining an exposure--response function with projections of future mortality and life expectancy
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span>, which we took from the UN World Population Prospects. We applied a (log)linear exposure-response function for mortality from all causes in adults based on a meta-analysis published in a recent World Health Organization report
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. We selected this approach for consistency with the UN projections—which only estimate mortality from all causes—and because recent epidemiological analyses indicate that the strong effects of air pollution occur at exposure (concentration) levels up to and including those most relevant to our study and that they likely affect a wide range of outcomes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fourth, we allow the change in air pollutant emissions to influence the global temperature using aerosol forcing coefficients derived from the MAGICC climate model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>. The coefficients incorporate both the direct and indirect effects represented in MAGICC, with the latter including those related to albedo and cloud responses. Aerosol forcing is added to the forcing from the other greenhouse gases in RICE’s climate module to produce estimates of future climate change.
 </p>
 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And fifth, for each region we monetize and then value the aerosol impacts. The average per capita health benefits are added to per capita consumption, whereas the climate effects—monetized using RICE’s standard climate damage function—subtract from consumption
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Consumption is transformed into well-being by a concave function in the optimization via RICE’s objective/social welfare function (Eq. (
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>)). Once the impacts have been valued in this way, they then enter the optimization.
