 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We summarize the results of the new model (hereafter referred to as RICE + AIR, for RICE + Aerosol Impacts and Responses) in terms of the optimal fraction of business-as-usual CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions that should be reduced over time. We refer to this quantitative reduction in CO
  <sub>2</sub> as the optimal decarbonization fraction and express it as a percentage. (What we call the decarbonization fraction is often referred to as the control rate.). The blue line in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> shows the optimal decarbonization pathway if the cost-benefit analysis only considers the climate impacts of CO
  <sub>2</sub> and associated aerosol co-reductions. Health impacts are not included. In this reference case, the optimal decarbonization fraction is 24% of business-as-usual emissions in 2030, rising to 35% in 2050 and ultimately reaching full decarbonization by 2130. It is similar to the optimal trajectory of the standard RICE model, which features exogenous aerosol forcing and excludes health co-benefits (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>).

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the blue line, which considers only the climate impacts of CO
  <sub>2</sub> and aerosols, the red line also includes the health co-benefits of the aerosol reductions that result from decarbonization. This leads to increased optimal CO
  <sub>2</sub> mitigation. The difference between the red line and the blue line demonstrates the importance of the health benefits; roughly 45–60% more decarbonization is optimal over the next five decades (and 10–40% thereafter) compared to the reference case that only considers climate consequences. Full mitigation also occurs earlier in time. The additional emission reductions that result from the inclusion of the health co-benefits cumulatively amounts to ~270 GtC (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Importantly, all of these results account for the damages from lost cooling attributable to the aerosol co-reductions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The additional decarbonization justified by the health gains leads to a peak temperature 0.4 °C lower than the reference case (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). The carbon price pathways associated with Fig.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a> shows that the optimal climate policy has immediate and continual monetized global net benefits when accounting for health co-benefits. This overturns the findings from standard cost-benefit optimization models, which ignore health co-benefits and thus imply that optimal climate policy has net costs for much of this century (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). The result is consistent with prior co-benefits studies that have analyzed specific emission reduction scenarios and reported high benefits relative to mitigation costs

  </span>, many of the co-benefits accrue in India and China in early periods, attributable to their large populations and high capacity for mitigation-related reductions in PM
  <sub>2.5</sub>. China’s benefits decline by mid-century due to relatively rapid economic development and a stabilizing population—which both act to constrain emissions—whereas those in India persist and are the major driver of increased decarbonization relative to the reference case (see below for a sensitivity test which corroborates India’s importance). Towards the end of the century, sub-Saharan Africa replaces China as the second-largest beneficiary, as air pollution remains problematic due to lagging economic development accompanied by the world’s largest population. Other regions also stand to benefit, including less populous regions that show important benefits per capita and/or per Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>).

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the results presented above, the averted premature mortality from aerosol co-reductions produces annual monetized benefits in the hundreds of billions of dollars over the next few decades, rising to several trillion annually at the end of the century (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). To derive these numbers, we multiply, for each region-time pair, the total life-years gained by 2 years of per capita consumption. This approach produces different life-year monetizations for each region, which leads to the slight change in composition of monetized benefits (compare Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a, c</a>). However, this does not imply that we assign life-years in poorer regions less value in the objective function, because the optimization accounts for the diminishing marginal utility of consumption through a concave relationship between wealth and well-being, as described below and in the Methods section (Eq. (
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>)). Below we also show the sensitivity of our results to alternative valuations of health benefits.
