  <p>Costs and benefits of mitigation. Decomposition of the change in global consumption relative to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario under 
   <span class="bold">a</span> the full RICE + AIR optimal policy, and 
   <span class="bold">b</span> the reference case optimal policy. Health co-benefits and benefits from avoided CO
   <sub>2</sub> damages are positive, while mitigation costs and aerosol co-harms (climate damage from the co-reduction of cooling aerosols) are negative. The black solid line displays the global net effect. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> shows that the net effect on global consumption is immediately positive when health co-benefits are taken into account, in contrast to the reference case (
   <span class="bold">b</span>), which is representative of standard cost-benefit models that do not include health co-benefits and thus imply that optimal climate policy has net costs for much of this century. If health co-benefits are added to the reference policy in 
   <span class="bold">b</span>—by adding the light-red bars displayed in 
   <span class="bold">a</span>—the global net effect becomes immediately positive, and if health co-benefits were removed from 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, the net effect would be negative for most of this century
