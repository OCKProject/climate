 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three leaves from three randomly selected plants per species from each OTC and control plot were collected on 13 July and 18 September 2017. All leaves were immediately fixed in FAA (5 mL 38% formaldehyde, 90 mL 70% ethanol, and 5 mL acetic acid in a proportion of 1:18:1

Each leaf had two pieces avoiding midribs and margins, and each transversal section was observed by three views. The leaf anatomy characteristics were observed with a light microscope and photographed (Motic BA 300) with a 100 magnification. Leaf thickness was measured with complete structure and was estimated as an average of at least three points. Thicknesses of palisade tissues were measured at the same point as leaf thickness for both warming and the control plots [
