 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was conducted in the tundra ecosystem at 2028 m a.s.l. on the north-facing slope of Changbai Mountain (41°58′–42°42′ N; 127°67′–128°27′ E), northeastern China. The experimental site has a mean annual temperature of −7.3 °C and mean annual precipitation of 1373 mm [

  <a rid="B32-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-plants-08-00271">32</a>]. A snow-free season lasts from June to August (growing season). The average growing season (June to September) temperature is 5.87 °C and average precipitation ranges from 700 to 1400 mm [
  <a rid="B33-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-plants-08-00271">33</a>]. The vegetation in the experimental plots is dominated by

  <span class="italic">asiatica</span>, 
  <span class="italic">V. uliginosum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Rh. confertissimum.</span> After 7 years of OTC warming in 2017, the average coverage was 32% (OTCs) and 21% (controls) for 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span>, 32% (OTCs) and 25% (controls) for

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eight hexagonal clear-sided OTCs, according to the criteria of the International Tundra Experiment [
  <a rid="B3-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-plants-08-00271">3</a>], were installed in the tundra in 2010. The OTCs were 45 cm high, had inclined sides (60 °C), enclosed a surface of 1.0 m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, and were left in the experimental plots year round. The OTCs were installed on relatively flat ground with similar species composition and vegetation coverage. Equal areas of control plots with similar characteristics were adjacently established to each OTC. The spatial arrangements of OTCs and control plots were randomly based on the similarity of the vegetation. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Em 50 Data Collection System (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) was respectively placed in each OTC and the corresponding control plot. The air temperature at the height of 15 cm above the ground surface, soil temperatures at 10 cm soil depth, air and soil relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were monitored and recorded every half an hour. All sensors were put in the research field only during growing seasons (June to September). We separated daytime from 0600 h to 1800 h and nighttime from 1800 h to next 0600 h to distinguish different warming effects between daytime and nighttime since daytime warming is more effective for photosynthesis. We showed only the data recorded during the growing seasons in 2016 and 2017. </p>
