 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Across the two growing seasons, there were significant differences in leaf length and width between treatments for 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00271-f003" href="#plants-08-00271-f003">Figure 3</a>). Warming increased the leaf length by 29.4% in 2016 and 20.0% in 2017, and similarly increased leaf width by 20.0% in 2016 and 16.7 % in 2017 for 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span>. Warming increased the leaf length (+25.0%; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001) and width (+20.0%; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.044) of 
  <span class="italic">V. uliginosum</span> in 2016, but these increases disappeared in 2017. For 
  <span class="italic">Rh. confertissimum</span>, warming affected the leaf length (+16%) only (
