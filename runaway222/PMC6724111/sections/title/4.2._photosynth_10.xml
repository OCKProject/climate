 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Photosynthesis was measured under ambient CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration (approx. 350 μmolmol
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) using LI-6400 portable photosynthesis systems with a red/blue LED light source (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, Dearborn, MI, USA) between 0900 h and 1130 h on sunny days. All measurements were conducted at ambient temperature to evaluate seasonal differences. At least three replicate measurements were made for each species in the warming OTCs and control plots on 21 and 28 July, 11 and 30 August, 5 and 7 September 2017. Leaf chamber temperature was maintained at ambient temperature without temperature control, representing the natural temperature experienced by leaves during the measurement time. Relative humidity inside the leaf chamber ranged from 30% to 50%. Net photosynthetic rate was determined at a series of light levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, and 2000 μmol m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> s
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. After leaf dark acclimation, PAR was increased gradually from 0 to each light level needed, and the net photosynthetic rates (
