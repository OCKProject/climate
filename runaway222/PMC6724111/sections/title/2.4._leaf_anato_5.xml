  <span class="italic">asiatica</span>, warming did not significantly change the leaf thickness (mean 136.3 μm for leaves both in the warming OTCs and the control plots) throughout the growing season (
  <a rid="plants-08-00271-t004" ref-type="table" href="#plants-08-00271-t004">Table 4</a>). Warming significantly decreased the leaf thickness by 26.6% for 
  <span class="italic">Rh. confertissimum</span> in July (

  <span class="italic">V. uliginosum</span> in September (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001). The three species showed relatively higher leaf thickness in July than in September for the warming and the control plots. The thickest leaves were found in 
  <span class="italic">Rh. confertissimum</span> (mean 250.6 μm) and the thinnest in 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span> (mean 136.3 μm) (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was no significant difference in palisade thickness (ranging from 63 μm to 70 μm) between the warming and the control plots for 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var.

  <span class="italic">V. uliginosum</span> and

  <a rid="plants-08-00271-t004" ref-type="table" href="#plants-08-00271-t004">Table 4</a>). Warming did not significantly affect the ratio of palisade to spongy parenchyma for the three species except for the measurements for

  <a rid="plants-08-00271-t004" ref-type="table" href="#plants-08-00271-t004">Table 4</a>). The ratios of palisade to leaf thickness and to spongy parenchyma in 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Warming significantly decreased adaxial and abaxial epidermis cell length (−17.2~−29.8%) and cell thickness (−21.6~−39.6%) in

  <span class="italic">Rh. confertissimum</span> was 13.7% higher in the warming OTCs than that in the control plots (
