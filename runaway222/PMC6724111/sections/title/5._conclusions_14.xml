 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results indicate that in response to warming, the magnitude and direction of leaf photosynthesis, morphology and anatomy differ with species. 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span> showed an obvious advantage in 
  <span class="italic">P</span>
  <sub>max</sub>, leaf size and relatively higher palisade proportion than 
  <span class="italic">Rh. confertissimum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">V. uliginosum</span>; therefore, we may expect that 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span> population could hold greater dominance on the Changbai Mountain tundra with the future continuous warming, and 
  <span class="italic">Rh. confertissimum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">V. uliginosum</span> might eventually decrease. Species-specific responses of leaf physiological traits to warming suggest that the measurements at the individual species level are still needed to better understand and predict the community- and/or ecosystem-level responses to future climate change and their responses in high latitude and high altitude ecosystems.
