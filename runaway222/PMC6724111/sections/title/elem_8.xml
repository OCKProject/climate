  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eight hexagonal clear-sided OTCs, according to the criteria of the International Tundra Experiment [
   <a rid="B3-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-plants-08-00271">3</a>], were installed in the tundra in 2010. The OTCs were 45 cm high, had inclined sides (60 °C), enclosed a surface of 1.0 m
   <span class="sup">2</span>, and were left in the experimental plots year round. The OTCs were installed on relatively flat ground with similar species composition and vegetation coverage. Equal areas of control plots with similar characteristics were adjacently established to each OTC. The spatial arrangements of OTCs and control plots were randomly based on the similarity of the vegetation. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Em 50 Data Collection System (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) was respectively placed in each OTC and the corresponding control plot. The air temperature at the height of 15 cm above the ground surface, soil temperatures at 10 cm soil depth, air and soil relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were monitored and recorded every half an hour. All sensors were put in the research field only during growing seasons (June to September). We separated daytime from 0600 h to 1800 h and nighttime from 1800 h to next 0600 h to distinguish different warming effects between daytime and nighttime since daytime warming is more effective for photosynthesis. We showed only the data recorded during the growing seasons in 2016 and 2017. </p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Photosynthesis was measured under ambient CO

   <span class="sup">−1</span>) using LI-6400 portable photosynthesis systems with a red/blue LED light source (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, Dearborn, MI, USA) between 0900 h and 1130 h on sunny days. All measurements were conducted at ambient temperature to evaluate seasonal differences. At least three replicate measurements were made for each species in the warming OTCs and control plots on 21 and 28 July, 11 and 30 August, 5 and 7 September 2017. Leaf chamber temperature was maintained at ambient temperature without temperature control, representing the natural temperature experienced by leaves during the measurement time. Relative humidity inside the leaf chamber ranged from 30% to 50%. Net photosynthetic rate was determined at a series of light levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, and 2000 μmol m
