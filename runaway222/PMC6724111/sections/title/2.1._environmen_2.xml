 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The OTC treatment increased average air and soil temperatures, while the soil water content was decreased (
  <a rid="plants-08-00271-t001" ref-type="table" href="#plants-08-00271-t001">Table 1</a>). Compared to controls, OTCs increased the mean daily (24 h) air temperature during the growing season by 1.4 °C (2016) and 1.6 °C (2017). OTCs increased the daytime air temperature by 2.5 °C (2016) and 2.9 °C (2017), and the nighttime temperature by 0.9 °C (2016) and 0.3 °C (2017) (

Warming did not significantly affect daily soil temperature at 10 cm depth although there was an increased trend, 13.7 vs. 13.1 °C in 2016 and 13.9 vs. 12.9 °C in 2017. The daytime soil temperature was markedly increased by 2.9 °C in 2016 and 3.3 °C in 2017, but the nighttime soil temperature did not change as compared to the control (
