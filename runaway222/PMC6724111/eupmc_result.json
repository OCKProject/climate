    "Tundra is one of the most sensitive biomes to climate warming. Understanding plant eco-physiological responses to warming is critical because these traits can give feedback on the effects of climate-warming on tundra ecosystem. We used open-top chambers following the criteria of the International Tundra Experiment to passively warm air and soil temperatures year round in alpine tundra. Leaf size, photosynthesis and anatomy of three dominant species were investigated during the growing seasons after 7 years of continuous warming. Warming increased the maximal light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Pmax) by 43.6% for Dryas. octopetala var. asiatica and by 26.7% for Rhododendron confertissimum across the whole growing season, while warming did not significantly affect the Pmax of V. uliginosum. The leaf size of Dr. octopetala var. asiatica and Rh. confertissimum was increased by warming. No marked effects of warming on anatomical traits of Dr. octopetala var. asiatica were observed. Warming decreased the leaf thickness of Rh. confertissimum and Vaccinium uliginosum. This study highlights the species-specific responses to climate warming. Our results imply that Dr. octopetala var. asiatica could be more dominant because it, mainly in terms of leaf photosynthetic capacity and size, seems to have advantages over the other two species in a warming world."
