         <p>Differences between regime shifts resulting from smooth pressure–status relationships,
            threshold-like responses, and alternative stable states (bistability) with hysteresis.
            The two top rows of graphs show time series of driver (e.g., nutrient inputs) and
            ecosystem state (e.g., phytoplankton biomass), and the lower row of graphs show the
            relationship between the driver and ecosystem state. 
            <span>a</span> Regime shift in driver is linearly translated to the ecosystem state. Jumps appear
            only in the time series. 
            <span>b</span> Regime shift in ecosystem state after driver exceeds a threshold (tipping point).
            This is manifested through a jump in the time series of the ecosystem state. 
            <span>c</span> The hysteresis loop linking the ecosystem state to the environmental driver results
            in jumps between two alternative states when the driver is first slowly increased
            and then reduced again. 
            <span>d</span> Regime in drivers leading to changes in ecosystem state that remain (or change slowly
            back, not shown) when the former driver situation is re-established. 
            <span>e</span> Regime in drivers leading to changes in ecosystem state that change gradually back
            (with differential resilience illustrated with different symbols) when the former
            driver situation is re-established.
