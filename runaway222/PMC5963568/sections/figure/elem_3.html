         <p>Above: Effects of the Dorset sealing activities on a pond on Baffin Island (Nunavut,
            Arctic Canada) based on diatom assemblage structure and sedimentary δ
            <span>15</span>N. The effects of Dorset sealing activities are recorded near the base of the core.
            The primary diatom zonation, as determined by CONISS (Grimm 
            <a>1987</a>), is shown as a dotted line. The radiocarbon date, shown on the leftmost side, was
            obtained on terrestrial macrofossils (TM) (Modified from Michelutti et al. 
            <a>2013</a>). Below: The fossil diatom stratigraphy and profile from Juet-1 on Baffin Island
            (Nunavut, Arctic Canada), a pond adjacent to a Dorset longhouse, believed to be used
            primarily for periodic seasonal gatherings and ceremonial functions. The relatively
            complacent profiles indicate no major human impacts at this site, as would be expected.
