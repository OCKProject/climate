         <p>Sediment core collected from the lake within a large bird colony at Salve Ø. It shows
            the stepwise change in the characteristics of the lake ecosystem. The change was very
            rapid, showing a total change in sediment chemistry within less than a cm, corresponding
            to less than 30 years. The stable isotopes of C and N are in permille, organic content
            is loss of ignition in %, N is percent of organic matter and C:N ratio is calculated
            by weight (modified from Davidson et al.
