         <p>Using a comparative approach to demonstrate the effects of Thule Inuit winter settlers
            on ponds in Arctic Canada based on algal remains in sediment cores. The profiles represent
            diatom species composition, δ
            <span>15</span>N, %N, and spectrally inferred chlorophyll 
            <span>a</span> from two similar ponds on Bathurst Island, only a few metres apart. However, Pond
            B-AO (above) had only 5 Thule whalebone houses in its catchment, whilst Pond B-AP
            (below) had 16 houses. The more affected pond clearly documents the limnological response
            of the whalers. For example, the diatom 
            <span>Stephanodiscus minutulus</span> is a well-known indicator of elevated nutrient conditions (modified from Hadley et
            al.
