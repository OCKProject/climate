      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While we have little data from the North Water area on the effects of Thule Inuit
         on the local ecosystems, paleolimnological and archaeological data collected from
         the Canadian Arctic suggest that the whaling activities of the Thule Inuit altered
         freshwater ecosystems markedly. For example, using paleolimnological approaches, Douglas
         et al. (
         <a>2004</a>) and Hadley et al. (
         <a>2010a</a>, 
         <a>b</a>) revealed that the Thule winter settlement on Somerset Island, south-eastern Bathurst
         Island, and on east-central Ellesmere Island (Nunavut, Arctic Canada), respectively,
         led to marked ecological changes in pond ecology due to excess nutrient input (eutrophication)
         from the Thule Inuit activities.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using a comparative approach, Hadley et al. (
         <a>2010a</a>) recorded striking ecological changes in diatom species assemblages, spectrally inferred
         primary production and nutrient geochemistry, indicating nutrient enrichment and eutrophication
         in a small pond draining 16 Thule Inuit whale houses, whilst an adjacent pond with
         only five whale houses recorded only minimal changes (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). Input of marine-derived nutrients from sea mammal carcasses used by the Thule Inuit
         for food and construction of winter settlements, and other human activities, coincided
         with a notable increase in a eutrophic diatom taxon. Although the diatom changes recorded
         in the affected site persisted for some time after the period and Thule occupation,
         indicating relatively strong resilience, the most recent sediments and water chemistry
         suggest that the pond has now, however, partly recovered to near pre-impact conditions
         (Hadley et al. 
         <a>2010a</a>) (Box 
         <a>1</a>, Fig. 
         <a>1</a>e scenario).

               <p>Using a comparative approach to demonstrate the effects of Thule Inuit winter settlers
                  on ponds in Arctic Canada based on algal remains in sediment cores. The profiles represent
                  diatom species composition, δ
                  <span>15</span>N, %N, and spectrally inferred chlorophyll 
                  <span>a</span> from two similar ponds on Bathurst Island, only a few metres apart. However, Pond
                  B-AO (above) had only 5 Thule whalebone houses in its catchment, whilst Pond B-AP
                  (below) had 16 houses. The more affected pond clearly documents the limnological response
                  of the whalers. For example, the diatom 
                  <span>Stephanodiscus minutulus</span> is a well-known indicator of elevated nutrient conditions (modified from Hadley et
                  al.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of the Dorset culture on the pond ecosystem can also be recorded in the
         paleolimnological record. Michelutti et al. (
         <a>2013</a>) analysed sediment cores from seven ponds on the south-western coast of Baffin Island,
         Nunavut, covering a gradient of the intensity of past human activity in their catchments.
         The study area was, prior to the historic Inuit occupation, extensively inhabited
         by Thule culture Inuit (ca. 12–16th century) and by an earlier Arctic group, the Dorset
         culture Palaeo-Eskimos (ca. 500 BC—fifth century) and their predecessors from a period
         as early as 2500 BC. The authors found that the degree of eutrophication in these
         freshwater ponds depended on the length of the occupation as well as the amount and
         type of marine mammals taken as primary prey items (e.g., whales, walrus, or seals).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to the Thule examples noted above, the limnological effects of Dorset sealing
         activities were clearly demarked in the sediment record. For example, Tanfield-1 is
         a pond adjacent to a Dorset archaeological excavation and the sediment record clearly
         identified the effects of past sealing and other Dorset activities by elevated δ
         <span>15</span>N and changes in diatom assemblages near the base of the core (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>, above). A nearby control pond (Tanfield-2), outside the influence of the Dorset,
         recorded no similar changes (Michelutti et al. 
         <a>2013</a>). Meanwhile, sediment cores collected near the so-called Dorset “longhouses”, such
         as Juet-1 (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>, below), believed to be locations of periodic seasonal gatherings, did not register
         any evidence of eutrophication, reflecting the shorter, less intensive nature of these
         occupations. Due to slow rates of decomposition, nutrients from butchered marine animal
         bones continue to influence the freshwater sites into which they drain, as evidenced
         by higher than typical nutrient- and production-related water chemistry variables
         (Douglas et al. 
         <a>2004</a>; Hadley et al. 
         <a>2010a</a>, 
         <a>b</a>; Michelutti et al. 
         <a>2013</a>). These examples show the mutual impact of the partners in what emerges as a truly
         
         <span>socio</span>-
         <span>ecological</span> system.

                  complacent profiles indicate no major human impacts at this site, as would be expected.
