      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apart from the environmental drivers of change, human, social, or cultural factors
         must also be taken into account—as we saw in the example above. In an article on population
         movements in the Canadian Arctic, the Canadian anthropologist Susan Rowley (
         <a>1985</a>) provides a systematic analysis of 25 historically and/or orally documented large-scale
         Inuit population movements. In six cases, the driver behind the movement is likely
         either famine or epidemic diseases (Box 
         <a>1</a>, Fig. 
         <a>1</a>a or b scenario, depending on whether these diseases appeared once or got gradually
         worse), and in a seventh case a natural disaster. Rowley suggests that in 10 cases,
         the impetus has to be found in what she calls social pressures, chief among which
         was fear of revenge.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The best documented case of direct relevance to our study area is that of the travels
         of the famous Qillarsuaq, who eventually had a major effect on the lives of people
         in the North Water area (Gilberg 
         <a>1976</a>; Ulloriaq 
         <a>1985</a>; Mary-Rousselière 
         <a>2002</a>; see also Hastrup et al. 
         <a>2018</a>). Qillarsuaq’s long journey seems to have begun with a killing in southern Baffin
         Island in the early 1840s. Having lived for a while in the Pond Inlet region, Qillarsuaq
         got into a conflict during which he committed a second murder, and after fleeing,
         he headed north and eventually joined up with Inughuit in Inglefield Land in the early
         1860s. Some 6 years later, he decided to leave Greenland, after having taken part
         in the killing of a powerful local hunter and angakok (”shaman”). Qillarsuaq died
         shortly after leaving Greenland.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even though this case revolves around Qillarsuaq, it originally included some 50–60
         people leaving Pond Inlet, of which the larger part died during the journeys across
         rarely travelled parts of Devon Island and Ellesmere Island. The historical sources
         do not provide an insight into whether or not gradually increasing social tensions
         had been building in Pond Inlet prior to Qillarsuaq’s arrival, but the resulting social
         and economic effects on the community in Pond Inlet must have been substantial as
         the movement included an estimated quarter or third of the total population in the
         area. It is, however, clear that the arrival of the group led by Qillarsuaq resulted
         in significant changes in the life among the Inughuit. The Baffin Island group (re-)introduced
         a number of technologies—the kayak, the 
         <span>umiaq</span>, the use of bow and arrow, and of fishing hooks and leisters—that resulted in a dramatic
         expansion of the resource base of the Inughuit. Only a decade earlier, prior to the
         arrival of the group, serious concerns about the survival of the Inughuit were expressed
         by both British explorers in the area and by indigenous people themselves, with, perhaps,
         the entire population amounting to 100–140 persons (Kane 
         <a>1856</a>; Hayes 
         <a>1867</a>, quoted in Gilberg (
         <a>1976</a>)). Just a generation later, due to the immigration of the Baffin islanders, the population
         seems to have increased to a more viable minimum at about 220–250 people (Gilberg
         
         <a>1976</a>), thus being an example of openness creating a more robust, or resilient, community.
         Given his brief sojourn, it was, indeed, a fast transition.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to Qillersuaq, the arrival of John Ross and his crew in 1818 also made a great
         impact in the Thule region; the arrival marked the first historically known meeting
         between Europeans and Inughuit (Ross 
         <a>1819</a>). Ross noted that the Inughuit did not have any kayaks or 
         <span>umiaqs</span> nor possessed knowledge of how to build these. His interpreter, Sakæus, was told
         that the knowledge was lost following a series of deaths of the people who knew how
         to build them many years earlier. He was also told that the Inughuit had no contact
         with other people, either to the south or to the west. Sakæus was surprised to see
         that dog sledges were made of bone and antler without the use of wood. These examples
         follow a Box 
         <a>1</a>, Fig. 
         <a>1</a>e scenario. Following immediately in the wake of Ross, the North Water and Inughuit
         were visited by primarily Scottish whaling ships that not only managed to wipe out
         the entire baleen whale population in the North Water by the turn of the twentieth
         century but also (along with British explorers) brought an (uneven) stream of European
         products into the area (Gilberg 
         <a>1976</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is highly likely that the very low population number recorded in the 1850s and
         1860s was a direct result of various diseases introduced by Europeans into the, in
         epidemiological terms, “virgin” Inughuit population, as we see in later more well-documented
         cases. Historical sources thus suggest that 10 to 20% of the Inughuit population died
         from each of a series of epidemics starting around 1880, and occurring in 1895–96,
         1901–02, 1909–10, 1920–21, 1928–29, 1932, 1945, 1948–49, and 1955 (Gilberg 
         <a>1976</a>, p. 27–30).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When combining the information contained in the records on the Inughuit community,
         it is plausible that the main drivers in the erosion of the Inughuit society in the
         early nineteenth century were epidemics and isolation. While the lack of several technologies
         reduced the resource spaces available to the Inughuit community, this seems to have
         been overcome by intensifying the harvest of an otherwise secondary resource, Little
         Auk (
         <span>Alle alle</span>), thus acting as a buffer. The widening of resource spaces with the arrival of Qillarsuaq
         and his group seems to have been sufficient to act as a resistance preventing the
         passing of a tipping point that would, otherwise, have led to the extinction of the
         Inughuit.
