  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was during these centuries that Alaskan Inuit groups crossed the Mackenzie Delta and settled the eastern Arctic. It has been suggested that one of the most important drivers was the unique source of iron located in northern Melville Bay, i.e., the famous Cape York meteorites (McGhee 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">1984</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2009</a>). Judging by the layout of the early Inuit sites, the groups arriving were organised around a whale-boat owner (an 
   <span class="italic">umialik</span>), his crew, and their families. The winter sites generally had 3–8 winter dwellings (although larger numbers have been found) built from a combination of sod, boulders, and slabs, and various baleen whale bone elements. The dwellings had a separate kitchen niche containing an open fireplace. Most would have housed one or two nuclear families, but many of the sites had a separate, larger and different type of dwelling structure—the so-called Men’s houses, or 
   <span class="italic">qassi</span> (Holtved 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">1944</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1954</a>; McCullough 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">1989</a>). The finds from these Men’s houses often include substantial amounts of baleen, and besides housing various social functions, they seem to have functioned as workshops (Mønsted 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2016</a>). With the arrival of the Alaskan Inuit, we have the first evidence of the large seagoing vessels known as 
   <span class="italic">umiat</span> (sing. 
   <span class="italic">umiaq</span>) in the eastern Arctic. These boats were not only used as whaling boats but could carry considerable gear and about 10–12 people. 
   <span class="italic">Umiaq</span> construction demanded a relatively large amount of high-quality wood, and maintenance required an annual renewal of the skin cover, made from either bearded seal or female walrus (Petersen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">1986</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Judging by the radiocarbon dates available from the North Water area, there is little evidence of Men’s houses after the middle of the fifteenth century, and no direct evidence of the 
   <span class="italic">umiaq</span> is known from the area. Thus, it is likely that the 
   <span class="italic">umialik</span> institution disappeared from the North Water area at this time when also the ordinary winter dwellings lost their separate kitchen to be replaced by small niches in which the source of heat was blubber lamps. It thus seems likely that considerable social and economic transformations (a regime shift, Box 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>a or b scenario) took place in the fifteenth century. An important driver in these changes would have been a gradual exhaustion of the wood brought from Alaska and the local and limited sources of driftwood, owing to the expanding ice cover in the Baffin Bay during the Little Ice Age (Alix 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2016</a>; Hastrup et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2018</a>). Even if we do not have a sufficiently refined chronological control of the order of events that took place in prehistoric times, it does seem clear that a substantial amount of Inuit moved further south in Greenland to settle all areas from south of the Melville Bay to Cape Farewell, and then north into East Greenland during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century. From the early part of the fifteenth century, other groups of Thule Inuit moved northwards around Peary Land and then south into Northeast Greenland (Gulløv 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2004</a>; Sørensen and Gulløv 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the Alaskan Inuit first arrived in the North Water area (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), it had been inhabited since the eighth century by the Late Dorset people, as they are known in archaeology. The timing and character of the meetings between the Inuit and Late Dorset are still strongly debated (e.g., Friesen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2000</a>; Appelt et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2016</a>; Park 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR01" href="#CR01">2016</a>), but clearly the social organisation and technologies of the two groups were very different. The incoming Alaskan Inuit groups were in control of the long-distance exchange networks, from the fourteenth century onwards, including the exchange of meteoric iron to most parts of the Canadian Arctic (Appelt et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2016</a>). By this time, we see the complete disappearance of the Late Dorset groups, not only in the North Water Area but throughout the eastern Arctic (Appelt et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2016</a>). It seems likely that their disappearance is in part the result of the arrival of the Inuit (Friesen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2000</a>; Appelt 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2004</a>), and it has been suggested that the Alaskan Inuit may have—unknowingly—exposed the Late Dorset groups to diseases to which their immune system had no defence, i.e., in epidemiological terms, the Late Dorset groups would have been a “virgin population” (Agger and Maschner 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2009</a>) (Box 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>a scenario).
  </p>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A third party was involved in these meetings, namely the Norse. We do not know what the frequency and extent of these meetings were, but we do know that they took place sometime in the late thirteenth and fourteenth century and that Norse artefacts from these meetings are distributed across at least nine different Inuit sites (Holtved 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">1944</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1954</a>; Schledermann

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2016</a>) and one of the Late Dorset sites (Appelt et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">1998</a>). The Norse presence in the North Water area would have made it clear to the Alaskan Inuit groups that they had to go further south for supplies of, among other items, wood and iron.
  </p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the Late Dorset groups, the arrival of the Inuit meant that they and their lifestyle vanished—a rapid transformation within a century. For the Inuit arriving in the region of the North Water area, it opened numerous rich and diverse resource spaces allowing them to continue most of their Alaskan lifestyle. However, after just one or two centuries, this would no longer have been viable. A major driver in this process is likely to have been a gradual exhaustion of wood supplies, as mentioned above, and/or a change in the timing and migration routes of the large whales in the North Water, which could be due to the onset of the Little Ice Age by the early fifteenth century. The situation was, however, buffered by moving into new lands—further south—which they came to fully utilise after the disappearance of the Norse in the middle of the fifteenth century.</p>

  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While we have little data from the North Water area on the effects of Thule Inuit on the local ecosystems, paleolimnological and archaeological data collected from the Canadian Arctic suggest that the whaling activities of the Thule Inuit altered freshwater ecosystems markedly. For example, using paleolimnological approaches, Douglas et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2004</a>) and Hadley et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2010a</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">b</a>) revealed that the Thule winter settlement on Somerset Island, south-eastern Bathurst Island, and on east-central Ellesmere Island (Nunavut, Arctic Canada), respectively, led to marked ecological changes in pond ecology due to excess nutrient input (eutrophication) from the Thule Inuit activities.
  </p>
  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using a comparative approach, Hadley et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2010a</a>) recorded striking ecological changes in diatom species assemblages, spectrally inferred primary production and nutrient geochemistry, indicating nutrient enrichment and eutrophication in a small pond draining 16 Thule Inuit whale houses, whilst an adjacent pond with only five whale houses recorded only minimal changes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Input of marine-derived nutrients from sea mammal carcasses used by the Thule Inuit for food and construction of winter settlements, and other human activities, coincided with a notable increase in a eutrophic diatom taxon. Although the diatom changes recorded in the affected site persisted for some time after the period and Thule occupation, indicating relatively strong resilience, the most recent sediments and water chemistry suggest that the pond has now, however, partly recovered to near pre-impact conditions (Hadley et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2010a</a>) (Box

However, Pond B-AO (above) had only 5 Thule whalebone houses in its catchment, whilst Pond B-AP (below) had 16 houses. The more affected pond clearly documents the limnological response of the whalers. For example, the diatom

   </div>
  </p>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of the Dorset culture on the pond ecosystem can also be recorded in the paleolimnological record. Michelutti et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2013</a>) analysed sediment cores from seven ponds on the south-western coast of Baffin Island, Nunavut, covering a gradient of the intensity of past human activity in their catchments. The study area was, prior to the historic Inuit occupation, extensively inhabited by Thule culture Inuit (ca. 12–16th century) and by an earlier Arctic group, the Dorset culture Palaeo-Eskimos (ca. 500 BC—fifth century) and their predecessors from a period as early as 2500 BC. The authors found that the degree of eutrophication in these freshwater ponds depended on the length of the occupation as well as the amount and type of marine mammals taken as primary prey items (e.g., whales, walrus, or seals).
  </p>
  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to the Thule examples noted above, the limnological effects of Dorset sealing activities were clearly demarked in the sediment record. For example, Tanfield-1 is a pond adjacent to a Dorset archaeological excavation and the sediment record clearly identified the effects of past sealing and other Dorset activities by elevated δ
   <span class="sup">15</span>N and changes in diatom assemblages near the base of the core (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, above). A nearby control pond (Tanfield-2), outside the influence of the Dorset, recorded no similar changes (Michelutti et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2013</a>). Meanwhile, sediment cores collected near the so-called Dorset “longhouses”, such as Juet-1 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, below), believed to be locations of periodic seasonal gatherings, did not register any evidence of eutrophication, reflecting the shorter, less intensive nature of these occupations. Due to slow rates of decomposition, nutrients from butchered marine animal bones continue to influence the freshwater sites into which they drain, as evidenced by higher than typical nutrient- and production-related water chemistry variables (Douglas et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2004</a>; Hadley et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2010a</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2013</a>). These examples show the mutual impact of the partners in what emerges as a truly

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historical drivers and resistance, the story of Qillarsuaq</div>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apart from the environmental drivers of change, human, social, or cultural factors must also be taken into account—as we saw in the example above. In an article on population movements in the Canadian Arctic, the Canadian anthropologist Susan Rowley (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">1985</a>) provides a systematic analysis of 25 historically and/or orally documented large-scale Inuit population movements. In six cases, the driver behind the movement is likely either famine or epidemic diseases (Box 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>a or b scenario, depending on whether these diseases appeared once or got gradually worse), and in a seventh case a natural disaster. Rowley suggests that in 10 cases, the impetus has to be found in what she calls social pressures, chief among which was fear of revenge.
  </p>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The best documented case of direct relevance to our study area is that of the travels of the famous Qillarsuaq, who eventually had a major effect on the lives of people in the North Water area (Gilberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">1976</a>; Ulloriaq 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">1985</a>; Mary-Rousselière 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2002</a>; see also Hastrup et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2018</a>). Qillarsuaq’s long journey seems to have begun with a killing in southern Baffin Island in the early 1840s. Having lived for a while in the Pond Inlet region, Qillarsuaq got into a conflict during which he committed a second murder, and after fleeing, he headed north and eventually joined up with Inughuit in Inglefield Land in the early 1860s. Some 6 years later, he decided to leave Greenland, after having taken part in the killing of a powerful local hunter and angakok (”shaman”). Qillarsuaq died shortly after leaving Greenland.
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even though this case revolves around Qillarsuaq, it originally included some 50–60 people leaving Pond Inlet, of which the larger part died during the journeys across rarely travelled parts of Devon Island and Ellesmere Island. The historical sources do not provide an insight into whether or not gradually increasing social tensions had been building in Pond Inlet prior to Qillarsuaq’s arrival, but the resulting social and economic effects on the community in Pond Inlet must have been substantial as the movement included an estimated quarter or third of the total population in the area. It is, however, clear that the arrival of the group led by Qillarsuaq resulted in significant changes in the life among the Inughuit. The Baffin Island group (re-)introduced a number of technologies—the kayak, the 
   <span class="italic">umiaq</span>, the use of bow and arrow, and of fishing hooks and leisters—that resulted in a dramatic expansion of the resource base of the Inughuit. Only a decade earlier, prior to the arrival of the group, serious concerns about the survival of the Inughuit were expressed by both British explorers in the area and by indigenous people themselves, with, perhaps, the entire population amounting to 100–140 persons (Kane 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02" href="#CR02">1856</a>; Hayes 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR03" href="#CR03">1867</a>, quoted in Gilberg (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">1976</a>)). Just a generation later, due to the immigration of the Baffin islanders, the population seems to have increased to a more viable minimum at about 220–250 people (Gilberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">1976</a>), thus being an example of openness creating a more robust, or resilient, community. Given his brief sojourn, it was, indeed, a fast transition.
  </p>
  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to Qillersuaq, the arrival of John Ross and his crew in 1818 also made a great impact in the Thule region; the arrival marked the first historically known meeting between Europeans and Inughuit (Ross 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">1819</a>). Ross noted that the Inughuit did not have any kayaks or 
   <span class="italic">umiaqs</span> nor possessed knowledge of how to build these. His interpreter, Sakæus, was told that the knowledge was lost following a series of deaths of the people who knew how to build them many years earlier. He was also told that the Inughuit had no contact with other people, either to the south or to the west. Sakæus was surprised to see that dog sledges were made of bone and antler without the use of wood. These examples follow a Box 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>e scenario. Following immediately in the wake of Ross, the North Water and Inughuit were visited by primarily Scottish whaling ships that not only managed to wipe out the entire baleen whale population in the North Water by the turn of the twentieth century but also (along with British explorers) brought an (uneven) stream of European products into the area (Gilberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">1976</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is highly likely that the very low population number recorded in the 1850s and 1860s was a direct result of various diseases introduced by Europeans into the, in epidemiological terms, “virgin” Inughuit population, as we see in later more well-documented cases. Historical sources thus suggest that 10 to 20% of the Inughuit population died from each of a series of epidemics starting around 1880, and occurring in 1895–96, 1901–02, 1909–10, 1920–21, 1928–29, 1932, 1945, 1948–49, and 1955 (Gilberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">1976</a>, p. 27–30).
  </p>
  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When combining the information contained in the records on the Inughuit community, it is plausible that the main drivers in the erosion of the Inughuit society in the early nineteenth century were epidemics and isolation. While the lack of several technologies reduced the resource spaces available to the Inughuit community, this seems to have been overcome by intensifying the harvest of an otherwise secondary resource, Little Auk (
   <span class="italic">Alle alle</span>), thus acting as a buffer. The widening of resource spaces with the arrival of Qillarsuaq and his group seems to have been sufficient to act as a resistance preventing the passing of a tipping point that would, otherwise, have led to the extinction of the Inughuit.

  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Little Auk was not only a food buffer for local people, creating social resilience and preventing extinction; it was also a key ecosystem engineer shaping the terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems along the Greenlandic coast in the North Water area and elsewhere within its breeding range. The Little Auk promotes the assimilation of marine-derived nutrients in terrestrial and aquatic biota and boosts primary productivity, which in turn has profound effects on a range of biogeochemical processes in the ecosystems involved (González-Bergonzoni et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2017</a>; Mosbech et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2018</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The formation of the polynya itself may be a classic example of a tipping point (Box 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>b scenario). The North Water polynya relies upon the formation of the ice bridge or ice arc at the north end of Baffin Bay in Smith Sound in the Nares Strait. This stable ice bridge prevents pack ice from being blown south by the prevailing northern wind into Baffin Bay. In addition, new ice formed south of the ice bridge is blown further south, creating open water, and as dense salt water forms during ice creation, the dense salt water sinks and help creating entrainment of deeper water with nutrients to the photic zone. Lower spring temperatures would lead to the formation or persistence of the ice bridge allowing the North Water polynya to form. Therefore, a relatively small change in temperature might lead to a profound alteration of the environment and ecosystems (Box 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>b scenario). Davidson et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2018</a>) suggest that the first arrival of the Little Auk at around 4400 cal years BP signals the genesis of the North Water polynya (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). This coincides with falling temperatures at the end of the Holocene climate optimum; thus, it appears that a cooling climate counter-intuitively led to a longer period of open water and formation of large amounts of ice, but the ice was blown south, which resulted in the formation of the productive polynya. The effects of this relatively small change in temperature may have reverberated ever further in the ecosystem as the arrival of humans in the region is also first recorded at this time.

     <p>Sediment core collected from the lake within a large bird colony at Salve Ø. It shows the stepwise change in the characteristics of the lake ecosystem. The change was very rapid, showing a total change in sediment chemistry within less than a cm, corresponding to less than 30 years. The stable isotopes of C and N are in permille, organic content is loss of ignition in %, N is percent of organic matter and C:N ratio is calculated by weight (modified from Davidson et al.

  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A sediment core from Salve Ø also revealed that the Little Auk arrival between 3945 and 3575 cal BP translated into rapid change in the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the colonisation areas/catchments (Davidson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2018</a>). If Little Auk again disappears in the North Water Area, the bird-influenced systems will expectedly recover to their former state, though with a very significant delay (Box 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>d scenario). This is evident from a sediment core from Raffles Ø, off Liverpool Land, East Greenland, covering the past 10 000 years. Here, the seabird populations—mainly consisting of Little Auk—have varied substantially during the Holocene as judged from the concentration of cadmium, total nitrogen, and organic matter in the sediment. Large seabird breeding colonies were present between 7500 cal BP and 1900 cal BP, from 1000 to 500 cal BP and since circa 100 cal BP, their presence/absence being dependent on the feeding conditions close to Raffles Ø (sea-ice cover) and/or the degree of a sufficiently long breeding season due to climate conditions (Wagner and Melles 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2001</a>). In between these periods, the concentrations of total nitrogen and organic matter declined to pre-bird conditions, in this case, suggesting a relatively fast recovery.
