 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While we have little data from the North Water area on the effects of Thule Inuit on the local ecosystems, paleolimnological and archaeological data collected from the Canadian Arctic suggest that the whaling activities of the Thule Inuit altered freshwater ecosystems markedly. For example, using paleolimnological approaches, Douglas et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2004</a>) and Hadley et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2010a</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">b</a>) revealed that the Thule winter settlement on Somerset Island, south-eastern Bathurst Island, and on east-central Ellesmere Island (Nunavut, Arctic Canada), respectively, led to marked ecological changes in pond ecology due to excess nutrient input (eutrophication) from the Thule Inuit activities.
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using a comparative approach, Hadley et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2010a</a>) recorded striking ecological changes in diatom species assemblages, spectrally inferred primary production and nutrient geochemistry, indicating nutrient enrichment and eutrophication in a small pond draining 16 Thule Inuit whale houses, whilst an adjacent pond with only five whale houses recorded only minimal changes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Input of marine-derived nutrients from sea mammal carcasses used by the Thule Inuit for food and construction of winter settlements, and other human activities, coincided with a notable increase in a eutrophic diatom taxon. Although the diatom changes recorded in the affected site persisted for some time after the period and Thule occupation, indicating relatively strong resilience, the most recent sediments and water chemistry suggest that the pond has now, however, partly recovered to near pre-impact conditions (Hadley et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2010a</a>) (Box 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>e scenario).

However, Pond B-AO (above) had only 5 Thule whalebone houses in its catchment, whilst Pond B-AP (below) had 16 houses. The more affected pond clearly documents the limnological response of the whalers. For example, the diatom 
     <span class="italic">Stephanodiscus minutulus</span> is a well-known indicator of elevated nutrient conditions (modified from Hadley et al.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of the Dorset culture on the pond ecosystem can also be recorded in the paleolimnological record. Michelutti et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2013</a>) analysed sediment cores from seven ponds on the south-western coast of Baffin Island, Nunavut, covering a gradient of the intensity of past human activity in their catchments. The study area was, prior to the historic Inuit occupation, extensively inhabited by Thule culture Inuit (ca. 12–16th century) and by an earlier Arctic group, the Dorset culture Palaeo-Eskimos (ca. 500 BC—fifth century) and their predecessors from a period as early as 2500 BC. The authors found that the degree of eutrophication in these freshwater ponds depended on the length of the occupation as well as the amount and type of marine mammals taken as primary prey items (e.g., whales, walrus, or seals).
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to the Thule examples noted above, the limnological effects of Dorset sealing activities were clearly demarked in the sediment record. For example, Tanfield-1 is a pond adjacent to a Dorset archaeological excavation and the sediment record clearly identified the effects of past sealing and other Dorset activities by elevated δ
  <span class="sup">15</span>N and changes in diatom assemblages near the base of the core (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, above). A nearby control pond (Tanfield-2), outside the influence of the Dorset, recorded no similar changes (Michelutti et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2013</a>). Meanwhile, sediment cores collected near the so-called Dorset “longhouses”, such as Juet-1 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, below), believed to be locations of periodic seasonal gatherings, did not register any evidence of eutrophication, reflecting the shorter, less intensive nature of these occupations. Due to slow rates of decomposition, nutrients from butchered marine animal bones continue to influence the freshwater sites into which they drain, as evidenced by higher than typical nutrient- and production-related water chemistry variables (Douglas et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2004</a>; Hadley et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2010a</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">b</a>; Michelutti et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2013</a>). These examples show the mutual impact of the partners in what emerges as a truly 
  <span class="italic">socio</span>-
  <span class="italic">ecological</span> system.
