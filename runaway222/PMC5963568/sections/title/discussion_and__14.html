      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Discussion and conclusion: Uncertain futures and a socio-ecological system in transition</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Discussing rapid transitions in the Arctic, notably in the North Water area, makes
         one realise the extreme complexity of the issue as has transpired from the cases described
         above. When and how do particular transformations qualify as transitions or even tipping
         points? Life in the multi-species community in the Thule Region has been sustained
         by the post-glacial polynya, which allowed both animals and humans to settle and remain
         there over four millennia—even if human settlement in the area was discontinuous (Hastrup
         et al. 
         <a>2018</a>). The hiatuses have a lot to do with climate fluctuations, as have the current changes,
         social and ecological, although there is no simple causality, as we have seen. In
         this section, we discuss current notions of fast transitions, resilience, and resistance
         with a view not only to past events but also to present and future prospects for the
         socio-ecological system. It underscores the need for human agents and political bodies
         to take action.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Arctic is regarded as a sentinel of change, and significant changes in the climate
         system here are occurring faster than anticipated in the IPCC (
         <a>2007</a>) report (Carmack et al. 
         <a>2012</a>). This not only calls for an obvious natural scientific interest but also for a renewed
         attention to the people (still) living there, who are more or less dependent on a
         particular natural system for their livelihood. In addition, it calls for socio-ecological
         system analyses, certainly also in the North Water area. In the preceding historical
         cases, this has been exemplified in various ways. The challenge now is to be able
         not only to analyse the past but also to understand the future challenges.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recognizing the North Water area as an integrated socio-ecological system prompts
         us to examine the present changes in the sea-ice system in relation to economic and
         political issues. While trying to curb the effects of the sea-ice changes, the political
         economy of predicting the future inadvertently contributes to the volatility and unpredictability
         of the system. “As we move further into the Anthropocene, the volatility of socio-ecological
         systems is increasing” (Young 
         <a>2012</a>, p. 75). Given the dramatic physical and biological changes, both public and private
         actors have taken new intense interest in shipping, industrial development, and tourism,
         intensifying the processes of environmental change. This affects the entire make-up
         of the Thule community. In the Thule region, part of the flexibility that has allowed
         people to live there over millennia, against all odds, has been their readiness to
         disperse and to shift between communal and more individualised family strategies based
         on the hunt. Resources were equally accessible to all, but not always in the same
         places as before.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The open-access nature of resources has been identified as a key feature of the so-called
         hunter-gatherer communities. Within this framework, it has been discussed when and
         how individual decisions about foraging strategies affect the entire forager-resource
         system—in turn feeding back on the decisions of individual foragers and potentially
         leading to stochastic environmental variation (Freeman and Anderies 
         <a>2012</a>, p. 439). While such abstract discussions of potential tipping points in a socio-ecological
         system may have their merits, they do tend to reduce the complexity of both the system
         and of human action. There is a lot more to human action than survival at the lowest
         possible cost-efficiency level; there are preferences and social relations, past experiences,
         and anticipated futures. Such is very much the case among the High Arctic hunters
         and their families living around the North Water. What is more, they are fully aware
         of the Anthropocene realities, and the challenges that the manifest environmental
         changes pose to their way of living. While it may be difficult to survive some periods,
         people are generally not averse to new futures (showing high resilience, Box 
         <a>2</a>). They may live in a relatively secluded region, but they are certainly abreast of
         both national and global developments (facing strong openness).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within the social sciences, there is a certain weariness of the notion of tipping
         points, given that social and, indeed, socio-ecological processes are seen to have
         contributed to continual change of the surface of the earth in a process of more or
         less smooth or abrupt change. As Nuttall has it: “the world has been transformed by
         human action in a constant process of engagement between people and the environments
         they inhabit, forcing us to question the idea of the ‘natural world” (Nuttall 
         <a>2012</a>, p. 100). Even when the transformative human acts originate beyond the ‘natural system’
         under scrutiny, because of the global impacts upon the North Water area, they are
         still part of the larger socio-ecological system with which we are concerned here—a
         ‘system’ that is made out of elements of many scales, temporal and spatial, and which
         is affected by material, technological, animal, and political processes originating
         elsewhere.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hunting communities that have so far lived off the North Water’s resources of
         marine mammals, as well as available game on the coastal lands, such as reindeer (
         <span>Rangifer tarandus</span>) and muskox (
         <span>Ovibus moschatus</span>), not to speak of seabirds, are also acutely aware of the national and international
         protection schemes that no longer give them free access to game, undermining Freeman’s
         and Anderies’ foraging-effort model and the dynamics of hunter-gatherer intensification.
         Intensification is not an option; hunting is restricted by quotas on all the big marine
         mammals (except the seals) in the interest of (international) species protection and
         sustainable use of the living resources. This takes us back to the issue of governance,
         which is an important part of any socio-ecological system and decisive as far as the
         High Arctic system is concerned. “Governance is a social function involving the establishment
         and administration of assemblages of rights, rules, and decision-making procedures
         intended to steer socio-ecological systems towards pathways that are collectively
         desirable and away from pathways that are undesirable” (Young 
         <a>2012</a>, p. 78). The often-debated hunting management’s regimes, such as the induced quotas
         on marine mammals, are examples of such governance. This again alerts us to the slippery
         boundaries of the system, incorporating actors from far beyond the region—be they
         national agencies or global bodies, and ranging from the native Thule Law, in force
         from 1929 onwards, to UNCLOS, the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another ‘boundless’ source of impact upon the localised system immediately around
         the polynya is the changing ice cover in the entire region. The sea-ice, the ice arch
         and the coastal fast ice, is a defining element in the constitution of the North Water
         (Hastrup et al. 
         <a>2018</a>), and it forms the entire sea-ice community within and around it. This has been so
         ever since humans moved into the region some 4500 years ago. The dwindling fast ice
         has increasingly obvious repercussions on most species and on human–animal relations.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The polynya is an ice-free area at a time and a place where ice would be expected
         and where ice is being formed. The constant formation of ice and it being blown away
         are important for seeding the marine productivity that sustains the fish, marine mammals,
         birds, and humans of the region. In recent decades, the formation of the Ice arch
         has been more unreliable and the ice arch seems to break up earlier (Marchese et al.
         
         <a>2017</a>). Warming in the region reduces ice formation in the Nares Strait, which cause instability
         of the ice bridge and eventually the loss of it and thus the polynya, and that will
         potentially have large and negative consequences for the primary production of what
         is currently the North Water area (Marchese et al. 
         <a>2017</a>). Counter-intuitively, in the short term, it will lead to greater ice cover with
         drifting pack ice in spring as more pack ice will be drifting south from the Arctic
         Ocean as it happened in 2007 (Rasmussen et al. 
         <a>2011</a>). However, alternatively, an ice arch may form and block the ice flow 500 km further
         north, as it has been observed in 2009 (Vincent 
         <a>2013</a>) changing the system in yet another direction. With increasing temperature in Baffin
         Bay, new fish species will move northwards, leading to a significantly higher predation
         on the copepods that the Little Auk relies upon, which, combined with reduced primary
         production, will likely result in a major decline in their population and thus a decline
         in the fuelling of the land ecosystems with marine-derived nutrients. Greening may,
         therefore, decline, likely with a long legacy as the nutrients are washed out (as
         seen earlier in East Greenland), but accelerated by more precipitation falling as
         rain in a warmer future. This means less food for consumers such as muskoxen. In the
         long term, however, the land will, with further warming, be colonised by additional
         plants (Normand et al. 
         <a>2013</a>), perhaps, compensating for the loss of primary production on land and in freshwaters
         due to a decline in the population of Little Auk.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While physical and biological transformations are expected, though still somewhat
         uncertain in the details, it is much less certain that they are adequate in explaining
         shifts in the socio-ecological system. The issues of politics, power, and governance
         rapidly enter into the equation and muddle the picture. The sea will open up for new,
         year-round shipping routes, tourism, and other encroachments on the region, which
         at first may seem to open up new opportunities for economic gains, but which may soon
         bypass the hunters’ and their families’ services due to the difference in scale of
         action. About 750 people live in the entire Thule Region—half of whom are children,
         and all of whom are pondering the future of their community. The changing climate
         incurs certain costs, but budgets are limited. So far, the Greenlandic Self-Rule Government
         has given extensive subsidies to hunters in need of bigger and more reliable motorboats,
         now that they have to reach hunting grounds that, until 5 or 10 years ago, could be
         reached on dog sledge. How far can the government subsidise a kind of living that
         is not economically viable?
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The accelerated warming in the Arctic leading to rising costs of relief and investment
         in new climate-change proof infrastructures and other adaptive actions will soon make
         governments face a choice between a continuing support to increase the adaptive capacity
         of local, coastal communities, leaving them to their own devices or closing down some
         of the communities and move the inhabitants. Here, at the intersection between politics
         and economy, Huntington et al. (
         <a>2012</a>) suggest that another trade-off emerges between willingness and unwillingness to
         pay. “Regardless of who bears the cost, responding to climate change is not optional
         (e.g., Stern 
         <a>2007</a>). As the environment changes, society and its members will have to respond” (Huntington
         et al. 
         <a>2012</a>, p. 72). It may prove impossible not to change the socio-ecological system substantially.
         There is no way in which the attempts at redefining the Arctic as a natural reserve
         will effectively curb the threats from the outside (cf. Young 
         <a>2012</a>)—because the ‘outside’ is already implicated, and always has been, in the development
         of the North Water area.
