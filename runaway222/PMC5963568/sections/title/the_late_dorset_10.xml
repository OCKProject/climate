 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was during these centuries that Alaskan Inuit groups crossed the Mackenzie Delta and settled the eastern Arctic. It has been suggested that one of the most important drivers was the unique source of iron located in northern Melville Bay, i.e., the famous Cape York meteorites (McGhee 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">1984</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2009</a>). Judging by the layout of the early Inuit sites, the groups arriving were organised around a whale-boat owner (an 
  <span class="italic">umialik</span>), his crew, and their families. The winter sites generally had 3–8 winter dwellings (although larger numbers have been found) built from a combination of sod, boulders, and slabs, and various baleen whale bone elements. The dwellings had a separate kitchen niche containing an open fireplace. Most would have housed one or two nuclear families, but many of the sites had a separate, larger and different type of dwelling structure—the so-called Men’s houses, or 
  <span class="italic">qassi</span> (Holtved 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">1944</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1954</a>; McCullough 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">1989</a>). The finds from these Men’s houses often include substantial amounts of baleen, and besides housing various social functions, they seem to have functioned as workshops (Mønsted 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2016</a>). With the arrival of the Alaskan Inuit, we have the first evidence of the large seagoing vessels known as 
  <span class="italic">umiat</span> (sing. 
  <span class="italic">umiaq</span>) in the eastern Arctic. These boats were not only used as whaling boats but could carry considerable gear and about 10–12 people. 
  <span class="italic">Umiaq</span> construction demanded a relatively large amount of high-quality wood, and maintenance required an annual renewal of the skin cover, made from either bearded seal or female walrus (Petersen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">1986</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Judging by the radiocarbon dates available from the North Water area, there is little evidence of Men’s houses after the middle of the fifteenth century, and no direct evidence of the 
  <span class="italic">umiaq</span> is known from the area. Thus, it is likely that the 
  <span class="italic">umialik</span> institution disappeared from the North Water area at this time when also the ordinary winter dwellings lost their separate kitchen to be replaced by small niches in which the source of heat was blubber lamps. It thus seems likely that considerable social and economic transformations (a regime shift, Box 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>a or b scenario) took place in the fifteenth century. An important driver in these changes would have been a gradual exhaustion of the wood brought from Alaska and the local and limited sources of driftwood, owing to the expanding ice cover in the Baffin Bay during the Little Ice Age (Alix 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2016</a>; Hastrup et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2018</a>). Even if we do not have a sufficiently refined chronological control of the order of events that took place in prehistoric times, it does seem clear that a substantial amount of Inuit moved further south in Greenland to settle all areas from south of the Melville Bay to Cape Farewell, and then north into East Greenland during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century. From the early part of the fifteenth century, other groups of Thule Inuit moved northwards around Peary Land and then south into Northeast Greenland (Gulløv 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2004</a>; Sørensen and Gulløv 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the Alaskan Inuit first arrived in the North Water area (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), it had been inhabited since the eighth century by the Late Dorset people, as they are known in archaeology. The timing and character of the meetings between the Inuit and Late Dorset are still strongly debated (e.g., Friesen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2000</a>; Appelt et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2016</a>; Park 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR01" href="#CR01">2016</a>), but clearly the social organisation and technologies of the two groups were very different. The incoming Alaskan Inuit groups were in control of the long-distance exchange networks, from the fourteenth century onwards, including the exchange of meteoric iron to most parts of the Canadian Arctic (Appelt et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2016</a>). By this time, we see the complete disappearance of the Late Dorset groups, not only in the North Water Area but throughout the eastern Arctic (Appelt et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2016</a>). It seems likely that their disappearance is in part the result of the arrival of the Inuit (Friesen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2000</a>; Appelt 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2004</a>), and it has been suggested that the Alaskan Inuit may have—unknowingly—exposed the Late Dorset groups to diseases to which their immune system had no defence, i.e., in epidemiological terms, the Late Dorset groups would have been a “virgin population” (Agger and Maschner 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2009</a>) (Box 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>a scenario).
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A third party was involved in these meetings, namely the Norse. We do not know what the frequency and extent of these meetings were, but we do know that they took place sometime in the late thirteenth and fourteenth century and that Norse artefacts from these meetings are distributed across at least nine different Inuit sites (Holtved 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">1944</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1954</a>; Schledermann 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">1980</a>; McCullough 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">1989</a>; LeMoine and Darwent 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2010</a>; Grønnow et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2016</a>) and one of the Late Dorset sites (Appelt et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">1998</a>). The Norse presence in the North Water area would have made it clear to the Alaskan Inuit groups that they had to go further south for supplies of, among other items, wood and iron.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the Late Dorset groups, the arrival of the Inuit meant that they and their lifestyle vanished—a rapid transformation within a century. For the Inuit arriving in the region of the North Water area, it opened numerous rich and diverse resource spaces allowing them to continue most of their Alaskan lifestyle. However, after just one or two centuries, this would no longer have been viable. A major driver in this process is likely to have been a gradual exhaustion of wood supplies, as mentioned above, and/or a change in the timing and migration routes of the large whales in the North Water, which could be due to the onset of the Little Ice Age by the early fifteenth century. The situation was, however, buffered by moving into new lands—further south—which they came to fully utilise after the disappearance of the Norse in the middle of the fifteenth century.</p>
