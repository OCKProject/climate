         and resistance in the societies and ecological systems as well as in interactions
         between societies and ecosystems—embraced in the term socio-ecological system, to
         which we shall return later. In this section, we provide some examples from the North

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was during these centuries that Alaskan Inuit groups crossed the Mackenzie Delta
            and settled the eastern Arctic. It has been suggested that one of the most important
            drivers was the unique source of iron located in northern Melville Bay, i.e., the
            famous Cape York meteorites (McGhee 
            <a>1984</a>, 
            <a>2009</a>). Judging by the layout of the early Inuit sites, the groups arriving were organised
            around a whale-boat owner (an 
            <span>umialik</span>), his crew, and their families. The winter sites generally had 3–8 winter dwellings
            (although larger numbers have been found) built from a combination of sod, boulders,
            and slabs, and various baleen whale bone elements. The dwellings had a separate kitchen
            niche containing an open fireplace. Most would have housed one or two nuclear families,
            but many of the sites had a separate, larger and different type of dwelling structure—the
            so-called Men’s houses, or 
            <span>qassi</span> (Holtved 
            <a>1944</a>, 
            <a>1954</a>; McCullough 
            <a>1989</a>). The finds from these Men’s houses often include substantial amounts of baleen,
            and besides housing various social functions, they seem to have functioned as workshops
            (Mønsted 
            <a>2016</a>). With the arrival of the Alaskan Inuit, we have the first evidence of the large
            seagoing vessels known as 
            <span>umiat</span> (sing. 
            <span>umiaq</span>) in the eastern Arctic. These boats were not only used as whaling boats but could
            carry considerable gear and about 10–12 people. 
            <span>Umiaq</span> construction demanded a relatively large amount of high-quality wood, and maintenance
            required an annual renewal of the skin cover, made from either bearded seal or female
            walrus (Petersen 
            <a>1986</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Judging by the radiocarbon dates available from the North Water area, there is little
            evidence of Men’s houses after the middle of the fifteenth century, and no direct
            evidence of the 
            <span>umiaq</span> is known from the area. Thus, it is likely that the 
            <span>umialik</span> institution disappeared from the North Water area at this time when also the ordinary
            winter dwellings lost their separate kitchen to be replaced by small niches in which
            the source of heat was blubber lamps. It thus seems likely that considerable social
            and economic transformations (a regime shift, Box 
            <a>1</a>, Fig. 
            <a>1</a>a or b scenario) took place in the fifteenth century. An important driver in these
            changes would have been a gradual exhaustion of the wood brought from Alaska and the
            local and limited sources of driftwood, owing to the expanding ice cover in the Baffin
            Bay during the Little Ice Age (Alix 
            <a>2016</a>; Hastrup et al. 
            <a>2018</a>). Even if we do not have a sufficiently refined chronological control of the order
            of events that took place in prehistoric times, it does seem clear that a substantial
            amount of Inuit moved further south in Greenland to settle all areas from south of
            the Melville Bay to Cape Farewell, and then north into East Greenland during the late
            thirteenth and early fourteenth century. From the early part of the fifteenth century,
            other groups of Thule Inuit moved northwards around Peary Land and then south into
            Northeast Greenland (Gulløv 
            <a>2004</a>; Sørensen and Gulløv 
            <a>2012</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the Alaskan Inuit first arrived in the North Water area (Fig. 
            <a>2</a>), it had been inhabited since the eighth century by the Late Dorset people, as they
            are known in archaeology. The timing and character of the meetings between the Inuit
            and Late Dorset are still strongly debated (e.g., Friesen 
            <a>2000</a>; Appelt et al. 
            <a>2016</a>; Park 
            <a>2016</a>), but clearly the social organisation and technologies of the two groups were very
            different. The incoming Alaskan Inuit groups were in control of the long-distance
            exchange networks, from the fourteenth century onwards, including the exchange of
            meteoric iron to most parts of the Canadian Arctic (Appelt et al. 
            <a>2016</a>). By this time, we see the complete disappearance of the Late Dorset groups, not
            only in the North Water Area but throughout the eastern Arctic (Appelt et al. 
            <a>2016</a>). It seems likely that their disappearance is in part the result of the arrival of
            the Inuit (Friesen 
            <a>2000</a>; Appelt 
            <a>2004</a>), and it has been suggested that the Alaskan Inuit may have—unknowingly—exposed the
            Late Dorset groups to diseases to which their immune system had no defence, i.e.,
            in epidemiological terms, the Late Dorset groups would have been a “virgin population”
            (Agger and Maschner 
            <a>2009</a>) (Box 
            <a>1</a>, Fig. 
            <a>1</a>a scenario).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A third party was involved in these meetings, namely the Norse. We do not know what
            the frequency and extent of these meetings were, but we do know that they took place
            sometime in the late thirteenth and fourteenth century and that Norse artefacts from
            these meetings are distributed across at least nine different Inuit sites (Holtved
            
            <a>1944</a>, 
            <a>1954</a>; Schledermann 
            <a>1980</a>; McCullough 
            <a>1989</a>; LeMoine and Darwent 
            <a>2010</a>; Grønnow et al. 
            <a>2016</a>) and one of the Late Dorset sites (Appelt et al. 
            <a>1998</a>). The Norse presence in the North Water area would have made it clear to the Alaskan
            Inuit groups that they had to go further south for supplies of, among other items,
            wood and iron.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the Late Dorset groups, the arrival of the Inuit meant that they and their lifestyle
            vanished—a rapid transformation within a century. For the Inuit arriving in the region
            of the North Water area, it opened numerous rich and diverse resource spaces allowing
            them to continue most of their Alaskan lifestyle. However, after just one or two centuries,
            this would no longer have been viable. A major driver in this process is likely to
            have been a gradual exhaustion of wood supplies, as mentioned above, and/or a change
            in the timing and migration routes of the large whales in the North Water, which could
            be due to the onset of the Little Ice Age by the early fifteenth century. The situation
            was, however, buffered by moving into new lands—further south—which they came to fully
            utilise after the disappearance of the Norse in the middle of the fifteenth century.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While we have little data from the North Water area on the effects of Thule Inuit
            on the local ecosystems, paleolimnological and archaeological data collected from
            the Canadian Arctic suggest that the whaling activities of the Thule Inuit altered
            freshwater ecosystems markedly. For example, using paleolimnological approaches, Douglas
            et al. (
            <a>2004</a>) and Hadley et al. (
            <a>2010a</a>, 
            <a>b</a>) revealed that the Thule winter settlement on Somerset Island, south-eastern Bathurst
            Island, and on east-central Ellesmere Island (Nunavut, Arctic Canada), respectively,
            led to marked ecological changes in pond ecology due to excess nutrient input (eutrophication)
            from the Thule Inuit activities.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using a comparative approach, Hadley et al. (
            <a>2010a</a>) recorded striking ecological changes in diatom species assemblages, spectrally inferred
            primary production and nutrient geochemistry, indicating nutrient enrichment and eutrophication
            in a small pond draining 16 Thule Inuit whale houses, whilst an adjacent pond with
            only five whale houses recorded only minimal changes (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>). Input of marine-derived nutrients from sea mammal carcasses used by the Thule Inuit
            for food and construction of winter settlements, and other human activities, coincided
            with a notable increase in a eutrophic diatom taxon. Although the diatom changes recorded
            in the affected site persisted for some time after the period and Thule occupation,
            indicating relatively strong resilience, the most recent sediments and water chemistry
            suggest that the pond has now, however, partly recovered to near pre-impact conditions
            (Hadley et al. 
            <a>2010a</a>) (Box 
            <a>1</a>, Fig.

                     diatom species composition, δ

                     <span>a</span> from two similar ponds on Bathurst Island, only a few metres apart. However, Pond
                     B-AO (above) had only 5 Thule whalebone houses in its catchment, whilst Pond B-AP
                     (below) had 16 houses. The more affected pond clearly documents the limnological response
                     of the whalers. For example, the diatom 
                     <span>Stephanodiscus minutulus</span> is a well-known indicator of elevated nutrient conditions (modified from Hadley et
                     al. 
                     <a>2010a</a>)

         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of the Dorset culture on the pond ecosystem can also be recorded in the
            paleolimnological record. Michelutti et al. (
            <a>2013</a>) analysed sediment cores from seven ponds on the south-western coast of Baffin Island,
            Nunavut, covering a gradient of the intensity of past human activity in their catchments.
            The study area was, prior to the historic Inuit occupation, extensively inhabited
            by Thule culture Inuit (ca. 12–16th century) and by an earlier Arctic group, the Dorset
            culture Palaeo-Eskimos (ca. 500 BC—fifth century) and their predecessors from a period
            as early as 2500 BC. The authors found that the degree of eutrophication in these
            freshwater ponds depended on the length of the occupation as well as the amount and
            type of marine mammals taken as primary prey items (e.g., whales, walrus, or seals).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to the Thule examples noted above, the limnological effects of Dorset sealing
            activities were clearly demarked in the sediment record. For example, Tanfield-1 is
            a pond adjacent to a Dorset archaeological excavation and the sediment record clearly
            identified the effects of past sealing and other Dorset activities by elevated δ
            <span>15</span>N and changes in diatom assemblages near the base of the core (Fig. 
            <a>4</a>, above). A nearby control pond (Tanfield-2), outside the influence of the Dorset,
            recorded no similar changes (Michelutti et al. 
            <a>2013</a>). Meanwhile, sediment cores collected near the so-called Dorset “longhouses”, such
            as Juet-1 (Fig. 
            <a>4</a>, below), believed to be locations of periodic seasonal gatherings, did not register
            any evidence of eutrophication, reflecting the shorter, less intensive nature of these
            occupations. Due to slow rates of decomposition, nutrients from butchered marine animal
            bones continue to influence the freshwater sites into which they drain, as evidenced
            by higher than typical nutrient- and production-related water chemistry variables
            (Douglas et al. 
            <a>2004</a>; Hadley et al. 
            <a>2010a</a>, 
            <a>b</a>; Michelutti et al. 
            <a>2013</a>). These examples show the mutual impact of the partners in what emerges as a truly
            
            <span>socio</span>-
            <span>ecological</span> system.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historical drivers and resistance, the story of Qillarsuaq</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apart from the environmental drivers of change, human, social, or cultural factors
            must also be taken into account—as we saw in the example above. In an article on population
            movements in the Canadian Arctic, the Canadian anthropologist Susan Rowley (
            <a>1985</a>) provides a systematic analysis of 25 historically and/or orally documented large-scale
            Inuit population movements. In six cases, the driver behind the movement is likely
            either famine or epidemic diseases (Box 
            <a>1</a>, Fig. 
            <a>1</a>a or b scenario, depending on whether these diseases appeared once or got gradually
            worse), and in a seventh case a natural disaster. Rowley suggests that in 10 cases,
            the impetus has to be found in what she calls social pressures, chief among which
            was fear of revenge.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The best documented case of direct relevance to our study area is that of the travels
            of the famous Qillarsuaq, who eventually had a major effect on the lives of people
            in the North Water area (Gilberg 
            <a>1976</a>; Ulloriaq 
            <a>1985</a>; Mary-Rousselière 
            <a>2002</a>; see also Hastrup et al. 
            <a>2018</a>). Qillarsuaq’s long journey seems to have begun with a killing in southern Baffin
            Island in the early 1840s. Having lived for a while in the Pond Inlet region, Qillarsuaq
            got into a conflict during which he committed a second murder, and after fleeing,
            he headed north and eventually joined up with Inughuit in Inglefield Land in the early
            1860s. Some 6 years later, he decided to leave Greenland, after having taken part
            in the killing of a powerful local hunter and angakok (”shaman”). Qillarsuaq died
            shortly after leaving Greenland.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even though this case revolves around Qillarsuaq, it originally included some 50–60
            people leaving Pond Inlet, of which the larger part died during the journeys across
            rarely travelled parts of Devon Island and Ellesmere Island. The historical sources
            do not provide an insight into whether or not gradually increasing social tensions
            had been building in Pond Inlet prior to Qillarsuaq’s arrival, but the resulting social
            and economic effects on the community in Pond Inlet must have been substantial as
            the movement included an estimated quarter or third of the total population in the
            area. It is, however, clear that the arrival of the group led by Qillarsuaq resulted
            in significant changes in the life among the Inughuit. The Baffin Island group (re-)introduced
            a number of technologies—the kayak, the 
            <span>umiaq</span>, the use of bow and arrow, and of fishing hooks and leisters—that resulted in a dramatic
            expansion of the resource base of the Inughuit. Only a decade earlier, prior to the
            arrival of the group, serious concerns about the survival of the Inughuit were expressed
            by both British explorers in the area and by indigenous people themselves, with, perhaps,
            the entire population amounting to 100–140 persons (Kane 
            <a>1856</a>; Hayes 
            <a>1867</a>, quoted in Gilberg (
            <a>1976</a>)). Just a generation later, due to the immigration of the Baffin islanders, the population
            seems to have increased to a more viable minimum at about 220–250 people (Gilberg
            
            <a>1976</a>), thus being an example of openness creating a more robust, or resilient, community.
            Given his brief sojourn, it was, indeed, a fast transition.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to Qillersuaq, the arrival of John Ross and his crew in 1818 also made a great
            impact in the Thule region; the arrival marked the first historically known meeting
            between Europeans and Inughuit (Ross 
            <a>1819</a>). Ross noted that the Inughuit did not have any kayaks or 
            <span>umiaqs</span> nor possessed knowledge of how to build these. His interpreter, Sakæus, was told
            that the knowledge was lost following a series of deaths of the people who knew how
            to build them many years earlier. He was also told that the Inughuit had no contact
            with other people, either to the south or to the west. Sakæus was surprised to see
            that dog sledges were made of bone and antler without the use of wood. These examples
            follow a Box 
            <a>1</a>, Fig. 
            <a>1</a>e scenario. Following immediately in the wake of Ross, the North Water and Inughuit
            were visited by primarily Scottish whaling ships that not only managed to wipe out
            the entire baleen whale population in the North Water by the turn of the twentieth
            century but also (along with British explorers) brought an (uneven) stream of European
            products into the area (Gilberg 
            <a>1976</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is highly likely that the very low population number recorded in the 1850s and
            1860s was a direct result of various diseases introduced by Europeans into the, in
            epidemiological terms, “virgin” Inughuit population, as we see in later more well-documented
            cases. Historical sources thus suggest that 10 to 20% of the Inughuit population died
            from each of a series of epidemics starting around 1880, and occurring in 1895–96,
            1901–02, 1909–10, 1920–21, 1928–29, 1932, 1945, 1948–49, and 1955 (Gilberg 
            <a>1976</a>, p. 27–30).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When combining the information contained in the records on the Inughuit community,
            it is plausible that the main drivers in the erosion of the Inughuit society in the
            early nineteenth century were epidemics and isolation. While the lack of several technologies
            reduced the resource spaces available to the Inughuit community, this seems to have
            been overcome by intensifying the harvest of an otherwise secondary resource, Little
            Auk (
            <span>Alle alle</span>), thus acting as a buffer. The widening of resource spaces with the arrival of Qillarsuaq
            and his group seems to have been sufficient to act as a resistance preventing the
            passing of a tipping point that would, otherwise, have led to the extinction of the
            Inughuit.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The arrival of the Little Auk transformed the local ecosystems</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Little Auk was not only a food buffer for local people, creating social resilience
            and preventing extinction; it was also a key ecosystem engineer shaping the terrestrial
            and freshwater ecosystems along the Greenlandic coast in the North Water area and
            elsewhere within its breeding range. The Little Auk promotes the assimilation of marine-derived
            nutrients in terrestrial and aquatic biota and boosts primary productivity, which
            in turn has profound effects on a range of biogeochemical processes in the ecosystems
            involved (González-Bergonzoni et al. 
            <a>2017</a>; Mosbech et al. 
            <a>2018</a>).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The formation of the polynya itself may be a classic example of a tipping point (Box
            
            <a>1</a>, Fig. 
            <a>1</a>b scenario). The North Water polynya relies upon the formation of the ice bridge or
            ice arc at the north end of Baffin Bay in Smith Sound in the Nares Strait. This stable
            ice bridge prevents pack ice from being blown south by the prevailing northern wind
            into Baffin Bay. In addition, new ice formed south of the ice bridge is blown further
            south, creating open water, and as dense salt water forms during ice creation, the
            dense salt water sinks and help creating entrainment of deeper water with nutrients
            to the photic zone. Lower spring temperatures would lead to the formation or persistence
            of the ice bridge allowing the North Water polynya to form. Therefore, a relatively
            small change in temperature might lead to a profound alteration of the environment
            and ecosystems (Box 
            <a>1</a>, Fig. 
            <a>1</a>b scenario). Davidson et al. (
            <a>2018</a>) suggest that the first arrival of the Little Auk at around 4400 cal years BP signals
            the genesis of the North Water polynya (Fig. 
            <a>5</a>). This coincides with falling temperatures at the end of the Holocene climate optimum;
            thus, it appears that a cooling climate counter-intuitively led to a longer period
            of open water and formation of large amounts of ice, but the ice was blown south,
            which resulted in the formation of the productive polynya. The effects of this relatively
            small change in temperature may have reverberated ever further in the ecosystem as
            the arrival of humans in the region is also first recorded at this time.
            
            <div><span>Fig. 5</span><div>
                  <p>Sediment core collected from the lake within a large bird colony at Salve Ø. It shows
                     the stepwise change in the characteristics of the lake ecosystem. The change was very
                     rapid, showing a total change in sediment chemistry within less than a cm, corresponding
                     to less than 30 years. The stable isotopes of C and N are in permille, organic content
                     is loss of ignition in %, N is percent of organic matter and C:N ratio is calculated
                     by weight (modified from Davidson et al. 
                     <a>2018</a>)

         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A sediment core from Salve Ø also revealed that the Little Auk arrival between 3945
            and 3575 cal BP translated into rapid change in the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
            in the colonisation areas/catchments (Davidson et al. 
            <a>2018</a>). If Little Auk again disappears in the North Water Area, the bird-influenced systems
            will expectedly recover to their former state, though with a very significant delay
            (Box 
            <a>1</a>, Fig. 
            <a>1</a>d scenario). This is evident from a sediment core from Raffles Ø, off Liverpool Land,
            East Greenland, covering the past 10 000 years. Here, the seabird populations—mainly
            consisting of Little Auk—have varied substantially during the Holocene as judged from
            the concentration of cadmium, total nitrogen, and organic matter in the sediment.
            Large seabird breeding colonies were present between 7500 cal BP and 1900 cal BP,
            from 1000 to 500 cal BP and since circa 100 cal BP, their presence/absence being dependent
            on the feeding conditions close to Raffles Ø (sea-ice cover) and/or the degree of
            a sufficiently long breeding season due to climate conditions (Wagner and Melles 
            <a>2001</a>). In between these periods, the concentrations of total nitrogen and organic matter
            declined to pre-bird conditions, in this case, suggesting a relatively fast recovery.
