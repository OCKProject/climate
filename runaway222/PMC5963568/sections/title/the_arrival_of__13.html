      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Little Auk was not only a food buffer for local people, creating social resilience
         and preventing extinction; it was also a key ecosystem engineer shaping the terrestrial
         and freshwater ecosystems along the Greenlandic coast in the North Water area and
         elsewhere within its breeding range. The Little Auk promotes the assimilation of marine-derived
         nutrients in terrestrial and aquatic biota and boosts primary productivity, which
         in turn has profound effects on a range of biogeochemical processes in the ecosystems
         involved (González-Bergonzoni et al. 
         <a>2017</a>; Mosbech et al. 
         <a>2018</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The formation of the polynya itself may be a classic example of a tipping point (Box
         
         <a>1</a>, Fig. 
         <a>1</a>b scenario). The North Water polynya relies upon the formation of the ice bridge or
         ice arc at the north end of Baffin Bay in Smith Sound in the Nares Strait. This stable
         ice bridge prevents pack ice from being blown south by the prevailing northern wind
         into Baffin Bay. In addition, new ice formed south of the ice bridge is blown further
         south, creating open water, and as dense salt water forms during ice creation, the
         dense salt water sinks and help creating entrainment of deeper water with nutrients
         to the photic zone. Lower spring temperatures would lead to the formation or persistence
         of the ice bridge allowing the North Water polynya to form. Therefore, a relatively
         small change in temperature might lead to a profound alteration of the environment
         and ecosystems (Box 
         <a>1</a>, Fig. 
         <a>1</a>b scenario). Davidson et al. (
         <a>2018</a>) suggest that the first arrival of the Little Auk at around 4400 cal years BP signals
         the genesis of the North Water polynya (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). This coincides with falling temperatures at the end of the Holocene climate optimum;
         thus, it appears that a cooling climate counter-intuitively led to a longer period
         of open water and formation of large amounts of ice, but the ice was blown south,
         which resulted in the formation of the productive polynya. The effects of this relatively
         small change in temperature may have reverberated ever further in the ecosystem as
         the arrival of humans in the region is also first recorded at this time.

               <p>Sediment core collected from the lake within a large bird colony at Salve Ø. It shows
                  the stepwise change in the characteristics of the lake ecosystem. The change was very
                  rapid, showing a total change in sediment chemistry within less than a cm, corresponding
                  to less than 30 years. The stable isotopes of C and N are in permille, organic content
                  is loss of ignition in %, N is percent of organic matter and C:N ratio is calculated
                  by weight (modified from Davidson et al. 
                  <a>2018</a>)
                  
               </p>

         </div>
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A sediment core from Salve Ø also revealed that the Little Auk arrival between 3945
         and 3575 cal BP translated into rapid change in the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
         in the colonisation areas/catchments (Davidson et al. 
         <a>2018</a>). If Little Auk again disappears in the North Water Area, the bird-influenced systems
         will expectedly recover to their former state, though with a very significant delay
         (Box 
         <a>1</a>, Fig. 
         <a>1</a>d scenario). This is evident from a sediment core from Raffles Ø, off Liverpool Land,
         East Greenland, covering the past 10 000 years. Here, the seabird populations—mainly
         consisting of Little Auk—have varied substantially during the Holocene as judged from
         the concentration of cadmium, total nitrogen, and organic matter in the sediment.
         Large seabird breeding colonies were present between 7500 cal BP and 1900 cal BP,
         from 1000 to 500 cal BP and since circa 100 cal BP, their presence/absence being dependent
         on the feeding conditions close to Raffles Ø (sea-ice cover) and/or the degree of
         a sufficiently long breeding season due to climate conditions (Wagner and Melles 
         <a>2001</a>). In between these periods, the concentrations of total nitrogen and organic matter
         declined to pre-bird conditions, in this case, suggesting a relatively fast recovery.
