               <td>Ecological regime shifts can be defined as abrupt transformations (regime shifts)
                  leading to ecosystem reconfiguration. These shifts are generally thought to be driven
                  by external perturbations (e.g., climatic fluctuations, overexploitation, eutrophication,
                  etc.). There are at least five ways in which an ecological system can exhibit abrupt
                  changes over time; two are directly reversible in response to changes in environmental
                  drivers, and three show resilience of different degree (Fig. 
                  <a>1</a>). An abrupt shift may occur if the key driver(s) show abrupt shifts or it may occur
                  with gradual changes in drivers when a tipping point is reached. In the latter and
                  only the latter case, we can talk about a critical transition, a term that has become
                  misused across disciplines. Thus, an abrupt change is a necessity, but not a sufficient
                  condition for demonstrating critical transitions and defining tipping points, as the
                  change might simply be driven by sudden changes in the main drivers of the systems
