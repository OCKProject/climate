 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the end of the experiment, all pots of each treatment were harvested to measure response characteristics (morphological characteristics and biomass). Leaf number and plant height were measured before harvest. Leaf area per plant was measured with a WinFOLIA system to measure the area of the blade part per plant (WinRHIZO, Regent Instruments). Plants were separated into three parts to harvest: leaf, stem, and root, and dried at 80°C to a constant weight, then weighted to get aboveground (leaf and stem) and belowground (root) biomass separately. Growth indices per plant were calculated as follows: specific leaf area (SLA; cm
  <span class="sup">2</span>/kg) = leaf area/leaf biomass; leaf area ratio (LAR; cm
  <span class="sup">2</span>/kg) = leaf area/plant total biomass; and root–shoot ratio (R/S) = belowground biomass/aboveground biomass.
