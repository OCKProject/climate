 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Precipitation is one of the main climatic factors restricting the growth of plants in arid and semiarid areas, and various characteristics are impacted differently by changes in precipitation (Maréchaux et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0033">2015</a>; Wertin et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0053">2015</a>). This study showed that changes in precipitation significantly affect the response characteristics of four 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species in the China steppe (Table 
  <a rid="ece35452-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" href="#ece35452-tbl-0003">3</a> and Figure 
  <a rid="ece35452-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35452-fig-0003">3</a>), but differences existed between the different plant species. Under the ambient temperature treatment (T0), all the four grasses showed no or modest responses to changes in precipitation. Growth strategy traits (R/S and SLA, Figure 
  <a rid="ece35452-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35452-fig-0003">3</a>) showed strongest sensitivity to changes in precipitation, indicating that 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species may adapt their growth under precipitation variability by altering their allocation of above/belowground growth under ambient temperatures, as previously reported (Chapin et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0010">1987</a>; Xu et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0058">2014</a>). 
  <span class="italic">S. baicalensis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">S. grandis</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">S. breviflora</span> showed gradually declining responses to precipitation variability under the ambient temperature (Table 
  <a rid="ece35452-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" href="#ece35452-tbl-0004">4</a>), which reflected the east‐to‐west precipitation gradients in their respective native areas in the steppes of Inner Mongolia (Qi et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0041">2010</a>). Under the warming by 1.5 and 2.0°C, the responses of the four 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species to precipitation variability increased to varying degrees. 
  <span class="italic">S. bungeana</span> was the most precipitation‐sensitive of the four species under ambient and warming (Table 
  <a rid="ece35452-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" href="#ece35452-tbl-0004">4</a>), which is probably related to its semiarid warm temperate steppe habitat and the resulting higher requirements for precipitation and temperature (Hu, Zhou, Li, Wu, &amp; Wang, 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0019">2013</a>). With a 1.5°C increase in temperature, the response of 
  <span class="italic">S. breviflora</span> was more sensitive to precipitation variability than 
  <span class="italic">S. baicalensis</span>, but the opposite with a 2.0°C increase (Table 
  <a rid="ece35452-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" href="#ece35452-tbl-0004">4</a>). So the sensitive characteristics of 
  <span class="italic">S. breviflora</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. baicalensis</span> could indicate the increased range of temperature. When exposed to warming, leaf area and biomass, which reflect the production capacity, were the most sensitive traits in 
  <span class="italic">S. breviflora</span>, 
  <span class="italic">S. baicalensis</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">S. grandis</span>, while R/S was the most sensitive trait in 
  <span class="italic">S. bungeana</span> (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35452-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35452-fig-0003">3</a>). This, to some extent, reflected the differences between the four species in their biological characteristics and sensitivity to precipitation, and supports the previous studies that showed that the tissues with the greatest response to changes in precipitation varied between species (Shafran‐Nathan et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0045">2013</a>; Wright et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0055">2004</a>). These findings also further indicated that the evaluation of plant responses to water stress based on a single trait is inaccurate. Species‐specific trait differences in sensitivity to changing precipitation are likely the primary reason why the four grasses occupy different ecological niches, and grow in different regions of the Inner Mongolia steppe (Cowlin et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0011">2015</a>; Donovan, Maherali, Caruso, Huber, &amp; Kroon, 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0014">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in functional traits to precipitation variability not only have significant influence on the final biomass of plants, but also are a reflection of plant growth strategy to changing environment (Brunner et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0007">2015</a>; Chapin et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0010">1987</a>; Li et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0026">2015</a>). The results of a principal component analysis could explain the different trade‐off strategies of the 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35452-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35452-fig-0004">4</a>). This study found that the first principal component of these four species incorporated their production capacity and morphological characters and the second principal component mainly reflected the allocation capacity of resources. This reflected that the common adaptation strategy of the four 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> plants in coping with hydrothermal changes may be to change the leaf size and biomass accumulation firstly, and this change will change the distribution of aboveground and underground resources, thus ensuring the maximum growth of individuals (Wright et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0055">2004</a>). The four 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> plants were distributed on different scoring axes of the principal components, which indicated that the trade‐off adaptation strategies adopted between their functional traits were different when dealing with the combined changes in temperature and precipitation, and this was the reasons for different adaptability to hydrothermal changes and mainly distributed in different grassland types (Donovan et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0014">2011</a>). 
  <span class="italic">S. breviflora</span> mainly favored the survival strategy of thick leaves and large root–shoot ratio to adapt to the arid and semiarid desert grassland environment, but 
  <span class="italic">S. baicalensis</span> tended to choose the survival strategy of thin leaves and smaller root–shoot ratio. Both species reduced water dispersion by changing the thickness of the blade (Bret‐harte et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0005">2001</a>) and change the allocation of resources on the aboveground/underground to adapt to the larger temperature and precipitation ranges. 
  <span class="italic">S. bungeana</span> tended to choose a strategy to reduce leaf area and increase underground growth, but 
  <span class="italic">S. grandis</span> chose the survival strategy to increase leaf area and aboveground growth. Also, the survival strategies of the two species were also changing the allocation of resources on aboveground/underground to adapt to their corresponding living environment. Through the response of different functional traits to changes in temperature and precipitation, the four 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species would choose different trade‐off adaptation strategies to adapt to environmental changes, which further indicates that when assessing the impact of future climate change on grassland ecosystems, we should pay attention on the differences in sensitivity and adaptability of functional traits and their contribution to individual growth in responding to changing temperature and precipitation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, total biomass showed large variation across these two major principal components (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35452-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35452-fig-0004">4</a>a), and therefore by the different responses of the various characteristics, as previously reported (Lanari, Silvestroni, Palliotti, Green, &amp; Sabbatini, 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0024">2015</a>; Wright et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0055">2004</a>). The functional traits that significantly influenced the total biomass of the four grasses were LA, R/S, SLA, and LAR (Table 
  <a rid="ece35452-tbl-0005" ref-type="table" href="#ece35452-tbl-0005">5</a>), mainly reflecting on the growth allocation strategy. The functional traits had different direct and indirect contributions to the total biomass of the 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> plants, indicating their varied biological effects (Hu, Liu, Li, Lu, &amp; Gao, 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0018">2014</a>). This corresponded to the distribution of the four 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species in the different score axes of the principle component analyses, indicating that, under changes in precipitation, their different trade‐off adaptive strategies would be achieved through their response characteristics, which influence their total biomass. This was a reflection of their different adaptabilities to precipitation changes (Donovan et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0014">2011</a>; Xu et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0058">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plant biomass is a combined product of photosynthesis and respiration, reflecting the comprehensive response of plants to changing environmental factors (Andresen et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0001">2017</a>; Myneni, Keeling, Tucker, Asrar, &amp; Nemani, 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0036">1997</a>), and is also the main research focus in steppe studies (Manea et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0032">2016</a>). Studies of the critical precipitation threshold of the four grasses would help to determine how steppe plants adapt to changing climates. This study found that the total biomass responses to changing precipitation were parabolic in 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35452-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35452-fig-0006">6</a>), indicating the existence of a critical point where the total biomass was significantly affected by precipitation variability. That was to say, 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> plants were therefore adapted to an optimum precipitation threshold, and deviations from this value will inhibit their growth (Badger, Björkman, &amp; Armond, 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0002">2006</a>; Xu &amp; Zhou, 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0059">2011</a>). Under ambient temperatures, the optimum precipitation was lower than the actual precipitation of June to August recorded from 1978 to 2007 when the total biomass of the 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> plants (except 
  <span class="italic">S. grandis</span>) reached their highest values (Table 
  <a rid="ece35452-tbl-0007" ref-type="table" href="#ece35452-tbl-0007">7</a>), illustrating that a certain degree of precipitation reduction might not affect the growth of the 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species (except 
  <span class="italic">S. grandis</span>). The drought thresholds of total biomass in 
  <span class="italic">S. bungeana</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. grandis</span> were 113 and 163 mm, respectively, which were 54% and 13% lower than the ambient precipitation. This result corresponded to the lower limits of precipitation (104 and 179 mm) in the potential distribution areas of 
  <span class="italic">S. bungeana</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. grandis</span>, calculated by Zhou, He, and Yin (
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0062">2015</a>) using the MaxEnt model. These indicated that, under ambient temperatures, a certain decrease in precipitation during the growing season (28%, 41%, 5%, and 14% decreases relative to the ambient precipitation for 
  <span class="italic">S. baicalensis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">S. grandis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">S. breviflora</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">S. bungeana</span>, respectively) can increase 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> plant biomass, which may also reflect their adaptation to slightly arid environments (Fariaszewska et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0015">2017</a>). Under warming condition, the optimum precipitation (the amount of precipitation required when total biomass reaches its maximum) for total biomass in the four grasses was higher than the ambient precipitation. This may because warmer temperatures would lead to increased available soil moisture via higher evaporation rates from soil (De Boeck et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0013">2008</a>) and higher precipitation can relieve the effect of warming on these plants (Li et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0027">2017</a>). Under the warming by 1.5°C, the critical precipitation thresholds of total biomass were significantly increased in all four species. But the critical precipitation thresholds were decreased by 12%–28% (Table 
  <a rid="ece35452-tbl-0007" ref-type="table" href="#ece35452-tbl-0007">7</a>), indicating that a 1.5°C increase in temperature alongside a mild reduced precipitation would promote biomass accumulation rather than inhibit it. However, as warming 2.0°C, critical precipitation threshold of total biomass of 
  <span class="italic">S. grandis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. baicalensis</span> was decreased by 17% and 38%, respectively, compared with these in warming 1.5°C, while their critical precipitation thresholds were decreased by 6% and 11%. Also, the critical precipitation threshold of 
  <span class="italic">S. bungeana</span> was increased by 75% relative to T1 condition and did not change significantly in 
  <span class="italic">S. breviflora</span> (Table 
  <a rid="ece35452-tbl-0007" ref-type="table" href="#ece35452-tbl-0007">7</a>). Thus, 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> plants can better adapt to a certain degree of precipitation reduction if the temperature increase is limited to 1.5°C instead of 2.0°C. If the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C will be accomplished, this will increase the probability for sustained viability of the 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> steppes in the next 50–100 years (Guiot &amp; Cramer, 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0016">2016</a>; Mitchell et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0034">2016</a>; Pecl et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0039">2017</a>). It should be noted that this study used controlled experiments with seedlings of the four 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species under different temperature and precipitation treatments; thus, it is an important reference for understanding the growth of 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species under future climate changes. However, the growth of plants is comprehensively influenced by other factors, such as soil, topography, and human factors, so further studies with field observation experiments are also needed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, manipulation experiments were done under ambient and warming conditions with water variability, the response sensitivity of functional traits in the four 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species to water variability was relatively low in ambient temperature and increased in warming condition. R/S, SLA, and LA were the most response sensitive to water among all the functional traits and also made greater contribution to total biomass of the four grasses. The order of response sensitivity to water variability in the four species under ambient temperature treatment was ranked as follows: 
  <span class="italic">S. bungeana</span> &gt; 
  <span class="italic">S. baicalensis</span> &gt; 
  <span class="italic">S. grandis</span> &gt; 
  <span class="italic">S. breviflora</span>, while 
  <span class="italic">S. bungeana</span> had the greatest response sensitivity, and 
  <span class="italic">S. grandis</span> had the lowest response sensitivity under warming treatments. The 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species were able to adapt better to mild decreased water when temperatures increased by 1.5°C rather than 2.0°C, indicating that future climate change will be more deleterious to 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> growth (especially 
  <span class="italic">S. bungeana</span>) if temperatures rise by 2.0°C rather than by 1.5°C. These findings contribute to our understanding of grassland species responses to global climate change and may be useful in providing experimental evidence for the Paris agreement.
