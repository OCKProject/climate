 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A method for assessing sensitivity was applied to study the differed responses of functional traits to precipitation variability in the four 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species. The response coefficient, which also could be called plasticity index, was defined as the absolute value of the relative change in a functional trait per unit of precipitation change compared with ambient precipitation level. A higher response coefficient (plasticity index) indicates a more response sensitivity to precipitation variability of this functional trait (Luers, 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0029">2005</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The tipping point of the four 
  <span class="italic">Stipa</span> species responding to precipitation variability is defined as the very point when the total biomass starts to deviate significantly from those with sufficient water supply, resulting from a decline in precipitation amount below a critical level (Czajkowski, Ahrends, &amp; Bolte, 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0012">2009</a>; Thompson, Gallardo, Valdez, &amp; Fernández, 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0051">2007</a>). This method named as one‐side lower tolerance limits for normal population was newly adopted to identify the tipping point of total biomass in the four species. The tolerance interval is an estimated interval within which at least a certain proportion 
  <span class="italic">β</span> of the population falls at a given level of confidence γ; tolerance limit refers to either of the two endpoints of a tolerance interval (Krishnamoorthy &amp; Mathew, 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0023">2009</a>; Shi et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0046">2016</a>; Xu et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0057">2009</a>; Young, 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0061">2014</a>). The rigorous statistical definitions could be found in Young (
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0061">2014</a>). Computational formulas of tolerance intervals and limits for different distribution populations are provided by ISO 16269‐6(2005) (Xu et al., 
  <a rid="ece35452-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35452-bib-0057">2009</a>). Given the sampling methods of the experiment, formulas of one‐side lower tolerance limits for normal population with unknown variance and unknown mean were calculated as follows:

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between total biomass and precipitation under different temperatures was analyzed using a regression analysis. The tipping points of total biomass in the four species were further quantified by their values of critical water thresholds, which were calculated in terms of the tipping points and the quadratic polynomial regression models between total biomass and precipitation under ambient and warming temperature treatments for the four species (Equation 
  <a rid="ece35452-disp-0005" ref-type="disp-formula" href="#ece35452-disp-0005">5</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All collected data were processed using the statistical software SPSS 17.0 (SPSS) and Origin 9.0 (Origin Lab). Two‐way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to examine the effects of warming and precipitation variability. The differences between the means among the precipitation treatments were compared using Duncan's multiple range tests. The effects of different response characteristics on the plant biomass were analyzed using principal component and pathway analyses. All statistical significances were denoted at
