 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We applied an atmospheric chemistry–general circulation model to calculate the impacts of air pollution on climate and public health (

  </span>). The model comprehensively accounts for emissions, multiphase chemistry, and other processes that control atmospheric composition. Model results include concentrations of ozone (O
  <sub>3</sub>) and particulate matter, including PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> (particulates with a diameter &lt;2.5 µm), being the main cause of morbidity and mortality (
  <a rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" href="#r2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" href="#r9">9</a>). The results for PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> and O
  <sub>3</sub> served as input to the health impact calculations, based on the Global Burden of Disease methodology (
  <a rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" href="#r2">2</a>). We applied a Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) for PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> that is based on an unmatched large number of cohort studies in many countries, and accounts for additional causes of death than considered previously (
  <a rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" href="#r10">10</a>). The GEMM calculations were complemented with those for O
  <sub>3</sub>, accounting for about 3% of the total excess mortality rate. The atmospheric chemistry model was initially run for 20 y (excluding 5-y spin-up) with prescribed ocean temperatures to analyze health impacts and climate forcings, following IPCC recommendations (
  <a rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" href="#r11">11</a>), including changes in cloud reflectivity through the effects of aerosols on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) (
  <a rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" href="#r12">12</a>). Uniquely, we included the increase in CCN activity of aeolian (wind-blown) dust particles is due to interaction with air pollution (chemical “aging”), which generally increases their ability to take up water.

  </span> present the calculated aerosol radiative forcing of climate, which match the IPCC ensemble model estimates (
  <a rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" href="#r11">11</a>). Subsequently, the same model was rerun for 30-y periods (excluding 5-y spin-up) with an interactive ocean to compute equilibrium climate responses. We accounted for air pollution and greenhouse gases in idealized scenario calculations to characterize the public health and climate impacts of a hypothetical phaseout from fossil-fuel-related and other anthropogenic emissions, a distinction that could be essential for policy-making.
