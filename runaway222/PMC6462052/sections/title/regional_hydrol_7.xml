 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerous studies have addressed the causes of observed decreases in precipitation over tropical regions, and analyzed the influence of pollution aerosols on the monsoon circulation over South and East Asia, and to a lesser extent over Africa. An exhaustive review of the South and East Asian studies can be found in Li et al. (
  <a rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" href="#r34">34</a>). The basic inference has been that the radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gases is unlikely to account for the sign and magnitude of negative precipitation trends, associated with a weakening of the monsoon. Dominant factors are trends in sea-surface temperature (SST), particularly the asymmetric warming of the southern tropical oceans relative to the northern oceans. Two principal forcing mechanisms have been proposed. Interdecadal variability of SSTs; and the negative aerosol forcing (from direct and indirect effects) of the ocean surface, which is larger in the northern than the southern hemisphere. Further, the solar dimming from pollution aerosols reduces the land–ocean heating contrast (since pollution levels are highest over land areas), so that winds at the surface weaken and evaporation decreases, hence affecting the dominant drivers of the monsoon. There is compelling evidence that anthropogenic aerosol forcing explains most of the drying tendency in South Asia, also simulated by our model, and supported by observations (

  <a rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" href="#r39">39</a>), who modeled pollution-induced precipitation reductions over Southeast and Northeast Asia, triggered by aerosol cooling of the midlatitude sea surface. Likewise, in East Asia aerosol cooling over land reduces the thermal contrast with the ocean, and weakens the monsoon circulation (
  <a rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" href="#r40">40</a>). Further, it was found that the weakening monsoon contributes to the pollution haze in the Beijing area (
  <a rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" href="#r41">41</a>). Negative rainfall trends have been observed over Northeast China, enhanced by the aerosol forcing, which was not captured well by climate models in the past (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the Sahel, drying during the latter part of the 20th century has been largely attributed to changes in SST patterns, influenced by external greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings as well as internal climate variability (
  <a rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" href="#r43">43</a>
  <a href="#r44">*</a>–
  <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>). By comparing climate model simulations with increasing greenhouse gases to those that also account for pollution aerosols it was shown that the latter cause a meridional SST gradient, associated with a reduced West African monsoon flow (
  <a rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" href="#r46">46</a>). Hence, the reduction or removal of anthropogenic aerosol forcing can be expected to increase the North Atlantic SST, leading to a moistening of the Sahel (
  <a rid="r47" ref-type="bibr" href="#r47">47</a>, 
  <a rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" href="#r48">48</a>). In addition, warming of the Mediterranean, through a decrease in solar dimming from European pollution, contributes to evaporation and moisture transport into the eastern Sahel (
  <a rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" href="#r49">49</a>, 
  <a rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" href="#r50">50</a>). Our results demonstrate that the asymmetric aerosol radiative forcing creates interhemispheric heating gradients and meridional rainfall shifts over all tropical oceans, including the Pacific (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>), which could be restored by removing the particulate pollutants. While Central America has been affected by droughts throughout its history, including El Niño influence on summer precipitation, our model simulations suggest that recent dryness, e.g., in Mexico, has been aggravated by air pollution. More work will be needed to substantiate these findings. Generally, it is a major challenge to attribute the contributions of greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings to decadal precipitation trends, and distinguish them from natural variability of the atmosphere–ocean system.
