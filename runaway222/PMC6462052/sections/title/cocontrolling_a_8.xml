 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model results show that the phaseout of air pollution emissions leads to substantial precipitation increases in these four regions. Recovery from aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns could be relevant for countries with rapidly growing populations, e.g., in the Sahel, South Asia, and West Africa, which depend on monsoon rainfall for water availability and food production. While the surface temperature and hydrologic cycle respond rapidly to the radiative forcings of short-lived climate pollutants such as aerosols, the response to CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions is irreversible for centuries (

  <a rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" href="#r22">22</a>, 
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>). On the other hand, the simultaneous reduction of short-lived greenhouse gases, such as O
  <sub>3</sub>, counteracts the warming from removing aerosols on short timescales. We find that the fossil-fuel-related and the total anthropogenic O
  <sub>3</sub> cooling could compensate about 0.12 and 0.19 °C of the aerosol warming, respectively (i.e., counteracting the 0.51 and 0.73 °C warming from fossil and total anthropogenic aerosols). The reduction of fossil methane, on the other hand, has limited impact, as it accounts for less than 20% of the total source, while an additional 40% of the emissions are related to other anthropogenic activities such as agriculture (rice paddies, domesticated animals), landfills, biomass burning, and biofuel use. Phasing out fossil as well as nonfossil CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions additionally moderates the warming from removing aerosols by about 0.21 °C.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The importance of reducing methane emissions to mitigate climate change, in part through the impact on O
  <sub>3</sub>, and together with black carbon, was emphasized by Shindell et al. (
  <a rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" href="#r15">15</a>), who calculated the cobenefits for human health and food security. They developed CH
  <sub>4</sub> and black carbon scenarios to optimally decrease the rate of climate warming (up to about 0.5 °C), and considered improved air quality and food security as cobenefits. Here we stress that a complete phaseout of fossil fuels, and accompanying reductions of other anthropogenic emissions, will be needed to reverse the major impacts on public health, regional climate, water supply, and food production. The prospect of preventing millions of excess deaths attributable to air pollution, and restoring perturbations of the hydrologic cycle that have contributed to regional drying, with the cobenefit of limiting climate warming to below 2 °C, is compelling and underscores the urgency of acting on global environmental change.
