 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mutual goals of clean air and a stable climate under the WHO guidelines and the Paris Agreement require a rapid phaseout of fossil fuels. Other pollution sources such as agriculture, biomass burning, and residential energy use should be controlled as well, to achieve a mortality reduction up to 5.55 million excess deaths annually (with additional mortality reduction from reduced household air pollution), limit the warming from aerosol removal, and restore the monsoon rainfall. Replacing fossil by clean, renewable energy sources could decrease the global attributable mortality by 65%, and up to 84% in the United States. If air pollution would be controlled by traditional end-of-pipe techniques alone to abate fine particulates, but leaving greenhouse gas emissions unchanged, global warming could be enhanced by 0.51(±0.03) °C, while removal of all anthropogenic aerosols can unleash 0.73(±0.03) °C (and &gt;2 °C in the United States). However, if air pollution and greenhouse gases are removed concurrently by replacing the common sources, a reduced residual, but unavoidable near-term global warming of 0.36(±0.06) °C will be liberated. Since a temperature increase of 1.0(±0.2 likely range) °C has been realized already, and considering the observed warming rate of 0.2(±0.1) °C per decade (high confidence) (

  <sub>2</sub> extraction from the air. However, with a phaseout by midcentury the 2 °C goal may still be within reach.
