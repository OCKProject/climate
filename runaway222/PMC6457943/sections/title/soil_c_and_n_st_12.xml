  </a>). We compiled forest litter layer C and N concentrations and the associated litter layer thickness and bulk density, mineral soil C and N concentrations for 0- to 20-cm soil depth, and the associated soil bulk density and coarse fraction at subplot level where species-level vegetation inventory was available. Soil C and N measurements in FIA data were based on mineral soil (&lt;2 mm), and coarse particles (&gt;2 mm) were not included. Mineral soil C and N stocks (kg m
  <span class="sup">âˆ’2</span>) to a depth of 20 cm were calculated on the basis of soil C and N concentration (%) and soil bulk density (g cm
  <span class="sup">3</span>) after removing a proportion of coarse particle fraction (particle size, &gt;2 mm) in the soil layer. Total soil C and N stocks were calculated by combining values for both mineral soil (0- to 20-cm depth) and litter layer. Since soil texture for mineral soil (0- to 20-cm depth) was categorized on the basis of field measure, we assigned mean clay proportion for each texture type (loamy, 45%; clayey, 60%; sandy or coarse sandy, 10%), following Zhu
