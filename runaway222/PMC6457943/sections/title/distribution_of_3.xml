 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) Geographical distribution of AM tree dominance. (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) Distribution of AM tree dominance in climatic space. MAP, mean annual precipitation; MAT, mean annual temperature. (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) Relative effects of MAP, MAT, and tree basal area on AM tree dominance. Each dot in (A) and (B) represents a plot and is colored on the basis of the associated AM-EM tree dominance. Boundaries of ecoregions (solid line) and nested subecoregions (dashed lines) in (A) are based on Cleland

  </a>). Circles in (B) indicate ecoregion-level mean MAT and MAP values with the associated SDs. The circle is colored on the basis of the mean AM tree dominance, and the size is proportional to the number of plots (log scale). Effects of MAP, MAT, and basal area on AM tree dominance across ecoregions in the contiguous United States (C) were tested using generalized mixed-effects models with subecoregions included as a random effect in each model. Significant coefficient estimates are plotted in (C) as solid circles, and nonsignificant ones are plotted as open circles. Circle size is proportional to the number of plots (log scale). The number beside each dot in (B) and (C) represents the associated ecoregion in (A). Error bars in (C) are SEs.
