 <div class="title">Changes in forest AM tree dominance during the past three decades and the relative impacts of environmental changes on the mycorrhizal association changes in forests of the eastern United States.</div>
 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) Changes in AM tree dominance over the two inventories (T2-T1). All ecoregions had a significant increase in AM tree dominance during the period based on a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05; inset figures are boxplots of hexagon-level changes by ecoregions). (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) Relative effects of climate and basal area change, AM tree dominance at the first inventory (T1), N deposition, and fire frequency on AM tree dominance change. (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) Effects of tree abundance change of the top 10 most abundant tree genera (genera on the left without shaded background are AM trees, and genera on the right are EM trees) on AM tree dominance change. Mean coefficients in (B) and (C) were estimated at the ecoregion level based on generalized mixed-effects models with subecoregions included as a random effect. Significant coefficient estimates are plotted as solid circles, and nonsignificant ones are plotted as open circles with the size being proportional to the number of hexagons (log scale). Error bars in (B) and (C) are SEs.
