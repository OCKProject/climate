The FIA program monitors forest resources at the national level, using permanent plots, which have a sampling intensity of approximately one plot every 2428 ha. Each plot comprises four subplots (fixed radius, 7.3 m) spaced 37 m apart in a triangular arrangement with one subplot in the center. For each FIA plot, we extracted tree basal area by species with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of &gt;12.7 cm as adult tree and a dbh of 5.1 to 12.7 cm as sapling (
