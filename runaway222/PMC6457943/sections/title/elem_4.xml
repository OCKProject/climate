 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand the impacts of human-induced global changes on tree mycorrhizal associations, we used repeated measures of forest inventories from the FIA program during the past three decades in the eastern United States where rapid climate change has been observed (fig. S2) (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>). AM tree dominance has significantly increased in all parts of the eastern United States during the past three decades (based on a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>), especially in the central regions (17% increase in prairie and 15% increase in hot continental regions), because of both an increase in AM tree abundance (i.e., basal area; fig. S3A) and a decrease in EM tree abundance (fig. S3B). AM tree dominance in southern and northern ecoregions also increased (5% increase in warm continental and 5% increase in subtropical; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>), although these regions had statistically significant increases in both AM and EM tree abundance (fig. S3, A and B). In particular, the western portion of the warm continental region and northern portion of the subtropical region had similar increases in AM tree abundance, while the eastern portion of the warm continental region and southern portion of the subtropical region had the opposite trend (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis indicates that three factors—N deposition, fire frequency, and climate change—likely contributed to the increases in AM tree dominance. First, we found a strong positive correlation between N deposition and shifts in AM tree dominance, consistent with earlier studies based on smaller spatial extent and shorter temporal scale (
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>). In temperate forests, most AM tree species have nutrient acquisitive traits (e.g., rapid root growth into nutrient hot spots and narrower C:N in leaf and root tissues) (
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>) and often dominate stands characterized by open (i.e., fast) N cycles (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>). Thus, the positive relationship between N deposition and AM dominance may result from AM trees being competitively superior at acquiring excess N—the nutrient that generally limits plant growth in these forests. Second, we found strong negative associations between fire frequency and AM tree dominance (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>). While it is well established that fire suppression following European settlement has led to oak (
  <span class="italic">Quercus</span>) regeneration failure and forest “mesophication” in the eastern United States (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>), our results indicate that this trend is not merely a result of EM-associating oaks being replaced by AM-associating maples (
  <span class="italic">Acer</span>). The change in AM tree dominance was not driven by a specific phylogenetic group of tree species, as the most common AM and EM tree genera had relatively similar effect sizes on the change (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>). Changes of abundance in all five most common AM genera, with a few statistically nonsignificant exceptions, were positively associated with AM tree dominance change, while the changes of abundance in EM genera were nearly all negatively associated with the AM tree dominance change (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>). Possible explanations for the observed nonsignificant outliers (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">Prunus</span> in prairie and 
  <span class="italic">Carya</span> in warm continental region) could be due to small sample sizes or potential preferential harvesting in these regions. The third factor contributing to increases in AM tree dominance is climate change. In general, increases in MAP were negatively associated with increases in AM tree dominance, while the associations with MAT were weak and variable (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extent to which other factors may contribute to future shifts in tree mycorrhizal associations is unknown. AM tree dominance tended to increase with basal area, an indicator of forest succession, as shade-tolerant AM trees increase their abundance with the progression of forest succession. However, the effects of basal area were relatively small compared with the other drivers, suggesting that anthropogenic drivers (i.e., climate change, N deposition, and fire suppression) had far greater impact on recent demographic shifts. Other factors such as land use change and forest management, which directly affect tree species dominance, could also affect shifts in tree mycorrhizal associations. In addition, to the extent that pollution control and reduction reduce N loading to U.S. forests, future shifts in mycorrhizal associations may be lessened in the coming decades.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A continuing shift to AM tree dominance is also predicted by our finding that saplings were more AM-dominated compared with adult trees in 7 of 11 ecoregions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). In the eastern United States, all ecoregions other than the warm continental region had greater AM tree dominance in saplings compared with adult trees (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). The prairie, hot continental, and subtropical regions had more than 54% greater sapling AM tree dominance compared with adult trees. The differences in AM tree dominance between saplings and adult trees were mixed in the western United States (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). Compared with adult trees, more AM saplings were observed in the marine, Mediterranean, and temperate steppe regions, but less AM saplings were observed in the temperate desert, tropical/subtropical desert, and tropical/subtropical steppe regions. In addition, the overall differences between adult and sapling AM tree dominance were smaller than those observed in the ecoregions in the eastern United States (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>).
