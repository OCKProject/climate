 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span> to 
  <span class="bold">C</span>) Relationships between AM tree dominance and soil (A) C stock, (B) N stock, and (C) C:N ratio (based on 0- to 20-cm depth mineral soil and litter layer). Linear regression lines were fitted by ecoregion (solid line, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05; dotted line, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05; red, positive slope; blue, negative slope). Inset shows coefficient (slope) estimate of the fitted line for each ecoregion (colored bars indicate significant relationship at 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05; red, positive; blue, negative). (
  <span class="bold">D</span> to 
  <span class="bold">F</span>) Effects of AM tree dominance and environmental factors on soil (D) C stock, (E) N stock, and (F) C:N ratio across ecoregions of the United States. Coefficient estimates in (D) to (F) are based on mixed-effect models at ecoregion level with subecoregions as a random effect. Significant coefficient estimates are plotted as solid circles, and nonsignificant ones are plotted as open circles. Circle size is proportional to the number of plots (log scale). Error bars are SEs. The number beside each bar in (A) to (C) and each dot in (D) to (F) represents the associated ecoregion in (A). Soil data summary is available in table S2.
