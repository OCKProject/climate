  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using FIA vegetation data and tree mycorrhizal type information, we mapped the relative abundance of more than 3 million AM and EM trees across the conterminous United States (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>). While patterns of mycorrhizal associations and associated drivers have been reported previously, these studies were based on species occurrence data (
   <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
    <span class="italic">27</span>
   </a>–
   <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">

   </a>), and they covered lesser spatial extent (
   <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
    <span class="italic">30</span>
   </a>) and examined fewer vegetation survey plots than our study (
   <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
    <span class="italic">31</span>
   </a>). Our results indicate that AM trees are more dominant in dry and warm ecoregions, while EM trees are more dominant in humid and cold ecoregions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>, A and B). In the western United States, AM trees are dominant in the subtropical desert and steppe regions, while EM trees are dominant in the northwestern and intermountain west regions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a> and fig. S1). AM and EM trees are well mixed in the eastern United States, with more AM trees in the hot continental region and more EM trees in the western portion of the warm continental region (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a> and fig. S1). Using a mixed-effects model that accounts for the spatial heterogeneity between plots in different subecoregions, we found that climate is an important driver of tree mycorrhizal association patterns at the continental scale (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>). Overall, AM tree dominance was negatively associated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) and positively associated with mean annual temperature (MAT) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>), although the magnitude and direction of effect sizes differed in some ecoregions. Forest tree basal area, which was used as an indicator of forest successional stage, had smaller effects on AM tree dominance compared with climatic factors, implying that climate is a more important driver of the continental tree mycorrhizal association patterns than successional stage (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand the impacts of human-induced global changes on tree mycorrhizal associations, we used repeated measures of forest inventories from the FIA program during the past three decades in the eastern United States where rapid climate change has been observed (fig. S2) (
   <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
    <span class="italic">1</span>

   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>), especially in the central regions (17% increase in prairie and 15% increase in hot continental regions), because of both an increase in AM tree abundance (i.e., basal area; fig. S3A) and a decrease in EM tree abundance (fig. S3B). AM tree dominance in southern and northern ecoregions also increased (5% increase in warm continental and 5% increase in subtropical; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>), although these regions had statistically significant increases in both AM and EM tree abundance (fig. S3, A and B). In particular, the western portion of the warm continental region and northern portion of the subtropical region had similar increases in AM tree abundance, while the eastern portion of the warm continental region and southern portion of the subtropical region had the opposite trend (

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis indicates that three factors—N deposition, fire frequency, and climate change—likely contributed to the increases in AM tree dominance. First, we found a strong positive correlation between N deposition and shifts in AM tree dominance, consistent with earlier studies based on smaller spatial extent and shorter temporal scale (
   <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
    <span class="italic">31</span>
   </a>). In temperate forests, most AM tree species have nutrient acquisitive traits (e.g., rapid root growth into nutrient hot spots and narrower C:N in leaf and root tissues) (
   <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
    <span class="italic">17</span>
   </a>, 
   <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
    <span class="italic">32</span>
   </a>–
   <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
    <span class="italic">34</span>
   </a>) and often dominate stands characterized by open (i.e., fast) N cycles (
   <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
    <span class="italic">13</span>
   </a>, 
   <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
    <span class="italic">30</span>
   </a>). Thus, the positive relationship between N deposition and AM dominance may result from AM trees being competitively superior at acquiring excess N—the nutrient that generally limits plant growth in these forests. Second, we found strong negative associations between fire frequency and AM tree dominance (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>). While it is well established that fire suppression following European settlement has led to oak (
   <span class="italic">Quercus</span>) regeneration failure and forest “mesophication” in the eastern United States (
   <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
    <span class="italic">35</span>
   </a>), our results indicate that this trend is not merely a result of EM-associating oaks being replaced by AM-associating maples (
   <span class="italic">Acer</span>). The change in AM tree dominance was not driven by a specific phylogenetic group of tree species, as the most common AM and EM tree genera had relatively similar effect sizes on the change (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>). Changes of abundance in all five most common AM genera, with a few statistically nonsignificant exceptions, were positively associated with AM tree dominance change, while the changes of abundance in EM genera were nearly all negatively associated with the AM tree dominance change (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>). Possible explanations for the observed nonsignificant outliers (e.g., 
   <span class="italic">Prunus</span> in prairie and 
   <span class="italic">Carya</span> in warm continental region) could be due to small sample sizes or potential preferential harvesting in these regions. The third factor contributing to increases in AM tree dominance is climate change. In general, increases in MAP were negatively associated with increases in AM tree dominance, while the associations with MAT were weak and variable (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extent to which other factors may contribute to future shifts in tree mycorrhizal associations is unknown. AM tree dominance tended to increase with basal area, an indicator of forest succession, as shade-tolerant AM trees increase their abundance with the progression of forest succession. However, the effects of basal area were relatively small compared with the other drivers, suggesting that anthropogenic drivers (i.e., climate change, N deposition, and fire suppression) had far greater impact on recent demographic shifts. Other factors such as land use change and forest management, which directly affect tree species dominance, could also affect shifts in tree mycorrhizal associations. In addition, to the extent that pollution control and reduction reduce N loading to U.S. forests, future shifts in mycorrhizal associations may be lessened in the coming decades.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A continuing shift to AM tree dominance is also predicted by our finding that saplings were more AM-dominated compared with adult trees in 7 of 11 ecoregions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). In the eastern United States, all ecoregions other than the warm continental region had greater AM tree dominance in saplings compared with adult trees (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). The prairie, hot continental, and subtropical regions had more than 54% greater sapling AM tree dominance compared with adult trees. The differences in AM tree dominance between saplings and adult trees were mixed in the western United States (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). Compared with adult trees, more AM saplings were observed in the marine, Mediterranean, and temperate steppe regions, but less AM saplings were observed in the temperate desert, tropical/subtropical desert, and tropical/subtropical steppe regions. In addition, the overall differences between adult and sapling AM tree dominance were smaller than those observed in the ecoregions in the eastern United States (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the potential consequences of mycorrhizal association shifts on C and N dynamics, we analyzed the relationships between AM tree dominance and soil C and N stocks (litter layer and 0- to 20-cm depth of the mineral soil) on plots where both soil attributes and associated vegetation were measured (2113 plots) using linear regression models. In general, the associations between AM tree dominance and soil C and N stocks were positive in mesic temperate ecoregions but negative in dry ecoregions; however, most ecoregions had a negative relationship between soil C:N ratio and AM tree dominance (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, A to C). Across the study area, AM-dominated forests had 28% more soil N and 8% more soil C than EM-dominated forests (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, A and B, and table S2). The higher increase in soil N stocks (relative to soil C stocks) in mesic ecoregions and the lower decrease in soil N stocks (relative to soil C stocks) in dry ecoregions resulted in a negative relationship between soil C:N ratio and AM tree dominance along the continental AM tree dominance gradient (

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using mixed-effects models, we further tested how forest mycorrhizal association and environmental factors are related to soil attributes for each ecoregion after accounting for the spatial heterogeneity between plots in different subecoregions by adding subecoregions as random intercepts in the models. We found that AM tree dominance, climate, and soil texture had significant associations with soil C and N stocks and C:N ratio, although with different effect sizes (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, D to F). Overall, AM tree dominance was positively associated with soil C and N stocks and negatively with C:N ratio across the ecoregions, consistent with site-based patterns recently reported (
   <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
    <span class="italic">22</span>
   </a>). Among the climatic factors, MAP tended to have positive associations with soil C and N stocks, while MAT have negative associations. Soil C and N stocks were similar between the top 20 cm of the mineral soil and the top 20 cm plus litter layer (fig. S4) owing to the much smaller size of the litter C and N pools.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observational nature of our data precludes us from determining whether AM trees are causing elevated N levels in soil (as opposed to merely responding to them). It is possible that AM trees can elevate soil N (pool sizes and transformation rates) by releasing high chemical quality litter to soil. Several studies of temperate trees have shown that AM litters generally decay faster than EM litters in common garden studies (
   <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
    <span class="italic">17</span>
   </a>) and meta-analyses (
   <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
    <span class="italic">36</span>
   </a>). Given that higher chemical quality litter leads to both greater rates of N transformations (
   <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
    <span class="italic">37</span>
   </a>) and the formation of more protected (i.e., stable) soil organic matter [sensu the MEMS (Microbial Efficiency-Matrix Stabilization) hypothesis] (
   <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
    <span class="italic">38</span>
   </a>), increasing AM dominance may lead to elevated N levels in soil (
   <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
    <span class="italic">22</span>
   </a>). Contemporary theory on soil organic matter stabilization and turnover predicts that changes in AM versus EM dominance can alter C and N cycling in 30 to 45 years (
   <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
    <span class="italic">18</span>
   </a>), well within the time frame of changes detected in the FIA dataset. Thus, our contention that AM trees may be contributing, in part, to N accumulation is a testable hypothesis but requires further inquiry.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Last, separating cause and effect in this instance may be of limited importance given that tree species often modify soils in ways that tend to exacerbate or enhance the preexisting biogeochemical condition (
   <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
    <span class="italic">39</span>
   </a>). Thus, while we cannot rule out that the species are merely responding to the high N soils, both processes likely contribute to the maintenance of the biogeochemical syndromes observed. More experiments and/or long-term repeated measures of soil stocks are needed to test the mechanisms of these associations. Nevertheless, the consistent large-scale patterns in forests across multiple ecoregions suggest that dominant tree mycorrhizal type could be an important driver of nutrient and C dynamics in forests through positive/negative feedbacks associated with AM/EM plant traits (
   <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
    <span class="italic">39</span>
   </a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that AM-dominated forests tend to be underlain by soils with lower C:N than EM-dominated soils [(
   <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
    <span class="italic">30</span>
   </a>, 
   <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
    <span class="italic">33</span>
   </a>); 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4C</a>], the increasing dominance of AM trees could have consequences for forest ecosystem functions and services. Low or small ratios are often used as proxies for rates of microbial N transformations in soils such as nitrification and nitrate leaching losses (
   <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
    <span class="italic">37</span>
   </a>), as well as for ecosystem sensitivity to N deposition (
   <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
    <span class="italic">40</span>
   </a>). Thus, forests of the eastern United States may be experiencing an acceleration of N cycling—owing to the shifts in AM dominance. The consequences of nutrient acceleration would likely be profound for water quality if, for example, elevated nitrification rates enhance nitrate export to lakes and rivers.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The consequences of nutrient acceleration may be most profound for forest productivity, which can feed back to affect climate change. Most AM-dominated ecosystems cannot sustain a high level of productivity under elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub> unless the availability of soil N is high (
   <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
    <span class="italic">23</span>
   </a>). Thus, if increases in AM tree dominance lead to an acceleration of N cycling, then AM-dominated forests in the eastern United States may be strong sinks for atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub>. However, if the AM-induced acceleration of N cycling leads to substantial ecosystem N losses (
   <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
    <span class="italic">25</span>
   </a>) or results in N stabilization in soil organic matter (
   <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
    <span class="italic">22</span>
   </a>), then there may be little stimulation of forest productivity. In addition, shifting the balance of AM-EM vegetation could also be influenced by N-induced phosphorus (P) limitation and more severe drought periods (
   <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
    <span class="italic">41</span>
   </a>). While N-induced P limitation has long been considered as something that would only occur in forests south of the Last Glacial Maximum (where mineral P levels are extremely low), recent evidence from northern ecosystems challenges that paradigm (
   <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
    <span class="italic">42</span>
   </a>). Either way, our results indicate that changes in N cycling owing to increasing AM tree dominance could have profound consequences for C and N retention and loss in forests and hence, the degree to which forests feedback to climate change.
