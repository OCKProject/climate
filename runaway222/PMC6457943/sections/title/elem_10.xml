The FIA program monitors forest resources at the national level, using permanent plots, which have a sampling intensity of approximately one plot every 2428 ha. Each plot comprises four subplots (fixed radius, 7.3 m) spaced 37 m apart in a triangular arrangement with one subplot in the center. For each FIA plot, we extracted tree basal area by species with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of &gt;12.7 cm as adult tree and a dbh of 5.1 to 12.7 cm as sapling (

We compiled forest litter layer C and N concentrations and the associated litter layer thickness and bulk density, mineral soil C and N concentrations for 0- to 20-cm soil depth, and the associated soil bulk density and coarse fraction at subplot level where species-level vegetation inventory was available. Soil C and N measurements in FIA data were based on mineral soil (&lt;2 mm), and coarse particles (&gt;2 mm) were not included. Mineral soil C and N stocks (kg m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>) to a depth of 20 cm were calculated on the basis of soil C and N concentration (%) and soil bulk density (g cm
   <span class="sup">3</span>) after removing a proportion of coarse particle fraction (particle size, &gt;2 mm) in the soil layer. Total soil C and N stocks were calculated by combining values for both mineral soil (0- to 20-cm depth) and litter layer. Since soil texture for mineral soil (0- to 20-cm depth) was categorized on the basis of field measure, we assigned mean clay proportion for each texture type (loamy, 45%; clayey, 60%; sandy or coarse sandy, 10%), following Zhu

For some species categorized as both AM and EM, we tested whether assigning them as AM (or EM) changes the patterns of mycorrhizal associations and found no significant effects; therefore, we assigned them a half of the basal area each to AM and EM.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test changes in AM-EM tree dominance over the past three decades, we used repeated measures of forest plot inventory available in the eastern United States by U.S. Forest Service, the first inventory, collected between 1980 and 1995 (T1; mean inventory year: 1986; 83,866 plots), and the second inventory was the latest completed inventory, which was finished in 2015 for most states (T2; mean inventory year: 2015; 70,715 plots). We only included the eastern United States since repeated FIA measures are not widely available for the western United States. Because T2 inventory measures were not necessarily done in the same plot locations with T1 plots, we aggregated plot-level AM tree dominance and total tree basal area to the hexagon level (a spatial tessellation design used by FIA), following Fei

We only included hexagons with at least 10 plots each for both T1 and T2 inventories (mean plot number per each T1 hexagon, 47; mean plot number per each T2 hexagon, 40), resulted in 1785 hexagons for the final analysis.

   </a>). We added subecoregions (nested units within ecoregion; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>) as a random effect in the model to account for the spatial heterogeneity between plots in different subecoregions. We excluded plots with any missing variables and ended up with 132,956 plots for analyses. All predictor variables were standardized by subtracting mean and dividing by 2 SDs to make the regression coefficients for the predictors comparable. AM tree dominance differences between two inventories (T1 and T2) (hexagon-level data) and between saplings and adult trees (plot-level data) were tested using a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test for each ecoregion. At the ecoregion level, effects of global change drivers (i.e., MAP and MAT changes, N deposition, and fire frequency), AM tree dominance at T1, and basal area on the AM tree dominance change during the past three decades (T2-T1) were tested using mixed-effects models with a Gaussian error distribution and subecoregions as a random effect (see fig. S2 for the spatial patterns of the predictor variables). We also tested the effects of genus-level tree dominance changes in 10 most abundant tree genera (

Bivariate relationships between soil C and N stocks and C:N ratio and AM tree dominance were tested using a linear regression. We further determined relative effects of AM tree dominance and environmental factors on soil attributes using a mixed-effects modeling approach. At the ecoregion level, we modeled each soil attribute (soil C and N stocks and C:N ratio) with a Gaussian error distribution as a function of AM tree dominance, MAP, MAT, basal area, and clay proportion, nested within subecoregions. Soil attributes were log-transformed to meet normality assumptions, and all predictor variables were standardized.
