At the hexagon level, MAT and MAP changes over the past three decades, calculated by subtracting mean values of the recent period (1981–2015) and the recent past period (1951–1980) from the PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) Climate Group (4-km spatial resolution; available at

Although wet N deposition data are available from 1985 to 2016, we used total N deposition data, which include wet and dry N deposition of both organic and inorganic forms, given that recent N deposition data reflect the historical N deposition patterns (
