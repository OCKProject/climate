 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mycorrhizal type was assigned for each tree species present in FIA plots based on peer-reviewed journal publications (
  <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">
   <span class="italic">49</span>
  </a>â€“
  <a rid="R52" ref-type="bibr" href="#R52">
   <span class="italic">52</span>
  </a>). If the species-level mycorrhizal type was not available, we assigned the most frequent mycorrhizal type within genus (or family). To avoid potential false conclusions due to misclassification of mycorrhizal association (
  <a rid="R53" ref-type="bibr" href="#R53">
   <span class="italic">53</span>
  </a>), we further revised the EM tree information based on Tedersoo and Brundrett (
  <a rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" href="#R54">
   <span class="italic">54</span>
  </a>). We then calculated the AM tree dominance (based on basal area) for each plot by dividing the total AM tree basal area by the sum of AM and EM mycorrhizal tree basal area. For some species categorized as both AM and EM, we tested whether assigning them as AM (or EM) changes the patterns of mycorrhizal associations and found no significant effects; therefore, we assigned them a half of the basal area each to AM and EM.
