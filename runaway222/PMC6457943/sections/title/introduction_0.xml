 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The forests of North America are experiencing unprecedented change owing to the combined effects of climate change, nitrogen (N) deposition, changes in disturbance regime, habitat fragmentation, and invasions of exotic species (

   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). While anthropogenic-induced shifts in the distribution and abundance of tree communities are well described (

   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>), far less is known about the direct and indirect impacts of global anthropogenic changes on plant-fungal associations (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>). More than 90% of vascular plants associate with mycorrhizal fungi (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>), and there is an emerging consensus that these plant-fungal associations have profound impacts on nutrient cycling and vegetation dynamics in ecosystems, particularly temperate forests (

   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). However, critical gaps remain in our understanding of biogeographic patterns of mycorrhizal associations, and our limited knowledge of the anthropogenic factors responsible for shifting plant-mycorrhizal distributions has hindered efforts to predict ecosystem feedbacks to climate change (

  </a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two dominant types of fungi that associate with trees—arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM)—differ greatly in their forms and functions. Consequently, tree mycorrhizal associations have been hypothesized to represent trait-integrating phenotypes that give rise to “biogeochemical syndromes” in forests (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>), although the relative contribution of the plants versus fungi to these syndromes is poorly quantified. EM-dominated forests often cycle carbon (C) and nutrients conservatively owing to the lower chemical quality of EM plant litter relative to that of AM-dominated forests, which have more “open” C and nutrient cycles (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>). These effects not only alter the degree to which these ecosystems store C and nutrients (

  </a>) but also likely affect their sensitivity to human-induced global changes (

   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). Here, using forest inventory data collected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program across the contiguous United States, we (i) map the tree mycorrhizal association patterns and identify underlying drivers of these observed associations; (ii) quantify the impacts of human-induced global changes, primarily climate change, N deposition, and disturbance regimes, on tree mycorrhizal associations; and (iii) assess the potential feedback of mycorrhizal association shifts on soil C and nutrient dynamics.
