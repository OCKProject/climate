 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test changes in AM-EM tree dominance over the past three decades, we used repeated measures of forest plot inventory available in the eastern United States by U.S. Forest Service, the first inventory, collected between 1980 and 1995 (T1; mean inventory year: 1986; 83,866 plots), and the second inventory was the latest completed inventory, which was finished in 2015 for most states (T2; mean inventory year: 2015; 70,715 plots). We only included the eastern United States since repeated FIA measures are not widely available for the western United States. Because T2 inventory measures were not necessarily done in the same plot locations with T1 plots, we aggregated plot-level AM tree dominance and total tree basal area to the hexagon level (a spatial tessellation design used by FIA), following Fei

  </a>). The size of hexagon (1452 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) was approximately the mean size of counties in the eastern United States. We only included hexagons with at least 10 plots each for both T1 and T2 inventories (mean plot number per each T1 hexagon, 47; mean plot number per each T2 hexagon, 40), resulted in 1785 hexagons for the final analysis.
