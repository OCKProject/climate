  </span> and decreased sea-ice thickness

  </span>. This phenomenon called Arctic Amplification can lead to a weakening of the temperature gradient between the Arctic and the midlatitudes. A weakened temperature gradient is related to a meridionalisation of the atmospheric flow and increased advection of warm air into the Arctic

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. In addition, dry cold polar air is transported into the midlatitudes, which can result in cold air outbreaks in Eurasia and North America. Advection of warm air leads to a reduction of Arctic sea ice and therefore an increased transport of heat and momentum into the atmosphere in fall and winter followed by an increase in wave propagation from the tropo- into the stratosphere and weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>, which then affects the tropospheric circulation in the midlatitudes in subsequent months

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent to which stratospheric ozone chemistry is important to climate linkages between the Arctic and midlatitudes. Therefor we implement a computationally fast but accurate interactive stratospheric ozone chemistry module into an atmospheric general circulation model, which allows to perform a large number of ensemble simulations.
