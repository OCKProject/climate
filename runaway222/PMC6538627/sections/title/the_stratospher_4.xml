 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to a near surface warming that is also caused by the general Arctic warming due to climate change, ERA-Interim, starting in early January, shows a statistically significant positive polar cap (65° to 90°N, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) temperature anomaly propagating downward from the stratosphere into the upper troposphere for LICE minus HICE conditions, according to a standard two-sample two-sided students t-test. This indicates a weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex, which then can influence weather systems in the troposphere

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. In the ECHAM6 model without the chemistry module, besides surface warming, a statistically significant response of the atmosphere due to sea-ice reduction is absent in the difference between the LICE and HICE experiments (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). ECHAM6-SWIFT, which takes into account interactive stratospheric ozone chemistry compares favorably to ECHAM6 with a more consistent stratospheric signal (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>). Though the simulated downward propagation leads the observed downward propagation by two weeks.
