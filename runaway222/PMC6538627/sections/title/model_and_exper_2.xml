To isolate the impact of Arctic sea-ice retreat we perform sensitivity experiments only varying the sea-ice concentration (SIC). To simulate high-ice conditions (HICE) we use the average 1979 to 1983 and for low-ice conditions (LICE) the average 2005 to 2009 SICs from the Merged Hadley-National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Optimum Interpolation sea surface temperature (SST) and SIC data set

Each of these four perpetual model simulations is integrated over 120 years, excluding the first 20 years as a spin-up period from the analysis. Compared to ECHAM6 the newly coupled ECHAM6-SWIFT does not apply ozone climatologies in the stratosphere but solves a set of coupled differential equations, which simulate the polar vortex-averaged mixing ratios of the chemical key species involved in polar ozone depletion on each discrete model level that is located in the range between 20 hPa and 80 hPa. The stratospheric polar vortex edge is assumed to be located at the 36PVU contour line of the modified potential vorticity field
