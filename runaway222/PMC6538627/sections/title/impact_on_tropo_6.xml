 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies have shown that a reduction of Arctic sea ice leads to a negative phase shift of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in late winter

  </span>. In ECHAM6-SWIFT Arctic sea-ice reduction leads to a reduction of the zonal wind component in February/March (FM) at 10 hPa in the polar cap region of up to 3 m/s, which is of the magnitude of the induced forcing needed to significantly change the interaction between planetary waves and the mean flow

  </span>, whereas such a signal is absent in the ECHAM6 experiments without interactive stratospheric ozone chemistry. This change in the stratospheric circulation also leads to tropospheric anomalies in the following months, due to alterations in upward wave propagation. This can be seen in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> where LICE minus HICE anomalies of the mean zonal wind in February-March at 500 hPa are shown for ERA-Interim reanalysis data (a), the ECHAM6 (b) and the ECHAM6-SWIFT (c) experiments. A weakening of the midlatitude westerly winds over the North Atlantic is evident in the reanalysis data. The wind change pattern in ECHAM6-SWIFT closely resembles the reanalysis, but is clearly different in ECHAM6.

  </span> of the combined HICE and LICE datasets for the reanalysis data and each of the two model configurations. The corresponding NAO index for each dataset is defined as the leading EOFs mean PC over the respective dataset (e.g. ECHAM6-SWIFT HICE). Changes in NAO indices between LICE and HICE are represented by differences of this mean PCs. For ERA-Interim a strong negative shift in the phase of the NAO is found (PC difference LICE minus HICE: −0.42). Consistent with the zonal wind anomalies ECHAM6 shows no clear changes in the phase of the NAO, even tending to a positive shift (+0.07), while ECHAM6-SWIFT shows a clear tendency towards a negative NAO (−0.29). This shows that changes in Arctic sea ice can lead to a shifted circulation which increases the potential for cold air outbreaks over Europe, in agreement with the reanalysis.
