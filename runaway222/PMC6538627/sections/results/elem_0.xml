  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand how the stratospheric temperature signals are generated, we investigate the mean vertical transport of momentum by atmospheric waves through the tropopause region (100 hPa) between 45°N and 75°N before the maximum monthly mean polar cap temperature signal in 50 hPa occurs. The vertical component of the Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux vector (

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>. In the ERA-Interim reanalysis (Fig.

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>) clear relations of these two quantities are apparent. In all datasets higher values of 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">z</span>
   </sub> are related to higher stratospheric temperatures in the following months. All correlations are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Also in ERA-Interim the mean of the distributions of 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">z</span>
   </sub> at 100 hPa and temperature at 50 hPa are significantly different at the 95% confidence level when comparing the LICE and HICE conditions. In LICE 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">z</span>
   </sub> tends to be higher, indicating an enhanced propagation of planetary waves into the stratosphere. By the momentum deposited this way, the stratospheric circulation is disturbed, resulting in higher temperatures. While the LICE and HICE experiments for ECHAM6 show no statistically significant difference in the mean of these distributions, in the ECHAM6-SWIFT LICE and HICE experiments both, 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">z</span>
   </sub> and temperature, are significantly different. In contrast to ECHAM6, ECHAM6-SWIFT is able to simulate a qualitatively improved impact of Arctic sea-ice loss on the stratospheric winter circulation. This suggests that wintertime stratospheric dynamics and its impact on tropospheric wave behaviour

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One reason for the improved response is the interaction of propagating planetary waves with the stratospheric polar vortex and its dynamical relation to stratospheric ozone. In Fig.

   <sub>
    <span class="italic">z</span>
   </sub>) at 100 hPa between 45°N and 75°N and its connection to polar-cap stratospheric ozone in the following spring is shown. Momentum is transported through the tropopause to high latitudes where it is deposited. This disturbs the stratospheric polar vortex, leads to warming of the polar cap and to poleward and downward transport of ozone with the amplified residual circulation, resulting in the positive correlation between 
   <span class="italic">F</span>

   </sub> and ozone

   </span> in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>. Linear regression analysis for the ECHAM6-SWIFT HICE and LICE simulations shows that both relations are statistically significant exceeding the 95% confidence level, proving that wave forcing entering the stratosphere in winter impacts the stratospheric ozone volume mixing ratio (VMR) in spring, which impacts stratospheric temperature because of its radiative properties. Lower values of 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">z</span>
   </sub> result in lower polar cap temperatures which allows the formation of more Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC) leading to activation of chlorine species through heterogeneous reactions. With the return of sunlight this results in chemical destruction of ozone, further steepening the relation between polar cap ozone and 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>

   </sub> on the left hand side of Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, where the colder conditions allow for more significant chemical ozone losses. Because these mechanisms are ignored when ozone is prescribed, including the interactive ozone scheme SWIFT leads to clear improvements in the dynamical response of the model.

In ECHAM6-SWIFT Arctic sea-ice reduction leads to a reduction of the zonal wind component in February/March (FM) at 10 hPa in the polar cap region of up to 3 m/s, which is of the magnitude of the induced forcing needed to significantly change the interaction between planetary waves and the mean flow

   </span>, whereas such a signal is absent in the ECHAM6 experiments without interactive stratospheric ozone chemistry. This change in the stratospheric circulation also leads to tropospheric anomalies in the following months, due to alterations in upward wave propagation. This can be seen in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> where LICE minus HICE anomalies of the mean zonal wind in February-March at 500 hPa are shown for ERA-Interim reanalysis data (a), the ECHAM6 (b) and the ECHAM6-SWIFT (c) experiments. A weakening of the midlatitude westerly winds over the North Atlantic is evident in the reanalysis data.

The corresponding NAO index for each dataset is defined as the leading EOFs mean PC over the respective dataset (e.g. ECHAM6-SWIFT HICE). Changes in NAO indices between LICE and HICE are represented by differences of this mean PCs. For ERA-Interim a strong negative shift in the phase of the NAO is found (PC difference LICE minus HICE: −0.42). Consistent with the zonal wind anomalies ECHAM6 shows no clear changes in the phase of the NAO, even tending to a positive shift (+0.07), while ECHAM6-SWIFT shows a clear tendency towards a negative NAO (−0.29). This shows that changes in Arctic sea ice can lead to a shifted circulation which increases the potential for cold air outbreaks over Europe, in agreement with the reanalysis.
