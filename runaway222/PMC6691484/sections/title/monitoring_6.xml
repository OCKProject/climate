 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hydraulic modelling holds tremendous potential as a means of predicting tree death and species extirpation at local, regional and global scales. However, maximizing this potential will demand resources to be focused towards understanding the diversity and plasticity of xylem vulnerability within and among species. At the same time, a better understanding of the relationship between rainfall and plant hydration will be achieved as arrays of sensors capable of monitoring measuring plant water potential, growth and plant water stress become distributed across forests worldwide. These efforts have already begun at local scales, identifying likely changes in forest community composition (

  </a>) and highlighting those species for which interventionist conservation may be a last resort. Scaling up to larger regions should be possible by combining soil and tree-based sensory arrays with airborne or spaceborne hyperspectral sensing tools. The ultimate goal of this coupled modelling-sensing approach will be the ability to monitor and ultimately predict forest heath at a global scale.
