 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential for using variation in xylem vulnerability to predict species mortality and distribution is clearly observable from strong associations between species’ rainfall niches and their vulnerability to cavitation. In a diversity of tree species (

  </a>), correlations exist whereby species growing in wet climates produce xylem that is more vulnerable to cavitation that of drier forest species. These patterns demonstrate the fundamental importance of species-specific xylem vulnerability in structuring the composition of vegetation growing at any location and climate, while indicating the likelihood of forest compositional change via mortality under conditions of changing temperature and rainfall (

  </a>). Furthermore, these relationships between xylem vulnerability and climate underscore the great potential to use plant hydraulics to model drought-induced mortality and species distribution. The advantage of hydraulic modelling is that the basis of the model is functional, designed to capture the processes that cause damage and death to plants. A mechanistic/analytical hydraulic approach should provide advantages over empirical models that predict future distributions based on contemporary distribution, ignorant of the processes driving selection and mortality. Furthermore, the hydraulic approach is not limited by the quality of the ‘training sets’ used by niche model approaches to project contemporary plant distributions into the future. Certainly, it is more complicated to use a hydraulic model compared with a niche model because the parameterization requires knowledge of individual species physiology, but the improved confidence achieved by employing a quantitative mechanistic approach should outweigh the extra knowledge cost (in terms of gathering the physiological information required to characterize species). In terms of complexity, hydraulic models of plant mortality are relatively easy to conceive because they are structured by the behaviour of non-living xylem tissue and can thus be expected to follow relatively simple physical rules (

   <p>Essentially a plant can be considered as a volume of water attached the soil water by a pipeline that fails at a specified tension (species-specific). The volume of water in the soil largely determines the tension in the xylem water column, and this volume of soil water (determined by the root architecture and soil properties) is increased by rainfall and reduced by water transpired by the plant. This tractable framework can be parameterized by species-specific information about the porosity of the stomata and cuticle, root properties and of course the vulnerability of the xylem to cavitation. Thus, it is possible to run time series to determine whether plants are exposed to cavitation damage under different climatic scenarios. Due to the complexities of pinpointing the precise moment of tree death, cavitation damage is translated to tree mortality based on observations that conifers typically die after 50% stem cavitation (

    <a rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref40">Urli 
     <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2013
    </a>). This 50–88% stem mortality trigger value is used as a good approximation of the water tension likely to cause widespread catastrophic embolism in branch tips because it can be easily measured, while it is much harder to precisely resolve the tension causing rapid and catastrophic failure of vascular system when 100% of conduits are cavitated. Here, we use both trigger points to examine the range of mortality expected (

Different xylem vulnerabilities can then be used to predict which species will be damaged or killed by droughts under specified conditions of climate and soil type. The power of this type of hydraulic mortality model has been demonstrated in manipulative pot experiments but is yet to be confirmed under natural forest conditions (
