  <p>Output from a hydraulic model used to estimate the temporal erosions of population and genetic diversity of 
   <span class="italic">Fagus</span> trees under a future climatic scenario in central France. Depending on the amount of xylem damage expected to cause mortality two scenarios for tree decline are predicted. If 50% xylem failure is lethal (dashed line) then a collapse in adult tree number is predicted after 2020 due to xylem cavitation produced by increased transpiration and soil water deficit. A more conservative rate of tree decline is predicted if plants are able to survive up to 88% loss of xylem function (dotted line). The insert shows the distribution of tree genetic sensitivity to drought (xylem vulnerability: P
   <sub>50</sub>) at four time points in the future, showing a shift to more resistant varieties. Under this RCP8.5 scenario (continuing increase in CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions), a dramatic collapse of tree population is predicted by the middle of this century, with most vulnerable genotypes dying first.
