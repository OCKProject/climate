  <p>Different species have different vulnerability of xylem tissue to damage by cavitation. The ‘optical method’ (
   <a rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref10">Brodribb 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2017
   </a>) is a recently developed approach for quantifying the vulnerability of plant tissues to cavitation during water stress. The optical method is applied here in a 
   <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span> plant to visualize cavitation in stem and leaf xylem tissues. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Custom-built miniaturized cameras are shown installed on a stem and a leaf of an oak plant to monitor xylem cavitation events during plant dehydration. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Colour map depicting the location of xylem cavitation events in leaf veins and the level of water potential that induces those events (colour scale) on a 
   <span class="italic">Q. robur</span> leaf (scale bar, 1 mm). (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) Optical hydraulic vulnerability curve showing the cumulative embolisms visualized against the water deficit (water potential) in the plant. Plants typically die when &gt; 50% of xylem tissue is damaged, so P
   <sub>50</sub> (blue dashed line) and P
   <sub>88</sub> (red dashed line) values (i.e. water potential at which 50% and 88% of xylem vessels are embolized, respectively) describe the range of water potentials (striped grey bar) where plant mortality is likely to occur.
