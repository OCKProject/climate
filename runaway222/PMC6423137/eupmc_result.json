    "Energy budget-based distributed modeling at high-altitude glacio-nival watersheds is essential to accurately describe hydrological processes and quantify the flow rates. In this study, SNOWPACK model and its distributed version Alpine3D are applied for the first time in Pakistan to simulate the runoff response of a high altitude glaciated catchment. The basic aim was to explore the feasibility of this modeling system and its future applications in the region. Final results demonstrated satisfactory performance of the model between measured and modeled discharges with Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency of 0.54. However, total simulated flow volume differs only 1.3 times as compared to measured discharge of the lake, located at the glacier snout. Flow composition analysis revealed that the runoff regime of the study site is strongly influenced by the snow and glacier melt runoff representing 53% snowmelt and 38% glacier melt contribution. Low model efficiency has been observed during glacier melting season due to inaccurate wind speed distribution and biased input met-data. It is concluded that high performance of this model can be achieved if the model is optimized over the catchment similar to the study site provided with long term data sets. This study leaves a firm foundation for the potential application of a highly accurate distributed energy balance model in the entire Karakoram and Himalaya region to understand the melt dynamics of such a rugged terrain glacier rich mountains."
