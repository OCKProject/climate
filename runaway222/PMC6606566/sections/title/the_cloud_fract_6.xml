 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The albedo is determined by the surface type, the clouds above the surface and the response of clouds to the surface change. The response of clouds to the surface change shows regional variability as shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. The response of clouds to the surface change is expected to influence the albedo feedback. However, the key to the albedo feedback is the change of surface albedo in the process of sea ice/snow melt. Thus clouds over the melted area can impact the albedo feedback directly. In this section, we investigate the cloud coverage over the melted portion of the Arctic and the relation between the average cloud fraction and the sea ice extent.

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We define a sensitive zone as one having a significant variation in SIC during the time period analyzed: July through October. The closed section of the Arctic, which is surrounded by the continents of Asia and North America and the islands of Greenland, Svalbard, and Franz Josef’s Land, is different from the Atlantic section of the Arctic. The ocean currents have a huge impact on the Atlantic section of the Arctic Ocean which consist of open water most of the time. However, the closed section of the Arctic experiences significant variation in sea ice extent. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> shows the area of the sensitive zone which has a very large variation in SIC over the investigated time. This sensitive zone is defined as the area located between 90° East and 120° West and with standard deviation (std) of SIC larger than 0.2. The surface in this selected sensitive zone is likely to experience an annual melt- freeze up- cycle during the period of investigation (2006–2015).

    <p>The sensitive zone of sea ice during summer. The colorbar indicates the standard deviation of the average sea ice concentration during the investigated period from 2005 to 2015. The light gray color area has standard deviation of SIC smaller than 0.1. The small variation implies that the topographic type of ocean surface maintains during the investigated period. The outer part of the area that has std of SIC smaller than 0.1 is always open water while the inner part is always covered by sea ice. The area located between 90° East and 120° West, having std values greater than 0.2, is defined as the sensitive zone.</p>

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A frequently used indicator of sea ice coverage is the minimum sea ice extent which occurs in September. Considering the effect of time evolution of melt and freeze up, we use the average sea ice extent from August 15 to October 15 to examine its relation to cloud cover. On the other hand, to take into account the lag between cloud formation and enhanced evaporation after sea ice melt, the average cloud fraction during the period from August 1st to October 30th was used in this part of study.</p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The time series of the average cloud fraction (after detrending) and the average sea ice extent (after detrending) during the summer and autumn from 2006 to 2015 are shown in part (
  <span class="bold">a</span>) of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>. We note that the cloud fraction increases as the sea ice extent shrinks, and vice versa. As the sea ice extent increasing, the evaporation and cloud amount reduce. The sea ice anomaly may change from positive to negative in the sensitive zone and so as the cloud anomaly. The fluctuation of the average cloud fraction is 3% in absolute value which is smaller than the uncertainty (5% absolute value). The fluctuation of the sea ice extension is 1.5 Mkm
  <span class="sup">2</span> in absolute value and 21% compared to the minimum sea ice extent in relative value. The correlation coefficients between clouds and SIC change from positive to negative Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>. The response of clouds to the sea ice is only locally significant but not on the average over the sensitive zone. Based on the observations from 2006 to 2015, no significant relation appears between the average cloud fraction and the sea ice extent.

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the average cloud fraction only show weak relation to the change of sea ice extent, it is expected that a high percentage of melted areas, where pixels have SIC values smaller than 15%, to be covered by clouds. The statistical relation of the melted area and the melted area that is covered by clouds is shown in the right panel (
  <span class="bold">b</span>) of the Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>. About (81 ± 5)% of the melted area in the sensitive zone is covered by clouds. The essential of the albedo feedback is the wane of albedo when the surface type change from sea ice to the darker water. From the CALIPSO observation, about 81% of the melted area is covered by clouds. The uncertainty of the melted area is 0.32 Mkm
  <span class="sup">2</span> which equals to the uncertainty of 15% in the cloud fraction. The high coverage over the melted dark water can compensate about 81% of the albedo-feedback in the Arctic Ocean area.
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the process of sea ice melt, the clouds fraction maintains a constant value of 81% over the melted ocean. This phenomenon may indicate that high cloud coverage over the melted ocean dominates the impact of cloud cover on the albedo feedback. The increase in the cloud fraction in the entire sensitive zone is not significant as a function of the sea ice extent. The response to sea ice is only a second order contribution to moderate the change in albedo due to sea ice melt.</p>
