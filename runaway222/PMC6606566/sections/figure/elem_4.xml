  <p>The sensitive zone of sea ice during summer. The colorbar indicates the standard deviation of the average sea ice concentration during the investigated period from 2005 to 2015. The light gray color area has standard deviation of SIC smaller than 0.1. The small variation implies that the topographic type of ocean surface maintains during the investigated period. The outer part of the area that has std of SIC smaller than 0.1 is always open water while the inner part is always covered by sea ice. The area located between 90° East and 120° West, having std values greater than 0.2, is defined as the sensitive zone.</p>
