 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual Shannon diversity index (
  <span class="italic">H</span>), which reflects the richness and evenness (
  <a rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" href="#r35">35</a>) of the distribution (
  <a rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" href="#r36">36</a>), was calculated for the cultivated area of cultivars (cultivar diversity) and for the clusters (response diversity) in every country, because the weather extremes relative to the phenological stages of wheat appear nationally rather than throughout Europe. The statistics on the national cultivation areas for cultivars in Finland, Denmark, Belgium, France, Germany, Czechia, and Spain apart from Andalusia during the period from 1991 to 2014 were utilized. In addition, the annual response diversities were calculated based on the relative number of cultivars in each cluster in the trials by country. A Shannon index equal to zero indicates that only one cultivar (or cluster) was cultivated in the country; the Shannon index increases as the number of cultivars or clusters (richness) and/or the evenness of the distribution of hectares or trials among them increases. The Shannon index gives an equal weight to each observation and is comparable among cases with different compositions (
  <a rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" href="#r35">35</a>, 
  <a rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" href="#r36">36</a>). The Shannon index was calculated according to the following equation:
