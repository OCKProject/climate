  <a rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" href="#r22">22</a>, 
  <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>). Data on these agroclimatic variables during crop phenological stages (
  <a rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" href="#r24">24</a>) were obtained from the stations closest to the cultivar trial sites. Missing data on sowing, heading, or maturity dates were estimated based on the corresponding dates for all of the cultivars from the same site and year. If a sowing date was missing, then it was assumed that the sowing dates of all cultivars did not differ (unless stated otherwise in the metadata). If no sowing date was available for a given site and year, then all data were discarded from further analysis. If the heading and maturity dates were missing, then the missing values were estimated using correlation analysis with overlapping data for the cultivars from the same site across the other seasons. If no overlapping data or limited (five or fewer) data pairs were available, then the heading and/or maturity dates were estimated using the thermal time above 5 Â°C obtained for the given cultivar from nearby sites and preceding/subsequent seasons. The analysis described below in more detail was based on a previously suggested procedure (

  <a rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" href="#r26">26</a>).
