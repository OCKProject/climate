 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This assessment suggests that current breeding programs and cultivar selection practices do not sufficiently prepare for climatic uncertainty and variability. Human feedback to coupled social–ecological systems, such as agriculture and food systems, depends on institutional arrangements. Strong institutions can assist farmers and managers in breeding and seed trading companies to shift crop-yield-related tipping points induced by intensifying climate variability and price volatility and thus protect the stability (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The national action plans and the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union are instrumental to removing the current disincentives and introducing new incentives and regulation for diversity in crop responses to climatic uncertainties. However, regulation needs to imply sufficient flexibility to allow adaptive management and continuous collective learning. The European Commission might include effective diversification through assessment and management of response diversity in its toolkit of risk management measures for the use by the member states to support viable farm income and resilience to enhance food security (

Furthermore, the costs of the portfolio approach and benefits to security need to be quantified for communication of the value added and targeting the economic incentives in the value chain. The institutions should primarily facilitate overcoming the perceived uncertainty in costs and benefits before sufficient experiences are gathered for the transition (
