 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that the diversity of yield responses to weather patterns that are critical to yield (i.e., the proxy for the climate resilience of crops) is declining in farmers’ wheat fields in most European countries. A rapid remedy is not expected because the trend of response diversity in the cultivar trials was not much better. In farmers’ fields, the overall diversity of responses to weather began to decline in the first decade of the millennium (country-level 
  <span class="italic">P</span> values &lt;0.001 if not specified), with the sharpest decline occurring in Czechia since 2002 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>). The decline in Germany began in 2003, in Spain in 2005 or earlier (data not available), in Slovakia in 2006, and in Denmark in 2009 (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.023), leading to the lowest response diversity among the countries. The response diversity also showed a continuous declining trend from 1991 to 2014 in Czechia. This development may have contributed to the stagnation and increased variability in wheat yields in most of Europe during the same period, which has been mainly attributed to climate change (

  <a href="#r39">*</a>–
  <a rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" href="#r40">40</a>). The only country with a recent increase in response diversity was Finland, which also exhibited the greatest response diversity (

  <a rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" href="#r40">40</a>) despite the lowest number of cultivars (

  </a>) among the countries. Through the entire period from 1991 to 2014, the response diversity slightly increased in Finland, Belgium, and France (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001), but since 2006 Belgium was characterized by sharp variations and no increase (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.35), and there was no clear evidence of an increase after 2008 in France (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.13).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The diversity of crops in response to weather represents climate resilience, as confirmed by our data on the relation between the accumulated number of weather response clusters of cultivars and the interannual yield variability, as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>. The decline in yield variance due to response diversity depended on cultivar, location, and year. Even if the response diversity of wheat generally declined, the diversity of wheat cultivars grown (i.e., type diversity) tended to slightly increase in the farmers’ fields in most countries (
