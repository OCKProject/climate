 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the available sets of cultivars in northern and central Europe, a shift toward yield stability and benefit from late high solar radiation and less penalty from late heat and precipitation (cluster 3 replacing clusters 1 and 5) occurred as a response from breeders to the increased average temperatures during the late growing seasons of the 2000s (
  <a rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" href="#r40">40</a>). In contrast, in southern countries after 2000, a cluster that suffers from high minimum temperatures in summer, early drought, and heat at heading (cluster 5) more than the previously dominant clusters took over, aggravating the risk to yield loss (
  <a rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" href="#r42">42</a>). This development cannot be explained as a response of cultivar selection to climate change but may rather represent unintentional adverse side effects to selection for other traits. The response to rain appears to be a sneaking risk for the entire continent: No single wheat cultivar cluster responded positively to abundant precipitation (

  <a rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" href="#r43">43</a>) and to wet weather that favors diseases and thus results in low yield (
  <a rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" href="#r41">41</a>). The yields of individual cultivars under scarce precipitation were even doubled compared with those under abundant precipitation (PC1 in

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S1
  </span>). These empirical findings are in line with simulations that suggested that heat stress rather than drought sensitivity is the limiting factor to the adaptation of wheat to climate change in Europe (
