 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observations for each agroclimatic variable were classified into three categories because the relations between grain yield and the agroclimatic variables were nonlinear in most cases. Some variables were also strongly correlated, leading to multicollinearity in the regression analysis. The random effects of country, site, and year were known to contain most of the variation and thus had to be taken into account. The 40th and 60th percentiles of the distributions of the agroclimatic variables were used to form categories of low, moderate, and high values for each variable. For example, the grain yield observations were divided into groups based on the number of rainy days experienced from sowing to maturity: fewer than 56, between 56 and 68, and above 68. The interaction of these categories with the grain yield of each of the 991 cultivars was analyzed using the following mixed model:

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each cultivar and agroclimatic variable, the relative difference in yield between the extreme categories (high–low) was calculated. The relative difference was used to balance the differences between the yield levels of cultivars, although using the simple difference led to similar results. These data consisted of the grain yield responses of 991 cultivars to 43 agroclimatic variables. For example, the relative difference of the estimated yields of each cultivar that experienced fewer than 56 rainy days from sowing to maturity and the estimated yields of each cultivar that experienced more than 68 rainy days from sowing to maturity was calculated. Consequently, a positive grain yield response implied a positive effect of numerous rainy days.</p>
