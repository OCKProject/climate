  </span>) than at the country level, but the substantial differences in conditions aggravate the direct utilization of cultivars across Europe. Funding for targeted research and an economic incentive to companies to utilize more cultivars from the European list of approved cultivars might diversify the cultivars used in national trials. Specific parts of wheat genome were also shown responsible, for example, for temperature response (
  <a rid="r51" ref-type="bibr" href="#r51">51</a>), which can be used in breeding a wheat cultivar portfolio with sufficient response diversity for Europe. Yield losses due to weather are currently not recorded in cultivar trials, which creates a tendency to not learn from the diversity of responses to weather variability. An option for immediate improvement thus is to document yield losses due to extreme weather events, and perhaps include them in a separate analysis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The costs to breed a selection of genuinely different cultivars are likely higher than the costs to breed a homogenous selection. A broader selection also poses additional costs to traders even if indirect benefits through lower risks and reduced contract area requirements may also follow. For farmers, several cultivars do not necessarily cause additional costs but may even temporally equalize work demand. The benefits from response diversity may be greatest to the weakest actors in the wheat supply chain, such as farmers (yield stability) and disadvantaged consumers (price stability), while the public actor in charge of food security might benefit most. The development in response diversity of wheat appeared, indeed, less alarming in countries with traditions in private–public breeding partnerships such as Finland and Belgium, while in Germany, with low response diversity, private breeders have dominated for more than a century.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Farmers’ demand could act as the incentive to breeders to diversify weather responses among wheat cultivars, but farmers currently focus on yield potential and quality. There is, however, no inherent trade-off between yield potential and diversity in weather responses. Yield stability is a complementary breeding goal in addition to yield potential and the average yield in the long term. While the example given here (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>) is mainly illustrative, in Finnish regions with high barley cultivar diversity where yield variations among years were low, also the average yield was greater than that in the regions with low cultivar diversities (
  <a rid="r52" ref-type="bibr" href="#r52">52</a>). Risk aversion varies among farmers, but the notable share (46%) of yield-independent subsidies in farm income in Europe (
  <a rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" href="#r10">10</a>) acts as a disincentive to innovations for yield security. For instance, the subsidies in Czechia are lower than in most European Union countries, and most of the farmland is rented, which creates a notable cost relative to the subsidies. Consequently, the demand by farmers for drought-resistant cultivars is clearly articulated in that country. Therefore, a cultivar portfolio with diversity in responses to weather could be a prerequisite for subsidies or loss compensation to farmers, and for a reduced price of an insurance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main challenge for enhancing the diversity in crop responses to weather events and thus the climate resilience lies in the required shift of the perspective to cover this aspect. The actors in wheat supply chains must shift the focus from individual cultivars and yield potential in good conditions to a portfolio of cultivars to include complementary responses to critical weather events. The lack of awareness and experience of the diversity approach keeps the focus on individual cultivars, which have a more limited yield stability potential than a portfolio of cultivars with diverse responses. The shift in perspectives toward resilience could be achieved through simple tools to demonstrate and communicate the diversity in cultivar responses between breeders, farmers, and traders (
  <a rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" href="#r48">48</a>), good examples rewarded by recognition (
  <a rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" href="#r53">53</a>), and “learning-by-doing” facilitated by the economic incentives or, likely most effectively, regulation. Initiating a dialogue within wheat value chains, for example by national emergency supply agencies, involving also research and policy makers, could help enhance the resilience of wheat supply chains and food systems (
  <a rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" href="#r54">54</a>). Diversity in responses provides a practical means to enhance robustness under weather variability and adapt to the uncertainty in climate change through portfolios of not only cultivars but also crops (
  <a rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" href="#r18">18</a>) and even marketing channels (
  <a rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" href="#r17">17</a>).
