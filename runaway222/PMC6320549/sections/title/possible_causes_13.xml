 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Repeated selection for few desirable characteristics from a continuously homogenizing and declining cultivar or genetic pool could be the reason for the observed decline in response diversity. While no genetic erosion in terms of loss of alleles was observed for wheat before the 1990s (
  <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>, 
  <a rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" href="#r46">46</a>), such a decline in alleles was found for durum after that period (
  <a rid="r47" ref-type="bibr" href="#r47">47</a>) and such a decline cannot be excluded for wheat in general. An activity called “face-lifting” of cultivars by breeders was identified as the cause of the decline in response diversity of Finnish barley in the main cultivation areas (
  <a rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" href="#r17">17</a>, 
  <a rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" href="#r48">48</a>). The homogenization of the genetic pool could be a consequence of a lack of incentives for breeders to introduce divergent material with uncertain benefits. The observed decline in response diversity coincides with an increasing dominance of crop improvement by private breeders, which accelerated in Europe around 2000. Increased competition and demand for cost efficiency increases the pressure for a shortened breeding cycle, irrespective of technology developments, and may contribute to the greater similarity among new cultivars launched in the market (
  <a rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" href="#r48">48</a>, 
  <a rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" href="#r49">49</a>). Periods of cultivar import from surrounding countries varied with a focus on local breeding in Belgium and led to a high diversity in weather responses. Conversely, a turn to mainly local cultivar selection in Denmark narrowed the response diversity and thus reduced the climate resilience of this export-oriented agricultural country.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The obvious explanation for the alarming decline and gaps in response diversity in European wheat is the absence of the explicit perspective of resilience to intensifying climatic variability and extremes in the wheat value chain. The prioritization of the yield potential of individual cultivars under current or projected average long-term climatic conditions, with a focus on harvest index and disease resistance (
  <a rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" href="#r39">39</a>), may have been influenced by early climate projections that did not consider uncertainty and variability. Since crop responses are nonlinear and exhibit thresholds in yield and quality (
  <a rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" href="#r50">50</a>) and the climatic variability is increasing (
  <a rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" href="#r2">2</a>), the benefit of response diversity will be even greater than that suggested by past yield data. An enhancement of response diversity through increased awareness of the significance of diversity in weather responses within the available set of cultivars is therefore of primary importance for wheat production and food security.
