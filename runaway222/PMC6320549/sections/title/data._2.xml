 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Long-term data series of cultivar trials between latitudes 37.21° and 61.34° and longitudes −6.02° and 26.24° in nine countries across Europe (Finland, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Czechia, France, Slovakia, Italy, and Spain) were used. In some countries (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>), the period was limited by data availability. The trials had a randomized complete block design or an incomplete block design with two to four replicates, and their management was similar to farmer practices. The cultivars in the experiments differed over time, but standard reference cultivars were used over long periods and across several countries. Cultivars with at least 20 yield observations were included in the assessment. The total number of clustered cultivars (minimum number of observations was 20) was 36 for Finland, 90 for Italy, 113 for Belgium, 139 for France, 140 for Germany, 169 for Czechia, 186 for Spain, 188 for Slovakia, and 265 for Denmark. Annual grain yield (kilograms per hectare) was used as the response variable. The entire cultivar yield data set comprised 100,985 observations.
