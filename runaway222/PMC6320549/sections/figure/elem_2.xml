  <p>Climate resilience hotspots and deserts of European wheat. The country charts show the percentages of cultivars in each weather response cluster with different responses to weather patterns (agroclimatic PCs) critical to yield in cultivar trials. The colored (green to orange) areas on the map illustrate the response diversity classes based on the proportion of the dominant cluster (&gt;90 to &lt;50%), the number of other simultaneously important clusters (0â€“4), and the trends. All of the cultivar yield data were utilized (
