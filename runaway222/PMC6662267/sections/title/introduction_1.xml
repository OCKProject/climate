 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coastal marsh carbon is an important component of the global carbon budget (Duarte, Losada, Hendriks, Mazarrasa, &amp; Marbà, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0014">2013</a>). Coastal marshes have high primary production, efficiently trap suspended organic carbon when flooded, and undergo slow carbon decomposition rates under anaerobic conditions (McLeod et al., 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0030">2011</a>; Nellemann &amp; Corcoran, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0041">2009</a>). The amount of carbon stored per unit area in stable coastal marshes can be far greater than that of forests, and the carbon stored may remain for millennia, as compared to decades or centuries in forests (Nellemann &amp; Corcoran, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0041">2009</a>). The marshes and their carbon stocks, however, are susceptible to the direct and indirect effects of climate change (Hinson et al., 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0020">2017</a>; Nahlik &amp; Fennessy, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0036">2016</a>). Depending on the marshes' vegetation composition, the current ambient conditions, and other environmental factors such as nutrients, the marsh plant growth, and the resulting primary production can be stimulated or hindered by temperature warming, sea‐level rise, and elevated atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration (Charles &amp; Dukes, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0006">2009</a>; Erickson, Megonigal, Peresta, &amp; Drake, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0015">2007</a>; Langley &amp; Megonigal, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0026">2010</a>; Langley, Mozdzer, Shepard, Hagerty, &amp; Megonigal, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0027">2013</a>; Morris, Sundareshwar, Nietch, Kjerfve, &amp; Cahoon, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0033">2002</a>). The decomposition of marsh substrates and hence the carbon sequestration rate can be promoted or inhibited by saltwater intrusion and global warming, varying among different marsh systems and being controlled by concurrent stressors (Craft, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0011">2007</a>; Wu, Huang, Biber, &amp; Bethel, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0060">2017</a>). Given the complex and dynamic outcomes of the various factors, it is hard to predict how coastal marshes will respond to the simultaneous climatic stresses at a landscape scale. Yet, this is a key piece of information needed in order to assess ecosystem sustainability and to predict future changes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we study the multi‐decadal phenology of four distinct coastal marsh systems to gain insights into their ability to uptake carbon in relation to climate change at a broad scale (Walther et al., 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0056">2002</a>). We use the longest continuous satellite‐based record of the Earth's ecosystems, the Landsat Climatic Data Records (CDRs) and an advanced modeling technique, the nonlinear mixed model, to reconstruct the phenology between 1984 and 2014 for the different coastal marsh systems in Louisiana, USA, one of world's largest coastal marsh habitats that share the same climatic stressors as many other coastal ecosystems around the world. We speculate that climate change (i.e., temperature, sea‐level, and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations) has influenced the phenology of the marshes at the ecosystem level and that the influence is a function of whether the marshes are tidal freshwater, intermediate, brackish, or saline systems. We also hypothesize that the climatic influences will continue, if not increase, under future climate scenarios.
