  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The correlations between the growing season length and the atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration may be the result of the stimulation of elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration on photosynthesis in marsh plants (Cherry, McKee, &amp; Grace, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0007">2009</a>; Rasse, Peresta, &amp; Drake, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0043">2005</a>). This is the first study we know of that reports a positive correlation between atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration and coastal marshes' growing season length, which reflects a broad pattern of ecosystem change due to a changing climate (Walther et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0056">2002</a>). The various responses among marsh systems are likely to reflect the different physiological characteristics of the marsh plants. The intermediate and brackish marshes have a high percentage of C3 plants, whereas saline marshes are mostly C4 plants. Elevated atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> promotes the plant growth of C3 marsh species, for example, 
   <span class="italic">Schoenoplectus americanus</span>,
   <span class="italic"> Scirpus maritimus</span>,
   <span class="italic"> Scirpus olneyi</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Puccinellia maritima</span>, but does not enhance, or even impairs, the plant growth of C4 species, for example, 
   <span class="italic">Distichlis spicata</span>,
   <span class="italic"> Spartina alterniflora</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Spartina patens</span> (Arp, Drake, Pockman, Curtis, &amp; Whigham, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0001">1993</a>; Cherry et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0007">2009</a>; Drake, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0012">2014</a>; Erickson et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0015">2007</a>; Rasse et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0043">2005</a>). This is because the increased atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> stimulates photosynthesis of C3 plants, but not the photosynthesis of C4 plants that is nearly saturated under ambient conditions as C4 plants concentrate CO
   <sub>2</sub> at the site with their primary CO
   <sub>2</sub>‐fixing enzyme. Moreover, the elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub> may even inhibit the plant growth of C4 species by reducing their stomatal conductance, transpiration, and ion uptake (Ghannoum, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0016">2009</a>; Rozema et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0046">1991</a>). Yet, the freshwater marshes, which have the highest percentage of C3 plants among the different marsh systems, demonstrate no response to higher CO
   <sub>2</sub> levels in our study. One possible explanation is that the high nutrient loading in freshwater marshes—freshwater marshes are closest to the surface runoff—favors species that are unresponsive to elevated atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> (Langley &amp; Megonigal, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0026">2010</a>; Langley et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0027">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global warming has a general effect of promoting plant growth that is manifested in increasing the growing season NDVI and lengthening the active growth season, especially in the middle and high latitudes (Myneni, Keeling, Tucker, Asrar, &amp; Nemani, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0035">1997</a>; Zhou et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0061">2001</a>). Although it was reported that warming increased the annual peak biomass of the marshes in Massachusetts, USA (Charles &amp; Dukes, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0006">2009</a>), this study did not find a similar effect of temperature on the peak NDVI nor on the growing season length of the marshes in Louisiana. This result might be expected because the ambient temperatures in Louisiana (at latitudes around 30ºN) are already close to the optimum conditions for the marsh growth.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indeed, the linear models used in this study are highly simplified. These models do not consider other environmental factors, such as water temperature and nutrient availability, which can vary substantially with in situ conditions, or the nonlinear effects and the interactions among the different factors. For instance, the enhancement of CO
   <sub>2</sub> uptake by C3 plants may be eventually slowed down by photosynthetic downregulation, nutrient limitations, or increased disturbance from sea‐level rise, thus the CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization on the marshes will not continue over long time frames as decades (Erickson et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0015">2007</a>; Langley et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0027">2013</a>). In addition, the marshes may suffer from other stresses such as pests, herbivores, and pathogens that can also be intensified by a warmer climate (Van der Putten, Macel, &amp; Visser, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0055">2010</a>). Nevertheless, this study provides a “baseline” scenario for future marsh phenology with unconstrained sole impacts from temperature or CO
   <sub>2</sub>, as well as observational inputs for more advanced modeling studies.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The marsh area changes in the last 30 years</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Couvillion et al. reported that 25% of Louisiana's coastal marshes that existed in 1932 had been lost by 2010 (Couvillion et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0010">2011</a>), and this study shows that 20% of the marshes in 1988 were lost by 2013. These findings document a highly vulnerable ecosystem. Recent studies have found strong correlations between marsh area loss and several climatic variables (Turner, Kearney, &amp; Parkinson, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0054">2017</a>; Turner, Baustian, Swenson, &amp; Spicer, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0053">2006</a>; Kearney &amp; Turner, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0023">2015</a>). In this study, we further the research by separating the area changes of different marsh systems. We find that the areas of the freshwater and intermediate marshes were quite stable; while the area of the brackish and saline marshes decreased significantly and were negatively correlated with sea‐level and CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration. Indeed, the area changes of the Louisiana coastal marshes are likely to relate with both climatic and anthropogenic factors, but here we focus on the climatic factors.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea‐level rise may decrease the marsh elevation by reducing their organic accretion (Nyman, Delaune, Roberts, &amp; Patrick, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0042">1993</a>), promoting decomposition of the marsh substrates (Craft, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0011">2007</a>; Weston, Vile, Neubauer, &amp; Velinsky, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0058">2011</a>; Stagg, Schoolmaster, Krauss, Cormier, &amp; Conner, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0051">2017</a>), and increasing erosion (Smith, Cialone, Wamsley, &amp; McAlpin, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0050">2010</a>). Hence, the negative correlation between the marsh area and sea‐level can be expected. On contrary, increased air temperature and CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration can contribute to the marsh stability against sea‐level rise. The elevated air temperature and atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> may promote the marsh plant growth (for both aboveground and belowground) and thus their organic accretion (Langley, McKee, Cahoon, Cherry, &amp; Megonigal, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0025">2009</a>; Ratliff, Braswell, &amp; Marani, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0044">2015</a>). Although the enhancement of plant growth from CO
   <sub>2</sub>, as discussed earlier, is mainly for C3 plants, the fertilization of CO
   <sub>2</sub>, based on a modeling study, can increase the marsh elevation for a mixed C3 and C4 plant community (by increasing plant production) in similar magnitude to the effect of increasing inorganic sediment input (Ratliff et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0044">2015</a>). The maintenance of the marsh elevation can further benefit from the increased belowground biomass: the increased shoot density will enhance the trapping of tidally driven sediment and provide stronger protection against erosion (Temmerman, Moonen, Schoelynck, Govers, &amp; Bouma, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0052">2012</a>; Mudd, D'Alpaos, &amp; Morris, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0034">2010</a>). It should also be noted that the influence of CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization on marsh elevation is likely to depend on many other factors such as the inorganic sedimentation rate (Langley &amp; Megonigal, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0026">2010</a>; Langley et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0025">2009</a>; Ratliff et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0044">2015</a>) and may be offset by the enhanced decomposition resulted from a rising air temperature (Charles &amp; Dukes, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0006">2009</a>; Kirwan &amp; Blum, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0024">2011</a>). The fertilization effects of the increased air temperature and atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> allow the coastal marshes to be more resilient against sea‐level rise, but this study documents a significant decrease in the brackish and saline marsh systems, where the impact of sea‐level is strongest and more likely to overwhelm the fertilization effects of temperature and CO
   <sub>2</sub>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The area changes of the different marsh systems vary spatially. We find an expansion of brackish marshes into intermediate and saline marshes in the Terrebonne Basin, while saline marshes were replaced by intermediate marshes in the Barataria Basin, and brackish marshes were replaced by intermediate and freshwater marshes in the Breton Sound Basin. This study focuses on the temporal changes of the environmental factors over the past decades and only considers the sea‐level and salinity information of one station within the study area. Future studies further examine the spatial pattern of the sea‐level and salinity changes (Jankowski et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0022">2017</a>), the relative relationship between sediment supply and sea‐level rise of different locations (Mariotti &amp; Fagherazzi, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0029">2010</a>), and the availability of accommodation space (Schuerch et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0049">2018</a>) may provide more insights the spatial patterns of the area changes.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marshes' feedback to climate change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless of the causes, the increased length of the marshes' growing season has a potentially important impact on the global carbon cycles. The extended growing seasons of the intermediate and brackish marshes directly reflect an increase in aboveground primary production (and possibly an increase in the belowground biomass; Langley et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0025">2009</a>). On average, roughly 20% of the marshes net primary production results in carbon storage (Duarte &amp; Cebrian, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0013">1996</a>). The increase in aboveground biomass allows for an increase in photosynthesis and CO
   <sub>2</sub> uptake, providing a negative feedback mechanism to the elevated atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> and climate change. On the other hand, the loss of the brackish and saline marshes impairs the ecosystems' potential to capture CO
   <sub>2</sub> and the stability of the existing carbon storage, which is quite large in the coastal marsh anaerobic substrates (long‐term C accumulation rate at 18‐1713 g C m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span>; McLeod et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0030">2011</a>; Nahlik &amp; Fennessy, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0036">2016</a>). The stored carbon will be released into the ocean or the atmosphere—which can also be in the form of methane, a more potent greenhouse gas, under the marshes' anaerobic conditions (Whiting &amp; Chanton, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0059">1993</a>)—providing a positive feedback mechanism to climate change. The Louisiana coastal marshes are representatives of coastal ecosystems around the world experiencing various climatic and anthropogenic stressors (Bianchi &amp; Allison, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0002">2009</a>; Wang et al., 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0057">2007</a>). This study documents the climate‐driven long‐term phenological shifts of the marshes that, in turn, provide a negative feedback mechanism to the changing climate. A stable coastal marsh system will capture and store more carbon under a changing climate, and compensate, to some extent, for anthropogenic carbon emissions. Such mechanisms highlight the marshes' critical role in climate mitigation and emphasize the importance of the conservation and restoration of coastal ecosystems under the changing climate.
