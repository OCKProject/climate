  <a rid="ece35215-sec-0009" ref-type="sec" href="#ece35215-sec-0009">3.1</a>, we find that the peak NDVI day of the saline marshes was significantly correlated with air temperature and that the length of the growing seasons of the intermediate and brackish marshes was significantly correlated with atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05 in all cases). Based on these correlations, we use the phenological and environmental data from 1984 to 2014 to build models to predict the marshes' future phenology. The model for predicting the brackish marsh growing season length (day) is −171.0538 + 0.8606 × CO
  <sub>2</sub>. The model for predicting the intermediate marsh growing season length (day) is −139.3226 + 0.7169 × CO
  <sub>2</sub>. The model for predicting the saline marsh peak NDVI day (day of year) is −376.507 + 29.365 × Temperature.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The changes in the peak NDVI day for saline marshes will continue at the same rate (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35215-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35215-fig-0004">4</a>a). The peak NDVI day of the saline marshes moved from July to August during the past 30 years and is projected to be in September in 2050. It should be noted that based on our analysis, the changes of the peak NDVI day of saline marshes were not directly correlated to time, but were correlated to air temperate in the study area which increases over time. The changes in the brackish and intermediate marshes' growing season length will accelerate under all CO
  <sub>2</sub> emission scenarios tested (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35215-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35215-fig-0004">4</a>b,c). From 1984 to 2014, the length of the growing seasons of the intermediate and brackish marshes increased for around 40 and 50 days, at rates of 1.3 and 1.6 days/year, respectively. Under the A1F1 scenario (a future world of very rapid economic growth with fossil intensive energy sources) with the ISAM, the growing seasons of the intermediate and brackish marshes will lengthen at the highest rates, for around 140 and 175 days in the next 30 years, equals to 4 and 5 days/year, respectively. Under the B1p scenario (a convergent world with the same global population) with the BERN, the length of the growing seasons of the intermediate and brackish marshes will increase at the lowest rates—but still faster than the past 30 years—for around 80 and 90 days in the next 30 years, equals to 2.2 and 2.7 days/year, respectively. It should be noted that these predictions rely solely on air temperature and CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions scenarios and do not take nutrient limitations or other limiting factors into account.
