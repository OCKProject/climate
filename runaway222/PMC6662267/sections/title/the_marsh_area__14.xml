 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The marsh area changes in the last 30 years</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Couvillion et al. reported that 25% of Louisiana's coastal marshes that existed in 1932 had been lost by 2010 (Couvillion et al., 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0010">2011</a>), and this study shows that 20% of the marshes in 1988 were lost by 2013. These findings document a highly vulnerable ecosystem. Recent studies have found strong correlations between marsh area loss and several climatic variables (Turner, Kearney, &amp; Parkinson, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0054">2017</a>; Turner, Baustian, Swenson, &amp; Spicer, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0053">2006</a>; Kearney &amp; Turner, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0023">2015</a>). In this study, we further the research by separating the area changes of different marsh systems. We find that the areas of the freshwater and intermediate marshes were quite stable; while the area of the brackish and saline marshes decreased significantly and were negatively correlated with sea‐level and CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration. Indeed, the area changes of the Louisiana coastal marshes are likely to relate with both climatic and anthropogenic factors, but here we focus on the climatic factors.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea‐level rise may decrease the marsh elevation by reducing their organic accretion (Nyman, Delaune, Roberts, &amp; Patrick, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0042">1993</a>), promoting decomposition of the marsh substrates (Craft, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0011">2007</a>; Weston, Vile, Neubauer, &amp; Velinsky, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0058">2011</a>; Stagg, Schoolmaster, Krauss, Cormier, &amp; Conner, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0051">2017</a>), and increasing erosion (Smith, Cialone, Wamsley, &amp; McAlpin, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0050">2010</a>). Hence, the negative correlation between the marsh area and sea‐level can be expected. On contrary, increased air temperature and CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration can contribute to the marsh stability against sea‐level rise. The elevated air temperature and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> may promote the marsh plant growth (for both aboveground and belowground) and thus their organic accretion (Langley, McKee, Cahoon, Cherry, &amp; Megonigal, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0025">2009</a>; Ratliff, Braswell, &amp; Marani, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0044">2015</a>). Although the enhancement of plant growth from CO
  <sub>2</sub>, as discussed earlier, is mainly for C3 plants, the fertilization of CO
  <sub>2</sub>, based on a modeling study, can increase the marsh elevation for a mixed C3 and C4 plant community (by increasing plant production) in similar magnitude to the effect of increasing inorganic sediment input (Ratliff et al., 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0044">2015</a>). The maintenance of the marsh elevation can further benefit from the increased belowground biomass: the increased shoot density will enhance the trapping of tidally driven sediment and provide stronger protection against erosion (Temmerman, Moonen, Schoelynck, Govers, &amp; Bouma, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0052">2012</a>; Mudd, D'Alpaos, &amp; Morris, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0034">2010</a>). It should also be noted that the influence of CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization on marsh elevation is likely to depend on many other factors such as the inorganic sedimentation rate (Langley &amp; Megonigal, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0026">2010</a>; Langley et al., 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0025">2009</a>; Ratliff et al., 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0044">2015</a>) and may be offset by the enhanced decomposition resulted from a rising air temperature (Charles &amp; Dukes, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0006">2009</a>; Kirwan &amp; Blum, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0024">2011</a>). The fertilization effects of the increased air temperature and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> allow the coastal marshes to be more resilient against sea‐level rise, but this study documents a significant decrease in the brackish and saline marsh systems, where the impact of sea‐level is strongest and more likely to overwhelm the fertilization effects of temperature and CO
  <sub>2</sub>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The area changes of the different marsh systems vary spatially. We find an expansion of brackish marshes into intermediate and saline marshes in the Terrebonne Basin, while saline marshes were replaced by intermediate marshes in the Barataria Basin, and brackish marshes were replaced by intermediate and freshwater marshes in the Breton Sound Basin. This study focuses on the temporal changes of the environmental factors over the past decades and only considers the sea‐level and salinity information of one station within the study area. Future studies further examine the spatial pattern of the sea‐level and salinity changes (Jankowski et al., 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0022">2017</a>), the relative relationship between sediment supply and sea‐level rise of different locations (Mariotti &amp; Fagherazzi, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0029">2010</a>), and the availability of accommodation space (Schuerch et al., 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0049">2018</a>) may provide more insights the spatial patterns of the area changes.
