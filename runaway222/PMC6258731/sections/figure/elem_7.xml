   <span class="bold">a</span> Regression slope between annual mean change in sea ice concentration and fall surface turbulent fluxes.

   <span class="bold">c</span> Regression slope between the fall surface turbulent flux change partial temperature contribution in the Barents/Kara Seas (boxed region) and the fall longwave clear-sky partial temperature contribution across the ensemble and 
   <span class="bold">d</span> as is 
   <span class="bold">c</span> for the Beaufort/Chukchi Seas. Regions where the regression slope is significant at the 90% level are bounded by the dotted line. The statistically significant regression slopes suggest that models with larger changes in surface turbulent fluxes in the Barents/Kara and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas also produce larger increases in the downward longwave clear-sky flux across the broader Arctic
