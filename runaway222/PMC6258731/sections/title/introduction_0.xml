 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Arctic has warmed 2–3 times faster than globally-averaged warming, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification (AA)

  </span>. Because of the significant implications for the physical climate and human systems, accurate projections of AA are needed. Unfortunately, climate models project a wide range of possible futures for the Arctic—a larger inter-model spread than any other region. The 2 °C globally-averaged warming specified in the Paris Climate Agreement equates to an Arctic warming between 3 and 7 °C, according to Coupled Model Intercomparison 5 (CMIP5

Previous studies have analyzed AA in CMIP5 models, yet generally lack the regional perspective required to isolate the energy exchanges that appear to regulate AA in observations

 <p id="Par555" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Our results outline the primary drivers of inter-model spread in AA found in CMIP5 models using a surface energy budget perspective highlighting the important contribution of seasonal energy exchange in sea ice retreat regions facilitated by ocean heat storage to the inter-model spread in Arctic warming. We argue that the atmospheric and ocean processes that modulate the seasonal energy exchange in sea ice retreat regions drive model differences in projected Arctic warming. The models that more effectively disperse energy drawn from the surface in sea ice retreat regions warm more. Therefore, reconciling the differences in AA projections requires constraining the representation of atmosphere-ocean-sea ice interactions in sea ice retreat regions.</p>
