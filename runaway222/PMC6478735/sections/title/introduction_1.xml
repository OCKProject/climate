  </span>, manifested by a decrease in sea ice, snow and glaciers and permafrost degradation relative to their benchmark average states for the period between 1979 and 2005

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. These changes can accelerate global warming further through a variety of climatic feedbacks. Carbon from thawing permafrost released into the atmosphere results in the permafrost carbon feedback (PCF)

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Decreasing sea ice and land snow covers increase solar absorption in high latitudes, causing the surface albedo feedback (SAF)

  </span>. Both feedbacks amplify the anthropogenic signal.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PCF and SAF represent three of the thirteen main tipping elements the Earth’s climate system identified in recent surveys
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Tipping elements are physical processes acting as positive nonlinear climate and biosphere feedbacks that, after passing a threshold, could irreversibly shift the planetary system to a new warmer state
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. They could cause additional impacts on ecosystems, economies and societies throughout the world. The risk of triggering the tipping elements is one of the arguments for adopting the ambitious 1.5 °C and 2 °C targets in the Paris Agreement

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Therefore, a rigorous quantitative assessment of the climate tipping elements under different climatic and socio-economic scenarios is required to estimate their impacts and narrow down the uncertainties.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite significant advances documented by the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, projections of future climate using general circulation models (GCMs) from the 5th climate model inter-comparison project (CMIP5) do not include the PCF
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>, although several models are set to incorporate the PCF in their next versions as part of CMIP6. Consequently, most climate policy assessments based on results from the GCMs underestimate the extent of global warming in response to anthropogenic emissions. The SAF, on the other hand, is present in GCM climate projections through the coupling of sea ice and land surface models to atmosphere and ocean models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. However, existing estimates of the total economic impact of climate change under different policy assumptions using integrated assessment models (IAMs) assume that radiative forcing from the SAF increases linearly with global mean temperature

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we explore nonlinear transitions in the state-dependent PCF and SAF, and estimate the resulting climatic and economic impacts globally. To perform the analysis, we develop dynamic model emulators of the nonlinear PCF and SAF, which are comparatively simple statistical surrogates of the highly complex physical models. The emulators are integrated within PAGE-ICE, a new development of the PAGE09 IAM

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The climatic impacts focus on changes in the global mean surface temperature (GMST) and the economic impacts focus on the net present value (NPV) of the total cost associated with future climate change. We consider a wide range of scenarios: zero emissions after 2020, the 1.5 °C and 2 °C targets for 2100 and the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) from the Paris Agreement, and a business as usual (BaU) scenario. We also introduce an intermediate 2.5 °C target, which requires more mitigation than is proposed by the NDCs, and an NDCs Partial scenario with a persistent under-delivery on pledges consistent with an estimated long-term effect of the US’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. The scenarios extend out to 2300 to capture the effects of multiple slow physical processes including the PCF and the loss of the winter sea ice under high emissions pathways. While very long horizons like this may appear irrelevant from the point of view of the actual socio-economic processes, the well-established technological, demographic and resource constraints

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the PCF and SAF, Arctic feedbacks include carbon emissions from thawing sub-sea permafrost, boreal forest uptake and changes in ocean circulation from the melting of the Greenland ice sheet
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>, which we do not explicitly simulate it in this study. Emissions from thawing sub-sea permafrost on Arctic shelf are poorly understood in comparison with land permafrost emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. The boreal forest and Greenland ice sheet feedbacks are beyond the scope of this study, along with the non-Arctic tipping elements and other major uncertain elements in the climate system such as the cloud feedback
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. While not modelled directly, many of these effects are included implicitly in the PAGE-ICE IAM through a number of uncertain climate system parameters constrained according to the latest literature (

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show that the PCF gets progressively stronger in warmer climates, while the SAF weakens. Both feedbacks are characterised by nonlinear equilibrium responses to warming. The PCF also develops state-dependent lagged behaviour. Compared with zero PCF and constant SAF, which are the legacy values that have been used in climate policy modelling to date, the combined nonlinear PCF and SAF cause statistically significant extra warming globally under the low and medium emissions scenarios. For high emissions scenarios, the strength of the PCF saturates, and the weakening SAF gradually cancels the warming effect of the PCF; for BaU, this takes place from the second half of the 22nd century onwards. Nevertheless, under all scenarios, the predominantly warmer future climate associated with the nonlinear PCF and SAF relative to their legacy values translates into marginal increases in the total discounted economic effect of climate change. These increases, which are significant for all scenarios except for BaU, occur through additional temperature-driven impacts on economy, ecosystems and human health, additional impacts from sea level rise, as well as highly uncertain extra impacts from social discontinuities and climate tipping elements other than the PCF and SAF. Even with the legacy PCF and SAF, emissions pathways in the range between the 1.5 °C and 2 °C targets lead to the lowest total economic effects of climate change compared to all other scenarios. Considering the nonlinear PCF and SAF makes the pathways towards the lower end of the range covered by the Paris Agreement targets marginally more economically attractive.</p>
