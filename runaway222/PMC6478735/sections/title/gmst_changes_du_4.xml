  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> shows the means and ±1SD ranges of the absolute changes in GMST until 2300 due to the nonlinear PCF, SAF and PCF &amp; SAF combined, measured relative to their respective legacy values. The GMST changes from the PCF and SAF are smaller than the underlying uncertainty in the base climate projections in PAGE-ICE with legacy constant SAF and zero PCF (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>; note the different vertical scale). However, with few exceptions, the values plotted in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> represent statistically significant shifts in the state of the climate system due to the two feedbacks at the 95% confidence level (the exceptions are listed in the Fig.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the legacy value is zero, the PCF increases GMST for all scenarios (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). The slow response of permafrost to thaw means the change in GMST before 2100 due to the PCF is nearly the same for all scenarios except Zero Emissions. The difference between the scenarios only becomes apparent in the 22nd and 23rd centuries, with the GMST effect of the PCF becoming progressively stronger as emissions increase towards BaU. The GMST increases are virtually indistinguishable between NDCs, NDCs Partial and BaU because the marginal effect on GMST of additional CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions from the PCF drops as total atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations increase. In addition, the highest emissions scenarios exhaust the permafrost carbon stocks in some simulations, causing a drop in the annual CO
  <sub>2</sub> flux from permafrost beyond 2200. This results in carbon removal from the atmosphere through CO
  <sub>2</sub> ocean uptake (Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) and causes a slight decline in the GMST effect of the PCF in the 23rd century for the BaU scenario.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nonlinear SAF is dominated by the decrease of its sea ice and land snow components (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), resulting in less warming and negative GMST changes compared to the constant legacy SAF (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). The NDCs, NDCs Partial and BaU scenarios have the largest temperature increases and greatest decreases in land snow and sea ice SAF components, and thus show the greatest negative differences in GMST. The differences are the highest for BaU with nearly ice-free oceans and snow-free land even in winter after 2200. For the Zero Emissions, 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C and 2.5 °C scenarios, there are small increases in GMST for the entire time period due to the small peaks in the sea ice and land snow SAF components within this temperature range (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Overall, the constant legacy SAF appears reasonable for low emission scenarios, but overestimates GMST for high emission scenarios according to the current generation of climate models (CMIP5), with no apparent tipping points (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nonlinear SAF can partially compensate for the PCF (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>). For the high emission NDC, NDC Partial, and BaU scenarios, reduced warming due to the nonlinear response of the SAF partially cancels out warming due to the PCF. The effect is strongest for the BaU scenario, where the change in GMST from the legacy value switches sign from positive to negative. The SAF slightly amplifies the PCF for the low emission scenarios where the constant SAF forcing assumption remains valid (Zero Emissions, 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C and 2.5 °C). This means IAMs that do not include the PCF and assume a constant SAF will underestimate GMST by between 0.1 and 0.2 C for all but the highest emissions scenarios. These findings stemming from the nonlinearities both in the PCF and SAF have been overlooked in climate policy studies so far (Supplementary Note
