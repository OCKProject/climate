 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PAGE and similar IAMs do not model natural climate variability, and therefore each Monte-Carlo run is deterministic in time. This allows us to work with Monte-Carlo generated probability distributions of multiple climatic and economic parameters in any fixed analysis year like 2100, as opposed to taking averages over the 30-year climatological windows (a standard requirement for any climate model data with multiple natural variability cycles). The ranges for all the uncertain parameters in PAGE-ICE are listed in the Supplementary Table

 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Generic updates in PAGE-ICE: first, adjusted analysis years starting with 2015 (base year), 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050, 2075, 2100, 2150, 2200, 2250 and 2300, allowing for a better representation of the essential long-term processes: permafrost emissions, winter sea ice and land snow decline and melting of the ice sheets; second, updated base year (2015) data for the emissions, temperature, population, GDP-PPP, cumulative permafrost emissions and surface albedo feedback, with uncertainty ranges for most parameters; third, updated set of emissions (RCP) and socio-economic (SSP) scenarios paired according to the RCP-SSP compatibility conditions
