 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have investigated the climatic and economic impacts of two major planetary feedbacks associated with the decline of Arctic land permafrost, snow and sea ice. PCF is caused by additional CO
  <sub>2</sub> and methane emissions from thawing permafrost, and SAF is mostly driven by increased solar absorption due to the decline of Arctic sea ice and land snow covers. These two feedbacks belong to the main tipping elements in the Earth’s climate system identified by recent surveys
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Model simulations indicate that both feedbacks accelerate the warming and are nonlinear, with the PCF being the stronger of the two, while most climate policy studies to date have assumed constant positive SAF and zero PCF, which we refer to as the legacy values. All this warrants their rigorous quantitative assessment. To perform such an assessment, we developed novel statistical emulators of the two Arctic feedbacks calibrated according to simulations results from the specialised land surface and general circulation models. The emulators allow one to study the entire parameter space, which is not possible with complex physical models, and also help establish dynamic links between highly specialized climate and economic models. We implemented the emulators dynamically inside the new integrated assessment model (IAM) PAGE-ICE, allowing us to explore nonlinear interactions between the Arctic feedbacks and the global climate and socio-economic systems under a range of scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement.

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the current parameterisations in PAGE-ICE, adding the significant corrections from the nonlinear Arctic feedbacks to the base estimates of the mean total economic effect of climate change makes the 1.5 °C target ($638 trillion) marginally more economically attractive than the 2 °C target ($646 trillion). While the total economic effects of the 1.5 °C and 2 °C scenarios are statistically equivalent (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>), we have several reasons to believe it would be prudent to aim for emissions towards the bottom end of the range covered by these scenarios. First, the PAGE-ICE model, in common with other aggregate IAMs, does not explicitly model other known climatic tipping elements such as Amazon rainforest, boreal forest, coral reefs and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as well as ocean acidification and climate-induced large-scale migration and conflict
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span> (we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the total economic effects of climate change are the same for these scenarios either at the 5% or at the 10% significance level). Some of these effects are already included implicitly in the highly uncertain non-economic and discontinuity impact sectors in PAGE-ICE, contributing to the long upper tails in the distributions of the total economic effect of climate change in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>; even with the current parameterisations, the upper tails in the distributions are at their lowest for the 1.5 °C scenario. It is possible that with an explicit modelling of the other climatic and societal tipping elements, as well as with comprehensive representation of the impacts of rising temperatures and increasing extreme weather events on economic growth
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span>, both the economic effect of climate change with legacy Arctic feedbacks, and the additional impacts due to the nonlinear PCF and SAF, would be higher compared to those reported here. The associated global risks are minimised at lower emissions. Second, it is possible that recent reduction trends in the costs of mitigation technologies such as solar power

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span>, which are captured by PAGE-ICE, could accelerate further if appropriate policy instruments such as carbon prices are implemented globally. Third, PAGE-ICE does not account for possible co-benefits of deep mitigation as part of a wider green growth transition in economy

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nonlinear transitions in the two feedbacks explored in this study demonstrate the pressing need for a better understanding of state-dependent processes in the Earth’s climate system, both those associated with the Arctic and beyond. This is important because triggering these and other planetary feedbacks might accelerate the pace of climate change
