  </span>. While the state-dependencies in the planetary feedbacks require further investigations as part of CMIP6, the evidence so far suggests that apart from the SAF effects presented here, the magnitudes of the feedbacks are less likely to decrease with GMST. This implies that our estimates for the impacts of the state-dependent PCF and SAF are likely to be on a conservative side.

  </span>. Of the two most recent studies on the cloud feedback that were based on observational constraints, one matched closely with the ECS parameterisation from IPCC AR5 adopted in PAGE-ICE, suggesting that our climate projections are robust. The uncertainties in the permafrost models used in this study, robustness of our PCF and SAF emulators, and uncertainties in other key parameterisations such as the carbon cycle, sea level rise, mitigation business as usual pathway and economic impacts of rising temperatures are discussed in Methods and
