 <p>The PAGE-ICE model (v6.22) and the associated pre- and post-processing computer codes are included in the SupplementaryÂ 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">Code</a> files. The SiBCASA and JULES models are managed, respectively, by expert teams at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (US) and at the UK Met Office, and are not included in this publication due to their complexity.
