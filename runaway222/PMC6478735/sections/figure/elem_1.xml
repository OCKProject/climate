  <p>Three components of the surface albedo feedback deduced from simulations of fully coupled climate models. SAF components (average global equivalent values) for 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Arctic sea ice, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Northern Hemisphere land snow and 
   <span class="bold">c</span> rest of the world, presented as functions of the GMST rise relative to pre-industrial conditions. Obtained from multiple CMIP5 GCMs using the ALL/CLR method. Solid red line: multi-model mean; shaded area: ±1 standard deviation (SD). Horizontal black dashed lines: legacy SAF forcing currently assumed in IAMs. Source data are provided as a Source Data file
