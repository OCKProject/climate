  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The repeat ATPI scores for Team A showed improvement from the original scores, with a wide gap between Team A’s scores and those of the comparison group for Team A. There was an improvement in scores in 24 of the 52 components of the ATPI. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2</a> illustrates the shift the team made from average to above and well above average. The increase in below average is due to two ‘reverse’ scores relating to team conflict moving from average to below average, a positive move.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the first measurement, team members reported that they did not need to work interdependently, which changed on the repeat measurement. At the repeat measurement, team members also perceived that the team had clear and shared objectives, and that there was an increased level of commitment to the team’s objectives. At time 2, they reported fewer conflicts about how the team’s tasks should be performed and interpersonal conflicts between team members were reported as infrequent or minor in nature.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The team also had an increased focus on the needs of the patient as well as an increased concern for quality. The team climate improved to be very supportive of creativity and innovation with team members continuing to offer practical support to each other to develop new ideas or ways of working. The team leader was seen as effective in acquiring the resources needed by the team and for the QI project and being more available to the team.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, there was improved satisfaction with the recognition the team members received from colleagues for their contribution to the team and with the way in which conflicts are resolved. Team members reported a stronger level of attachment to the team and team member colleagues. They reported that they were now much more encouraged to work collaboratively with other teams, the biggest area of improvement for Team A. The team had improved levels of cooperation with other relevant teams within the organisation.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the repeat assessment, Team A was perceived to be a high-performing team by its members, an improvement from the initial ATPI assessment. The largest increases in scores were for working interdependently (from below average to above average) and the team leader’s encouragement of interteam working (from average to well above average). The team scored lower on only four components between the two times of measurement, which included a reduction in the level of challenge to the team due to completing the QI project.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Team A’s performance changes as a team need to be placed in context: Shortly after the start of the QI project, major changes were made in allocation of inpatient beds for the orthopaedic service in the hospital and the roles of some members of the team were under threat for several weeks. In addition, in the same time period, team members were getting ready for and going through a major inspection by the health and social care regulator.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Team B</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At time 1, 39 of 57 staff in Team B completed the ATPI and 39 of 54 staff completed the repeat ATPI at time 2. The spider diagrams in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">figure 3</a> show how Team B’s performance compared with scores by individual subgroups of staff and overall for the team as a whole. Team B’s initial scores on the ATPI were poor; the team generally performed worse than the comparison group. When the results were fed back to the team, team members agreed that the scores reflected how team members felt.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4</a> shows the distribution of scores on individual components of the ATPI, illustrating the shift the team made, removing almost all the below average scores and achieving a significant number of above average ratings. On the repeat ATPI assessment at time 2, Team B generally performed better than the comparable clinical service teams. There was a large improvement in overall team effectiveness. The team members developed greater clarity about their task and established shared objectives. The team’s scores on all aspects of participation, including decision-making, communication and regular meetings, improved. Team conflict also reduced.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The team became more patient focused with an increased concern for quality. The team climate was reported to be more supportive of creativity and innovation with team members sometimes offering practical support to each other in developing new ways of working, and being much more supportive of teamworking.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The team leader was seen as being more effective in acquiring the resources needed by the team and providing clear direction in relation to expected team performance. There was improvement in the team leader’s management of the team’s processes, monitoring of performance, encouragement of interteam working and recognition and reward. There was a striking improvement in the ratings for team satisfaction, with team members above average on all measures of satisfaction. Also, team members reported a stronger level of attachment to the team and team member colleagues.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In subgroup analysis, the ratings for trained staff (nurses and therapists) moved from well below average to well above average, when compared with norm groups. The multidisciplinary Steering Group members’ ratings also rose to above average from average; however, the one component on which Steering Group members scored below average indicates that they feel they no longer have a challenging task to perform now that the QI project has been completed. Administrative staff members’ ratings moved from below average to average. Ratings stayed at similar levels for night staff and mental health support workers.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Again, the context for Team B’s performance is relevant: the unit in which the QI project was based was under continuous scrutiny concerning a potential reduction in the number of patients cared for. A few of the mental health support workers who were part of the team when the QI project began left the team to take advantage of better economic opportunities. It is possible that replacement staff did not take part in the QI or team-related workshops or meetings.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both teams</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both teams, the data from before and after assessments on the ATPI present a compelling picture of significant overall improvement in team-based working. Team A became a high-performing team by the completion of the team’s QI project. Team B, comprising more than 50 staff many of whom are support workers, began as a poorly performing team. Following participation in the QI experience, they reported above average satisfaction, a high positive profile in their organisation and a large overall improvement in team effectiveness.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both teams reported that they perceived they no longer have a challenging task to work on because they achieved the improvements they intended in their QI projects.</p>
