 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Aston Team Performance Inventory (ATPI) was used to measure team performance of the two teams. The ATPI is a validated comprehensive measure of team performance, which has been used to evaluate the functioning of teams in clinical settings in healthcare organisations.
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">14–18</a> Team members categorise their performance as a team in 18 dimensions, grouped under team inputs, processes, leadership processes and outputs, by completing online 100 questionnaire items consisting of rating scales. The dimensions in the ATPI are summarised in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both teams volunteered to complete the ATPI and staff in each team who were willing and available completed the questionnaire approximately 3 months after the start of the QI Team Fellowship. An ATPI accredited facilitator (LW) administered, analysed and interpreted the results for both teams.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Team members’ answers on the ATPI were collated and a mean score for each component was calculated. These scores were compared with scores from a representative sample of comparable teams (norm groups). The analysis involves comparison of scores to the norm group scores to determine the position of the team’s scores: well below average is defined as in the bottom 9% of team scores; below average in the next 24% of team scores; average in the middle 34% of team scores; above average in the next 24% of team scores; or well above average in the top 9% of team scores. The dimension of team conflict is scored in reverse. The analysis also considers the extent to which team members agree in their views on each dimension.</p>
