 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study has a number of limitations. It involved only two teams in two NHS Trusts. The work extended over only 12 months, and data were not available to confirm if the improvements in the quality of care were sustained over a longer time. It is unknown what the effects would be with substantial turnover in staff or leaders of the teams.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the two teams were focusing on care for the same type of patients, that is, patients with dementia, the nature of the services provided by the teams was substantially different: Team A provided care for patients having orthopaedic surgery on an acute orthopaedic surgical ward; Team B provided care for female elderly patients with a range of mental health conditions, including dementia. The NHS Trusts where the services are located are in different cities and have somewhat different population profiles.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The QI Team Fellowship was funded for 1â€‰year only; therefore, it was not possible to follow the teams over a longer time period to confirm whether or not the improvements achieved both in care and in teamwork were sustained over time. Both teams received awards from their Trusts months after completion of the study, based on the evidence of improvements the teams achieved; however, it is not known if the improvements have been sustained long term. Also, the staff who make up teams in a workplace change, and the effect of staff turnover on team performance is unknown.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the study is limited to two teams providing care to patients with dementia, the findings cannot be generalised to other teams providing care to other types of patients in other care settings.</p>
