 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both teams, the data from before and after assessments on the ATPI present a compelling picture of significant overall improvement in team-based working. Team A became a high-performing team by the completion of the teamâ€™s QI project. Team B, comprising more than 50 staff many of whom are support workers, began as a poorly performing team. Following participation in the QI experience, they reported above average satisfaction, a high positive profile in their organisation and a large overall improvement in team effectiveness.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both teams reported that they perceived they no longer have a challenging task to work on because they achieved the improvements they intended in their QI projects.</p>
