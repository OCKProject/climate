 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Involvement of a multidisciplinary team and skilled facilitation of teamwork on a QI project have been recognised as key factors in the success of QI in healthcare organisations. If teamwork is key to achieving improvements in patient care, some questions emerge for healthcare organisations. Can an assumption be made that professionals working in clinical settings function effectively as teams? What are the processes that produce successful teamworking in clinical environments? How does participation in a QI project work to change the way a team performs?</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a large-scale study of team-based working in NHS Trusts using findings from a national NHS staff survey, Carter and colleagues
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">16</a> reported that nearly 90% of NHS staff said they worked in a team. When West’s
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">20</a> definition of a team (clear shared team objectives; role interdependence and clarity; meeting regularly to review and improve performance) was applied through survey questions, only 56% of staff respondents could be classified as working in a well-structured ‘real team.’ The research team concluded that comparatively large numbers of staff in NHS Trusts work in poorly functioning ‘pseudo’ teams, that is, groups where there is no attention to collective performance.

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A number of processes that underpin teamworking have been identified from synthesis of the literature.
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">17</a> These processes include: a shared sense of purpose; pooling of resources; collaboration and coordination; efficient, open and equitable communication; shared responsibility and influence; support and value; critically reviewing performance and decisions; generating and implementing new ideas; individual learning; leadership; tactical communication; role blurring; and team behavioural norms. A group of staff working together to achieve a well-defined improvement in the quality of patient care is likely to experience many if not all of the processes identified.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Healthcare organisations are routinely expecting individual members of staff or small teams to work on QI projects, using one of the well-established approaches to QI including the PDSA cycle, lean, six sigma or re-engineering. Some teams are successful in achieving intended improvements; some are not and no one approach to QI is more effective than any other approach.
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a> A question is, therefore, what made the approach to QI used with Team A and Team B effective both in improving teamwork and in achieving important improvements in patient care.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Traditional approaches to QI all begin with a problem to solve, a service to improve or a change to implement. They do not begin with the team doing the work or do not explicitly recognise the need for a functional team to carry out the work. An assumption is often made that a group of individuals will be motivated to carry out the QI-related work. What is unique about the QI model used with Team A and Team B is that the QI process started with the team itself. The first stages in the A-TEAM model taught the team members how to work together to reach consensus as a team on the improvement subject and objective. The second stage taught the team members to test their own commitment and the commitment of their key stakeholders to the team’s QI project.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We believe that this investment in developing teamworking skills within the team itself contributed significantly to the way the teams worked on their QI projects. West’s characteristics of a team became embedded in the QI process through the A-TEAM model: the team members learnt how to develop a shared objective; that they could not achieve the objective without working interdependently; that they needed to have clear roles within the team, including for the leader; and how to use meetings to review and advance their progress on achieving the objective.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both teams achieved their improvement objectives with both quantitative and qualitative evidence of the effects of the changes in practice they made. Examples included: significantly improved compliance with evidence-based practice relating to patients with dementia; reduction in behaviour-related incidents involving patients with dementia; improved staff and carer satisfaction with services provided; and for Team B, reduction in total length of stay and use of sedative medications. In addition, the measures of team performance of the two teams at different points in time show that the QI process itself the teams experienced influenced positively how they perform as teams. The study indicates the need for more research on the relationship between team development as part of the QI process itself and the longer term functioning of teams in clinical settings.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study has a number of limitations. It involved only two teams in two NHS Trusts. The work extended over only 12 months, and data were not available to confirm if the improvements in the quality of care were sustained over a longer time. It is unknown what the effects would be with substantial turnover in staff or leaders of the teams.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the two teams were focusing on care for the same type of patients, that is, patients with dementia, the nature of the services provided by the teams was substantially different: Team A provided care for patients having orthopaedic surgery on an acute orthopaedic surgical ward; Team B provided care for female elderly patients with a range of mental health conditions, including dementia. The NHS Trusts where the services are located are in different cities and have somewhat different population profiles.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The QI Team Fellowship was funded for 1 year only; therefore, it was not possible to follow the teams over a longer time period to confirm whether or not the improvements achieved both in care and in teamwork were sustained over time. Both teams received awards from their Trusts months after completion of the study, based on the evidence of improvements the teams achieved; however, it is not known if the improvements have been sustained long term. Also, the staff who make up teams in a workplace change, and the effect of staff turnover on team performance is unknown.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the study is limited to two teams providing care to patients with dementia, the findings cannot be generalised to other teams providing care to other types of patients in other care settings.</p>
