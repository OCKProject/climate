 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At time 1, 39 of 57 staff in Team B completed the ATPI and 39 of 54 staff completed the repeat ATPI at time 2. The spider diagrams in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">figure 3</a> show how Team B’s performance compared with scores by individual subgroups of staff and overall for the team as a whole. Team B’s initial scores on the ATPI were poor; the team generally performed worse than the comparison group. When the results were fed back to the team, team members agreed that the scores reflected how team members felt.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4</a> shows the distribution of scores on individual components of the ATPI, illustrating the shift the team made, removing almost all the below average scores and achieving a significant number of above average ratings. On the repeat ATPI assessment at time 2, Team B generally performed better than the comparable clinical service teams. There was a large improvement in overall team effectiveness. The team members developed greater clarity about their task and established shared objectives. The team’s scores on all aspects of participation, including decision-making, communication and regular meetings, improved. Team conflict also reduced.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The team became more patient focused with an increased concern for quality. The team climate was reported to be more supportive of creativity and innovation with team members sometimes offering practical support to each other in developing new ways of working, and being much more supportive of teamworking.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The team leader was seen as being more effective in acquiring the resources needed by the team and providing clear direction in relation to expected team performance. There was improvement in the team leader’s management of the team’s processes, monitoring of performance, encouragement of interteam working and recognition and reward. There was a striking improvement in the ratings for team satisfaction, with team members above average on all measures of satisfaction. Also, team members reported a stronger level of attachment to the team and team member colleagues.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In subgroup analysis, the ratings for trained staff (nurses and therapists) moved from well below average to well above average, when compared with norm groups. The multidisciplinary Steering Group members’ ratings also rose to above average from average; however, the one component on which Steering Group members scored below average indicates that they feel they no longer have a challenging task to perform now that the QI project has been completed. Administrative staff members’ ratings moved from below average to average. Ratings stayed at similar levels for night staff and mental health support workers.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Again, the context for Team B’s performance is relevant: the unit in which the QI project was based was under continuous scrutiny concerning a potential reduction in the number of patients cared for. A few of the mental health support workers who were part of the team when the QI project began left the team to take advantage of better economic opportunities. It is possible that replacement staff did not take part in the QI or team-related workshops or meetings.</p>
