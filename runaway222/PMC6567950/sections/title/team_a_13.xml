 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The repeat ATPI scores for Team A showed improvement from the original scores, with a wide gap between Team A’s scores and those of the comparison group for Team A. There was an improvement in scores in 24 of the 52 components of the ATPI. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2</a> illustrates the shift the team made from average to above and well above average. The increase in below average is due to two ‘reverse’ scores relating to team conflict moving from average to below average, a positive move.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the first measurement, team members reported that they did not need to work interdependently, which changed on the repeat measurement. At the repeat measurement, team members also perceived that the team had clear and shared objectives, and that there was an increased level of commitment to the team’s objectives. At time 2, they reported fewer conflicts about how the team’s tasks should be performed and interpersonal conflicts between team members were reported as infrequent or minor in nature.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The team also had an increased focus on the needs of the patient as well as an increased concern for quality. The team climate improved to be very supportive of creativity and innovation with team members continuing to offer practical support to each other to develop new ideas or ways of working. The team leader was seen as effective in acquiring the resources needed by the team and for the QI project and being more available to the team.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, there was improved satisfaction with the recognition the team members received from colleagues for their contribution to the team and with the way in which conflicts are resolved. Team members reported a stronger level of attachment to the team and team member colleagues. They reported that they were now much more encouraged to work collaboratively with other teams, the biggest area of improvement for Team A. The team had improved levels of cooperation with other relevant teams within the organisation.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the repeat assessment, Team A was perceived to be a high-performing team by its members, an improvement from the initial ATPI assessment. The largest increases in scores were for working interdependently (from below average to above average) and the team leader’s encouragement of interteam working (from average to well above average). The team scored lower on only four components between the two times of measurement, which included a reduction in the level of challenge to the team due to completing the QI project.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Team A’s performance changes as a team need to be placed in context: Shortly after the start of the QI project, major changes were made in allocation of inpatient beds for the orthopaedic service in the hospital and the roles of some members of the team were under threat for several weeks. In addition, in the same time period, team members were getting ready for and going through a major inspection by the health and social care regulator.</p>
