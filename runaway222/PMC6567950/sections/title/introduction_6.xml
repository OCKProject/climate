 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Healthcare systems throughout the world are focused on achieving improvements in the quality of patient care using the concept of quality improvement (QI).
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">1–3</a> A number of strategies and approaches, for example, Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA), lean, value stream analysis, six sigma, re-engineering, have been applied in healthcare organisations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The importance of teams and skilled facilitation of teamwork on a QI project has been recognised.
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">5–10</a> These studies have limitations, particularly the lack of evidence on the attributes of successful and unsuccessful team QI initiatives, how to establish and implement QI teams and the contribution of selected QI interventions.
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">11</a> It has also been unclear if teamwork demonstrated in the completion of a QI project is sustained over time and can be generalised to other teamwork functions other than QI.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">QI Fellowships have been established in some National Health Service (NHS) organisations in England to teach and support for individual clinicians interested in carrying out a QI project. In recognition of the evidence on teams and QI, a QI Team Fellowship was offered to clinical teams working in a Region in the English NHS. The QI Team Fellowship provided face-to-face learning on QI, skilled QI facilitation and team coaching for teams of staff interested in carrying out a QI project. Staff teams applied and were selected to participate in the QI Team Fellowship.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper reports on the experience of two teams that participated in this QI Team Fellowship and the effects of participation on their performance as teams in clinical settings 1 year later. Evidence of the specific improvements in quality of care achieved by the teams for patients with dementia has been previously reported elsewhere.
