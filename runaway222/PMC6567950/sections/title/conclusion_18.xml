 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study demonstrates that a structured team-based learning approach to QI that emphasises development of the team as part of the process can have effects over at least 1â€‰year on the performance of two teams in their clinical settings, as measured by the ATPI validated team performance tool. It is notable that on repeat measurement, both teams perceived a reduction in the level of challenge to the team due to completing their QI projects. It is unknown if the findings can be generalised to other teams or other settings, or if other approaches to QI would have the same effect.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study indicates the need for more research on the relationship between team development as part of the QI process itself and the longer term performance of teams in clinical settings.</p>
