 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A structured package of QI interventions was provided for both teams, consisting of standardised workshops and facilitation as needed. The workshops included content on: the QI process; tools to reach consensus on decisions within the team; and how to design the QI project; involve key stakeholders; carry out baseline measurement of the effects of current performance; analyse findings; and plan and implement change interventions. For purposes of the QI training, a simple model for QI was derived from the major approaches to QI (lean, six sigma, and so on). To emphasise the need for teamwork on a QI project, stages in the QI model were explained using an acronym, A–TEAM. The stages are described in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first workshop, teams completed the Agree and Test commitment stages and decided how to establish a baseline for their projects. All staff in Team A participated in the workshop. Because of the size of Team B, a multidisciplinary Steering Group consisting of representatives of all staff groups participated in the first workshop. The workshop was repeated twice for Team B in order to involve all members of staff, particularly in reaching consensus on and testing commitment to the QI project.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In subsequent workshops, held approximately 6–8 weeks apart, teams designed the measurement of current practice, analysed problems and planned change. The workshops also reviewed teams’ progress, provided technical guidance and contributed to resolving problems encountered by the teams. Team B’s Steering Group requested an additional workshop 3 months after the implementation of changes in practice, to share the data gathered from repeat measurement with as many staff as possible, celebrate the team’s success and learn what further actions were needed to sustain the improvements.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The same teacher, an experienced QI facilitator (ND), presented all the workshops and attended all QI meetings with teams. The same teaching materials were used for both teams.</p>
