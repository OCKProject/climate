 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On completion of the team performance assessment at time 1, the ATPI accredited facilitator (LW) met individually with each team leader to discuss the report. The ATPI facilitator and each team leader then presented the findings to the members of each team and discussed the implications with the team members. The ATPI facilitator also provided a team coaching session for each team, and participated in the QI ‘feedback’ workshop that was requested by Team B. No specific method was used to develop team leadership, apart from use of the QI tools to build the team and feedback from the ATPI assessments.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The teams’ QI project proposals were reviewed and approved by their NHS Trusts. The provider of the QI interventions screened the teams’ proposals for any ethical issues prior to the start of the work, using a checklist derived from the literature,
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">19</a> and determined that there were none. All staff who responded to the ATPI volunteered to complete the questionnaire. The teams both consented to the anonymous presentation of their performance on the ATPI. Thus, it was deemed by the funding organisation that there were no ethical issues associated with the evaluation.
