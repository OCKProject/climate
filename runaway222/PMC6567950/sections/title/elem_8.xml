  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A structured package of QI interventions was provided for both teams, consisting of standardised workshops and facilitation as needed. The workshops included content on: the QI process; tools to reach consensus on decisions within the team; and how to design the QI project; involve key stakeholders; carry out baseline measurement of the effects of current performance; analyse findings; and plan and implement change interventions. For purposes of the QI training, a simple model for QI was derived from the major approaches to QI (lean, six sigma, and so on). To emphasise the need for teamwork on a QI project, stages in the QI model were explained using an acronym, A–TEAM. The stages are described in

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first workshop, teams completed the Agree and Test commitment stages and decided how to establish a baseline for their projects. All staff in Team A participated in the workshop. Because of the size of Team B, a multidisciplinary Steering Group consisting of representatives of all staff groups participated in the first workshop. The workshop was repeated twice for Team B in order to involve all members of staff, particularly in reaching consensus on and testing commitment to the QI project.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In subsequent workshops, held approximately 6–8 weeks apart, teams designed the measurement of current practice, analysed problems and planned change. The workshops also reviewed teams’ progress, provided technical guidance and contributed to resolving problems encountered by the teams. Team B’s Steering Group requested an additional workshop 3 months after the implementation of changes in practice, to share the data gathered from repeat measurement with as many staff as possible, celebrate the team’s success and learn what further actions were needed to sustain the improvements.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The same teacher, an experienced QI facilitator (ND), presented all the workshops and attended all QI meetings with teams. The same teaching materials were used for both teams.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both teams volunteered to complete the ATPI and staff in each team who were willing and available completed the questionnaire approximately 3 months after the start of the QI Team Fellowship. An ATPI accredited facilitator (LW) administered, analysed and interpreted the results for both teams.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Team members’ answers on the ATPI were collated and a mean score for each component was calculated. These scores were compared with scores from a representative sample of comparable teams (norm groups). The analysis involves comparison of scores to the norm group scores to determine the position of the team’s scores: well below average is defined as in the bottom 9% of team scores; below average in the next 24% of team scores; average in the middle 34% of team scores; above average in the next 24% of team scores; or well above average in the top 9% of team scores. The dimension of team conflict is scored in reverse. The analysis also considers the extent to which team members agree in their views on each dimension.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On completion of the team performance assessment at time 1, the ATPI accredited facilitator (LW) met individually with each team leader to discuss the report. The ATPI facilitator and each team leader then presented the findings to the members of each team and discussed the implications with the team members. The ATPI facilitator also provided a team coaching session for each team, and participated in the QI ‘feedback’ workshop that was requested by Team B. No specific method was used to develop team leadership, apart from use of the QI tools to build the team and feedback from the ATPI assessments.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The teams’ QI project proposals were reviewed and approved by their NHS Trusts. The provider of the QI interventions screened the teams’ proposals for any ethical issues prior to the start of the work, using a checklist derived from the literature,
   <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">19</a> and determined that there were none. All staff who responded to the ATPI volunteered to complete the questionnaire. The teams both consented to the anonymous presentation of their performance on the ATPI. Thus, it was deemed by the funding organisation that there were no ethical issues associated with the evaluation.
