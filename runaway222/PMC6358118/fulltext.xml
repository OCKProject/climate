Building on related work on how increased investment in agricultural research, resource management, and infrastructure can address the challenges of meeting future food demand, we explore the costs and implications of these investments for reducing hunger in Africa by 2030. This analysis is coupled with a new investment estimation model, based on the perpetual inventory methodology (PIM), which allows for a better assessment of the costs of achieving projected agricultural improvements. We find that climate change will continue to slow projected reductions in hunger in the coming decades&#x02014;increasing the number of people at risk of hunger in 2030 by 16 million in Africa compared to a scenario without climate change. Investments to increase agricultural productivity can offset the adverse impacts of climate change and help reduce the share of people at risk of hunger in 2030 to five percent or less in Northern, Western, and Southern Africa, but the share is projected to remain at ten percent or more in Eastern and Central Africa. Investments in Africa to achieve these results are estimated to cost about 15 billion USD per year between 2015 and 2030, as part of a larger package of investments costing around 52 billion USD in developing countries.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Agriculture</kwd><kwd>Agricultural investments</kwd><kwd>Hunger</kwd><kwd>Africa</kwd><kwd>SDGs</kwd><kwd>Food security</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0105">The Second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG2) builds off the progress achieved under previous hunger eradication efforts (e.g. Millennium Development Goals; <xref rid="b0515" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 2015a</xref>) and presents the ambitious target of ending hunger globally by 2030 (<xref rid="b0520" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 2015b</xref>).

However, ODA flows to agriculture are significant across Africa. In SSA there is a reliance of public budgets on ODA support with over three billion annually from ODA compared to less than two billion from government investments.</p><p id="p0135">Although ODA for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change in the agricultural sector is quite small compared to other sources of finance, development assistance is the most easily tracked of any source of climate finance. Consequently, much discourse and analysis focuses on international public finance of climate change. Private sources of finance for climate change, whether domestic or international, remain largely hidden, which greatly limits our understanding of the overall financing of climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts (<xref rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr">UNEP, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0140">Work by <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Buchner et al. (2015)</xref> shows that if we consider financing (public, private, domestic, and international) to adapt to and mitigate climate change across sectors, we see that the private sector is, again, the largest source of funds. In 2014, about $391 billion was spent on the financing of adaptation to and mitigation of climate change; most was spent in the country of origin, with the bulk of investments made in East Asia and the Pacific, Western Europe, and the Americas. About $12 billion was invested in countries in SSA. Most public and private finance has funded mitigation efforts and the generation of renewable energy. The amount of private finance for climate change adaptation and mitigation allocated toward agriculture, forestry, and land use is unknown, but about six billion in ODA (of $148 billion of public finance) was allocated to these sectors, with about an even split between mitigation and adaptation. Public finance for climate adaptation and mitigation encompasses national, multilateral, and bilateral actors, with contributions from international organizations representing only a small fraction of the assistance (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Buchner et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Modeling framework</title><p id="p0145">To explore the role of increased agricultural productivity for food security in Africa, we use IFPRI&#x02019;s IMPACT system of models (<xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>). IMPACT has been used extensively in projecting future agricultural production and demand and changes to food security globally and regionally (<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Delgado et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0430" ref-type="bibr">Rosegrant et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="b0440" ref-type="bibr">Rosegrant et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="b0485" ref-type="bibr">Sulser et al., 2011</xref>). It has been used to explore alternative agricultural productivity futures (<xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Islam et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr">Rosegrant et al., 2014</xref>), including the potential impacts of climate change on agriculture (<xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Ignaciuk and Mason-D'Croz, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0480" ref-type="bibr">Sulser et al., 2015</xref>). IMPACT is linked to spatially explicit crop and hydrology models to integrate natural resource constraints on agricultural production (<xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">Rosegrant et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, IMPACT represents the global agriculture sector with a high level of geographic disaggregation and broad commodity coverage as compared to other similar models (<xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">Mason-D&#x02019;Croz et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>), which makes it a good tool to analyze the potential of investing in African agriculture across a range of commodities.</p><p id="p0150">The IMPACT system of models has, at its core, a highly disaggregated, global partial equilibrium multi-market model that simulates 62 agricultural commodity markets in 158 countries and regions. This multi-market model is directly linked to grid-based biophysical models (crop and hydrology models) that provide inputs on the impacts of changes in temperature and water availability at 0.5-degree resolution that are aggregated to summarize effects on agricultural production in 320 sub-national geographic units (Food Production Units or FPUs), which are the intersection of national boundaries with water basins. The DSSAT crop-modeling suite (<xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Hoogenboom et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2003</xref>) provides estimated yields of crops at the grid-cell under varying management and climate scenarios. Crop land and crop allocation are determined at the FPU level using stylized land markets that simulate cropping choices based on changes to marginal revenue of crop production, such that total cropland and specific crop areas respond over time to changing crop productivity and prices. Water availability is modeled with the IMPACT suite of water models at the grid level and aggregated to FPUs, with water demand determined through crop/livestock life cycles, cropping patterns, and competition with non-agricultural sectors at FPU levels. IMPACT solves for equilibrium prices that clear world commodity markets by equating global supply and demand annually out to 2050. Food demand is simulated for all countries and regions based on changes in average income, population, and prices. Food demand then serves as an input to estimations of changes in food security, such as the population at risk of hunger (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Fischer, Shah, Tubiello, &#x00026; van Velhuizen, 2005</xref>) and malnourished children (<xref rid="b0465" ref-type="bibr">Smith &#x00026; Haddad, 2000</xref>).

(2015)</xref>.</p><p id="p0155">As a partial-equilibrium model, IMPACT does not endogenously model the feedbacks between the agriculture sector and the broader economy. Investments in agriculture, particularly in developing countries where agriculture contributes a large share of total GDP, would be expected to have significant economic spillovers (<xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Dercon and Gollin, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="b0505" ref-type="bibr">Timmer, 2002</xref>). To better assess the potential of investments in agriculture to spur economic growth, the IMPACT framework was augmented to include an iterative link to GLOBE (<xref rid="b0570" ref-type="bibr">Willenbockel et al., 2018</xref>), a global computable general equilibrium model (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

Price changes lead to knock-on effects for non-agricultural sectors, ultimately leading to changes in real household incomes, which are then passed to IMPACT that incorporates these income dynamics into its food demand system.

There is also uncertainty to the effects of increasing GHG levels in the atmosphere on changing temperatures and precipitation patterns and the ultimate impact of these changes on crop yields (<xref rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr">Rosenzweig et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="b0455" ref-type="bibr">Ruane et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0555" ref-type="bibr">von Lampe et al., 2014</xref>).

First, it responds to the question of what outcomes could be achieved through increased public funding to agricultural R&#x00026;D. The CGIAR has a long history of successfully converting research into agricultural and economic development (<xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Evenson and Rosegrant, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">Renkow and Byerlee, 2010</xref>) and this scenario builds on this network having been developed jointly with experts across the CGIAR system and embodies an optimistic, but plausible, scenario of the potential for improvements to the agricultural sector in a future with higher investments. Second, the investments represented in this scenario are well suited to responding to the problem of underinvestment in public goods technologies, in which the CGIAR specializes. <xref rid="b0490" ref-type="bibr">Tassey (2005)</xref> identified the four primary causes of underinvestment as: 1) technical complexity; 2) long time horizons between investments and returns; 3) challenges of scale and scope of research; and 4) leakages. The CGIAR specializes in the provision of global goods technologies and the heart of its mission is to work on the types of research most likely to see underinvestment. It also plays a critical role in developing and helping diffuse technologies by building regional research capacity that, in turn, should increase the region&#x02019;s ability to absorb new technologies (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Aghion &#x00026; Jaravel, 2015</xref>). Third, with limited knowledge of what the future will bring, we believed it was better to look at a scenario that would help prepare for the future (<xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">Nordmann, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="b0545" ref-type="bibr">Vervoort and Gupta, 2018</xref>), instead of trying to predict the &#x0201c;best path forward.&#x0201d; Given the broad future uncertainty, we also believed it reasonable to follow portfolio theory and consider a broad and diversified mix of investments (<xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">Markowitz, 1952</xref>, <xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">Markowitz, 1991</xref>).

To assess the future costs of the projected yields, we have calculated the required investments in agricultural R&#x00026;D to achieve given changes in agricultural productivity using PIM. The CGIAR contributed about three percent of total public R&#x00026;D funding in developing regions; however, in SSA it contributes about twelve percent (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">ASTI, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Beintema et al., 2012</xref>).

Investments grow faster than GDP to 2030 (6.3 vs. 4.7 percent) to account for research lags between initial investments and productivity growth. NARS investments are also projected to increase across the region from $1.6 to $2.4 billion by 2030, an increase of over 50 percent.</p><p id="p0275">In 2010, Africa and West Asia accounted for about 10 percent of the world&#x02019;s irrigated area, about 32 million hectares. Total irrigated area in IMPACT is projected to increase in the region by approximately six million hectares by 2030, with this increase split evenly between SSA, and North Africa and West Asia. In SSA this is an increase of over 33 percent, whereas for North Africa and West Asia, the increase is about 13 percent over 2010 levels. In addition to expanding irrigated areas throughout the region, the baseline scenario considers that new water resource management technologies will be implemented over time. There is significant variation globally on the efficiency of water management systems due to irrigation technologies (e.g. drip vs. furrow; <xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">Rosegrant et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Ignaciuk et al., 2015</xref>) and crop management (e.g. no-till, <xref rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr">Rosegrant et al., 2014</xref>).

To do so would involve additional public investment in social protection combined with public and private efforts to raise investment levels in productive sectors&#x02014;especially in rural areas and particularly in agriculture. Over the period 2016&#x02013;2030, the additional poverty gap transfers as well as increased investments in productive sectors would need to total US$265 billion per year on average. This represents 0.3 percent of global GDP in 2014. It would fund social protection and additional targeted pro-poor investments with rural areas receiving most (US$181 billion) of the annual investments. Hunger would be reduced to below five percent prevalence rates in all developing countries considered by raising incomes of the poor above the poverty line. Climate change impacts are not considered in the <italic>Achieving Zero Hunger</italic> analysis.</p><p id="p0370">The joint analysis by IISD and IFPRI estimates the minimum cost of ending hunger by 2030, defined as reducing the population consuming less than the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement (MDER) to five percent or less. This study found the cost to be $11 billion annually from 2015 to 2030, four billion of which would be required from donors (<xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Laborde et al., 2016</xref>). The pathway for ending hunger focuses on additional investments in social safety nets, farm support, and rural development. The target recipients are vulnerable households and the impacts of climate change are not included. The model used was the MIRAGRODEP model&#x02014;using a mixture of multisector CGE modelling and bottom up estimates based on household survey data for seven countries in Africa. The split between donors and private financing was determined using a co-funding rule; this involved regression of government spending on ODA to determine the relationship which is assumed to stay the same into the future.</p><p id="p0375">The results presented in this paper are estimates of possible outcomes of different levels of investment on a range of indicators, including agricultural productivity and hunger. Under baseline productivity scenarios, direct investments in agriculture (excluding infrastructure) across developing countries average $20 billion annually from 2010 to 2030. Including infrastructure, the total baseline investments across developing countries is about $45.5 billion. Under the <bold>COMP</bold> scenario, additional investments are $52 billion annually from 2015 to 2030 and are allocated to agricultural R&#x00026;D, expanding irrigation, improved water use efficiency and soil management, and improved transportation and energy infrastructure. Most of the additional investments needed in agricultural R&#x00026;D takes place in SSA while investments in some other sectors are more evenly spread among regions.</p><p id="p0380">The impacts of additional investments under <bold>COMP</bold> are increased average incomes, improved agricultural productivity, decreased food prices, and improved food security. The prevalence of hunger would be reduced to five percent on average across developing countries. In addition to reducing hunger, other goals are also achieved, such as increased agricultural productivity, and increased incomes. Incomes in Africa increased by about five percent compared to the baseline in 2030, and agricultural productivity was more than 1.5 times as high as it was in 2010. Nevertheless, despite the share at risk of hunger declining to the five percent threshold in the developing world as a whole and in several African sub-regions, Africa in aggregate persists at a level closer to 10 percent with progress lagging in Eastern and Central Africa. This suggests that additional investments in agriculture could be important pieces of a broad portfolio of investments and interventions, but will need to be supplemented by additional social safety net and pro-poor investments similar to those suggested by Laborde et al. if the goal of achieving SDG2 is to be achieved.</p></sec><sec id="s0095"><label>4.2</label><title>Caveats and critical assessment</title><p id="p0385">In this paper, we explore the potential contributions of a scenario of higher future investments within the CGIAR with a particular focus on the impacts on the population at risk of hunger. We have taken a novel approach attempting to integrate the R&#x00026;D and agricultural productivity literature directly to a global economic modeling framework to better link projected economy-wide gains in agricultural production to the kinds of investments needed to achieve these gains. Our modeling efforts include a broad multi-model ensemble designed to capture key feedback dynamics between agriculture and other sectors of the economy by integration of GLOBE into the IMPACT framework. The inclusion of this linkage allowed for a better assessment of some of the potential benefits of investments in agriculture in Africa, which suggested an estimated reduction of 1.2% (2 million) fewer people at risk of hunger in Africa than would have been estimated without income feedbacks from GLOBE (for more detailed comparison of results with and without connection to GLOBE in <xref rid="s0130" ref-type="sec">Appendices Table S5</xref>).</p><p id="p0390">Our objective with this multi-model ensemble was to expand the scope of analysis, but we recognize that results are in part dependent on the models selected. Research from AgMIP suggests that there can be significant differences in outcomes between models even when assuming the same scenario inputs (<xref rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr">Rosenzweig et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="b0555" ref-type="bibr">von Lampe et al., 2014</xref>). A multi-model ensemble that included multiple similar models (crop, economic, climate), would allow us to explore model uncertainty at each coupling point. Baseline productivity growth and investment levels, as well as future food demand are directly tied to scenarios of economic growth. This analysis only used SSP2, and we would expect the magnitude of the challenge of eradicating hunger would vary significantly based on the socioeconomic scenarios used. Nevertheless, given recent results from work by <xref rid="b9015" ref-type="bibr">Hasegawa et al. (2018)</xref>, which explores future hunger across a broader range of economic and climate scenarios, and including land-use and trade policies that were not included in this analysis, we believe our conclusion that increased investments in agriculture are necessary but insufficient to achieve SDG2 would be robust in such an exercise.</p><p id="p0395">The potential gains from Agricultural R&#x00026;D are also susceptible to uncertainty in future state capacity and fragility. The SSPs focus their narratives on long run trends in the global economy, which, while helpful for exploring scenarios around climate change and long run drivers in the food system like agricultural R&#x00026;D, do not include other drivers that are important to global food security. For example, extreme events, both social and environmental, will almost certainly complicate progress towards SDG2. These events and crises can displace millions while destroying capital (human, physical, natural, social) and limiting the capacity of societies to effectively function. Poor governance and weak and corrupt states can prevent the effective application of science, technology, and best practices. The recent uptick in global food insecurity can be attributed in large part due to state failure and internal conflicts (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">FSIN, 2018</xref>). Peace and stability, broadly, are prerequisites for development, without which gains from research are unlikely to be achieved.</p><p id="p0400">Uncertainty in this analysis also stems from the fact that global economic models rely on aggregated national statistics and must represent detailed economic behavior in a fairly stylized way. The global food system is rapidly transforming with the development of more complex and integrated processing value chains (<xref rid="b0385" ref-type="bibr">Reardon et al., 2018</xref>). We believe that by coupling a highly disaggregated agricultural partial equilibrium model like IMPACT to GLOBE was an important advance to better assess economy-wide impacts of investments. However, we also recognize that the kinds of investments we considered are focused more on primary production, even as we tried to simulate certain investments like improved infrastructure that would see their impact more generally throughout the value chain. Future research linking global models like IMPACT and GLOBE to more granular analysis of value chains could highlight important complimentary interventions that could ensure there is full capacity throughout the value chain for the increased production modeled in this work. Hunger in this analysis, as well as those we&#x02019;ve compared to provide context define hunger in terms of calories. For a better assessment on changes to food security, which should be the ultimate goal for policymakers, more research will be needed to move beyond calorie supply, and to consider dietary and nutritional quality. Both IMPACT and GLOBE simulate economic behavior of a single representative consumer. National averages can mask significant distributional differences within countries and there would be significant gains from trying to bridge scales of analysis through linking to more detailed value chain and disaggregated household analyses.</p><p id="p0405">On the side of cost estimation, we had to work in a data sparse environment with limited long-run data on investments, which complicates the empirical estimation of returns to R&#x00026;D (<xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Esposti &#x00026; Pierani, 2003</xref>). We applied a methodology with a structural theory of how investments in R&#x00026;D are converted to changes in sector productivity, the PIM. However, this approach has its drawbacks in that the parameters needed to represent research lags and knowledge decay are not observed directly and are difficult to estimate as they are endogenous with respect to investment decisions (<xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Bitzer and Stephan, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2010</xref>). <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Baker and Shittu (2007)</xref> highlighted the importance of better understanding endogenous technical change, and further research is still needed to better understand the way that research institutions respond to changes in R&#x00026;D investment levels and how basic research and absorptive capacity can increase or decrease with respect to investment decisions. Better understanding these relationships will be critical for closing the modeling feedback loop, to begin to consider the potential effects of income changes and economic development on R&#x00026;D investment streams.</p><p id="p0410">Additionally, with our focus on public investments through the CGIAR, we assumed that private and other public investments (e.g. NARS) stayed at baseline levels and would not adjust to higher spending in the CGIAR. However, it is unlikely that the rest of the agricultural R&#x00026;D ecosystem would not adjust their behavior. More research would be needed to explore this. It is possible that these increases could crowd out other investments, decreasing non-CGIAR investments, which in turn could diminish regional capacity to fully benefit from research done in the CGIAR. Alternatively, it could spur complementary research investments, leading to an even greater impact from additional investments. From a policy perspective, the latter case is obviously preferred, so applied research in this realm would be useful to ensure greater impacts and efficacy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0100"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0415">In this research, we used a quantitative foresight modeling system (IMPACT) to examine the potential impact of increasing investments in agricultural R&#x00026;D, with a particular focus on the potential impact of climate change. Agricultural research, resource management, and infrastructure improvement can help address the challenges of meeting future food demands, but it is unlikely that hunger can be eliminated by focusing on the agricultural sector alone. Complementary efforts will be required outside of agriculture. The costs of investments focused on the agricultural sector are in line with historical trends and should be manageable with increasing growth in global and regional economies. Nevertheless, reducing hunger in Africa will be a challenge moving forward.
