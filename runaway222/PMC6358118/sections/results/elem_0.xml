 <p id="p0310" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The developing world is projected to experience important improvements in overall well-being and reduced hunger in the 
  <span class="bold">NoCC</span> scenario. The investment scenarios described above, combined with other drivers, will play a significant role in this positive trajectory. Economic growth is particularly important with average incomes in the developing world more than doubling between 2010 and 2030 in the baseline scenario. Africa experiences fairly optimistic growth in per capita incomes of more than three percent per year during this period. Although, we should note that changes in average incomes can still mask significant diversity of income and poverty levels at the household and individual level. Climate change (
  <span class="bold">CC</span>) is projected to slow global income growth by about 1 percent over this period and have stronger effects in the developing world, especially in Africa and South Asia.

  <p id="p0315" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coupling the GLOBE and IMPACT models allows endogenous determination of the aggregate income effects of changes in agricultural productivity. The 
   <span class="bold">COMP</span> scenario, combining high investment in agricultural R&amp;D, irrigation expansion, improvements in water use efficiency and soil water management, and reduced marketing margins, sees significant increases in income and manages to more than offset the negative effects of climate change on incomes by 2030. Globally, average incomes increase by almost $500 per person (about three percent) in 2030 compared to the 
   <span class="bold">CC</span> scenario without added investments. Developing countries generally benefit more, with Africa seeing average incomes increasing by more than five percent (over $200 per person). The regional average masks variation within Africa, with larger growth observed in West Africa ($300 per person) compared to Central Africa ($60 per person) (

   <span class="bold">NoCC</span>). Climate change reduces this potential productivity growth by four percentage points (with variation by crop and region) as yields respond to changes in temperature and precipitation and, in turn, to changing prices. The additional investments in agriculture in the 
   <span class="bold">COMP</span> scenario have significant effects on yields, with gains more than offsetting the negative effects of climate change and increasing global crop productivity in 2030 by 40 percent compared to 2010. This is 12 and 8 percentage points above the 
   <span class="bold">CC</span> and 
   <span class="bold">NoCC</span> scenarios, respectively. Africa gains significantly in this scenario with crop productivity increasing by 51 percent over 2010 levels, from 47 to 56 percent, depending on the region (

  <p id="p0325" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interplay of food prices and income ultimately determines the ability of consumers to purchase the quantities of food they demand. Growing population, increasing incomes, and climate change are all factors that will likely lead to higher food prices. By 2030, prices are projected to increase between 10 and 30 percent from 2010 levels under a baseline without climate change (
   <a rid="f0035" ref-type="fig" href="#f0035">Fig. 7</a>). Climate change, on average, increases prices an additional 3 to 15 percentage points, with cereals and roots and tubers seeing the largest price increases due to climate change. In the 
   <span class="bold">COMP</span> scenario, the increases in agricultural productivity are able to not only offset the price increases caused by climate change, but also, in several cases, are able to more than match the added demands caused by population and income growth. For example, average prices for meats, cereals, pulses, roots and tubers fall to or below 2010 levels. Processed commodities like food oils and sugar, which were not targeted in this scenario, see smaller price declines, but still return to levels projected without climate change.

  <p id="p0330" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average kilocalorie availability across the developing world increases from about 2700 kcal per person per day in 2010 to almost 3000 per day by 2030, or the recommended daily intake of an active 20 to 35-year-old male (
   <a rid="b0525" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0525">USDA, 2015</a>). Africa starts from a lower base than the developing country average with 2500 kcal per person growing to 2700 by 2030. Northern and Southern Africa are above the developing country average, both achieving over 3000 kcal by 2030 with or without climate change. Eastern and Central Africa lag behind the rest of Africa with initial kilocalories per person around 2100 in 2010 and staying below 2500 in 2030 in both scenarios with and without climate change.
  </p>
  <p id="p0335" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasing incomes combined with lower food prices due to productivity improvements in the 
   <span class="bold">COMP</span> scenario help to drive down food insecurity (along the dimension of food supply) globally with calorie availability increasing by 15 and 13 percent relative to a baseline without climate change in developing countries and Africa, respectively (
   <a rid="f0040" ref-type="fig" href="#f0040">Fig. 8</a>). The largest gains are in Central and Western Africa, where kilocalories increase by six percent compared to the

  <p id="p0340" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What does it mean to achieve SDG2 and eliminate hunger? Few would argue with the goal, but actually defining it in practical terms (let alone achieving it in absolute terms) is more challenging. Changes in average income, prices, and food availability are useful targets for broadly driving down hunger but will still miss parts of the population. For example, some people remain hungry even in rich countries due to gaps in social protection measures and other factors. Therefore, we follow one of the scenarios analyzed in 
   <a rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0115">FAO (2015)</a>
   <span class="italic">Achieving Zero Hunger</span> report, which adopted “a prudential threshold of five percent of the population.”
  </p>
  <p id="p0345" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The general trend towards increasing calorie availability leads to a decline in the prevalence of hunger as measured by the share of the total population in the developing world. However, in raw terms, this decline is less noted in Africa where rapid population growth keeps the number of people at risk of hunger in 2030 near 2010 levels even though shares are declining. This is particularly true for Northern and Eastern Africa where the number of people at risk of hunger increases in 2030 compared to 2010 even without taking into account the negative effects of climate change (
   <a rid="f0045" ref-type="fig" href="#f0045">Fig. 9</a>). Once climate change is included, the population at risk of hunger in 2030 is greater than 2010 levels in Northern, Western, and Central Africa, with only Southern Africa seeing a decline in the population at risk of hunger from 2010. Nevertheless, it is important to note that in all regions the share of the population at risk of hunger is declining. Particularly large reductions are observed in Eastern and Central Africa where the share falls from 35 and 41 percent in 2010 to 26 and 22 percent in 2030, respectively.

  <p id="p0350" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the 
   <span class="bold">COMP</span> scenario, these trends toward declining rates of hunger are accelerated and help drive down the prevalence of hunger across the three most food insecure regions (Western, Eastern, and Central Africa) that contribute almost 90 percent of those at risk of hunger in Africa and almost a quarter of the global population at risk in 2010. By 2030, the added investments in agriculture help to halve the number of people at risk of hunger and drive down the share of the world’s population at risk of hunger from over 12 percent to just over 5 percent. In Africa, these additional investments lead to the share at risk of hunger falling from 21 percent in 2010 to about 10 percent by 2030, a reduction of about 55 million people, compared to a 16 million increase by 2030 in the 
   <span class="bold">CC</span> scenario. Three sub-regions (Northern, Western, and Southern Africa) achieve the target of five percent at risk of hunger, but the share at risk remains above 10 percent in Eastern and Central Africa, despite significant reductions. In total, 16 of the 48 African countries modeled in IMPACT approach or surpass the five percent target by 2030, with another six countries at or below 10 percent at risk of hunger. Without the additional investments in 
   <span class="bold">COMP</span>, only 12 countries would achieve the five percent target, with another five countries below 10 percent at risk of hunger.
