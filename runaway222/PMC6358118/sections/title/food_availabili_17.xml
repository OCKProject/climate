 <p id="p0330" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average kilocalorie availability across the developing world increases from about 2700 kcal per person per day in 2010 to almost 3000 per day by 2030, or the recommended daily intake of an active 20 to 35-year-old male (
  <a rid="b0525" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0525">USDA, 2015</a>). Africa starts from a lower base than the developing country average with 2500 kcal per person growing to 2700 by 2030. Northern and Southern Africa are above the developing country average, both achieving over 3000 kcal by 2030 with or without climate change. Eastern and Central Africa lag behind the rest of Africa with initial kilocalories per person around 2100 in 2010 and staying below 2500 in 2030 in both scenarios with and without climate change.

 <p id="p0335" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasing incomes combined with lower food prices due to productivity improvements in the 
  <span class="bold">COMP</span> scenario help to drive down food insecurity (along the dimension of food supply) globally with calorie availability increasing by 15 and 13 percent relative to a baseline without climate change in developing countries and Africa, respectively (
  <a rid="f0040" ref-type="fig" href="#f0040">Fig. 8</a>). The largest gains are in Central and Western Africa, where kilocalories increase by six percent compared to the 
  <span class="bold">NoCC</span> scenario. Higher consuming Northern and Southern Africa see smaller gains (two to three percent) with Eastern Africa in between at four percent.

 <p id="p0340" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What does it mean to achieve SDG2 and eliminate hunger? Few would argue with the goal, but actually defining it in practical terms (let alone achieving it in absolute terms) is more challenging. Changes in average income, prices, and food availability are useful targets for broadly driving down hunger but will still miss parts of the population. For example, some people remain hungry even in rich countries due to gaps in social protection measures and other factors. Therefore, we follow one of the scenarios analyzed in 
  <a rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0115">FAO (2015)</a>
  <span class="italic">Achieving Zero Hunger</span> report, which adopted “a prudential threshold of five percent of the population.”
 </p>
 <p id="p0345" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The general trend towards increasing calorie availability leads to a decline in the prevalence of hunger as measured by the share of the total population in the developing world. However, in raw terms, this decline is less noted in Africa where rapid population growth keeps the number of people at risk of hunger in 2030 near 2010 levels even though shares are declining. This is particularly true for Northern and Eastern Africa where the number of people at risk of hunger increases in 2030 compared to 2010 even without taking into account the negative effects of climate change (
  <a rid="f0045" ref-type="fig" href="#f0045">Fig. 9</a>). Once climate change is included, the population at risk of hunger in 2030 is greater than 2010 levels in Northern, Western, and Central Africa, with only Southern Africa seeing a decline in the population at risk of hunger from 2010. Nevertheless, it is important to note that in all regions the share of the population at risk of hunger is declining. Particularly large reductions are observed in Eastern and Central Africa where the share falls from 35 and 41 percent in 2010 to 26 and 22 percent in 2030, respectively.

 <p id="p0350" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the 
  <span class="bold">COMP</span> scenario, these trends toward declining rates of hunger are accelerated and help drive down the prevalence of hunger across the three most food insecure regions (Western, Eastern, and Central Africa) that contribute almost 90 percent of those at risk of hunger in Africa and almost a quarter of the global population at risk in 2010. By 2030, the added investments in agriculture help to halve the number of people at risk of hunger and drive down the share of the world’s population at risk of hunger from over 12 percent to just over 5 percent. In Africa, these additional investments lead to the share at risk of hunger falling from 21 percent in 2010 to about 10 percent by 2030, a reduction of about 55 million people, compared to a 16 million increase by 2030 in the 
  <span class="bold">CC</span> scenario. Three sub-regions (Northern, Western, and Southern Africa) achieve the target of five percent at risk of hunger, but the share at risk remains above 10 percent in Eastern and Central Africa, despite significant reductions. In total, 16 of the 48 African countries modeled in IMPACT approach or surpass the five percent target by 2030, with another six countries at or below 10 percent at risk of hunger. Without the additional investments in 
  <span class="bold">COMP</span>, only 12 countries would achieve the five percent target, with another five countries below 10 percent at risk of hunger.
