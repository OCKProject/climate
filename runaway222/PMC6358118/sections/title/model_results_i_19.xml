 <p id="p0355" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerous estimates have been made of the cost of achieving various development goals, such as ending hunger, though methods and targets are often specified differently and therefore careful interpretation is necessary when comparing across studies. Estimates vary for different reasons related to the specific questions being asked; the objective of the study; sectors covered; whether climate change is considered; the methods, models and assumptions used; geographical coverage; and numerous other factors. Because different studies ask different questions and employ different methods, estimates are not always directly comparable. Here we compare and contrast our results with those from a 2015 study by FAO, IFAD, and WFP (referred to here as the 
  <span class="italic">Achieving Zero Hunger</span> estimates) as well as with joint IISD and IFPRI work (

 <p id="p0360" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimates of the additional investments needed are largest for the 2015 
  <span class="italic">Achieving Zero Hunger</span> analysis and smallest for 
  <a rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0280">Laborde et al. (2016)</a> with the results presented in this paper in-between. This is largely due to differences in the questions being asked and the methods used to answer them (
  <a rid="t0035" ref-type="table" href="#t0035">Table 7</a>). The 
  <span class="italic">Achieving Zero Hunger</span> analysis eliminates hunger in all countries by eliminating poverty. 
  <a rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0280">Laborde et al. (2016)</a> instead consider the minimum public investment needed to end hunger. Both of these studies consider investments in and outside of agriculture and do not include the impacts of climate change. Our analysis, instead of costing the eradication of hunger, attempts to estimate the potential hunger reduction from investments only in the agriculture sector and includes the potential impacts of climate change on hunger eradication efforts.

 <p id="p0365" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 2015 
  <span class="italic">Achieving Zero Hunger</span> report, the Rome-based UN agencies (
  <a rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0135">FAO, IFAD, &amp; WFP, 2015a</a>) posited that poverty and hunger could be eradicated in all developing countries by 2030. To do so would involve additional public investment in social protection combined with public and private efforts to raise investment levels in productive sectors—especially in rural areas and particularly in agriculture. Over the period 2016–2030, the additional poverty gap transfers as well as increased investments in productive sectors would need to total US$265 billion per year on average. This represents 0.3 percent of global GDP in 2014. It would fund social protection and additional targeted pro-poor investments with rural areas receiving most (US$181 billion) of the annual investments. Hunger would be reduced to below five percent prevalence rates in all developing countries considered by raising incomes of the poor above the poverty line. Climate change impacts are not considered in the 
  <span class="italic">Achieving Zero Hunger</span> analysis.
 </p>
 <p id="p0370" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The joint analysis by IISD and IFPRI estimates the minimum cost of ending hunger by 2030, defined as reducing the population consuming less than the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement (MDER) to five percent or less. This study found the cost to be $11 billion annually from 2015 to 2030, four billion of which would be required from donors (
  <a rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0280">Laborde et al., 2016</a>). The pathway for ending hunger focuses on additional investments in social safety nets, farm support, and rural development. The target recipients are vulnerable households and the impacts of climate change are not included. The model used was the MIRAGRODEP model—using a mixture of multisector CGE modelling and bottom up estimates based on household survey data for seven countries in Africa. The split between donors and private financing was determined using a co-funding rule; this involved regression of government spending on ODA to determine the relationship which is assumed to stay the same into the future.
 </p>
 <p id="p0375" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results presented in this paper are estimates of possible outcomes of different levels of investment on a range of indicators, including agricultural productivity and hunger. Under baseline productivity scenarios, direct investments in agriculture (excluding infrastructure) across developing countries average $20 billion annually from 2010 to 2030. Including infrastructure, the total baseline investments across developing countries is about $45.5 billion. Under the 
  <span class="bold">COMP</span> scenario, additional investments are $52 billion annually from 2015 to 2030 and are allocated to agricultural R&amp;D, expanding irrigation, improved water use efficiency and soil management, and improved transportation and energy infrastructure. Most of the additional investments needed in agricultural R&amp;D takes place in SSA while investments in some other sectors are more evenly spread among regions.
 </p>
 <p id="p0380" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impacts of additional investments under 
  <span class="bold">COMP</span> are increased average incomes, improved agricultural productivity, decreased food prices, and improved food security. The prevalence of hunger would be reduced to five percent on average across developing countries. In addition to reducing hunger, other goals are also achieved, such as increased agricultural productivity, and increased incomes. Incomes in Africa increased by about five percent compared to the baseline in 2030, and agricultural productivity was more than 1.5 times as high as it was in 2010. Nevertheless, despite the share at risk of hunger declining to the five percent threshold in the developing world as a whole and in several African sub-regions, Africa in aggregate persists at a level closer to 10 percent with progress lagging in Eastern and Central Africa. This suggests that additional investments in agriculture could be important pieces of a broad portfolio of investments and interventions, but will need to be supplemented by additional social safety net and pro-poor investments similar to those suggested by Laborde et al. if the goal of achieving SDG2 is to be achieved.
