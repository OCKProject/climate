 <p id="p0415" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this research, we used a quantitative foresight modeling system (IMPACT) to examine the potential impact of increasing investments in agricultural R&amp;D, with a particular focus on the potential impact of climate change. Agricultural research, resource management, and infrastructure improvement can help address the challenges of meeting future food demands, but it is unlikely that hunger can be eliminated by focusing on the agricultural sector alone. Complementary efforts will be required outside of agriculture. The costs of investments focused on the agricultural sector are in line with historical trends and should be manageable with increasing growth in global and regional economies. Nevertheless, reducing hunger in Africa will be a challenge moving forward. To make progress towards this goal we should recognize the following:

    </p>
    <p id="p0425">Climate change could increase the number of people at risk of hunger in 2030 relative to a scenario without climate change. In Africa, the combined effects of population growth and climate change mean that the number of people at risk of hunger is projected to increase even relative to todayâ€™s levels, i.e. more than offsetting reductions projected in 2030 due to increased incomes and other factors. Reducing hunger will be particularly challenging in Eastern and Central Africa.</p>

    <p id="p0435">Increased investments in agricultural research, resource management, and infrastructure can more than offset the negative effects of climate change, increasing crop productivity in 2030 by 40 percent globally and by over 50 percent in Africa compared to 2010 levels.</p>

    </p>
    <p id="p0445">Increased productivity growth in agriculture boosts food supply, reduces food prices, and increases incomes. This increases access to food and helps reduce the share of people at risk of hunger in 2030 to five percent or less in Northern, Western, and Southern Africa. However, the share is projected to remain at 10 percent or more in Eastern and Central Africa even with investments in agricultural R&amp;D.</p>

    <p id="p0455">While the costing methodology in this research produced estimates that differ from other research on this topic, the research questions and approaches make these studies mutually reinforcing, despite their apparent contrast. The joint IISD and IFPRI work by

    </p>
    <p id="p0465">While agriculture is an important cornerstone for most of Africa, its overall importance is declining as economies grow. Investments in the agricultural sector will help build the foundation for a more prosperous and stable Africa, but complementary investments throughout value chains within the food system and in the non-agricultural sector will be necessary for resilient economies and achievement of the SDGs, especially for eliminating hunger. Future work will examine the scope for further progress in ending hunger through investments outside of the agricultural sector, such as clean water and sanitation, health, education, and the manufacturing and services sectors.</p>
