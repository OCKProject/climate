  <a rid="t0020" ref-type="table" href="#t0020">Table 4</a>). This will require government investments in agriculture to more than double currently estimated levels (
  <a rid="t0005" ref-type="table" href="#t0005">Table 1</a>) by 2030, a significant increase, but one that is plausible given the low levels of investments compared to other developing regions and the economic growth projected for Africa under SSP2 (
  <a rid="t0010" ref-type="table" href="#t0010">Table 2</a>). Globally, the additional investments assumed in the baseline are more than $86 billion per year, with about $34 billion coming from direct investments in agriculture, which can be categorized primarily as either investments in R&amp;D or in irrigation and water resource use.

 <p id="p0270" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In IMPACT, improvements in agricultural productivity are embedded in growth rates, which represent historical trends on agricultural yield growth and biological yield potential (
  <a rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0400">Robinson et al., 2015</a>). To assess the future costs of the projected yields, we have calculated the required investments in agricultural R&amp;D to achieve given changes in agricultural productivity using PIM. The CGIAR contributed about three percent of total public R&amp;D funding in developing regions; however, in SSA it contributes about twelve percent (
  <a rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0030">ASTI, 2016</a>, 
  <a rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0045">Beintema et al., 2012</a>). The projected investment costs for Africa are $2.7 billion per year, with CGIAR investments projected to follow historical trends and keep pace with GDP growth from 2010 to 2050 (4.1 percent compared to 4.4 percent for GDP). Investments grow faster than GDP to 2030 (6.3 vs. 4.7 percent) to account for research lags between initial investments and productivity growth. NARS investments are also projected to increase across the region from $1.6 to $2.4 billion by 2030, an increase of over 50 percent.
 </p>
 <p id="p0275" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2010, Africa and West Asia accounted for about 10 percent of the world’s irrigated area, about 32 million hectares. Total irrigated area in IMPACT is projected to increase in the region by approximately six million hectares by 2030, with this increase split evenly between SSA, and North Africa and West Asia. In SSA this is an increase of over 33 percent, whereas for North Africa and West Asia, the increase is about 13 percent over 2010 levels. In addition to expanding irrigated areas throughout the region, the baseline scenario considers that new water resource management technologies will be implemented over time. There is significant variation globally on the efficiency of water management systems due to irrigation technologies (e.g. drip vs. furrow; 
  <a rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0415">Rosegrant et al., 2002</a>, 
  <a rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0225">Ignaciuk et al., 2015</a>) and crop management (e.g. no-till, 
  <a rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0425">Rosegrant et al., 2014</a>). The baseline scenario assumes improving regional water use efficiency based on historical trends, which leads to a 4 percent decline in water use intensity per hectare (m
  <span class="sup">3</span>/ha). Using cost data on water projects from 
  <a rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0245">Inocencio et al. (2007)</a> and FAO’s AquaStat Database (
  <a rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0125">FAO, 2016b</a>), the average annual cost of investments to achieve this level of improvement to the irrigation system amounts to about $4 billion per year from 2010 to 2030. The majority of the investments is dedicated to irrigation expansion, particularly in SSA. Improvements in soil management were estimated to be more than $1.5 billion per year with SSA requiring about 58 percent of costs for Africa and West Asia.
 </p>
 <p id="p0280" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The economic growth projected as a part of the baseline SSP2 assumptions is significant across the developing world, particularly for SSA. This growth will require investments in expanding and maintaining transportation and energy infrastructure, which are critical for not only the agriculture sector, but the economy as a whole. Following 
  <a rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0435">Rosegrant, Magalhaes, Valmonte-Santos, and Mason-D’Croz (2018)</a>, we estimate global infrastructure investments to be about $52.5 billion per year. In Africa and West Asia, the investment levels will be much smaller than in other regions at about $1.1 billion per year, which may seem counterintuitive due to lower levels of infrastructure in the region. However, a significant share of infrastructure investment is focused on maintenance and preventing deterioration. The low levels and quality of existing infrastructure throughout Africa and West Asia lead to lower investment costs in the region as investments are focused on new construction instead of maintaining older infrastructure.
