 <p id="p0120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We begin by providing rough approximations of current levels of investment in agriculture to provide context on agricultural investment scenarios explained in greater detail in following sections. The private sector is by far the largest investor in agriculture (

 <p id="p0125" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A dataset newly released by the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows that, in recent years, farmers in developing countries have invested approximately 153 billion USD annually on agricultural capital—similar to the $156 billion estimate of investments made by farmers in developed countries (

  <a rid="s0130" ref-type="sec" href="#s0130">Appendix S1</a>). Government investments in agriculture have been smaller than private investments globally, with this difference being more pronounced in developed regions where government investments are about a third the level of private investments, compared to developing regions where it is about half. Public spending on agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) (not shown in 
  <a rid="t0005" ref-type="table" href="#t0005">Table 1</a>) is also an important component of government spending.

 <p id="p0130" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown in 
  <a rid="t0005" ref-type="table" href="#t0005">Table 1</a>, globally, development flows to agriculture (ODA to agriculture) are much smaller than private and governmental investments in agriculture, while dedicated funds for climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture are even smaller. However, ODA flows to agriculture are significant across Africa. In SSA there is a reliance of public budgets on ODA support with over three billion annually from ODA compared to less than two billion from government investments.
 </p>
 <p id="p0135" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although ODA for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change in the agricultural sector is quite small compared to other sources of finance, development assistance is the most easily tracked of any source of climate finance. Consequently, much discourse and analysis focuses on international public finance of climate change. Private sources of finance for climate change, whether domestic or international, remain largely hidden, which greatly limits our understanding of the overall financing of climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts (
  <a rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0510">UNEP, 2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="p0140" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Work by 
  <a rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0060">Buchner et al. (2015)</a> shows that if we consider financing (public, private, domestic, and international) to adapt to and mitigate climate change across sectors, we see that the private sector is, again, the largest source of funds. In 2014, about $391 billion was spent on the financing of adaptation to and mitigation of climate change; most was spent in the country of origin, with the bulk of investments made in East Asia and the Pacific, Western Europe, and the Americas. About $12 billion was invested in countries in SSA. Most public and private finance has funded mitigation efforts and the generation of renewable energy. The amount of private finance for climate change adaptation and mitigation allocated toward agriculture, forestry, and land use is unknown, but about six billion in ODA (of $148 billion of public finance) was allocated to these sectors, with about an even split between mitigation and adaptation. Public finance for climate adaptation and mitigation encompasses national, multilateral, and bilateral actors, with contributions from international organizations representing only a small fraction of the assistance (
