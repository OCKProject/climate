 <p id="p0105" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG2) builds off the progress achieved under previous hunger eradication efforts (e.g. Millennium Development Goals; 
  <a rid="b0515" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0515">United Nations, 2015a</a>) and presents the ambitious target of ending hunger globally by 2030 (
  <a rid="b0520" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0520">United Nations, 2015b</a>). Achieving this goal will require a multi-pronged effort that recognizes that the “last mile” to eradicate hunger will be the most difficult (
  <a rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0065">Chandy, Kato, &amp; Kharas, 2015</a>). The next push will have to confront more binding environmental and resource constraints (
  <a rid="b0410" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0410">Rockström et al., 2009</a>, 
  <a rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0500">Tilman and Clark, 2014</a>) even as food demand continues to increase due to a growing population (
  <a rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0275">Kc &amp; Lutz, 2017</a>) and their growing demand for richer diets (
  <a rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0055">Bodirsky et al., 2015</a>, 
  <a rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0375">Pingali, 2007</a>, 
  <a rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0500">Tilman and Clark, 2014</a>). Climate change further complicates eradicating hunger by reducing agricultural yields, driving up food prices, reducing food availability, and increasing negative health outcomes (
  <a rid="b0475" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0475">Springmann et al., 2016</a>, 
  <a rid="b0480" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0480">Sulser et al., 2015</a>, 
  <a rid="b0565" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0565">Wiebe et al., 2015</a>).

 <p id="p0110" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the 1960s, increasing agricultural productivity has been critical for reducing poverty and hunger globally (
  <a rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0085">Dercon and Gollin, 2014</a>, 
  <a rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0305">McArthur, 2015</a>, 
  <a rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0380">Pingali, 2012</a>). However, Africa South of the Sahara (SSA) has benefited less than other regions from past investments and continues to have low agricultural productivity by global standards (
  <a rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0185">GYGWPA, 2017</a>). Closing agricultural productivity gaps alone will not be sufficient to ensure food supply can keep pace with growing demand (
  <a rid="b0530" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0530">van Ittersum et al., 2016</a>). Therefore, achieving SDG2 will require specific attention be given to agriculture in Africa and will have to take into account the particularities of the region and encompass a range of important regional crops beyond just the key staple cereals that fueled the Green Revolution (
  <a rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0380">Pingali, 2012</a>).

 <p id="p0115" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper we present scenarios of agricultural productivity enhancements based on current and envisioned CGIAR efforts focused on the developing world. We then estimate the costs of achieving these projected improvements in the agriculture sector applying methodologies developed in the field of R&amp;D investment and productivity gains (
  <a rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0015">Alston et al., 2011</a>, 
  <a rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0095">Esposti and Pierani, 2003</a>, 
  <a rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0100">Evenson and Gollin, 2003</a>, 
  <a rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0340">Nin-Pratt, 2016</a>, 
  <a rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0345">Nin-Pratt et al., 2015</a>). We then estimate the impacts of achieving these improvements on agricultural productivity, average incomes, commodity prices, food demand, and hunger using an augmented version of IFPRI’s IMPACT modeling system (
  <a rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0400">Robinson et al., 2015</a>), which was extended to include GLOBE (
  <a rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0310">McDonald, Thierfelder, &amp; Robinson, 2007</a>), a global general equilibrium model, to capture the macroeconomic impacts of increased agricultural productivity (
  <a rid="b0445" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0445">Rosegrant et al., 2017</a>). Finally, we compare these results to several recent reports on reducing or eradicating hunger to highlight potential points of uncertainty with respect to the contributions of public investments in agriculture towards SDG2.
