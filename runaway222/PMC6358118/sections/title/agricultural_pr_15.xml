 <p id="p0320" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agricultural productivity is projected to increase by about 32 percent in the developing world between 2010 and 2030 in the absence of climate change (
  <span class="bold">NoCC</span>). Climate change reduces this potential productivity growth by four percentage points (with variation by crop and region) as yields respond to changes in temperature and precipitation and, in turn, to changing prices. The additional investments in agriculture in the 
  <span class="bold">COMP</span> scenario have significant effects on yields, with gains more than offsetting the negative effects of climate change and increasing global crop productivity in 2030 by 40 percent compared to 2010. This is 12 and 8 percentage points above the 
  <span class="bold">CC</span> and 
  <span class="bold">NoCC</span> scenarios, respectively. Africa gains significantly in this scenario with crop productivity increasing by 51 percent over 2010 levels, from 47 to 56 percent, depending on the region (
