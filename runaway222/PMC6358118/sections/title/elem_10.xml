 <p id="p0250" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potential investment costs are assessed quantitatively for the 
  <span class="bold">COMP</span> and baseline scenarios (
  <span class="bold">NoCC</span> and 
  <span class="bold">CC</span>) with the understanding that the timing of investments is inherently different according to the targeted driver of agricultural production (e.g. crop yields versus irrigation expansion). Infrastructure investments in irrigation, as well as investments in improving marketing efficiency, require more up-front spending to expand and improve irrigation and transportation networks, whereas investments to increase agricultural yields through increased TFP require a longer-term stream of research and development activities (see

 <p id="p0255" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Infrastructure investments are estimated using unit costs of construction and maintenance. However, given the challenges of capturing the “lumpy” development of new technology, where progress can be observed in fits and bursts, with advances in basic science pushing continued gains in applied science for a period of time (
  <a rid="b0490" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0490">Tassey, 2005</a>), we decided to structurally model the process of converting R&amp;D investments into agricultural productivity gains. To do this, we follow a long literature of translating R&amp;D investments into changes on sector productivity (

Additionally, we recognize different regional and institutional returns to R&amp;D investment (
  <a rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0100">Evenson &amp; Gollin, 2003</a>) and disaggregate agricultural R&amp;D by region and source of public investment (CGIAR or National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS)). This allowed us to represent the variation of regional and institutional capacity, as well as in what types of research each institution specializes (i.e. CGIAR tends to work more on basic research). We further apply lessons from

   <a rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0400">Robinson et al., 2015</a>). To assess the future costs of the projected yields, we have calculated the required investments in agricultural R&amp;D to achieve given changes in agricultural productivity using PIM. The CGIAR contributed about three percent of total public R&amp;D funding in developing regions; however, in SSA it contributes about twelve percent (
   <a rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0030">ASTI, 2016</a>, 
   <a rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0045">Beintema et al., 2012</a>). The projected investment costs for Africa are $2.7 billion per year, with CGIAR investments projected to follow historical trends and keep pace with GDP growth from 2010 to 2050 (4.1 percent compared to 4.4 percent for GDP). Investments grow faster than GDP to 2030 (6.3 vs. 4.7 percent) to account for research lags between initial investments and productivity growth. NARS investments are also projected to increase across the region from $1.6 to $2.4 billion by 2030, an increase of over 50 percent.
  </p>
  <p id="p0275" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2010, Africa and West Asia accounted for about 10 percent of the world’s irrigated area, about 32 million hectares. Total irrigated area in IMPACT is projected to increase in the region by approximately six million hectares by 2030, with this increase split evenly between SSA, and North Africa and West Asia. In SSA this is an increase of over 33 percent, whereas for North Africa and West Asia, the increase is about 13 percent over 2010 levels. In addition to expanding irrigated areas throughout the region, the baseline scenario considers that new water resource management technologies will be implemented over time. There is significant variation globally on the efficiency of water management systems due to irrigation technologies (e.g. drip vs. furrow; 
   <a rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0415">Rosegrant et al., 2002</a>, 
   <a rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0225">Ignaciuk et al., 2015</a>) and crop management (e.g. no-till, 
   <a rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0425">Rosegrant et al., 2014</a>). The baseline scenario assumes improving regional water use efficiency based on historical trends, which leads to a 4 percent decline in water use intensity per hectare (m
   <span class="sup">3</span>/ha). Using cost data on water projects from 
   <a rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0245">Inocencio et al. (2007)</a> and FAO’s AquaStat Database (
   <a rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0125">FAO, 2016b</a>), the average annual cost of investments to achieve this level of improvement to the irrigation system amounts to about $4 billion per year from 2010 to 2030. The majority of the investments is dedicated to irrigation expansion, particularly in SSA. Improvements in soil management were estimated to be more than $1.5 billion per year with SSA requiring about 58 percent of costs for Africa and West Asia.
  </p>
  <p id="p0280" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The economic growth projected as a part of the baseline SSP2 assumptions is significant across the developing world, particularly for SSA. This growth will require investments in expanding and maintaining transportation and energy infrastructure, which are critical for not only the agriculture sector, but the economy as a whole. Following 
   <a rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0435">Rosegrant, Magalhaes, Valmonte-Santos, and Mason-D’Croz (2018)</a>, we estimate global infrastructure investments to be about $52.5 billion per year. In Africa and West Asia, the investment levels will be much smaller than in other regions at about $1.1 billion per year, which may seem counterintuitive due to lower levels of infrastructure in the region. However, a significant share of infrastructure investment is focused on maintenance and preventing deterioration. The low levels and quality of existing infrastructure throughout Africa and West Asia lead to lower investment costs in the region as investments are focused on new construction instead of maintaining older infrastructure.

Additional investments to improve the productive capacity of agriculture and boost the sector’s efficiency will be required. These investments are also critical towards improving the sustainability of the agriculture sector ensuring that gains achieved by 2030 can be maintained moving further into the 21st century. The additional agricultural investments considered in this analysis include investments to improving the capacity of water resource management (more efficient irrigation technologies, implementation of soil water management technologies), as well as further expansion of irrigation beyond the assumed expansion in the baseline.</p>
  <p id="p0300" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The additional investments needed to expand irrigation, and improve water resource management throughout the developing world are significant, more than $25 billion per year (columns 2–4 in

Most of this investment in Africa and West Asia will be in irrigation expansion ($3.6 billion, 47 percent) and soil management ($3 billion, 40 percent). Within this region almost two thirds of the investments are concentrated in SSA.

  <p id="p0305" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agricultural markets throughout the developing world suffer from market inefficiencies due to poor infrastructure. To reduce these inefficiencies, and thereby reduce transportation and marketing costs it is necessary to invest in building new infrastructure as well as improving and maintaining current infrastructure. These investments enhance productivity along the value chain, increase the speed of moving commodities to markets while also improving storage capacity, all of which improve market efficiency by better matching supply and demand over time. In this scenario, infrastructure investments focus on expanding and improving energy and transportation infrastructure. The cost of infrastructure investments is based on 
   <a rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0435">Rosegrant et al.
