 <p id="p0325" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interplay of food prices and income ultimately determines the ability of consumers to purchase the quantities of food they demand. Growing population, increasing incomes, and climate change are all factors that will likely lead to higher food prices. By 2030, prices are projected to increase between 10 and 30 percent from 2010 levels under a baseline without climate change (
  <a rid="f0035" ref-type="fig" href="#f0035">Fig. 7</a>). Climate change, on average, increases prices an additional 3 to 15 percentage points, with cereals and roots and tubers seeing the largest price increases due to climate change. In the 
  <span class="bold">COMP</span> scenario, the increases in agricultural productivity are able to not only offset the price increases caused by climate change, but also, in several cases, are able to more than match the added demands caused by population and income growth. For example, average prices for meats, cereals, pulses, roots and tubers fall to or below 2010 levels. Processed commodities like food oils and sugar, which were not targeted in this scenario, see smaller price declines, but still return to levels projected without climate change.
