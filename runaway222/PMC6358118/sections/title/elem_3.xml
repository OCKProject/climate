   <a rid="t0005" ref-type="table" href="#t0005">Table 1</a>, globally, development flows to agriculture (ODA to agriculture) are much smaller than private and governmental investments in agriculture, while dedicated funds for climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture are even smaller. However, ODA flows to agriculture are significant across Africa. In SSA there is a reliance of public budgets on ODA support with over three billion annually from ODA compared to less than two billion from government investments.
  </p>
  <p id="p0135" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although ODA for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change in the agricultural sector is quite small compared to other sources of finance, development assistance is the most easily tracked of any source of climate finance. Consequently, much discourse and analysis focuses on international public finance of climate change. Private sources of finance for climate change, whether domestic or international, remain largely hidden, which greatly limits our understanding of the overall financing of climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts (
   <a rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0510">UNEP, 2016</a>).

   <a rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0060">Buchner et al. (2015)</a> shows that if we consider financing (public, private, domestic, and international) to adapt to and mitigate climate change across sectors, we see that the private sector is, again, the largest source of funds. In 2014, about $391 billion was spent on the financing of adaptation to and mitigation of climate change; most was spent in the country of origin, with the bulk of investments made in East Asia and the Pacific, Western Europe, and the Americas. About $12 billion was invested in countries in SSA. Most public and private finance has funded mitigation efforts and the generation of renewable energy. The amount of private finance for climate change adaptation and mitigation allocated toward agriculture, forestry, and land use is unknown, but about six billion in ODA (of $148 billion of public finance) was allocated to these sectors, with about an even split between mitigation and adaptation. Public finance for climate adaptation and mitigation encompasses national, multilateral, and bilateral actors, with contributions from international organizations representing only a small fraction of the assistance (

   <a rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0325">Nelson et al., 2010</a>, 
   <a rid="b0480" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0480">Sulser et al., 2015</a>). IMPACT is linked to spatially explicit crop and hydrology models to integrate natural resource constraints on agricultural production (
   <a rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0400">Robinson et al., 2015</a>, 
   <a rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0415">Rosegrant et al., 2002</a>). Additionally, IMPACT represents the global agriculture sector with a high level of geographic disaggregation and broad commodity coverage as compared to other similar models (

   <a rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0405">Robinson et al., 2014</a>), which makes it a good tool to analyze the potential of investing in African agriculture across a range of commodities.
  </p>
  <p id="p0150" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The IMPACT system of models has, at its core, a highly disaggregated, global partial equilibrium multi-market model that simulates 62 agricultural commodity markets in 158 countries and regions. This multi-market model is directly linked to grid-based biophysical models (crop and hydrology models) that provide inputs on the impacts of changes in temperature and water availability at 0.5-degree resolution that are aggregated to summarize effects on agricultural production in 320 sub-national geographic units (Food Production Units or FPUs), which are the intersection of national boundaries with water basins. The DSSAT crop-modeling suite (
   <a rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0205">Hoogenboom et al., 2012</a>, 
   <a rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0265">Jones et al., 2003</a>) provides estimated yields of crops at the grid-cell under varying management and climate scenarios. Crop land and crop allocation are determined at the FPU level using stylized land markets that simulate cropping choices based on changes to marginal revenue of crop production, such that total cropland and specific crop areas respond over time to changing crop productivity and prices. Water availability is modeled with the IMPACT suite of water models at the grid level and aggregated to FPUs, with water demand determined through crop/livestock life cycles, cropping patterns, and competition with non-agricultural sectors at FPU levels. IMPACT solves for equilibrium prices that clear world commodity markets by equating global supply and demand annually out to 2050. Food demand is simulated for all countries and regions based on changes in average income, population, and prices. Food demand then serves as an input to estimations of changes in food security, such as the population at risk of hunger (

  </p>
  <p id="p0155" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a partial-equilibrium model, IMPACT does not endogenously model the feedbacks between the agriculture sector and the broader economy. Investments in agriculture, particularly in developing countries where agriculture contributes a large share of total GDP, would be expected to have significant economic spillovers (

   <a rid="b0505" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0505">Timmer, 2002</a>). To better assess the potential of investments in agriculture to spur economic growth, the IMPACT framework was augmented to include an iterative link to GLOBE (

  <p id="p0160" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in agricultural productivity from IMPACT are passed to GLOBE as factor productivity shifters that generate equivalent impacts on agricultural producer prices. Price changes lead to knock-on effects for non-agricultural sectors, ultimately leading to changes in real household incomes, which are then passed to IMPACT that incorporates these income dynamics into its food demand system. To bridge the varying levels of geographic aggregation between the two models we exploit the fact that the household real income deviations from the baseline are highly correlated with the initial shares of value added generated by food production. Using the fully disaggregated GTAP database we estimate the food value-added shares in GDP for 135 countries to downscale changes in real income from GLOBE to IMPACT.

    <a rid="t0010" ref-type="table" href="#t0010">Table 2</a>). Population growth is concentrated in the developing world, where population grows at more than one percent per year adding, by 2030, almost 1.4 billion people globally (0.5 billion in Africa), compared to about 0.1 billion in developed countries. Economic growth is also fastest in developing countries, with an average annual growth rate of five percent compared to two percent in developed countries. Africa grows at the developing country average (5.2 percent), with Western and Eastern Africa growing somewhat faster at 6.5 percent per year. Central, Northern, and Southern Africa grow below the regional average at 5.0, 4.7 and 3.9 percent respectively. Robust economic growth across Africa pushes up average incomes, with the regional average annual income nearly doubling to $5000 by 2030. Nevertheless, by 2030, average annual incomes in Africa would still be below the developing country average, with only Southern Africa exceeding the developing country average.

    <span class="bold">CC</span>) adds climate change to the baseline socioeconomic assumptions. Work done in the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) has explored various dimensions of uncertainty around climate change impacts on agriculture. First, there is uncertainty on future GHG concentration levels, which will depend on economic growth and technological development. There is also uncertainty to the effects of increasing GHG levels in the atmosphere on changing temperatures and precipitation patterns and the ultimate impact of these changes on crop yields (

   <p id="p0215" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The third scenario presented is a comprehensive investment scenario (
    <span class="bold">COMP</span>) for agriculture and the rural sector, which combines investments in agricultural research, resource management, and infrastructure in developing countries. This scenario is drawn from related work (
    <a rid="b0445" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0445">Rosegrant et al., 2017</a>) assessing the potential impact of various investment levels across the CGIAR on agricultural development and sustainability.
   </p>
   <p id="p0220" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
    <span class="bold">COMP</span> scenario was selected for this analysis for three main reasons. First, it responds to the question of what outcomes could be achieved through increased public funding to agricultural R&amp;D. The CGIAR has a long history of successfully converting research into agricultural and economic development (
    <a rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0105">Evenson and Rosegrant, 2003</a>, 
    <a rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0390">Renkow and Byerlee, 2010</a>) and this scenario builds on this network having been developed jointly with experts across the CGIAR system and embodies an optimistic, but plausible, scenario of the potential for improvements to the agricultural sector in a future with higher investments. Second, the investments represented in this scenario are well suited to responding to the problem of underinvestment in public goods technologies, in which the CGIAR specializes. 
    <a rid="b0490" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0490">Tassey (2005)</a> identified the four primary causes of underinvestment as: 1) technical complexity; 2) long time horizons between investments and returns; 3) challenges of scale and scope of research; and 4) leakages. The CGIAR specializes in the provision of global goods technologies and the heart of its mission is to work on the types of research most likely to see underinvestment. It also plays a critical role in developing and helping diffuse technologies by building regional research capacity that, in turn, should increase the region’s ability to absorb new technologies (
    <a rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0005">Aghion &amp; Jaravel, 2015</a>). Third, with limited knowledge of what the future will bring, we believed it was better to look at a scenario that would help prepare for the future (
    <a rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0350">Nordmann, 2014</a>, 
    <a rid="b0545" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0545">Vervoort and Gupta, 2018</a>), instead of trying to predict the “best path forward.” Given the broad future uncertainty, we also believed it reasonable to follow portfolio theory and consider a broad and diversified mix of investments (
    <a rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0290">Markowitz, 1952</a>, 
    <a rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0295">Markowitz, 1991</a>). The 
    <span class="bold">COMP</span> scenario is just such a mix, encompassing investments across the agriculture sector.
   </p>
   <p id="p0225" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the interventions specified in 
    <span class="bold">COMP</span> are assumed to begin after 2015, with the scenario projection horizon going to 2050. The 2030 results presented in the following sections show the outcomes of these interventions at the midpoint of the overall scenario. While we focus on investments in Africa, the analysis includes investments in all developing regions, recognizing the importance of spillovers in technology and market effects to eliminating hunger in any one region and the difficulty and high cost of trying to do so in isolation.
   </p>
   <p id="p0230" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
    <span class="bold">COMP</span> scenario considers the role of improving agricultural productivity throughout the developing world, focusing on the potential gains in reducing yield gaps from increased CGIAR investment in agricultural R&amp;D. The target yield improvements were quantified through consultations with CGIAR scientists on plausible yield gains from increases in research budgets. These yield gains were quantified for the developing world at the country level, differentiated across irrigated and rainfed systems, and incorporated knowledge on varying regional production levels and local research and extension capacity.

    <a rid="f0020" ref-type="fig" href="#f0020">Fig. 4</a> summarizes the target improvements in crop productivity globally and specifically in Africa. Agricultural productivity in Africa lags significantly behind the rest of the world and, therefore, the productivity gains possible in this region are significant in percentage terms. Africa in general is projected to be catching up with the rest of the world in the coming decades and productivity gains are generally projected to increase at a faster rate than the global average. Assuming some level of convergence may be optimistic, given that African cereal yields have not grown at a rate significantly faster than the global average since 1990 (
    <a rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0120">FAO, 2016a</a>), however it is consistent broadly with the SSP 2 narrative, which projects economic convergence (

Expanding the area equipped for irrigation is a powerful option in terms of both increasing crop yields as well as reducing the risk of production volatility due to changing weather. At the same time, however, water can be a scarce resource and the expansion of irrigation in a sustainable fashion requires investments in water use efficiency. Water use efficiency investments in all targeted regions increases efficiency by 15 percentage points.

    <a rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0400">Robinson et al., 2015</a>). To assess the future costs of the projected yields, we have calculated the required investments in agricultural R&amp;D to achieve given changes in agricultural productivity using PIM. The CGIAR contributed about three percent of total public R&amp;D funding in developing regions; however, in SSA it contributes about twelve percent (
    <a rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0030">ASTI, 2016</a>, 
    <a rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0045">Beintema et al., 2012</a>). The projected investment costs for Africa are $2.7 billion per year, with CGIAR investments projected to follow historical trends and keep pace with GDP growth from 2010 to 2050 (4.1 percent compared to 4.4 percent for GDP). Investments grow faster than GDP to 2030 (6.3 vs. 4.7 percent) to account for research lags between initial investments and productivity growth. NARS investments are also projected to increase across the region from $1.6 to $2.4 billion by 2030, an increase of over 50 percent.
   </p>
   <p id="p0275" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2010, Africa and West Asia accounted for about 10 percent of the world’s irrigated area, about 32 million hectares. Total irrigated area in IMPACT is projected to increase in the region by approximately six million hectares by 2030, with this increase split evenly between SSA, and North Africa and West Asia. In SSA this is an increase of over 33 percent, whereas for North Africa and West Asia, the increase is about 13 percent over 2010 levels. In addition to expanding irrigated areas throughout the region, the baseline scenario considers that new water resource management technologies will be implemented over time. There is significant variation globally on the efficiency of water management systems due to irrigation technologies (e.g. drip vs. furrow; 
    <a rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0415">Rosegrant et al., 2002</a>,

    <a rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0425">Rosegrant et al., 2014</a>). The baseline scenario assumes improving regional water use efficiency based on historical trends, which leads to a 4 percent decline in water use intensity per hectare (m
    <span class="sup">3</span>/ha). Using cost data on water projects from 
    <a rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0245">Inocencio et al. (2007)</a> and FAO’s AquaStat Database (
    <a rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0125">FAO, 2016b</a>), the average annual cost of investments to achieve this level of improvement to the irrigation system amounts to about $4 billion per year from 2010 to 2030. The majority of the investments is dedicated to irrigation expansion, particularly in SSA. Improvements in soil management were estimated to be more than $1.5 billion per year with SSA requiring about 58 percent of costs for Africa and West Asia.
   </p>
   <p id="p0280" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The economic growth projected as a part of the baseline SSP2 assumptions is significant across the developing world, particularly for SSA. This growth will require investments in expanding and maintaining transportation and energy infrastructure, which are critical for not only the agriculture sector, but the economy as a whole. Following 
    <a rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0435">Rosegrant, Magalhaes, Valmonte-Santos, and Mason-D’Croz (2018)</a>, we estimate global infrastructure investments to be about $52.5 billion per year. In Africa and West Asia, the investment levels will be much smaller than in other regions at about $1.1 billion per year, which may seem counterintuitive due to lower levels of infrastructure in the region. However, a significant share of infrastructure investment is focused on maintenance and preventing deterioration. The low levels and quality of existing infrastructure throughout Africa and West Asia lead to lower investment costs in the region as investments are focused on new construction instead of maintaining older infrastructure.

    <a rid="f0020" ref-type="fig" href="#f0020">Fig. 4</a>, total CGIAR investments in agricultural R&amp;D would start to diverge from the baseline in 2015, increasing to more than $3.1 billion by 2030, almost double the investment level in 2030 in the baseline scenario ($1.7 billion) (
    <a rid="f0025" ref-type="fig" href="#f0025">Fig. 5</a>). This amounts to an average annual investment of $0.74 billion per year in additional investments in CGIAR research. These investment increases will not be uniform across regions, with nearly 90 percent of additional investments ($0.67 billion per year) needed in SSA.

   <p id="p0295" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plausible investments in agricultural research to boost yields by 2030 will not be sufficient to eliminate hunger in Africa. Additional investments to improve the productive capacity of agriculture and boost the sector’s efficiency will be required. These investments are also critical towards improving the sustainability of the agriculture sector ensuring that gains achieved by 2030 can be maintained moving further into the 21st century. The additional agricultural investments considered in this analysis include investments to improving the capacity of water resource management (more efficient irrigation technologies, implementation of soil water management technologies), as well as further expansion of irrigation beyond the assumed expansion in the baseline.</p>
   <p id="p0300" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The additional investments needed to expand irrigation, and improve water resource management throughout the developing world are significant, more than $25 billion per year (columns 2–4 in 
    <a rid="t0025" ref-type="table" href="#t0025">Table 5</a>), nearly doubling baseline investments for irrigation expansion (
    <a rid="t0020" ref-type="table" href="#t0020">Table 4</a>). About $7.7 billion, or about 31 percent, of this additional investment will be in Africa and West Asia. Most of this investment in Africa and West Asia will be in irrigation expansion ($3.6 billion, 47 percent) and soil management ($3 billion, 40 percent). Within this region almost two thirds of the investments are concentrated in SSA.

   <p id="p0305" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agricultural markets throughout the developing world suffer from market inefficiencies due to poor infrastructure. To reduce these inefficiencies, and thereby reduce transportation and marketing costs it is necessary to invest in building new infrastructure as well as improving and maintaining current infrastructure. These investments enhance productivity along the value chain, increase the speed of moving commodities to markets while also improving storage capacity, all of which improve market efficiency by better matching supply and demand over time. In this scenario, infrastructure investments focus on expanding and improving energy and transportation infrastructure. The cost of infrastructure investments is based on 
    <a rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0435">Rosegrant et al. (2018)</a>, where infrastructure investments across the developing world in road network expansion and improvement, rail expansion, and increased electrification were estimated to cost almost $26 billion per year between 2015 and 2030. Investments in Africa and West Asia account for about $6.6 billion (25 percent) of the total infrastructure investments with the majority dedicated to the improvement of road connections.
