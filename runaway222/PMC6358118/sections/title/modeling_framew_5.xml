 <p id="p0145" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore the role of increased agricultural productivity for food security in Africa, we use IFPRI’s IMPACT system of models (
  <a rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0400">Robinson et al., 2015</a>). IMPACT has been used extensively in projecting future agricultural production and demand and changes to food security globally and regionally (

  <a rid="b0485" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0485">Sulser et al., 2011</a>). It has been used to explore alternative agricultural productivity futures (

  <a rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0425">Rosegrant et al., 2014</a>), including the potential impacts of climate change on agriculture (

  <a rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0325">Nelson et al., 2010</a>, 
  <a rid="b0480" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0480">Sulser et al., 2015</a>). IMPACT is linked to spatially explicit crop and hydrology models to integrate natural resource constraints on agricultural production (
  <a rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0400">Robinson et al., 2015</a>, 
  <a rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0415">Rosegrant et al., 2002</a>). Additionally, IMPACT represents the global agriculture sector with a high level of geographic disaggregation and broad commodity coverage as compared to other similar models (
  <a rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0300">Mason-D’Croz et al., 2016</a>, 
  <a rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0405">Robinson et al., 2014</a>), which makes it a good tool to analyze the potential of investing in African agriculture across a range of commodities.

 <p id="p0150" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The IMPACT system of models has, at its core, a highly disaggregated, global partial equilibrium multi-market model that simulates 62 agricultural commodity markets in 158 countries and regions. This multi-market model is directly linked to grid-based biophysical models (crop and hydrology models) that provide inputs on the impacts of changes in temperature and water availability at 0.5-degree resolution that are aggregated to summarize effects on agricultural production in 320 sub-national geographic units (Food Production Units or FPUs), which are the intersection of national boundaries with water basins. The DSSAT crop-modeling suite (
  <a rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0205">Hoogenboom et al., 2012</a>, 
  <a rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0265">Jones et al., 2003</a>) provides estimated yields of crops at the grid-cell under varying management and climate scenarios. Crop land and crop allocation are determined at the FPU level using stylized land markets that simulate cropping choices based on changes to marginal revenue of crop production, such that total cropland and specific crop areas respond over time to changing crop productivity and prices. Water availability is modeled with the IMPACT suite of water models at the grid level and aggregated to FPUs, with water demand determined through crop/livestock life cycles, cropping patterns, and competition with non-agricultural sectors at FPU levels. IMPACT solves for equilibrium prices that clear world commodity markets by equating global supply and demand annually out to 2050. Food demand is simulated for all countries and regions based on changes in average income, population, and prices. Food demand then serves as an input to estimations of changes in food security, such as the population at risk of hunger (

 <p id="p0155" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a partial-equilibrium model, IMPACT does not endogenously model the feedbacks between the agriculture sector and the broader economy. Investments in agriculture, particularly in developing countries where agriculture contributes a large share of total GDP, would be expected to have significant economic spillovers (
  <a rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0085">Dercon and Gollin, 2014</a>, 
  <a rid="b0505" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0505">Timmer, 2002</a>). To better assess the potential of investments in agriculture to spur economic growth, the IMPACT framework was augmented to include an iterative link to GLOBE (
  <a rid="b0570" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0570">Willenbockel et al., 2018</a>), a global computable general equilibrium model (
  <a rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" href="#f0005">Fig. 1</a>). The extended dynamic version of GLOBE employed here was initially calibrated to the GTAP 8.1 database (
  <a rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0320">Narayanan, Aguiar, &amp; McDougall, 2012</a>) and represents global economy-wide production, demand, and trade for 24 sectors in 15 geographical regions. This version incorporates capital accumulation, population growth, labor force growth, and technical progress, and features a stylized representation of the technical substitution possibilities among different energy sources in production using a state-of the-art KLEM (Capital [

 <p id="p0160" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in agricultural productivity from IMPACT are passed to GLOBE as factor productivity shifters that generate equivalent impacts on agricultural producer prices. Price changes lead to knock-on effects for non-agricultural sectors, ultimately leading to changes in real household incomes, which are then passed to IMPACT that incorporates these income dynamics into its food demand system. To bridge the varying levels of geographic aggregation between the two models we exploit the fact that the household real income deviations from the baseline are highly correlated with the initial shares of value added generated by food production. Using the fully disaggregated GTAP database we estimate the food value-added shares in GDP for 135 countries to downscale changes in real income from GLOBE to IMPACT.
