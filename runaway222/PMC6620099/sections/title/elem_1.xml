  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore determinants of the 
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub> difference between soil depths, we analyzed four types of variables associated with 
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub>, including substrate quality, SOM association with minerals, SOM protection by aggregates, and microbial communities, and compared them between the two soil depths. Of these variables, substrate quality revealed by SOM composition differed between the topsoil and the subsoil. Specifically, the intensity of O-alkyl C acquired from solid-state 
   <span class="sup">13</span>C CPMAS (cross polarization with magic-angle spinning) NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) was higher in the topsoil (41%) than in the subsoil (29%) (

   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01; 
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, A and B</a>). The calculated alkyl/O-alkyl ratio was thus significantly higher in the subsoil (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01; 
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>), indicating more recalcitrant SOM in deep soils. Consequently, on the basis of the “carbon-quality temperature” hypothesis, the poorer substrate quality could not be responsible for the lower
