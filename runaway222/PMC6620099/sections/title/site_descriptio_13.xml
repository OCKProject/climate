 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected soil samples from three alpine meadow sites on the Tibetan Plateau, China, where substantial quantities of soil organic C (15.3 Pg) were stored in the top 3 m (
  <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">
   <span class="italic">44</span>
  </a>). In the past decades, mean annual temperature on the plateau increased at a rate about twice that of global warming (
  <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">
   <span class="italic">45</span>
  </a>). The high rate of climate warming, together with the high

  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
   <span class="italic">46</span>
  </a>), could induce potential positive C-climate feedback in this unique geographic region. Moreover, because of the detected differences in substrate quality, environmental constraints, and microbial properties among soil depths (
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>), there might be considerable differences in 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> through soil profile. To test this possibility, we selected three sampling sites (Halejing, Xihetai, and Zhagamu) on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (fig. S1A) and examined

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sites are situated at latitudes of 37.02°N to 37.61°N and longitudes of 100.11°E to 101.24°E, with an elevation of 3200 to 3400 m. The mean annual temperature varies from 0.12° to 2.20°C, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 340 to 378 mm. The vegetation type belongs to alpine meadow, characterized by the dominant species of 
  <span class="italic">Kobresia pygmaea</span> in Halejing and Zhagamu, and 
  <span class="italic">Kobresia humilis</span> in Xihetai. The soil type at the three study sites is Cambisol according to the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
   <span class="italic">46</span>
  </a>). Cambisols are widespread not only on the Tibetan Plateau but also worldwide (
  <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
   <span class="italic">47</span>
  </a>), accounting for ~38% of the Tibetan Plateau and ~11% of the global land surface. Soil physicochemical properties at these sites are given in table S3.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted soil sampling in July and August 2014 (
  <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">
   <span class="italic">44</span>
  </a>). At each sampling site, we set up a 10 m × 10 m square plot and excavated three replicate soil pits at two corners and the center along a diagonal line (fig. S1B). We then collected topsoil at depths of 0 to 10 cm and subsoil at depths of 30 to 50 cm (fig. S1C). Soils from each depth were divided into two subsamples: one of which was passed through a 2-mm sieve and stored at −20°C to determine SOM composition and microbial communities; the other set was air-dried and processed for measurements of other physicochemical properties.
