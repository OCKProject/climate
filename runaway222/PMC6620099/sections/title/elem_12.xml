  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected soil samples from three alpine meadow sites on the Tibetan Plateau, China, where substantial quantities of soil organic C (15.3 Pg) were stored in the top 3 m (
   <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">
    <span class="italic">44</span>
   </a>). In the past decades, mean annual temperature on the plateau increased at a rate about twice that of global warming (
   <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">
    <span class="italic">45</span>
   </a>). The high rate of climate warming, together with the high 
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub> on the plateau (
   <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
    <span class="italic">46</span>
   </a>), could induce potential positive C-climate feedback in this unique geographic region. Moreover, because of the detected differences in substrate quality, environmental constraints, and microbial properties among soil depths (
   <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
    <span class="italic">17</span>
   </a>), there might be considerable differences in 
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub> through soil profile. To test this possibility, we selected three sampling sites (Halejing, Xihetai, and Zhagamu) on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (fig. S1A) and examined 
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub> in different soil depths and various soil C components, as well as the associated mechanisms.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sites are situated at latitudes of 37.02°N to 37.61°N and longitudes of 100.11°E to 101.24°E, with an elevation of 3200 to 3400 m. The mean annual temperature varies from 0.12° to 2.20°C, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 340 to 378 mm. The vegetation type belongs to alpine meadow, characterized by the dominant species of 
   <span class="italic">Kobresia pygmaea</span> in Halejing and Zhagamu, and 
   <span class="italic">Kobresia humilis</span> in Xihetai. The soil type at the three study sites is Cambisol according to the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (
   <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
    <span class="italic">46</span>
   </a>). Cambisols are widespread not only on the Tibetan Plateau but also worldwide (
   <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
    <span class="italic">47</span>
   </a>), accounting for ~38% of the Tibetan Plateau and ~11% of the global land surface. Soil physicochemical properties at these sites are given in table S3.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted soil sampling in July and August 2014 (
   <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">
    <span class="italic">44</span>
   </a>). At each sampling site, we set up a 10 m × 10 m square plot and excavated three replicate soil pits at two corners and the center along a diagonal line (fig. S1B). We then collected topsoil at depths of 0 to 10 cm and subsoil at depths of 30 to 50 cm (fig. S1C). Soils from each depth were divided into two subsamples: one of which was passed through a 2-mm sieve and stored at −20°C to determine SOM composition and microbial communities; the other set was air-dried and processed for measurements of other physicochemical properties.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental design</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine the 
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub> difference between soil depths and the associated mechanisms, we established two manipulative experiments based on 330-day incubations at 10° and 20°C: One was conducted to compare 
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub> in the topsoil and subsoil, and also to test the effects of aggregate protection through the uncrushed (control) and crushed (remove aggregate protection) soils (termed “aggregate disruption experiment”). The other was performed to examine the depth difference in microbial controls by inoculating soils with active microorganism from away (collected in the other depth) and own (the same depth) (termed “microorganism reciprocal transplant experiment”).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the aggregate disruption experiment, we compared 
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub> between the topsoil and the subsoil and then examined the effects of aggregate protection on 
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub>. The treatments included uncrushed (control) and crushed soil samples. For the crushed treatment, air-dried soil samples were crushed for 1 min by a ball mill to disrupt aggregates and remove aggregate protection (
   <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
    <span class="italic">19</span>
   </a>). Together, a 3 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 factorial experiment was conducted corresponding to three study sites, two soil depths, two levels of aggregate disruption, two incubation temperatures, and three replicates. For each of these treatments, 10 g of air-dried topsoil and 20 g of air-dried subsoil from each replicate were evenly distributed into 250 ml of airtight amber jars and incubated at both 10° and 20°C for 330 days (fig. S1D). Soil moisture was adjusted to 60% of water holding capacity (
   <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
    <span class="italic">46</span>
   </a>). The rate of CO
   <sub>2</sub> release was determined on the basis of the changes in headspace CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration during the incubation interval (
   <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
    <span class="italic">17</span>
   </a>) using an infrared gas analyzer (EGM-5; PP Systems, Haverhill, MA, USA). The measurements were taken every 1 to 4 days for the first 3 weeks and then 1 to 2 weeks for 3 months, followed by 1 to 2 months for the rest of the incubation. It should be noted that the CO
   <sub>2</sub> production from the uncrushed (control) soils was also used to explore the difference in 
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub> between soil depths.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the microorganism reciprocal transplant experiment, we explored whether microorganisms were functionally different between soil depths (
   <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
    <span class="italic">20</span>
   </a>). This experiment was conducted by applying two microbial inoculums (derived from topsoil and subsoil) to both sterilized topsoil and subsoil. Specifically, soil samples were sterilized using γ-irradiation (
   <span class="sup">60</span>Co) at a dose of 30 kGy (
   <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
    <span class="italic">37</span>
   </a>). The sterilized soil was then divided into two subsamples, receiving the inoculum derived from itself (own) and from the other corresponding depth (away), respectively; the former treatment (own) was treated as control. In total, 72 microcosms (3 sites × 2 soil depths × 2 inoculums × 2 temperatures × 3 replicates) were constructed. Inoculums from each soil depth were made by adding 1 g of dry weight fresh soil to 100 ml of sterilized deionized water. Then, the inoculum was shaken at 150 rpm for 0.5 hour and filtered through a Whatman GF/C filter. Inoculum (0.4 ml) was applied to per gram soil. The procedure of subsequent CO
   <sub>2</sub> measurement was the same as the first experiment.

   </a>), soil samples were rinsed with deionized water and then freeze-dried. Approximately 100 mg of HF-treated samples was measured on an AVANCE III 400 WB spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) at 100.62 MHz. The spectrometer was equipped with a 4-mm CPMAS probe, and the parameters were set with a spinning rate of 8 kHz, a contact time of 2 ms, and a recycle delay of 6 s. We then used MestReNova 9.0 (Mestrelab Research S.L., Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain) to integrate the spectra into the following chemical shift regions and acquire the relative intensity of each region: alkyl C [0 to 50 parts per million (ppm)], O-alkyl C (50 to 110 ppm), aromatic C (110 to 165 ppm), and carboxylic C (165 to 220 ppm) (

A reducing agent, sodium dithionite, was then added, and the mixture was held at 80°C for 15 min. Instead of CBD extraction, soil samples in the control treatment were extracted with sodium chloride (NaCl) at an equivalent ionic strength. After rinsing the soil residues three times with 1 M NaCl, SOC content of the residues in each treatment was measured. Fe-bound SOC was then calculated as follows

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine SOM protection by aggregates, we isolated three SOM fractions to measure C distributions in each fraction. Specifically, using the wet-sieving technique (

   </a>), 30 g of air-dried soil (&lt;2 mm) was submerged in water for 5 min and then wet-sieved over 250 and 53 μm of sieves, consecutively. The fraction collected on the 250-μm sieve was macroaggregates (250 to 2000 μm), and that collected on the 53-μm sieve was microaggregates (53 to 250 μm). The fraction in the remaining suspension was silt + clay (&lt;53 μm). Each fraction was then dried at 60°C. After isolating sand in macroaggregates and microaggregates with sodium hexametaphosphate, SOC concentrations of the three fractions were measured. Of the three fractions, the proportions of SOC distributed in macroaggregates and microaggregates were used to quantify SOM protection by aggregates (

On the basis of this criterion, the collinearity between SOC distribution in macroaggregates and microaggregates could be partly omitted (VIF = 1.6), whereas the relative abundance of fungal PLFAs was closely correlated with F/B (VIF = 4.4), and thus, only the former was included in the model.
