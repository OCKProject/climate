 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether the underlying mechanisms of depth-associated variations in 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> were C pool dependent, we conducted variation partitioning analyses for the active and slow C pools. During these analyses, we incorporated aggregate protection and microbial communities, which exerted significant controls over 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Figs. 3 and 4</a>). The results demonstrated that 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> variations in the bulk soil and slow pool were primarily explained by aggregate protection, with the pure effects being 24.5% (
  <a rid="F5" ref-type="fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5A</a>) and 36.9% (
  <a rid="F5" ref-type="fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5C</a>), respectively. The 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> variations in the active pool, however, were mainly explained by microbial communities, whose pure effect was 16.2% (
  <a rid="F5" ref-type="fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5B</a>). These results demonstrated that microbial communities governed 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> in the active pool, while aggregate protection governed 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> in the slow pool.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The different underlying mechanisms of 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> between the two C pools were confirmed by the microorganism reciprocal transplant experiment and aggregate disruption experiment. The former experiment showed that, in the active pool, inoculating the topsoil with the subsoil microorganism (away inoculum) significantly decreased 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> compared with its own inoculum (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01; fig. S2A), whereas inoculating the subsoil with the topsoil microorganism (away inoculum) resulted in a significantly higher 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01; fig. S2A). Consequently, △

  <sub>10</sub> (i.e., 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10 topsoil</sub> − 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>

  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01;

  <sub>10</sub> in this pool (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.20; 
  <a rid="F6" ref-type="fig" href="#F6">Fig. 6A</a>). In contrast, the later experiment demonstrated that the SOM protection by aggregates mainly affected
