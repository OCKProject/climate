  <sub>10</sub> was independent of the sampling site (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.28; table S1). To further explore 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> for various SOM components, we adopted the 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10-q</sub> method to evaluate 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> for three soil C fractions (i.e., 1 to 1.5%, 2 to 2.5%, and 3 to 3.5% of cumulative respired soil C), which represent a gradient of decreasing substrate lability. Similarly, the topsoil 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> was significantly higher than the subsoil for 2 to 2.5% and 3 to 3.5% of cumulative respired soil C (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05; 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>), without interaction effects (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.20 and 0.50, respectively; table S1). No significant difference was detected in the 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> value of 1 to 1.5% of cumulative respired soil C between soil depths (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.05; table S1). In addition, 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> estimated from the two-pool model also showed significantly lower values in the subsoil for both active pool and slow pool (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05; 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>), with no site Ã— depth interaction (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.31 and 0.26 for active pool and slow pool, respectively; table S1).
