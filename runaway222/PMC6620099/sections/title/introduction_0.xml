 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Globally, approximately 2300 Pg (1 Pg = 10
  <span class="sup">15</span> g) carbon (C) is stored in the top 3 m of soils, of which more than 70% is distributed in deep horizons below 20 cm (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>). Deep soil C is characterized by high stability over long time scales, because the rate of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition usually decreases with soil depth (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). Similar to many other biochemical reactions, the decomposition of SOM is temperature dependent (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). Because of this point, global warming is expected to promote carbon dioxide (CO
  <sub>2</sub>) release from both the topsoil and the subsoil, thereby triggering a potential positive feedback (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). However, large uncertainties remain in the magnitude of this C-climate feedback, partly due to the inaccurate parameterization of the temperature sensitivity (
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub>) of SOM decomposition in different soil depths and C pools in Earth system models (ESMs) (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>). It has been estimated that the current use of a globally constant 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> value in most models underestimates the magnitude of C-climate feedback by 25% compared to incorporating the spatially heterogeneous 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> values into models (
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>). Therefore, a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms regulating 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> is pivotal for accurately predicting soil C dynamics and reducing model uncertainties in forecasting terrestrial C-climate feedback.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historically, SOM quality had been recognized as the major determinant of 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub>. On the basis of enzyme kinetic theory, “carbon-quality temperature” hypothesis predicts that the decomposition of low-quality substrates in the subsoil requires high activation energy and is thus more sensitive to temperature changes (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>). However, several emergent conceptual frameworks have challenged the perceived importance of soil C quality in governing the decomposition of SOM and its responses to warming, and argued that processes controlling substrate accessibility (e.g., SOM protection, spatial disconnection, and enzyme diffusion) are also critically important (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>). Moreover, microbial properties (e.g., microbial abundance, community composition, and enzyme productions) and the existence of energetic barriers to microorganisms regulate SOM decomposition and 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> as well (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). Despite the theoretical predictions of an important role for these factors, direct evidence for the effects of SOM protection and microbial communities on 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> is scarce (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>), which, in turn, limits the accurate parameterization of 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> in ESMs. The soil profile provides an ideal natural gradient for exploring the relative contribution of different mechanisms underlying 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> due to vertical variations in substrate quality and environmental and microbial controls over SOM decomposition (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>). Moreover, manipulative experiments such as aggregate disruption experiments (
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>) and microorganism reciprocal transplant experiments (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>), combined with laboratory culture, offer the possibility to explore the effects of aggregate protection and microbial communities on 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub>, respectively. However, these approaches have not been adequately applied in disentangling the complex mechanisms regulating 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> between soil depths.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is widely recognized that the large heterogeneity of SOM decomposition and its response to warming exists not only between soil depths but also within the composition of SOM itself (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>). SOM is considered as a heterogeneous mixture consisting of pools with different turnover times, which is also the premise of classic soil C models such as Century (
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>) and RothC (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>). It has been assumed that the active C pool, persisting for hours to weeks, is composed mainly of chemically labile and unprotected compounds, whereas the slow C pool could persist for decades to centuries due to the physicochemical and biological constraints on decomposition (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>). These variations in substrate quality and abiotic and biotic regulators between C pools imply that their responses to climate warming and the associated mechanisms may also differ (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). Despite this recognition, current models assume equal 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> value for all C pools (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). The assumption of a single 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> value may obscure the responses of soil C pool to climate warming, especially for the slow C pool, whose temperature response cannot be well captured from short-term incubation experiments (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). With the development of a data-model fusion technology, Bayesian probabilistic inversion, it is possible to estimate 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> values for different soil C pools through the combination of long-term incubations and two-pool models (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). Nonetheless, limited studies have adopted this approach to explore potential mechanisms regulating 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> for different soil C pools.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study aimed to address the following three questions: (i) Are 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> values for bulk soil, active C pool, and slow C pool different between the topsoil and the subsoil? (ii) What are the regulatory mechanisms underlying the 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> difference between soil depths? (iii) Are the regulatory mechanisms different between the two C pools? To answer these questions, topsoil samples from 0 to 10 cm depth and subsoil samples from 30 to 50 cm depth were collected from three alpine meadow sites on the Tibetan Plateau (fig. S1). On the basis of these samples, we conducted a 330-day incubation experiment, in combination with three methods (bulk soil 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> by average decomposition rate, 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> values for different respired soil C fractions through the 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10-q</sub> method, and active and slow pool 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> by the two-pool model), to estimate the 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> values of various SOM components for the two soil depths. Soil properties including substrate quality, SOM protection, and microbial characteristics were then quantified to explore the determinants of 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub>. We further performed two manipulative experiments (i.e., aggregate disruption experiment and microorganism reciprocal transplant experiment) to examine the effects of aggregate protection and microbial communities on 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> in different C pools.
