  <sub>10</sub> difference between soil depths
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore determinants of the 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> difference between soil depths, we analyzed four types of variables associated with 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub>, including substrate quality, SOM association with minerals, SOM protection by aggregates, and microbial communities, and compared them between the two soil depths. Of these variables, substrate quality revealed by SOM composition differed between the topsoil and the subsoil. Specifically, the intensity of O-alkyl C acquired from solid-state 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C CPMAS (cross polarization with magic-angle spinning) NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) was higher in the topsoil (41%) than in the subsoil (29%) (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01; 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, A and B</a>), whereas the contribution of alkyl C was significantly higher in the subsoil (53%) than in the topsoil (28%) (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01; 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, A and B</a>). The calculated alkyl/O-alkyl ratio was thus significantly higher in the subsoil (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01; 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>), indicating more recalcitrant SOM in deep soils. Consequently, on the basis of the “carbon-quality temperature” hypothesis, the poorer substrate quality could not be responsible for the lower 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> in the subsoil.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then measured the proportion of soil organic carbon (SOC) associated with Fe to total SOC (i.e., Fe-bound SOC) to quantify SOM protection by minerals. The results revealed no significant difference in the Fe-bound SOC between the topsoil and the subsoil (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.17; 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>). In consistence, the proportion of SOC associated with silt + clay (&lt;53 μm) acquired by the wet-sieving technique did not show significant difference (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.83; 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>), jointly indicating that SOM protection by minerals might be less responsible for the 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> difference between soil depths. However, SOM protection by aggregates, as determined by the same technique, differed between the two soil depths. Compared with the topsoil, the proportion of SOC distribution in the subsoil was lower in macroaggregates (250 to 2000 μm, 44% versus 63%, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01; 
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>) but higher in microaggregates (53 to 250 μm, 32% versus 15%, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01; 
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3B</a>). Moreover, as revealed by linear regression analyses, these differences in aggregate protection were associated with the
