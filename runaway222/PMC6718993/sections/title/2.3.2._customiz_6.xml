 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Any user who is initially registered on the HEAT-SHIELD platform is considered an “unacclimatized worker” to heat stress conditions and, for this reason, the RAL is initially used in the calculation of the customized heat risk level. However, after 5 days with at least moderate heat stress risk level (
  <a rid="ijerph-16-02890-t001" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02890-t001">Table 1</a>) forecasted in the short term (the first 5 days of forecasting the heat stress risk of the HEAT-SHIELD platform) during the warm season, the worker is considered “acclimatized” and the REL (higher WBGT limits than RAL) is used for the heat stress risk level calculation. Based on some stakeholder meetings organized as part of the HEAT-SHIELD project, one of the main feedback obtained was that workers are often not able to define whether they are adapted to heat. For this reason, we decided to adopt a simple empirical approach which, based on the available scientific literature, allowed us to consider when a worker can be considered acclimatized to heat. According to previous studies [
  <a rid="B56-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-ijerph-16-02890">56</a>,
  <a rid="B57-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57-ijerph-16-02890">57</a>,
  <a rid="B58-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58-ijerph-16-02890">58</a>], about 1 to 2 weeks of daily heat exposure are needed to gain adaptation that reduces physiological strain and helps to improve physical work capabilities under a hot environment. Other studies have shown that about 75% of the physiologic adjustments occur within the first 4–6 days of heat exposure [
  <a rid="B59-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59-ijerph-16-02890">59</a>,
  <a rid="B60-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60-ijerph-16-02890">60</a>] and a recent study [
  <a rid="B61-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61-ijerph-16-02890">61</a>] revealed that 5 days of exposure to heat sessions were enough to acclimatize to heat workers involved in hot-climate countries. The 5-day threshold with critical heat stress conditions (in our case with at least a moderate risk level) was therefore used to define when a worker can be considered acclimatized to heat within a warm season.

    <p>Moderate: Your water needs will be high. Increase the number of breaks (include small breaks with cooling) and drink frequently. Remember to rehydrate after work/exercise: Be aware that thirst is usually not a sufficient indicator when sweating is high.

   <div class="list-item">
    <p>High: This level is associated with severe heat stress. It is strongly suggested to adjust work—use active cooling, schedule frequent breaks in shadowed or cool areas where you can hydrate. Additional drinking is required (water needs may be more than 1 L/h). If possible, after consulting your doctor, add mineral salts to your meals. Consider adjusting the timing of activities (moderate–heavy physical tasks) to the cooler period of the day.</p>
