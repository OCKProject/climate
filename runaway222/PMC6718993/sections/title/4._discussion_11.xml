 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The HEAT-SHIELD platform [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-02890">24</a>] developed within the frame of the European Project HEAT-SHIELD and described in this study represents the first step to fill the lack of international heat warning systems specifically addressed to occupational sectors. This website platform was officially launched in 2018 and is currently operating for about 1800 European localities. It represents the first international example of personalized short- and long-term heat risk forecasts with useful heat-related adaptation information for workers and stakeholders in charge of safeguarding workers’ health and productivity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently the website platform is available in six languages (English, Italian, Slovenian, French, Portuguese and German) and will be further implemented in other languages. This characteristic is of great importance especially in the occupational field because most European countries are typically multicultural. It is indeed known that foreign workers may have a real difficulty in understanding the local language with consequent important repercussions on the perception of the heat risk in the workplace [
  <a rid="B64-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-ijerph-16-02890">64</a>,
  <a rid="B65-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65-ijerph-16-02890">65</a>]. As reported in a recent review on the existing HHWSs in Europe [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-16-02890">17</a>], one of the main communication limits of these systems is that the warnings are generally issued in the local language of each country in addition to (in very few countries) English.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The non-customized heat stress forecast output (the maps of the weekly maximum probability of exceeding the daily WBGT
  <sub>sun</sub> threshold of 27 °C) is simplified, generalized information valid for the whole Europe and accessible to everyone without any registration information. However, this information has the limitation of highlighting the potential heat risk mainly in southern Europe, displaying a clear latitudinal gradient typically resembling the air temperature gradient. The scientific literature [
  <a rid="B66-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66-ijerph-16-02890">66</a>,
  <a rid="B67-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67-ijerph-16-02890">67</a>,
  <a rid="B68-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-ijerph-16-02890">68</a>] has shown that local populations are acclimatized to their local climate and respond to heat stress differently. A solution to try to solve this limitation would be to collect data on the perception of heat stress in the occupational sectors in various geographical areas with different climatic characteristics. In this way, the WBGT thresholds might be recalibrated accounting for geographical adaptation. The main aim of the very general information provided by the non-customized outputs is to motivate the user to register on the HEAT-SHIELD platform to obtain personalized information on heat stress risk calculated by using a tailored WBGT threshold based on individual worker characteristics and the workplace environment. The personalization of the forecast certainly represents an ambitious challenge to improve the generic information already available and provided by the main meteorological services and that need to correctly interpret each personal situation. This customized approach is essential in occupational settings due to the high variability of environmental conditions and job/task activities, which results in a strong heterogeneity of the thermal stress exposure with direct repercussions on workers’ health and productivity. However, it must also be considered that, in common practice, workers accustomed to carry out specific work tasks repetitively, might make a self-evaluation in a way that underestimates the work effort and therefore the heat-related job risk perception. This situation might include some bias and distort the efficiency of the strategies to counteract heat stress. Distortion might also depend on socio-cultural aspects, such as the dietary habits that underlie the maintenance of a good level of hydration and nutrition. For example, people of Muslim origin are at greater heat-related health risk during the Ramadan period [
  <a rid="B69-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69-ijerph-16-02890">69</a>,
  <a rid="B70-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70-ijerph-16-02890">70</a>]. On the other hand, a natural reaction to heat of a worker is to reduce their physical activity, that is a self-pacing or autonomous adaptation which reduces the body’s internal heat production but also the hourly work capacity [
  <a rid="B71-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71-ijerph-16-02890">71</a>,
  <a rid="B72-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72-ijerph-16-02890">72</a>,
  <a rid="B73-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73-ijerph-16-02890">73</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A strength of the developed website platform relates to its ability to provide hydration and work/break schedule recommendations in the short term. Taking breaks in shady or cool areas as well as suggestions on hydration (water consumption) during working time according to specific heat stress conditions and physical efforts represents a fundamental heat-related adaptation method recommended by the ISO [
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-16-02890">36</a>] and other governmental agencies [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-16-02890">19</a>,
  <a rid="B58-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58-ijerph-16-02890">58</a>]. Moreover, the platform also includes e-mail alerts that represent important adaptation strategies to timely counteract heat stress conditions and safeguard the workers’ health and productivity. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The HEAT-SHIELD platform is a potentially very useful tool because heat stress is significantly increasing in many geographical areas worldwide, with strong effects also in European cities [
  <a rid="B74-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74-ijerph-16-02890">74</a>]. In addition, heat stress is expected to increase significantly in the next years because of climate change [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-16-02890">1</a>,
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-16-02890">2</a>] also in areas where the worker population is not used to fighting this phenomenon [
  <a rid="B75-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75-ijerph-16-02890">75</a>], such as central-northern European countries.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the moment, the HEAT-SHIELD platform is the only example of a website platform providing such a comprehensive collection of information. Nevertheless, there are already a few interesting smartphone applications in place that inform workers about precautions against outdoor heat stress. These include the OSHA NIOSH Heat Safety Tool [
  <a rid="B76-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-ijerph-16-02890">76</a>] and the ClimApp [
  <a rid="B77-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-ijerph-16-02890">77</a>] device currently in an advanced stage of development by several HEAT-SHIELD partners. These applications are, however, not able to provide long-term forecasting information that is particularly useful for planning issues. Precisely for this reason, the HEAT-SHIELD website platform is based on the extended range ensemble forecasts of the ECMWF that enables customized heat stress risk up to over a month. In this way, useful information for employers, organizations and operators in charge of safeguarding health and productivity in various occupational areas are provided, calibrated with greater precision, the interventions to be taken according to the subjective characteristics of the worker and other situations in which the workers are involved. A further interesting feature of the HEAT-SHIELD platform is the possibility for real-time verification of the heat stress risk situation by modifying some characteristics, for example, by varying the work environment (e.g., working in the shade) or the clothing worn, in this way planning the best actions to counteract the effects of the heat in the long term. Certainly, there is a need of further validation including the worker’s health component linked to the information provided by the HEAT-SHIELD platform. This might be done by processing the subjective information collected by the self-administered questionnaire developed within the frame of the HEAT-SHIELD project. They have already been used in several European countries for gathering evidences on workers’ risk perception of heat stress in the workplace and potential productivity losses due to extreme heat. For example, based on a preliminary investigation [
  <a rid="B78-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78-ijerph-16-02890">78</a>] carried out during the summer months of 2017 and 2018 on some workers engaged in Italy in construction and agriculture sectors, results revealed agreements between the ISO-standard WBGT thresholds associated with specific work efforts and the worker’s thermal stress perceptions for high WBGT values (WBGT &gt; 30 °C). Conversely no agreements were observed for lower WBGT values. In the latter case, workers declared a heat stress level (from low to more often moderate heat stress) even if the ISO-standard WBGT threshold for that activity level does not recommend critical heat-stress conditions. For this reason, if data collected also in other countries during the summer of 2019 and the following summers confirm these preliminary results, the recalibration of the ISO-standard WBGT thresholds may be desirable, also including lower critical values which, however, may represent a health problem. Furthermore, through the case studies planned as part of the HEAT-SHIELD project, other health/physiological data of workers are being collected that could be of great help for a worker’s health validation in relation to heat stress in workplaces.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the HEAT-SHIELD project started (January 2016), some stakeholder meetings presenting the HEAT-SHIELD platform have already been organized during the years of 2018 and 2019 in several European countries, and other meetings are scheduled in different countries by the end of the project (December 2020). One of the main objectives of these meetings, in which employers, workers, worker safety representatives, prevention, protection service managers and competent doctors took part, was to obtain immediate feedback on the HEAT-SHIELD platform. Initial user feedback suggest that there is potential for further improvements, with new procedures/suggestions aimed to provide increasingly detailed information useful for worker’s heat-related health prevention and reducing productivity loss. Trying to maximize employers’ involvement in the use of the HEAT-SHIELD platform is a priority since they are considered key elements among all stakeholders. In particular, employers are the main actors for regulating work activities (i.e., defining of the length of work shifts and relative work breaks, identifying of the days and working hours in which to carry out certain work activities, defining of the number of workers involved in specific work tasks, etc.) and are responsible for the workers’ health, without ever losing sight of the economic aspect linked to work productivity. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Field studies carried out also in the field of the HEAT-SHIELD project [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02890">14</a>,
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-16-02890">20</a>,

  <a rid="B80-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80-ijerph-16-02890">80</a>,
  <a rid="B81-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81-ijerph-16-02890">81</a>] aimed at evaluating the responses of workers exposed to heat stress conditions during different work activities will be particularly useful for identifying the best heat-related adaptation strategies helpful to manage this hazard situation. For now, only recommendations on water consumption and work/rest breaks clearly described in reports provided by international organizations working on this topic are provided. However, other recommendations (i.e., the recommended clothing, or others) obtained by using other thermal-stress indicators, subjective information (i.e., age or gender), and detailed infographics related to specific occupational sectors, could also be integrated and included in an operational way in the HEAT-SHIELD platform to counteract the effects of heat. A more complex issue, on the other hand, concerns the possibility of personalizing the heat risk level based on pre-existing diseases or specific pharmacological treatments. Currently, information on the customized heat risk refers to a healthy worker and not where specific drugs are used; the situation should always and exclusively be evaluated by an occupational health physician. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the near future, it will also be desirable to develop a system for monitoring work injuries to be updated in real time, to report heat-related injuries in order to activate timely emergency response interventions. In the current version, the website platform does not include heat stress thresholds based on the relationships between WBGT and injuries because only very few studies have investigated this relationship [
  <a rid="B82-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82-ijerph-16-02890">82</a>]. In addition, the use of meteorological data for occupational heat stress assessment is actually limited because weather stations do not traditionally and directly measure some important climate factors useful for WBGT calculation [
  <a rid="B83-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83-ijerph-16-02890">83</a>,
  <a rid="B84-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84-ijerph-16-02890">84</a>]. For this reason, results are not as obvious as those identified between several thermal indicators and some categories of the general population (e.g., the elderly) [
  <a rid="B85-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-ijerph-16-02890">85</a>,
  <a rid="B86-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86-ijerph-16-02890">86</a>,
  <a rid="B87-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87-ijerph-16-02890">87</a>]. In fact, in this latter case, city-specific thermal stress thresholds were identified, and in several cases, these thresholds were implemented in HHWSs addressed to the general population or the elderly [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-16-02890">17</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current website platform relies on a probabilistic forecast model, which has the advantage of allowing long-term forecasts. It has, however, also some limitations such as the temporal resolution (it only provides a daily value). In particular, the intra-daily hourly heat stress risk forecast (i.e., morning, afternoon, evening, night) is not provided and the information is only available for a limited number of European localities (about 1800). For this reason, we are already working to implement the heat stress risk forecast in the short term for specific regions by using high-resolution (i.e., spatial resolution of 3–7 km) deterministic meteorological models. In this way, detailed information on an hourly basis will be obtained and personalized heat stress risk will be available for various times of the day in which workers can be engaged. Furthermore, by exploiting the high spatial resolution of deterministic meteorological models, the information will be extended to all locations without the need to perform downscaling operations at the meteorological station level.</p>
