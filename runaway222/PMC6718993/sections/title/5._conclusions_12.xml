 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The HEAT-SHIELD platform [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-02890">24</a>] is the customized occupational heat-related warning system developed within the framework of the European HEAT-SHIELD project as the first operational website platform providing short- and long-term heat warning to safeguard workersâ€™ health and productivity on a continental scale. This platform represents a useful adaptation strategy aimed at protecting workers, a population category particularly exposed to the effects of climate change. The usefulness of this type of adaptation strategies is linked to the fact that, based on future climate change scenarios, more and more workers operating on ever-wider geographical areas affected by heat-stress hazard conditions will be exposed for longer periods of time during the year to the effects of global warming.
