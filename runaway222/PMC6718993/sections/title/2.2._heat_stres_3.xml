 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the target group of the HEAT-SHIELD platform, i.e., workers engaged in outdoor activities exposed in the sun and in the shade, the Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index was used as the primary heat strain indicator because it can be calculated (estimated) from standard weather and climate model data as well as measured locally at workplaces.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">WBGT was originally developed by U.S. military ergonomists in the 1950s [
  <a rid="B35-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-16-02890">35</a>] and is currently widely used and internationally recognized [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-16-02890">19</a>,
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-16-02890">36</a>] as a method for assessing heat stress conditions specifically in military [
  <a rid="B37-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-16-02890">37</a>], occupational and sports fields [
  <a rid="B38-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-16-02890">38</a>,
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-16-02890">39</a>,
  <a rid="B40-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-16-02890">40</a>]. WBGT (unit = °C) considers the combination of the natural wet bulb temperature (dependent on humidity, air temperature and wind speed), the black globe temperature (dependent on radiation and wind speed) and the air temperature for estimating heat-stress in the sun (WBGT
  <sub>sun</sub>, in conditions of direct short-wave radiation) and in the shade (WBGT
  <sub>shade</sub>, no direct short-wave radiation). The natural wet bulb temperature simulates the cooling of the body via sweat evaporation, while the black globe temperature simulates the heat absorption from short- and long-wave radiations (from the sun, the soil or artificial heat sources in the workplace). These two variables are influenced by both the air temperature and the wind speed. For example, low wind speeds considerably affect black globe temperatures and significant higher values occur with no wind. WBGT shows a large dependence on wind speed when the wind is low and only minor WBGT increases occur above 1 m/s [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on reference WBGT values, recommendations in term of work–rest cycles and water intake depending on specific work activities are provided by several international organizations. In particular, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) [
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-16-02890">36</a>] uses WBGT thresholds to recommend work–rest limits for workers involved in different physical activities and wearing specific clothing in hot environments, in order to avoid a core body temperature exceeding 38 °C [
  <a rid="B41-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-16-02890">41</a>]. The core body temperature of all humans is maintained close to 37 °C. While some increase in the core temperature beyond this latter threshold may be acceptable, an increase above 39 °C creates health risks [
  <a rid="B42-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-16-02890">42</a>] that vary from person to person. These variations depend on ethnic group, age, gender, duration of heat exposure and degree of acclimatization; in this way also generating geographical variations [
  <a rid="B41-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-16-02890">41</a>,
  <a rid="B43-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-16-02890">43</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At this stage, WBGT is considered to fulfill the purpose for individualized heat warnings, with customized limits for different workers potentially useful for managing policies against the heat effects.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the recommendations for calculating workplace WBGT from meteorological data provided by Lemke and Kjellstrom [
  <a rid="B41-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-16-02890">41</a>], we applied the WBGT implementations of Bernard and Pourmoghani [
  <a rid="B44-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-16-02890">44</a>] and Liljegren et al. [
  <a rid="B45-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-16-02890">45</a>] for computing WBGT in the shade and in the sun, respectively. These implementations allow the calculation of both the natural wet bulb temperature, that is the largest component (70%) of WBGT, and the black globe temperature (it contributes 20–30% of WBGT) as required by the WBGT
  <sub>sun</sub> and WBGT
  <sub>shade</sub> formulas starting from well-established meteorological variables (air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation) provided by the weather forecast model. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ECMWF model outputs used for the daily WBGT predictions are daily maximum temperature, daily average dew point temperature, and daily average near-surface wind speed. As daily maximum global radiation is not available as a forecast output, we derived this parameter from quantile mapping of daily mean radiation against the observed daily maximum radiation as part of the bias correction. Using these bias-corrected daily values of maximum temperature and radiation, and average humidity and wind, daily maximum WBGT
  <sub>sun</sub> and WBGT
  <sub>shade</sub> were computed by using the R package HeatStress [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-16-02890">46</a>], in this way providing the forecast of the maximum heat stress for each specific day.
