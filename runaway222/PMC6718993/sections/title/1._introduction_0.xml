 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meteorological observations worldwide reveal significant increases of heat-stress conditions and future climatological scenarios report that we should expect far worse situations even in the most optimistic projections [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-16-02890">1</a>,
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-16-02890">2</a>]. Workers, and above all outdoor manual workers, represent an important part of the population potentially vulnerable to heat stress [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-02890">3</a>,
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-16-02890">4</a>,
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-16-02890">5</a>]. In particular, work that involves high levels of physical exertion—such as heavy lifting and manual labor carried out for example by farmers, construction workers, fire-fighters, miners, soldiers, and manufacturing workers operating near artificial heat sources—are particularly affected since individuals tire faster and metabolize heat less effectively under exertion [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-02890">3</a>,
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-16-02890">4</a>,
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-16-02890">6</a>]. Workers are often exposed for many hours to direct solar radiation or artificial radiant heat, and in several cases wearing personal protective clothing and equipment that significantly aggravate heat stress by limiting body heat loss. An advanced working age or the potential interaction between heat and chemical substances (i.e., pesticides and fertilizers), used i.e., in agricultural activities, represent other important heat-related vulnerability factors. For economic reasons, workers may need to work during hot weather conditions, which impose an occupational heat stress; it is a public health issue. However, appropriate adaptation strategies could help to avoid heat-related health problems, and also limit the typical productivity loss that occurs during the warmer period of the year [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-16-02890">7</a>,
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-16-02890">8</a>]. Although workers contribute enormously to economic growth, they are often overlooked in discussions about the effects of heat [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-16-02890">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-16-02890">10</a>], and specific heat warning systems for occupational purposes are actually unavailable internationally.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An accurate and timely heat–health warning system (HHWS) represents one of the core elements nested in a wider Heat–Health Action Plan, which encompasses and directs all preventive measures to be taken to protect the population from the effects of environmental heat exposure [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-16-02890">9</a>,
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-02890">11</a>]. At present, HHWSs aim at protecting the general population or people considered most vulnerable, such as the elderly population [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-16-02890">12</a>,
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-16-02890">13</a>], even if in recent studies [
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-16-02890">10</a>,
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02890">14</a>] young workers were found to be as vulnerable and at increasing risk of occupational injuries with high temperatures. Various metrics to define the effects of heat on health have been developed [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-16-02890">9</a>,
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-16-02890">15</a>,
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-16-02890">16</a>], based on different thermal (i.e., single-metric based on air temperature or heat stress index; heat budget models; air mass-based synoptic climatological approaches) and health indicators (generally mortality data, but also morbidity indicators could be used if available). In this way, different heat threshold levels based on epidemiological (i.e., city-specific heat-related mortality thresholds) or climatological (i.e., specific percentiles of the local distribution of minimum and maximum temperatures) evidences, or even based on heat stress levels assessed through specific thermal stress indices, have been developed and are currently used to issue heat warnings in HHWSs [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-16-02890">9</a>,
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-16-02890">17</a>]. Concerning the occupational sector, a HHWS should be more focused on heat stress than mortality events or other health indicators addressed to the general population. This is because heat stress for workers represents a public health concern [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-16-02890">5</a>] and worker health and performance are affected at much lower environmental heat strain levels than those directly associated with higher mortality. When working in the heat, skin blood flow and sweat rate increase to allow for heat dissipation to the surrounding environment (thermoregulatory adjustments), thus increasing risk of heat-related injuries, kidney diseases and generally, physiological strain leading to dehydration [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-16-02890">18</a>,
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-16-02890">19</a>]. A recent study [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-16-02890">20</a>] revealed that about 70% of workers initiate work with a suboptimal hydration status, meaning that workers are dehydrated at onset of work and that rehydration from day to day may be a bigger issue than failure to drink during the working shift. The higher heart rate associated with dehydration signifies an overall elevation of cardiovascular strain [
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-16-02890">21</a>]. Dehydration may have an even larger impact on performance in cognitive occupational settings where people are exposed for prolonged periods to high heat stress levels and fail to prevent hypo-hydration [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-16-02890">20</a>]. Surely, a good adaptation to heat can help to prevent many negative consequences, even if it has recently been highlighted that heat acclimation may not be sufficient to protect against hyperthermia when complex tasks are performed [
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-16-02890">22</a>]. Thus, the availability of timely heat stress warnings calibrated on specific work activities and accounting for the clothing worn would make it possible to reduce heat-related performance losses, especially in the case of prolonged heat exposure.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the different needs of the occupational sector compared to the general population, a HHWS for occupational purposes should have some main characteristics. In particular: 
  <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>It should be personalized; that is, based on the physical demands of the job as well as on workers’ physical, clothing, and behavioral characteristics and on the work environment;</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>it should include short-term suggestions useful to help heat adaptation for workers;</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>it should contain long-term heat risk information for planning/organizing work, which is useful for employers, organizations, and operators in charge of safeguarding health and productivity in various occupational areas.</p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To achieve this goal, a meteorological forecasting model for different lead times (with forecasts up to about one month) is necessary, as well as the use of a thermal stress indicator able to provide detailed information in various situations. Then, the metric used should account for the level of physical activity performed by a worker, which will obviously be influenced by personal physical characteristics (e.g., weight and height), the clothing worn, and the working environment, differentiating between a worker exposed to solar radiation, or other heat sources, and a person working in the shade.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the international level, there is presently no example of a HHWS specifically targeting workers and capable of meeting the main characteristics listed above. At European level, an important contribution on this topic has been provided by the European project “Integrated inter-sector framework to increase the thermal resilience of European workers in the context of global warming” (HEAT-SHIELD) [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-16-02890">23</a>] that aims to develop solutions to protect the health and productivity in workplaces from excessive heat in the context of climate change. In 2017, a first prototype of an occupational HHWS for entire Europe for a timeframe of four upcoming weeks was developed within the frame of HEAT-SHIELD. In 2018, an online open access service (website platform) was officially launched to help industry and society anticipate threats by heat stress to workers’ health and productivity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this paper is to present and describe the characteristics of the website platform “HEAT-SHIELD occupational warning system” [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-02890">24</a>], currently operating for the entire Europe and representing one of the main outcomes of HEAT-SHIELD.
