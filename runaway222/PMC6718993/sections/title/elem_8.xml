  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The map of the weekly maximum probability of exceeding the daily WBGT
   <sub>sun</sub> threshold of 27 °C, available for each of the four weeks, is the non-customized heat stress forecast output and is generalized information accessible to everyone without any registration. This information is provided for all 1798 locations (represented by points) for which the forecast is available at European level and is shown by a point-related chromatic scale varying between green (the lowest probability of occurring) and dark red (the highest probability) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f002">Figure 2</a>). 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f002">Figure 2</a> shows a clear gradient with high probabilities of WBGT
   <sub>sun</sub> &gt; 27 °C in southern Europe, medium probabilities in several central European countries and very low probabilities in the North. This spatial distribution results from the typical climatological conditions of air temperature, with a south-north (latitudinal) gradient.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To access the personalized forecast heat stress alert system, including the suggested rest/hydration advices, a registration is required (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f003">Figure 3</a>) by clicking on “USE WEB VERSION”. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The registration process consists, in a first step, of providing an e-mail address (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f004" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f004">Figure 4</a>), necessary to receive an alert message automatically in the event of a moderate (or high) heat risk level in one of the first 5-day forecasts (the first 5 days of forecasting the heat stress risk of the HEAT-SHIELD platform), and a password to access the user profile at any time and change it if necessary. Subsequently, the user must provide a series of information including the most important for the purposes of calculating the customized heat stress: 
   <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Height (cm) and weight (kg);</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>The location, which must be chosen by the user after indicating the exact address for which the forecast is need and double clicking on the available shield (one of the 1798 stations) nearest and with similar altitude to the location of interest;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>The physical activity level (low, moderate, high, and very high);</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>The work environment (outdoors in the sun or shade);</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>The type of clothing or PPE worn during work.</p>
    </div>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The registration process can be done by a user identified as a worker or a stakeholder (i.e., employer, competent doctor, or other operators in charge of safeguarding workers’ health). In the latter case, the difference consists in the possibility to select a “standard” worker in terms of height and weight. </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once the registration is completed, the user can access his/her personal forecast page containing the forecasts of the heat stress risk and behavioral suggestions (in relation to hydration and work breaks recommended) to be taken in the short term, that is for the first 5 days (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f005">Figure 5</a>). 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The short-term warning forecast is updated daily. If at least one day with a moderate (or high) heat stress risk level is expected in the short term (within the first 5-day forecasts), a warning message is automatically sent to the e-mail address provided by the user during the registration process (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f006" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f006">Figure 6</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the worker’s heat stress risk is also available in the long term (by clicking on “LONG TERM RISK”) by means of a colored calendar (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f007" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f007">Figure 7</a>), from the 6th to the 46th day, updated twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday. In this case, the information is mainly aimed at providing useful information for planning work activities in the long term.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is also possible to modify the user’s profile by clicking on “EDIT PROFILE” (e.g., changing the physical characteristics, the work effort, the workplace condition, or the clothing worn) and immediately obtaining new short- and long-term heat stress risk forecasts based on the new input data. </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By accessing the “Profile” page, the user can also create multiple profiles for workers with different characteristics or engaged working in different geographical areas and therefore with different forecasts (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f008" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f008">Figure 8</a>). 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, by accessing the “Feedback” page, the user can also send feedback messages on various topics concerning the HEAT-SHIELD platform and report any errors.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. WBGT Forecast Verification</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CRPSS is used to account for the skill of the forecasts used by the HEAT-SHIELD platform (
   <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3dot3-ijerph-16-02890" href="#sec2dot3dot3-ijerph-16-02890">Section 2.3.3</a>). 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>a,c shows the spatial distribution of the CRPSS of WBGT
   <sub>shade</sub> in week 2 (days 12 to 18). There is a clear added value of the bias-corrected forecasts with respect to the raw counterparts (positive CRPSS in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>a). This added value appears mainly in regions with complex topography or at some coastal regions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>a) and remains at all lead times (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>b), illustrating the capability of EQM to downscale the coarse model output to location-specific information. The bias-corrected forecasts are more skillful than climatology up to 12–18 days at most sites (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>d), especially in Central and Northern Europe (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>c). The CRPSS of WBGT
   <sub>sun</sub> vs. climatology is very similar to that of WBGT
   <sub>shade</sub> (not shown), both in terms of spatial pattern and skill decrease with lead time. For 19–25 days ahead, forecasts can only marginally add value to climatological forecasts, and beyond 25 days, forecasts are as skillful as climatology (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>d). Note that a location-specific climatological forecast of WBGT also represents valuable information (i.e., location- and season-specific climatological risk of heat stress) and the HEAT-SHIELD platform therefore provides meaningful information throughout the full forecast range.
