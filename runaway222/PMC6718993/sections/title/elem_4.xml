  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The primary forecast outputs are daily ensembles of the maximum WBGT (both in the sun and in the shade) for each of the 1798 locations. From these WBGT ensembles, probabilities of exceeding any WBGT threshold of interest can be computed, thus allowing to address specific user needs on particular WBGT thresholds. As forecast uncertainty increases with lead time, it is appropriate to use aggregated quantities when attempting to do longer term predictions. Averaging in time or space is a basic way to focus on the more predictable larger-scale components of the atmosphere and allows for extending skill to longer lead times, albeit at coarser (spatial/temporal) resolution [
   <a rid="B47-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-16-02890">47</a>]. This can be accounted for by creating forecast products displaying the predictions aggregated over several days (aggregated over seven days, from Monday to Sunday) rather than daily information. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In particular, for each of the four upcoming weeks, a map showing the maximum daily probability of exceeding a specific heat stress condition (WBGT above a specific threshold) scheduled for the week is provided. With the aim to provide an overall picture over Europe, a single WBGT threshold was chosen to assess the heat stress situation potentially detrimental in several outdoor occupational sectors across the continent. The choice was made by using one of the WBGT thresholds described by the ISO standard [
   <a rid="B36-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-16-02890">36</a>] for which it is required to increase the work breaks with the aim of avoiding that the core body temperature exceeds 38 °C. Trying not to be too alarmist, and taking into account the experience of the HEAT-SHIELD partners and user feedback, a threshold of 27 °C for WBGT
   <sub>sun</sub> was exemplary chosen for the weekly operational forecast. For WBGT values above this threshold, the ISO 7243 [
   <a rid="B36-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-16-02890">36</a>] recommends increasing work breaks for workers engaged in jobs that require a very high or high physical effort depending on whether the workers are acclimatized or not to heat respectively. This information is, however, very general and should be used above all to motivate the user to register on the HEAT-SHIELD platform to obtain customized information based on individual characteristics.

However, after 5 days with at least moderate heat stress risk level (
   <a rid="ijerph-16-02890-t001" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02890-t001">Table 1</a>) forecasted in the short term (the first 5 days of forecasting the heat stress risk of the HEAT-SHIELD platform) during the warm season, the worker is considered “acclimatized” and the REL (higher WBGT limits than RAL) is used for the heat stress risk level calculation. Based on some stakeholder meetings organized as part of the HEAT-SHIELD project, one of the main feedback obtained was that workers are often not able to define whether they are adapted to heat. For this reason, we decided to adopt a simple empirical approach which, based on the available scientific literature, allowed us to consider when a worker can be considered acclimatized to heat. According to previous studies [

Other studies have shown that about 75% of the physiologic adjustments occur within the first 4–6 days of heat exposure [

   <a rid="B61-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61-ijerph-16-02890">61</a>] revealed that 5 days of exposure to heat sessions were enough to acclimatize to heat workers involved in hot-climate countries. The 5-day threshold with critical heat stress conditions (in our case with at least a moderate risk level) was therefore used to define when a worker can be considered acclimatized to heat within a warm season.

     <p>High: This level is associated with severe heat stress. It is strongly suggested to adjust work—use active cooling, schedule frequent breaks in shadowed or cool areas where you can hydrate. Additional drinking is required (water needs may be more than 1 L/h). If possible, after consulting your doctor, add mineral salts to your meals. Consider adjusting the timing of activities (moderate–heavy physical tasks) to the cooler period of the day.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the aim to monitor and improve the forecast quality (the ability of a model to correctly predict an event, that is the degree of agreement between the forecasts and the corresponding observations), the forecasts during summer 2018 were verified against observations. For this purpose, a thorough comparison of the daily WBGT forecasts against the corresponding observed values at the 1798 representative meteorological stations used for downscaling and bias correction procedures was carried out. The probabilistic component of ensemble forecasts requires diverse metrics to characterize their quality in terms of accuracy, reliability association, and discrimination [

   <a rid="B62-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-16-02890">62</a>]. In this work, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) was used to assess the accuracy of the forecasts [
   <a rid="B63-ijerph-16-02890" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-ijerph-16-02890">63</a>]. This metric is widely used in forecast verification and represents the ensemble version of the mean absolute error. It is sensitive to the bias in the ensemble mean and to the over- or under-dispersion of the ensemble (i.e., it also penalizes ensembles with large spread even when having a good ensemble mean prediction). The score can be expressed as a skill score (SS) relative to a reference forecast (CRPSS). A positive CRPSS indicates a better performance of the forecast compared to the reference (perfect score of 1), CRPSS = 0 means that the forecast is as good as the reference and negative scores indicate lower skill than the reference. In this work, the CRPSS of the bias-corrected forecasts is obtained considering two possible reference datasets: (1) Raw forecasts (non-bias-corrected) and (2) observations from the past 20 years (which mimic a 20-member ensemble, hereafter climatological forecasts). The former shows potential added value of the bias-corrected forecasts with respect to the uncorrected forecasts, whereas the latter represents the skill of the forecasts with respect to a naive forecast based on climatological observations. Daily CRPS values were averaged into weekly values (week 1 spans from day 5 to day 11, week 2 from day 12 to day 18, week 3 from day 19 to day 25, week 4 from day 26 to day 32). Final CRPSSs were obtained from the weekly CRPS, for each European location. The verification was conducted considering forecasts which span from April to September 2018, i.e., 40 forecasts.
