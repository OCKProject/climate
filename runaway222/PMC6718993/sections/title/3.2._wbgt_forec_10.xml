  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>a,c shows the spatial distribution of the CRPSS of WBGT
  <sub>shade</sub> in week 2 (days 12 to 18). There is a clear added value of the bias-corrected forecasts with respect to the raw counterparts (positive CRPSS in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>a). This added value appears mainly in regions with complex topography or at some coastal regions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>a) and remains at all lead times (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>b), illustrating the capability of EQM to downscale the coarse model output to location-specific information. The bias-corrected forecasts are more skillful than climatology up to 12–18 days at most sites (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>d), especially in Central and Northern Europe (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>c). The CRPSS of WBGT
  <sub>sun</sub> vs. climatology is very similar to that of WBGT
  <sub>shade</sub> (not shown), both in terms of spatial pattern and skill decrease with lead time. For 19–25 days ahead, forecasts can only marginally add value to climatological forecasts, and beyond 25 days, forecasts are as skillful as climatology (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02890-f009" href="#ijerph-16-02890-f009">Figure 9</a>d). Note that a location-specific climatological forecast of WBGT also represents valuable information (i.e., location- and season-specific climatological risk of heat stress) and the HEAT-SHIELD platform therefore provides meaningful information throughout the full forecast range.
