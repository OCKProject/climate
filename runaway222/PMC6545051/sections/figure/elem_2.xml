  <p>Surface conditions derived from infrared remote sensing for a small region in central France, for 1 August 2000 (left panels) and 10 August 2003 (right panels). The top panels show the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), with the red colours indicative of vegetation. The lower panels show the radiometric temperature, with the colour scale at the bottom. The distance scale is shown in the lower right panel, and the values given in the right panels indicate the average differences in those parts of the scene between the left and right panels.
