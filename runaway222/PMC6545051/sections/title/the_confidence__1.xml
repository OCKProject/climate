 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The confidence straightjacket</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most authoritative statements on physical aspects of climate change come from Working Group I (WGI) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In the Summary for Policymakers of the last (Fifth) IPCC WGI Assessment Report [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C2">2</a>], atmospheric circulation is scarcely mentioned, and all the statements of confidence are based on thermodynamics. This remarkable fact evidences better than anything else the lack of scientific consensus on dynamical aspects of climate change. Moreover, the statements of confidence are crafted to be reliable, generally by emphasizing global rather than regional aspects of change. A good example is the headline statement on the water cycle: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>Changes in the global water cycle in response to the warming over the 21st century will not be uniform. The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions. [
    <a rid="RSPA20190013C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C2">2</a>, p. 20]
   </p>
  </div> This statement is based on the sound physical principle that, all else being equal, a moister atmosphere will exhibit an accelerated hydrological cycle [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C10">10</a>]. The statement achieves its reliability in the tropics by including oceanic regions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20190013F1" href="#RSPA20190013F1">figure 1</a>); indeed, a key observation supporting the statement is the increased salinity in the subtropical upper oceans (due to increased evaporation). However, it is precipitation over land that matters for climate impacts, and there have been many studies showing that the ‘wet get wetter, dry get drier’ paradigm does not hold over land regions [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C12">12</a>–
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C14">14</a>], as is reflected in the general lack of stippling over these regions (apart from the high northern latitudes) in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20190013F1" href="#RSPA20190013F1">figure 1</a>. The statement is perfectly reliable as an explanation of how the global climate system works, but it does not provide useful information at the regional scale, as the final caveat makes clear. In this way, reliability is achieved at the price of informativeness.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To find a high-level statement on dynamical aspects of climate change in the IPCC WGI Fifth Assessment Report, one must look one level down, in the Technical Summary [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C2">2</a>]. The statements are uniformly characterized by low levels of confidence and a lack of informativeness at the regional scale. An illustrative example is the statement on changes in Northern Hemisphere (NH) storm tracks, which are an important determinant of mid-latitude weather: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>Substantial uncertainty and thus low confidence remains in projecting changes in NH storm tracks, especially for the North Atlantic basin. [
    <a rid="RSPA20190013C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C2">2</a>, p. 90]
   </p>
  </div> Furthermore, IPCC WGI uses a likelihood scale in which the term ‘unlikely’ is used to describe likelihoods of up to 33%. This terminology seems rather perverse from a lay perspective; in most areas of life, one would pay attention to likelihoods that high, especially if the consequences were serious—as they are with climate change. (Would you board an aeroplane if you were told that it had a 33% chance of crashing?) Yet in the WGI report, the term ‘unlikely’ is generally used to dismiss rather than to highlight a possibility. Consider this example from the Technical Summary, again with reference to the North Atlantic storm track: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>…it is unlikely that the response of the North Atlantic storm track is a simple poleward shift [
    <a rid="RSPA20190013C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C2">2</a>, p. 108]
   </p>
  </div> The context here is that, despite the lack of an agreed upon theoretical explanation, the concept of a poleward storm track shift under climate change has become a general expectation [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C5">5</a>]. However, projected changes in the North Atlantic storm track do not conform to that expectation [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C15">15</a>]. An equivalent version of the statement would be ‘…it is likely that the response of the North Atlantic storm track [to climate change] is not a simple poleward shift’. Because, in the present state of knowledge, a consensus statement could not be crafted on what was likely to happen, the authors instead chose to emphasize what was not likely to happen. Yet, there are several possibilities for what might happen, each with its own implications for climate risk, which could have been articulated (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C16">16</a>]). However, the simultaneous consideration of contradictory futures is not naturally expressed through statements of confidence. Thus, reliability is again achieved at the price of informativeness.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These examples illustrate the fact that by employing a confidence framework, which seeks to attribute what has happened and to predict what will happen (for a given climate forcing scenario), climate science winds up in something of a straightjacket when it comes to aspects of regional climate change that are closely related to large-scale atmospheric circulation, such as drought and storminess.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is notable in this respect that IPCC Working Group II, which deals with impacts and adaptation, defines climate change as any observed change, not necessarily one that has been attributed to anthropogenic forcing [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C17">17</a>]. This is done to avoid the confidence straightjacket, but it creates a knowledge gap between the WGI and WGII science domains [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C18">18</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is always a trade-off to be made between reliability and informativeness [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C19">19</a>]. Yet, a focus on reliability, guarding preferentially against type 1 errors (false positives, i.e. false alarms), increases the likelihood of type 2 errors (false negatives, i.e. missed warnings). It follows that much as though climate science might strive to be value free, it cannot be: the way in which climate information is constructed has ethical implications [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C20">20</a>]. Lloyd &amp; Oreskes [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C20">20</a>] raise the important question of why, in climate science, it has become normative that scientific rigour is associated with a focus on reliability. They point out that the decision on whether to preferentially guard against type 1 or type 2 errors is not a scientific one, but one of values. For example, in deciding whether to bring a new drug to market, one assesses both the drug's efficacy (guarding against type 1 errors) and whether it has any unwanted side effects (guarding against type 2 errors). Similarly, in deciding whether to issue an evacuation order for a city in the face of a forecasted storm, a balance of concern between type 1 and type 2 errors will be considered. Thus, there is nothing unscientific about seeking to guard against type 2 errors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It would seem entirely appropriate to preferentially guard against type 1 errors when making high-level definitive statements concerning global climate change such as ‘Warming of the climate system is unequivocal’ [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C2">2</a>, p. 4]. However, the framework is not so evidently appropriate when it comes to regional aspects of change (see also [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C21">21</a>]). This situation seems to be an example of Kuhn's [
  <a rid="RSPA20190013C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPA20190013C22">22</a>, p. 37] important observation that ‘a paradigm can … insulate the [scientific] community from those socially important problems that … cannot be stated in terms of the conceptual and instrumental tools the paradigm supplies'. Thus, it is imperative to find alternative paradigms.
