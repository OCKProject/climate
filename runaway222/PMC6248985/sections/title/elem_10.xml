 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water distribution infrastructure is a vital part of urban water supply systems, comprising of expensive and often complex physical assets. When thought of as a complex system, it includes physical pipeline networks delivering water to users, the municipality or private company as an institution that manages the infrastructure and the organizations and individuals who consume the water [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref037">37</a>]. In water distribution networks, aging pipelines accelerate the effects produced on the infrastructure by external stressors, leading to a faster decay in the performance of this complex system as a whole. The three important drivers of dynamic interactions between agents of a water distribution are shown in

They include (i) physical degradation of the infrastructure network and its components, which is a function of several factors such as aging, erosion and environmental conditions (ii) renewal decision-making processes and adaptive behavior of institutional actors [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref038">38</a>] (iii) external stressors such as population change and fluctuations in funding, which either exacerbate physical degradation of the system or affect the response behavior/decision-making processes of its institutional actors.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Physical network degradation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The physical condition of an infrastructure asset denotes its structural capacity and ability to withstand different types of stressors. On the other hand, the functionality of infrastructure indicates its ability to serve its intended function at the desired level of service. The approach to modeling the mechanisms of physical degradation varies for different infrastructure (e.g., roadways vs. water systems) [
   <a rid="pone.0207674.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref039">39</a>]. However, the modeling of infrastructure degradation essentially involves identifying indicators of physical and functional conditions of an asset and then integrating them into a unified performance measure [
   <a rid="pone.0207674.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref040">40</a>]. A unified performance measure quantifies the state of an infrastructure asset at any given time based on variables such as design characteristics of the asset, asset’s age, ambient climate, and service load of the asset in that period [
   <a rid="pone.0207674.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref040">40</a>]. Typical physical attributes of a water distribution network are pipeline age, materials used, length of pipes, fluid pressure and flow rate. The deterioration of physical assets in a network decreases the reliability of the infrastructure and affects the system as a whole in terms of maintenance and operation costs, rehabilitation needs and exposure of actors in the system to risks. Therefore, a complex system model of water distribution infrastructure needs to account for degradation and the effect that it has on service life, condition states, future maintenance and rehabilitation expenses. The physical degradation process of pipework is not clearly understood, with published literature citing several factors such as age, material and network pressure as driving mechanisms, meaning, different functions may be implemented to capture the process [
   <a rid="pone.0207674.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref041">41</a>]. However, several deterioration model studies have correlated age with condition thereby establishing that the process is age-dependent [
   <a rid="pone.0207674.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref042">42</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a system perspective, age-based deterioration can be used as a criterion to sort various sections (lengths) of piping in the network into discrete age groups based on pre-defined age ranges. As a consequence, aging sections would move from one age group to the next during the process of deterioration. Thus, modeling degradation as a dynamic process would capture long-term transformation effects in the network which would lend greater accuracy to the assessment of the system’s resilience.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Renewal decision-making processes</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to physical network degradation, human actors (users and administrative agencies) play an important role in the long-term dynamics of water distribution infrastructure. For instance, expectation of and demands placed by users determine the actual quantity of water supplied by the network, while municipalities and private institutions (administrative agencies) which manage the decision-making processes related to renewal and restoration, affect the ability of the network to maintain the required supply. Consider the following scenario which illustrates the interplay of human behavior in the network. The demand placed on the network fluctuates with changes to the user population. These fluctuations drive the price of water, which in turn affects the revenue generated by administrative agencies. Since revenue drives renewal decision processes as well as regular maintenance work, a direct consequence of this interplay is the degradation rate of physical assets in the water distribution network.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In response to the various factors which affect the decision-making process, administrative agencies often identify strategy targets to pursue when maintaining large infrastructure networks. A strategy target may be defined as that indicator of network performance (e.g. average condition and break frequency) which is deemed acceptable by the administrative agency. Thus, any strategy target is a combination of various factors in the behavior spectrum of its human actors. The proposed model captures various behavioral factors affecting the decision-making process such as capital and operational expenses, revenue, water price and capital improvement funds, which are uniquely combined to create three heuristic renewal strategy targets for the network: (i) controlling the average break frequency (ii) controlling average condition of network and (iii) regular renewal based on age of pipes. When the agency adopts a break-control strategy, the motive is to keep the frequency of breaks below a certain target threshold. The annual pipe renewal process would be maintained until the desired average annual break frequency over a five-year horizon is reached. If the target is average condition control, the agency strives to maintain the condition of the network below the required threshold through the renewal process. In either of these strategies, renewal costs exceeding the base allotment are met through the activation of a surplus called the capital improvement fund. This fund is allocated based on a 5-year budget from which 20% can be used annually towards the renewal process if expected costs are exceeded. In the case of an age-based (regular) renewal strategy, the agency performs maintenance work only on sections of the pipeline which are older than 100 years (100 years is the average service life of water pipes as reported by [
   <a rid="pone.0207674.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref043">43</a>]). The capital improvement fund is unavailable when an age-based strategy target is adopted. Therefore, when faced with a deficit, the agency performs renewal based on the amount of available revenue.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is apparent that renewal decision-making processes of the utility agency and other adaptive actions affect the dynamic variables of the infrastructure, resulting in different performance regimes. Hence, a long-term resilience assessment of the water distribution infrastructure system would be incomplete in their absence.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">External stressors</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impact of stressors on civil infrastructure systems has been highlighted in the previous sections. The impact of chronic stressors in particular, has greater bearing when the long-term dynamics of a water distribution infrastructure are being investigated. The proposed model framework considers the impact of population change and funding fluctuations as external stressors. Accordingly, different levels of capital improvement fund and various rates of population change are accounted for, to investigate its influence on the dynamics of the infrastructure. Together, water demand fluctuations arising from population change, and availability of funds for renewal, produce critical points which lead to shifts in performance regimes of the water distribution network.</p>
