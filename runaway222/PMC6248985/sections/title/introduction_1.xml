 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Globalization and large-scale urban development in the latter half of the 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century have precipitated massive demographic shifts in regions across the world, a trend which is expected to continue in the near future. In a bid to cater to these burgeoning developments, the demand for civil infrastructure has grown disproportionately to the supply that is currently made available by civic bodies. For instance, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that an additional 3.6 trillion dollars are required, merely to keep up with the increasing rate of demand for infrastructure [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important factor affecting the demand-supply economics of civil infrastructure is the longevity and utility of said infrastructure over a given period of time. External factors such as inclement weather directly affect the performance of physical assets, a statement which is of greater importance today than ever before owing to climate change. In fact, climate change is expected to affect the performance of physical assets, both directly and indirectly [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref002">2</a>] as evidenced by the following example. Climate change-induced increase in the number of freeze-thaw cycles directly affects the physical condition of pavements. In addition to this, climate change stimulates changes in the behavior of both users and administrative agencies responsible for the upkeep of pavements, which in turn also affects their physical condition [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref003">3</a>]. More generally, civil infrastructure systems such as those catering to transport, power grids, water supply and sewage networks are exposed to various stressors which are broadly classified into two major groups: acute and chronic stressors. Acute stressors are extreme events such as natural and man-made disasters, whereas chronic stressors are gradual, low impact-high probability phenomena which affect infrastructure over a period of time, such as climate change, population growth and decline, and funding limitations, to name a few. Coupled with the aforementioned increase in demand and usage, the impact of these stressors poses a major challenge to scientists and policy-makers concerned with the sustainability of civil infrastructure.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ability of civil infrastructure to cope with the impact of these stressors is characterized as resilience, which is an emerging topic in the field of infrastructure sustainability. Resilience, in this context, is defined as the capacity of civil infrastructure to experience the impact induced by various types of stressors, while retaining the function to provide services required for the socio-economic development and safety of humans [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref004">4</a>]. In essence, it serves to inform scientists and policy-makers about ways to cope with the impact of stressors on infrastructure.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering the pivotal role played by civil infrastructure in sustainable socio-economic development as well as in protecting communities, a better understanding of the long-term transformation of infrastructure under external stressors is a critical step towards enhancing the sustainability and resilience of the communities themselves. Over the last decade, literature pertaining to infrastructure resilience [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref005">5</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref008">8</a>] has centered on examining the physical attributes and topological characteristics that affect the behavior of infrastructure systems under disruption, through the use of an engineering-based approach. The focus of engineering-based approaches is to assess resilience in the presence of acute stressors, while chronic stressors which change the long-term dynamics of infrastructure over a long-time horizon are not fully considered. Engineering resilience approaches primarily focus on event-based analysis of resilience considering system dynamics related to loss of function and short-term recovery of infrastructure for a particular disruptive event. Dynamic behavior of infrastructure is governed by three major factors including (i) physical assets; (ii) human actors; and (iii) chronic and acute stressors, which affect its long-term transformation. The consequence of defining resilience as the final equilibrium state which is a product of the infrastructure’s robustness and resistance to acute stressors, is that the engineering-based approach ignores adaptive behavior seen in its human actors (users, administrative agencies and policy-makers), which is dynamic in nature. However, planning for long-term adaptation to evolving external stressors (e.g., climate change) must contend with potential changes in human decision-maker values and attitudes about the effects of external stressors on hazards and tradeoffs among adaptation options [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref009">9</a>]. However, despite the growing literature in the areas of resilience, the characteristics of long-term resilience in civil infrastructure systems are not specified and evaluated. In particular, in the context of chronic stressors (e.g., population change), understanding of long-term resilience characteristics holds the key for robust adaptation planning. For example, performance regime shift is one of the important characteristics of long-term resilience [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref010">10</a>]. Evaluation of performance regime shifts in infrastructure systems is very important for long-term adaptation planning and investment decision-making; due to the significant physical and institutional inertia in infrastructure systems, undesirable performance regime shifts are very difficult to reverse [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref011">11</a>]. A critical knowledge gap is examining what attributes and relationships in stressor-human-infrastructure nexus would yield long-term resilience that will mitigate the potential impacts of evolving external stressors under different scenarios [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref012">12</a>]. Recent developments in the field of complex systems science have addressed some of these concerns [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref013">13</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Civil infrastructure systems can be considered as complex systems [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref005">5</a>] composed of facilities and assets associated with the physical infrastructure, the services they provide to a community, people using these services and the organizations that manage the infrastructure [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref015">15</a>]. The resilience of such systems is a function of their internal and external dynamics [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref013">13</a>], and their performance depends on the interplay between human actors and the physical assets. Thus, developing a holistic framework for assessing resilience of civil infrastructure requires a better understanding of human actors (users and administrative agencies) and their capacity for adaptive decision-making. Going one step further, under the complex systems approach, resilience of civil infrastructure itself needs to be redefined to account for its dynamic nature. Consequently, resilience may be defined as the ability of a complex system to adapt and transform internal feedback processes, to cope with chronic or “surprise” shocks, recover from internal/external disturbances [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref004">4</a>]. That is, the system does not attempt to maintain status quo (equilibrium) through resistance and robustness, rather, the system evolves and improves with non-stationary conditions, through flexibility, diversity and adaptability, which makes resilience as an emergent property of complex systems [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref004">4</a>]. An important feature of resilience is that it enables recovery and robustness to unknown and uncertain events [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref016">16</a>]. The fact that in complex systems, threats are often impossible to foresee and quantify was one of the main motivations to complement risk-based approaches with resilience analysis [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref016">16</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref017">17</a>]. Although the proposed approach in this study is not particular threat-diagnostic, it can be used in the presence of “threats”. Essentially, the impact of a threat (i.e., acute stressor) on a system over time would depend on the steady state performance of the system, which is governed by the internal dynamics and chronic stressors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A complex systems approach holds the key to addressing knowledge gaps in the development of a holistic framework that is capable of conceptualizing and assessing the long-term resilience of civil infrastructure. Under this approach, resilience of civil infrastructure is characterized using three mechanisms: (i) external stressors; (ii) internal dynamics; and (iii) regime shifts. [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref013">13</a>] theorized that the resilience of complex systems can be described based on their topology and dynamics. However, the understanding of dynamics that affect infrastructure resilience is rather limited. To address this inadequacy, this paper proposes a framework to capture important phenomena that affect the dynamics, model the long-term performance regimes of infrastructure using a complex systems approach, and analyze the resilience of civil infrastructure in a long-term horizon based on the performance regime shifts and tipping points of external stressors. The components and application of the proposed framework are presented in the context of urban water distribution infrastructure. To this end, a Multi-Agent Simulation (MAS) model was developed to integrate the institutional agencies’ renewal decision-making processes with physical components in order to simulate the transformations, capture the dynamics, and model the performance regimes of water distribution infrastructure system under the impact of external stressors such as population change and funding fluctuations. Using the developed simulation model, various experiments were designed to measure the long-term resilience based on the visual detection of regime shifts and identification of the threshold values (i.e., tipping points) associated with infrastructure performance regimes. That is to say, the long-term resilience of the water distribution infrastructure was evaluated in the presence of stressors using the proposed framework. Accordingly, the effectiveness of different renewal strategies was assessed in light of improving the resiliency of the infrastructure for various scenarios.
