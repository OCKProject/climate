 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study utilized a complex system-theoretic approach for the civil infrastructure long-term resilience investment. The literature related to ecological sciences has made significant advancements in adopting a complex systems perspective for understanding the long-term resilience in ecological systems. According to [

  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref020">20</a>], resilience in complex ecological systems can be defined based on their ability to cope with the changes in the surrounding environment. In fact, complex systems frequently do not return to their prior state of performance following the impact of stressors. Instead a new equilibrium state is attained, as seen in other fields such as ecology and economics which inspired developments in the engineering resilience field [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref018">18</a>]. In the proposed study, grounded theories, measures, and methods related to resilience in complex systems [

The resilience of civil infrastructure system is contingent upon its transformation and adaptation to evolving conditions in the social and environmental sphere [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref021">21</a>]. Complex systems approach addresses this need by considering the ability of the system to reach a stable state after a certain threshold (critical or tipping point) has been reached.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using a complex systems approach, the long-term resilience landscape of civil infrastructure systems can be investigated based on stable states and regimes that determine the performance behavior of the system [
   <a rid="pone.0207674.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref010">10</a>]. Changes in internal dynamics and external disturbances can cause shifts from the current stable state to a new stable state (better or worse) [
   <a rid="pone.0207674.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref010">10</a>]. Accordingly, long-term resilience is defined as the ability of an infrastructure system to maintain its performance regime or transform to a better regime in response to internal and external disturbances. The performance regime of infrastructure system is the state related to the system’s long-term performance in terms of the environmental, social, economic, functionality, and vulnerability parameters, which is maintained by internal dynamics pertaining to stressors-human-infrastructure interactions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207674.g001" href="#pone.0207674.g001">Fig 1</a>). The regime shifts occur when a change in the stressor-human-infrastructure interaction triggers a different behavior in the performance of infrastructure system [

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">External stressors</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">External stressors can be chronic or acute in nature. Chronic stressors are gradual, low impact-high probability events that are caused by changes in the internal feedback processes and the external environment. Acute stressors are abrupt, high impact-low probability events that are mainly caused by extreme events. Both chronic (e.g. accelerated erosion due to climate change) and acute stressors (e.g. flooding) affect the dynamics of the infrastructure and as a consequence, its resilience. For instance, climate change (chronic stressor) is a major driver of changes in the socio-environmental conditions surrounding civil infrastructure [
    <a rid="pone.0207674.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref025">25</a>,
    <a rid="pone.0207674.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref026">26</a>]. Climate change impacts the sustainability and resilience of civil infrastructure in various ways such as (i) changes in temperature and precipitation which affect the erosion of the networks; (ii) population displacement which affects the demand on the networks; (iii) changes in the priorities of agencies which affects allocation of resources; and (iv) increased frequency and magnitude of extreme events (e.g. floods), leading to greater exposure of the networks to risks [
    <a rid="pone.0207674.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref027">27</a>,
    <a rid="pone.0207674.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref028">28</a>]. Hence, changes in decision and physical infrastructure attributes and relationship would change the sensitivity of civil infrastructure system to external stressors. The Threshold values of these attributes at which the sensitivity of infrastructure system to stressors varies can be examined as tipping points. Tipping points occur in complex systems when “a small smooth change made to the parameter values of a system causes a sudden qualitative or topological change in its behavior”. The parameter value at which state transition occurs is referred to as the tipping point or threshold point. Understanding tipping points is essential in describing long-term resilience in complex systems. In the context of civil infrastructure system resilience, regime shifts describe the extent to which the infrastructure system performance regime is sensitive to changes in external stressors magnitudes (e.g., population growth rate). On the other hand, tipping points, explain the critical values related to decision and physical infrastructure attributes (e.g., funding level and network age) that drastically increase or decrease the infrastructure system sensitivity to a certain scenario and stressor magnitude.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Internal dynamics</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Civil infrastructure as a complex system is composed of various components which are connected by a complex set of direct and indirect interactions and controlled by not one micro-behavior, but by a host of drivers. The observable collective behavior (overall performance) of civil infrastructure emerges from the underlying internal interactions and feedback among the system’s components (internal dynamics), as well as through the impact of external stressors. The internal dynamics of civil infrastructure are determined based on the interaction between human actors (i.e. agencies and users) and physical networks. The dynamics of each component (i.e. human actors and physical networks) are determined by two factors: (i) interaction between the components, which is governed by dynamic rules that impose the activity or decision on the human actors and distribute the condition (performance) to the physical networks; and (ii) global fluctuations in the overall performance of the infrastructure system [
    <a rid="pone.0207674.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref029">29</a>]. 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207674.g002" href="#pone.0207674.g002">Fig 2</a> depicts the internal dynamics of civil infrastructure through the lens of a complex systems approach. This figure illustrates the couplings between human activities and engineered infrastructure. On the human actor side, two distinct decision-making processes of institutional actors (i.e., infrastructure agencies) can affect the long-term transformation of physical infrastructure. First, actor’s decisions on maintenance, rehabilitation, or reconstruction of assets (referred to as preservation decisions) [
    <a rid="pone.0207674.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref022">22</a>] influence transformation of physical infrastructure by affecting the degradation rates and renewal of assets. Second, the adaptation decisions of actors affect the vulnerability of assets to external stressors. As demonstrated in 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207674.g002" href="#pone.0207674.g002">Fig 2</a>, the decision-making processes of institutional actors affect the expansion, maintenance, and rehabilitation of physical infrastructure. In making their operational and strategic decisions, agencies adopt certain heuristics related to performance (functionality) requirements. These decision-making heuristics are affected by the demand and expectations of the users (consumer actors) as well as by the risks posed by external stressors (acute and chronic stressors). In addition to the decision-making processes of agencies, the functionality of infrastructure networks is affected by attributes (e.g. design, material and age) of physical assets in the network, behavior of its users (e.g. demand) and physical deterioration induced by aging of assets. These internal interactions between human actors and the physical infrastructure, both of which in turn are influenced by external stressors, lead to a certain performance regime for the infrastructure system as a whole. System and policy changes which affect interactions between human actors and physical networks can lead to shifts in the performance regime of the infrastructure. Hence, evaluation of such changes in the performance regime of infrastructure is a key aspect of resilience assessment from a complex systems perspective.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Performance regime shifts</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The performance regime of infrastructure is defined as the steady state related to the system’s performance, which is maintained by internal dynamics associated with the interactions between human actors and physical infrastructure affected by different stressors. A regime is a characteristic behavior of a system which is maintained by mutually reinforced processes or internal dynamics [
    <a rid="pone.0207674.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref023">23</a>]. A change of regime (regime shift) occurs when a change in an internal process (dynamics) or external disturbance triggers a completely different system performance behavior [
    <a rid="pone.0207674.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref019">19</a>]. Regime shifts are large, abrupt, persistent changes in the performance behavior of a system [
    <a rid="pone.0207674.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref030">30</a>]. The regime shifts occur at tipping points (critical points), where an external stressor interrupts the steady state of the system performance. Evaluation of performance regime shifts is critical for long-term decision-making. Due to significant physical and institutional inertia that is prevalent in civil infrastructure, undesirable performance regime shifts are very difficult to reverse. Identification and adoption of the critical points would facilitate early detection of regime shifts, prior to their occurrence. The occurrence of shifts in the performance regime of an infrastructure system can be detected using different methods such as (i) plotting mean and standard deviation values of the system performance parameters against socio-environmental parameters (e.g. population change, temperature change, and level of funding); and (ii) using time-series data related to different system performance measures in non-parametric methods. To this end, a visual investigation of system performance parameter values under different scenarios can be conducted to identify the non-linear trends and long-term regime shifts.
