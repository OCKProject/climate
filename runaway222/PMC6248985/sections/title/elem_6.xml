 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Civil infrastructure as a complex system is composed of various components which are connected by a complex set of direct and indirect interactions and controlled by not one micro-behavior, but by a host of drivers. The observable collective behavior (overall performance) of civil infrastructure emerges from the underlying internal interactions and feedback among the system’s components (internal dynamics), as well as through the impact of external stressors. The internal dynamics of civil infrastructure are determined based on the interaction between human actors (i.e. agencies and users) and physical networks. The dynamics of each component (i.e. human actors and physical networks) are determined by two factors: (i) interaction between the components, which is governed by dynamic rules that impose the activity or decision on the human actors and distribute the condition (performance) to the physical networks; and (ii) global fluctuations in the overall performance of the infrastructure system [

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207674.g002" href="#pone.0207674.g002">Fig 2</a> depicts the internal dynamics of civil infrastructure through the lens of a complex systems approach. This figure illustrates the couplings between human activities and engineered infrastructure. On the human actor side, two distinct decision-making processes of institutional actors (i.e., infrastructure agencies) can affect the long-term transformation of physical infrastructure. First, actor’s decisions on maintenance, rehabilitation, or reconstruction of assets (referred to as preservation decisions) [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref022">22</a>] influence transformation of physical infrastructure by affecting the degradation rates and renewal of assets. Second, the adaptation decisions of actors affect the vulnerability of assets to external stressors. As demonstrated in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207674.g002" href="#pone.0207674.g002">Fig 2</a>, the decision-making processes of institutional actors affect the expansion, maintenance, and rehabilitation of physical infrastructure. In making their operational and strategic decisions, agencies adopt certain heuristics related to performance (functionality) requirements. These decision-making heuristics are affected by the demand and expectations of the users (consumer actors) as well as by the risks posed by external stressors (acute and chronic stressors). In addition to the decision-making processes of agencies, the functionality of infrastructure networks is affected by attributes (e.g. design, material and age) of physical assets in the network, behavior of its users (e.g. demand) and physical deterioration induced by aging of assets. These internal interactions between human actors and the physical infrastructure, both of which in turn are influenced by external stressors, lead to a certain performance regime for the infrastructure system as a whole. System and policy changes which affect interactions between human actors and physical networks can lead to shifts in the performance regime of the infrastructure. Hence, evaluation of such changes in the performance regime of infrastructure is a key aspect of resilience assessment from a complex systems perspective.
