 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Verification and validation techniques focus on verifying the data, rules, logic and computational algorithms [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref049">49</a>]. They could be as simple as tracking variables at intermediate levels in simulation and running the simulation with extreme values of constructs [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref050">50</a>]. Typically, attempts are made to replicate the outcomes seen in theory, failing which, systematic checks are carried out to identify errors in the code. In this study, a gradual, systemic, and iterative procedure was employed to conduct a thorough verification of the computational model. In addition, the validation of the model was ensured through the use of grounded theories, logic and equations utilized by previous studies in modeling the performance of water distribution networks such as [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Various internal and external validation techniques (e.g., predictive and face validation) were employed to verify the data, logic, and computational algorithms related to the simulation model. First, the initial conditions and the ranges of the parameters were compared to the existing empirical data to ensure the reliability of the parameters in the model [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref052">52</a>]. For example, the parameters related to the physical network, such as pipes’ age, length, and material, were compared to the actual water distribution data related to another network (in Ontario, Canada). Second, the behaviors of model entities (e.g., network average condition) were followed so as to identify unusual model behaviors. Whenever an unusual behavior was observed, the model logic was checked to ensure that the behavior was not due to unreasonable assumptions or imperfect logic. Third, extreme value analyses were performed, where the model was run at different extreme conditions (for each component) to observe its response and verify its functionality under these scenarios. Fourth, several random replications (more than one thousand runs) of the model were compared to check for the consistency of the results [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref053">53</a>]. Fifth, predictive validation of the model was conducted. In predictive validation, the model is used to predict the system’s behavior, and then the model’s forecast is compared with actual system’s behavior obtained, for example, from data related to behaviors of an operational system [
  <a rid="pone.0207674.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207674.ref054">54</a>]. To conduct the predictive validation, the outputs related to each model specification were compared to the existing data related to the water distribution networks in Fort Collins, CO. For example, the simulated annual leakage and breakage rates of the network were compared to the real values based on historical data. Accordingly, most of the observed errors pertained to incorrect implementation of the algorithm (the algorithm itself proved robust) in the code and were rectified easily. Finally, a face validation was pursued by research team through examining the simulated behaviors of the model (output results) to ensure that they are reasonable for a real case. Following this, the quality of the model components was ensured for completeness, coherence, consistency and correctness (4Cs) [
