         <div>The morphology of Roi-Namur Island on Kwajalein Atoll and the impact of the March
            2014 large wave event on the island’s oceanography and hydrogeology.

            <span>A</span>) Photograph of the seaward side of Roi-Namur showing the wide coral reef flat and
            low relief of the island during typical low-energy conditions. (

            flooding inland (to the left) during the March 2014 large wave event. (

            3 March large wave event, wave-driven flooding overwashed the seaward portion of the
            island, raising groundwater levels and salinizing portions of the island’s freshwater
            lens.
