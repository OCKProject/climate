   <span class="bold">A</span>) Photograph of the seaward side of Roi-Namur showing the wide coral reef flat and low relief of the island during typical low-energy conditions. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) Photograph of the seaward side of Roi-Namur showing the wave-driven runup and seawater flooding inland (to the left) during the March 2014 large wave event. (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) Wave heights and wave periods offshore the island during the March 2014 large wave event. (
   <span class="bold">D</span>) Mean seawater levels across the atoll. (
   <span class="bold">E</span>) Instantaneous wave-driven water levels and modeled runup at the seaward shoreline. (
   <span class="bold">F</span>) Groundwater levels at a subset of the monitoring wells. At the peak of the 2 to 3 March large wave event, wave-driven flooding overwashed the seaward portion of the island, raising groundwater levels and salinizing portions of the island’s freshwater lens.
