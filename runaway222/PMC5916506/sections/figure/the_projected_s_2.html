         <div>The projected spatial extent of inundation due to SLR and annual flooding due to the
            combined effects of waves and SLR on Roi through time for different SLR and climatic
            scenarios.

            annual large wave events increase into the future because of SLR and with increasing
            RCP scenario; the island is completely overwashed annually by wave-driven flooding
            later in the 21st century for RCP8.5 scenarios.
