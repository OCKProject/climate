 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We developed framework for simulating the salinization and recovery processes that affect freshwater supply on low-elevation atoll islands. A 3D finite-element model of variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport in the island aquifer was created using the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) SUTRA groundwater model (

  </a>). The model domain includes Roi and some distance offshore to a depth of about 105 m below sea level. The TB-DEM was used as the SUTRA modelâ€™s surface. For this model, the SUTRA code was modified to account for water table storage by including the aquifer-specific yield in the governing equations. The SUTRA model was calibrated and validated using observations from a December 2008 wave-driven overwash and flooding event on Roi-Namur.
