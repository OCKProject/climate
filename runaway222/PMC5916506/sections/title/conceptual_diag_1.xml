 <div class="title">Conceptual diagram of the influence of SLR on wave heights, wave-driven runup, and flooding and the resulting impact on atoll island groundwater.</div>
 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) Current sea level. (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) Future elevated sea level. SLR will allow for greater wave heights, 
  <span class="italic">H</span>, and wave-driven runup, 
  <span class="italic">R</span>, than at present, resulting in frequent overwash that will contaminate the atoll islandâ€™s freshwater lens. High vertical exaggeration in schematic.
