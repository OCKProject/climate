 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Past efforts that relied solely on passive SLR inundation modeling to predict when atolls will become uninhabitable suggest that many atoll islands may remain suitable for human habitation until 2100 or 2150 (

   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>). The results presented here, however, demonstrate that when the nonlinear interaction between SLR and wave-driven overwash and the subsequent island flooding are taken into account, the timeline for sustainable human habitation on these low-lying atoll islands shortens considerably. Not only will such flooding affect terrestrial infrastructure and habitats, but also, more importantly, it will make the limited freshwater resources nonpotable and, therefore, directly threaten the sustainability of human populations. On the basis of the limited topographic (

  </a>) data available for atoll islands, Roi-Namur is characteristic of (if not of higher elevation than) most of the thousands of atoll islands in the world’s oceans. Assuming that this is the case, then the tipping point, at which point potable groundwater on most of the atoll islands will be unavailable, is projected to be reached by no later than the 2030s for the RCP8.5+icesheet collapse climate scenario, by the 2040s for the RCP8.5 scenario, and 2060s for the RCP4.5 scenario. Island inhabitants will therefore be unable to rely on groundwater, in many cases the sole source of fresh water, as a source of potable water in the next few decades, and thus, the islands will be uninhabitable by the middle of the 21st century—not by the end of the 21st century or the middle of the 22nd century as previously suggested (

   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For those rare atoll islands where groundwater is not a limiting resource due to rainfall capture, desalinization facilities, transport from elsewhere, etc., the tipping point at which most of those atoll islands would be flooded annually is projected to be reached in the 2060s for the RCP8.5+icesheet collapse climate scenario, the 2070s time frame for the RCP8.5 scenario, and sometime after the 2110s for the RCP4.5 scenario. These findings have relevance not only to populated atoll islands in the Marshall Islands but also to those in the Caroline Islands, Cook Islands, Gilbert Islands, Line Islands, Society Islands, Spratly Islands, Maldives, Seychelles, and Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. In addition, because the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand was highest in the Marshall Islands (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>), providing the greatest vertical accommodation space for coral reefs to grow up into, the Marshall Islands are likely some of the highest atolls in the Pacific. Therefore, the timing of the tipping points presented here may be conservative (later in the future) compared to most of the other atoll islands that formed under lower mid-Holocene sea levels and, thus, have lower elevations. Islands fronted by wider, shallower reef flats with high coral coverage will have tipping points further in the future, whereas islands with narrower, deeper reef flats with lower coral cover (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>) will reach these tipping points sooner than described here for Roi-Namur. Last, if coral bleaching events (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>) and ocean acidification (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>) also increase in frequency and/or magnitude because of global climate change, then live coral coverage will decline, resulting in increased depths and reduced hydrodynamic roughness of the reefs. This will further enhance wave energy propagation to the shoreline and subsequent wave-driven flooding (

  </a>–
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>), causing tipping points to be reached sooner than projected here.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the focus of the effort presented here is on low-lying coral atoll islands, our findings are relevant to other tropical, reef-lined islands. Because most high tropical islands such as those found in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans receive enough rainfall on their mountains to generate freshwater resources at elevations unreachable by wave-driven runup, wave-driven coastal flooding will likely not threaten their freshwater resources. However, because most of these islands’ housing and critical infrastructure (ports, roads, airports, hospitals, power plants, water treatment plants, etc.) are located within a few meters of current sea level, they are also vulnerable to increased wave-driven overwash due to SLR.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These projections of low-lying atoll island sustainability through the 21st century contrast with the recent hypotheses (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>) that islands will endure through the SLR projected through the end of the 21st century (

   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>). Those hypotheses were based on observations of how uninhabited islands’ planform areas migrated but maintained themselves over a period of limited (&lt;0.3 m) SLR during the 20th century. However, our results, as well as those from other studies (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>), demonstrate that a more critical metric than island planform area is the elevation of the island above the current sea level, because that elevation controls the frequency and magnitude of wave-driven overwash and island flooding. Although studies (
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>) have shown that storms and wave-driven overwash can contribute to island formation through the deposition of reef-derived sediment during energetic events, the maximum vertical thickness of a storm or tsunami deposit is generally less than 10% and no more than 50% of the depth of the flooding seawater during the overwash event (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>). Thus, wave-driven island overwash, subsequent flooding, and groundwater salinization (and saltwater intrusion) will continue to increase with SLR, despite any wave-driven sediment deposition. Although these islands may experience a variety of sediment deposition and/or migration patterns, including the maintenance of their lateral extents, because of the loss of freshwater resources and the increased frequency of impacts to infrastructure, most of these islands will likely become uninhabitable in the near future, well before the end of the 21st century, as has been previously suggested (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Together, these results provide an improved and updated timeline of the threats that these low-lying atoll islands face to their infrastructure and natural resources in the face of future climate change. By incorporating wave-driven overwash into future predictions, we demonstrate the immediacy of the threats and underscore the urgency for planning and action. The next step is to use these results and those from theoretical simulations covering the range of reef island morphologies and climate forcing conditions to identify individual islands that are most vulnerable to SLR and then gauge the associated impacts to those islands over the next 20 to 50 years so that managers can prioritize funding for further place-based studies and/or restoration and adaptation efforts (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>). Although there are a number of engineering solutions to increase the resilience of infrastructure and food and water resources that could be used to help the islands adapt to climate change and extend their habitability, these solutions in remote areas generally have such high costs that most islands cannot afford them. This information will also be critical to political leaders, not only of island nations but also globally, for understanding how climate change will determine when these islands will no longer be able to support human habitation, resulting in an extensive displacement of human populations. If these impacts are not addressed or adequately planned for, as it becomes necessary to abandon or relocate island nations, then significant geopolitical issues could arise.
