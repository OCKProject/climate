 <div class="title">The projected percentage of Roi inundated because of SLR and flooded annually because of the combined effects of waves and SLR through time for different SLR and climatic scenarios.</div>
 <p>Dashed lines denote percentage of the island inundated by SLR, and the solid lines denote that annually flooded by waves. Large portions of the island are only affected by inundation due to SLR later in the 21st century, if at all, whereas significant portions are annually flooded by waves by the latter half of the 21st century for the RCP8.5 scenarios. Wave-driven flooding of more than 25% of the island, however, is enough to contaminate the groundwater and make it nonpotable, which is forecasted to be attained by the mid-21st century for the RCP8.5 scenarios and the latter half of the 21st century for the RCP4.5 scenario.</p>
