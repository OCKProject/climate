      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Physics-based numerical oceanographic and hydrogeologic models are necessary to robustly
         assess how future SLR will affect wave-driven flooding and the resulting impacts to
         human populations, infrastructure, and freshwater resources on atoll islands. To make
         accurate projections, such modeling requires field data for validation and calibration.
         Roi-Namur, an island with a mean elevation of 2 m above mean sea level (
         <a>Fig. 2A</a>), was selected as the study site for this effort because it recently experienced
         wave-driven marine flooding (
         <a><span>9</span></a>, 
         <a><span>11</span></a>) and an existing suite of groundwater monitoring wells provided a detailed understanding
         of the hydrogeology and groundwater resources (
         <a><span>18</span></a>). We conducted a field campaign on Roi-Namur from November 2013 to May 2015 to collect
         the requisite data to calibrate and validate the models.

               lens.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within the observational period, a large wave event (
         <a><span>16</span></a>), with wave heights exceeding 6 m, occurred on 2 to 3 March 2014. This wave event
         (
         <a>Fig. 2</a>, B and C) coincided with spring tides, which resulted in unusually elevated water
         levels over the atoll’s reef flat (
         <a>Fig. 2D</a>) and anomalously large wave-driven runup at the shoreline (
         <a>Fig. 2E</a>). Together, these conditions resulted in wave-driven shoreline water levels that
         exceeded the crest of the coastal berm; as a result, seawater overwashed parts of
         northern Roi-Namur and flooded inland into topographic lows (
         <a>Fig. 2B</a>). During the period of overwash, the groundwater levels on the shoreface of Roi-Namur
         increased almost 1 m above normal levels; observations farther inland also showed
         increases and elevated salinity, indicating that seawater infiltrated into the groundwater
         across the northern portion of the island (
         <a>Fig. 2F</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate future wave and water-level dynamics at the island scale, it is first
         necessary to understand how the regional meteorological and oceanographic conditions
         will evolve with a changing climate. These conditions were derived from global climate
         models (GCMs), providing information on annual changes in waves (
         <a><span>19</span></a>), rainfall, winds, and tropical cyclones (TCs). These metrics were then combined
         with SLR projections (
         <a><span>4</span></a>) to provide inputs for the island-scale models and regional context for the results.
         For the area around Kwajalein Atoll, deep-water wave heights and wind speeds are projected
         to decrease slightly. The frequency of TCs is projected to decrease, which is consistent
         with recent studies (
         <a><span>20</span></a>), but their intensity is predicted to increase. Although projected changes in the
         regional oceanographic patterns point to a slight reduction in the impact of waves
         to these islands, we demonstrate below that the effects of these changes will likely
         be insignificant in comparison to the impact of projected SLR in the region (
         <a><span>4</span></a>). Rainfall is expected to decrease slightly, as has been predicted throughout large
         swaths of the tropics (
         <a><span>21</span></a>), which would cause a reduction in freshwater availability and lengthen aquifer recharge
         (
         <a><span>18</span></a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two different models were used to examine the effects of increasing sea levels, offshore
         wave forcing, coastal overwash, flooding, and freshwater lens contamination on Roi-Namur.
         The first was a high-resolution, two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model (XBEACH)
         of the study area, which was used to simulate wave transformation across the reef
         flat and subsequent overwash and coastal flooding. The calibrated XBEACH model was
         used to assess the impacts of wave-driven flooding under three climate-change scenarios:
         Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5, representing medium and
         high greenhouse concentration trajectory scenarios, respectively (
         <a><span>22</span></a>-
         <a><span>23</span></a>); and RCP8.5+icesheet collapse (
         <a><span>4</span></a>). The climate change scenarios were incorporated into the model by increasing mean
         sea level based on the SLR [tables S1 and S2; (
         <a><span>4</span></a>)] and wave projections [table S1; (
         <a><span>19</span></a>)]. The modeled time frame ranged from 2035 to 2105 at 10-year time steps.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second model was a 3D groundwater model (SUTRA) that simulates the salinization
         and recovery processes of aquifers on low-elevation atoll islands. The SUTRA model
         was calibrated and validated using well data collected during a previous 2008 seawater-flooding
         event (
         <a><span>9</span></a>, 
         <a><span>11</span></a>). The simulated postflood evolution of the aquifer salinity after a seawater-flooding
         event indicates that the natural groundwater convection in the model is initiated
         as saline water infiltrates downward from the flooded area. When the simulated natural
         recharge from rainfall begins, fresh water accumulates at the water table and slowly
         pushes the intruded seawater deeper in the freshwater lens and toward the coast. For
         simulations of future years, the SUTRA model was forced by the multimodel ensemble
         output from the five best GCMs and the SLR scenarios (
         <a><span>4</span></a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The modeled future forcing conditions, coupled with the hydrodynamic and groundwater
         models, allow us to investigate the effects of wave-driven flooding on atoll island
         habitability and how these effects will change because of SLR and different climate
         change scenarios. With SLR alone (no wave-driven flooding considered), under the RCP8.5+icesheet
         collapse scenario, the projected spatial extent of seawater inundation on Roi does
         not affect most of the island until the end of the 21st century (
         <a>Fig. 3</a>, A to C). In terms of effects on freshwater availability, with no wave-driven flooding,
         the groundwater simulations indicate that, even when sea level is 1.6 m above present,
         the groundwater salinity would be only mildly affected and would remain potable. With
         +1.6 m of SLR, parts of the interior of Roi become saturated to the ground surface
         because the freshwater lens floats increasingly higher relative to the ground surface.
         These areas were simulated as freshwater bodies that lost water to evaporation, resulting
         in higher salinities in the island’s freshwater lens.

               annual large wave events increase into the future because of SLR and with increasing
               RCP scenario; the island is completely overwashed annually by wave-driven flooding
               later in the 21st century for RCP8.5 scenarios.

         <div></div>
      </div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, with higher sea levels, the island is projected to experience more severe
         annual wave-driven flooding events, during which seawater overtops the coastal berm
         resulting in increased inland flooding (
         <a>Fig. 3</a>, D to F). With both wave-driven flooding and SLR inundation, at a sea-level increase
         of just 0.4 m, much of the isthmus that connects Roi and Namur will be flooded annually,
         negatively affecting the infrastructure in this location. The groundwater simulations
         indicate that, with wave-driven flooding and progressively higher sea levels, the
         freshwater supply will be more adversely affected than from SLR alone: The postflood
         groundwater will become more saline, and the recovery times to potable water conditions
         will lengthen. A simulation of a 3-year period (dry, average, and wet years) at +0.4
         m of SLR (
         <a>Fig. 4</a>) indicates that, after two consecutive years of annual wave-driven flooding, the
         freshwater lens does not recover from the seawater contamination because chloride
         levels in the lens remain above the potability threshold (250 mg/liter).

               potability threshold. Within 2 years of annual flooding with +0.4 m of SLR, the island’s
               groundwater is no longer potable because of seawater contamination.

         </div>
         <div></div>
      </div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, this “tipping point”—the time at which potable groundwater on Roi-Namur will
         be unavailable—is projected to be reached in the very near future, that is, within
         the life span of current residents and before 2030 for the RCP8.5+icesheet collapse
         climate scenario and within the 2030–2040 time frame for the RCP8.5 scenario and 2055–2065
         for the RCP4.5 scenario. The 10-year ranges in these time frames take into account
         variability related to the El Nino–Southern Oscillation, which, in any given year,
         can cause regional sea level around Kwajalein to elevate or lower by 0.2 m for a few
         months (
         <a><span>24</span></a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if the groundwater supply were supplemented or replaced with another source (for
         example, desalinization or delivery of fresh water from elsewhere), annual wave-driven
         flooding would continue to disrupt infrastructure on Roi-Namur. Furthermore, most
         of the thousands of other populated atoll islands have far more limited options for
         managing their limited groundwater resources and are, therefore, even less resilient
         to SLR than the example provided here for Roi-Namur. When the mean sea level is 1.0
         m higher than that at present because of SLR, at least 50% of the island is projected
         to be flooded annually. This secondary tipping point—when most of Roi’s land would
         be flooded annually—is projected to be reached in the 2055–2065 time frame for the
         RCP8.5+icesheet collapse climate scenario, the 2060–2070 time frame for the RCP8.5
         scenario, and sometime after 2105 for the RCP4.5 scenario (
         <a>Fig. 5</a>). More than 90% of the island’s surface is projected to be flooded annually when
         the mean sea level is 1.8 m higher than that at present because of SLR, which will
         likely be reached in the 2075–2085 time frame for the RCP8.5+icesheet collapse scenario
         and in the 2090–2100 time frame for the RCP8.5 scenario.

            <p>Dashed lines denote percentage of the island inundated by SLR, and the solid lines

               by inundation due to SLR later in the 21st century, if at all, whereas significant
               portions are annually flooded by waves by the latter half of the 21st century for
               the RCP8.5 scenarios. Wave-driven flooding of more than 25% of the island, however,
               is enough to contaminate the groundwater and make it nonpotable, which is forecasted
               to be attained by the mid-21st century for the RCP8.5 scenarios and the latter half
               of the 21st century for the RCP4.5 scenario.
