      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential future changes in ocean surface storm waves were quantitatively simulated
         using models driven by historical hindcast data and projected conditions based on
         GCM output (
         <a><span>19</span></a>). Three-hour GCM wind speed and wind direction output were assimilated for the area
         encompassing Kwajalein Atoll from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase
         5 [CMIP5; (
         <a><span>35</span></a>)]. To reduce uncertainty in model variability, wind speed and wind direction for
         the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios (table S1) from four different GCMs (table
         S3) were used as boundary conditions to the physics-based WAVEWATCH III (
         <a><span>36</span></a>) numerical wave model. Modeled time periods were limited to the years 2026–2045 and
         2085–2100, as prescribed by the CMIP5 modeling framework, and interpolated to the
         2035–2105 time frame at 10-year time steps. The resulting modeled deep-water wave
         heights, wave periods, wave directions, wind speeds, and wind directions were analyzed
         using published methods (
         <a><span>19</span></a>).
