      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The primary goal of this investigation was to determine the influence of climate change
         and SLR on wave-driven flooding and the resulting impacts to infrastructure and freshwater
         resources on atoll islands. First, we mapped the morphology and benthic habitats of
         the atoll to determine the influence of spatially varying bathymetric structure and
         hydrodynamic roughness on wave propagation over the coral reefs that made up the atoll.
         Second, we analyzed historic meteorologic and oceanographic data to provide historical
         context for the limited in situ data and comparison to previous seawater overwash
         and flooding events. These data were then used to calibrate and validate physics-based,
         dynamically downscaled numerical models to project future atmospheric and oceanic
         forcing for a range of climate change scenarios. Third, we made in situ observations
         to better understand how changes in meteorologic and oceanographic forcing controlled
         wave-driven water levels, seawater flooding of the island, and the resulting hydrogeologic
         response. We then used those data to calibrate and validate physics-based, numerical
         hydrodynamic, and hydrogeologic models of the island. The hydrodynamic model was used
         to forecast future wave-driven island overwash and seawater flooding for a range of
         climate change and SLR scenarios. The output of those hydrodynamic simulations was
         then used as input to the hydrogeologic model to evaluate the impact of projected
         wave-driven flooding on the atoll island’s freshwater resource and at what rate the
         resource can recover. Last, we projected the tipping points—when the reoccurrence
         interval of island overwash and seawater intrusion events is shorter than the recovery
         times for the impact.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hydrodynamic and hydrogeologic models needed to be run on a high-resolution, seamless
            topographic and bathymetric (TB) digital elevation model (DEM) of the study area.
            To create the TB-DEM, topographic data from Global Positioning System (GPS) and terrestrial
            lidar scanning (TLS) collected on the island were combined with bathymetry derived
            from satellite imagery. The topographic surveys of Roi were conducted using static
            Topcon GRS1 dual-frequency GPS and GPS rovers. TLS surveys were conducted using a
            Riegl VZ-1000 tripod-based lidar scanner placed at 31 locations on the island. Data
            point cloud cleaning and filtering were performed on the registered point clouds to
            produce a subset of ground measurements suitable for constructing a bare-earth DEM.
            Because of the lack of high-resolution bathymetric data for the study area, WorldView-2
            and WorldView-3 multispectral satellite imagery were used to derive bathymetry (
            <a><span>32</span></a>). Depths on the ocean side were a combination of depths generated from the model
            down to 22.5 m; past that, depths were taken from an interpolated surface from fathometer
            measurements. A 3 × 3 low-pass convolution filter was used on the final product to
            eliminate single-pixel anomalies. To create the seamless TB-DEM of Roi-Namur, TLS,
            GPS, and satellite-derived bathymetry were combined into a 0.5-m grid. For the island
            and intertidal reef flat areas, TLS and GPS data were combined into a triangulated
            irregular network model. Because of the higher data density, TLS data were used preferentially
            over GPS and satellite-derived bathymetry wherever it was available. To produce the
            final seamless 0.5-m resolution TB-DEM, the onshore and offshore grids were combined.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hydrodynamic modeling uses a variety of equations with different coefficients to describe
            interactions between waves, current, and the seabed. Benthic habitats were mapped
            using spectral classification with the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique
            (ISODATA) unsupervised clustering algorithm, in combination with on-screen, heads-up
            digitizing (
            <a><span>33</span></a>). The minimum mapping unit (MMU) in the areas where ISODATA was used to depths of
            10 m was at the pixel level (4 m
            <span>2</span>); the MMU in the deeper areas where on-screen digitizing was used was 30 m
            <span>2</span>. The benthic habitat map was produced using a nonhierarchical classification system
            similar to the scheme used on adjacent Majuro Atoll (
            <a><span>33</span></a>). The resulting habitat map was converted to a spatially varying friction coefficient
            map, using published values for coral reef habitats from the literature (
            <a><span>15</span></a>,

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Land-cover data were needed to determine how much of any given land cover class would
            be inundated for a given future wave and sea-level scenario. Half-meter true-color
            and three-band color infrared satellite imagery were used as base layers to develop
            the terrestrial land-cover map. The ArcGIS Interactive Supervised Classification tool
            was used to delineate 15 distinct land-cover classes, and a majority filter was applied
            using eight closest cells. The result of the majority filter was a raster that was
            converted to polygons that were grouped by land-cover classification.

            an 18-month field experiment was conducted on Roi-Namur Island in Kwajalein Atoll,
            and concurrent far-field, deep-water wave and wind-forcing data were acquired. Together,
            these observations elucidated the influence of water depth (as related to tidal and
            atmospheric forcing) on wave propagation and transformation across the atoll rim and
            over the reef flats for a range of oceanographic and meteorologic conditions. The
            18-month field experiment consisted of three consecutive 6-month deployments in which
            two cross-shore arrays (
            <a><span>16</span></a>) were installed on the north, oceanside coastline of Roi (western portion of Roi-Namur).
            Each cross-shore array consisted of three bottom-mounted RBR wave/tide gauges over
            the reef flat and one on the upper fore reef. Between the two adjacent transects,
            an upward-looking 600-kHz Nortek Acoustic Wave and Current meter was placed on the
            fore reef. In addition, to capture wave and tidal conditions in the lagoon, an RBR
            wave/tide gauge and an RBR tide gauge were placed on a dock pier.

            of XBEACH was used to simulate wave transformation and coastal flooding on Roi-Namur.
            The XBEACH model was calibrated and validated by comparing modeled and measured wave
            and water-level data from the December 2013 and March 2014 large wave events. The
            calibrated and validated XBEACH model was then forced with SLR values (
            <a><span>4</span></a>) that ranged from +0.2 to +2.9 m (tables S1 and S2). The incident offshore wave parameters
            used in the model (

            The modeled years ranged from 2035 to 2105 at 10-year intervals, and the SLR and wave
            parameters used for each year were based on interpolation of the SLR (

            a spatially varying friction coefficient was incorporated on the basis of the benthic
            habitat mapping. The 2D model was calibrated for the current friction coefficient
            by comparing modeled and measured in situ wave and water-level data and the spatially
            varying habitat data.

            represent climate, both in terms of future predictions and the observed long-term
            trends in the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean regions over recent decades. Historical
            simulations (1971–2005) were used to assess the models’ ability to realistically simulate
            the annual mean precipitation, winds, sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and their annual
            cycles. On the basis of a suite of metrics, five models that demonstrated high skills
            (“best”) in representing the present-day climatology and variability (table S3) were
            selected from the larger pool of 41 GCMs for detailed analyses. Then, for the five
            best GCMs, their skill in capturing interannual variations in seasonal rainfall during
            rainy seasons was examined. Finally, mean annual changes in rainfall, SST, and winds
            from the five best GCMs were used for future projections. Although CMIP5 global models
            do not adequately simulate the intensity of fully developed tropical cyclones (TCs),
            the genesis and the early life of TCs, in these models over the west Pacific were

            saltwater ponding over the surface of Roi, and natural recharge of wells via rainfall.
            The annual wave events derived from the future oceanographic flood modeling were used
            to drive overwash. Then, following these overwash events, the temporal evolution of
            the freshwater-lens seawater contamination (chloride concentrations relative to potability
            levels) was simulated with the same groundwater pumping rate and timing as occurred
            in the years following the 2008 flooding event. Future recharge (2080–2099) was estimated
            using rainfall and evapotranspiration based on future climate modeling of the RCP8.5
            scenario. Modeled climate data were processed for historic (1990–2009) and future
            (2080–2099, RCP8.5) conditions to compute mean monthly change factors for rainfall

            topography, and then the estimated maximum seawater flooding distribution was applied
            to the model for a 2-day period each year. The response of the freshwater lens was
            evaluated on the basis of how the salinity (chloride concentration) of water at the
            skimming well changed during the recovery time period. Under some climatic scenarios,
            it was necessary to carry out these simulations for several years after a single overwash
