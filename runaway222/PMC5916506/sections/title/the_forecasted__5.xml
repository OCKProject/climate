 <div class="title">The forecasted impact of annual wave-driven flooding events on groundwater potability over 3 years for +0.4 m of SLR.</div>
 <p>Plot shows the modeled evolution of chloride concentrations relative to the 250-mg/liter potability threshold. Within 2 years of annual flooding with +0.4 m of SLR, the islandâ€™s groundwater is no longer potable because of seawater contamination.</p>
