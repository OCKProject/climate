      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The availability of multimember ensembles of present-day and warming scenario simulations
         from 41 GCMs (table S3) in CMIP5 (
         <a><span>35</span></a>) provides a unique opportunity to examine the ability of global models to accurately
         represent climate, both in terms of future predictions and the observed long-term
         trends in the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean regions over recent decades. Historical
         simulations (1971–2005) were used to assess the models’ ability to realistically simulate
         the annual mean precipitation, winds, sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and their annual
         cycles. On the basis of a suite of metrics, five models that demonstrated high skills
         (“best”) in representing the present-day climatology and variability (table S3) were
         selected from the larger pool of 41 GCMs for detailed analyses. Then, for the five
         best GCMs, their skill in capturing interannual variations in seasonal rainfall during
         rainy seasons was examined. Finally, mean annual changes in rainfall, SST, and winds
         from the five best GCMs were used for future projections. Although CMIP5 global models
         do not adequately simulate the intensity of fully developed tropical cyclones (TCs),
         the genesis and the early life of TCs, in these models over the west Pacific were
         evaluated, and the statistical properties of these storms around Kwajalein were quantified.
         The TRACK program (
         <a><span>37</span></a>), a mathematically and physically developed objective procedure, was applied on the
         model output to diagnose tropical storms over the west Pacific region. TRACK objectively
         identifies TCs through analysis of the time series of meteorological fields.
