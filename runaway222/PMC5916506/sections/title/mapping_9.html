      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hydrodynamic and hydrogeologic models needed to be run on a high-resolution, seamless
         topographic and bathymetric (TB) digital elevation model (DEM) of the study area.
         To create the TB-DEM, topographic data from Global Positioning System (GPS) and terrestrial
         lidar scanning (TLS) collected on the island were combined with bathymetry derived
         from satellite imagery. The topographic surveys of Roi were conducted using static
         Topcon GRS1 dual-frequency GPS and GPS rovers. TLS surveys were conducted using a
         Riegl VZ-1000 tripod-based lidar scanner placed at 31 locations on the island. Data
         point cloud cleaning and filtering were performed on the registered point clouds to
         produce a subset of ground measurements suitable for constructing a bare-earth DEM.
         Because of the lack of high-resolution bathymetric data for the study area, WorldView-2
         and WorldView-3 multispectral satellite imagery were used to derive bathymetry (
         <a><span>32</span></a>). Depths on the ocean side were a combination of depths generated from the model
         down to 22.5 m; past that, depths were taken from an interpolated surface from fathometer
         measurements. A 3 Ã— 3 low-pass convolution filter was used on the final product to
         eliminate single-pixel anomalies. To create the seamless TB-DEM of Roi-Namur, TLS,
         GPS, and satellite-derived bathymetry were combined into a 0.5-m grid. For the island
         and intertidal reef flat areas, TLS and GPS data were combined into a triangulated
         irregular network model. Because of the higher data density, TLS data were used preferentially
         over GPS and satellite-derived bathymetry wherever it was available. To produce the
         final seamless 0.5-m resolution TB-DEM, the onshore and offshore grids were combined.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hydrodynamic modeling uses a variety of equations with different coefficients to describe
         interactions between waves, current, and the seabed. Benthic habitats were mapped
         using spectral classification with the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique
         (ISODATA) unsupervised clustering algorithm, in combination with on-screen, heads-up
         digitizing (
         <a><span>33</span></a>). The minimum mapping unit (MMU) in the areas where ISODATA was used to depths of
         10 m was at the pixel level (4 m
         <span>2</span>); the MMU in the deeper areas where on-screen digitizing was used was 30 m
         <span>2</span>. The benthic habitat map was produced using a nonhierarchical classification system
         similar to the scheme used on adjacent Majuro Atoll (
         <a><span>33</span></a>). The resulting habitat map was converted to a spatially varying friction coefficient
         map, using published values for coral reef habitats from the literature (
         <a><span>15</span></a>, 
         <a><span>34</span></a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Land-cover data were needed to determine how much of any given land cover class would
         be inundated for a given future wave and sea-level scenario. Half-meter true-color
         and three-band color infrared satellite imagery were used as base layers to develop
         the terrestrial land-cover map. The ArcGIS Interactive Supervised Classification tool
         was used to delineate 15 distinct land-cover classes, and a majority filter was applied
         using eight closest cells. The result of the majority filter was a raster that was
         converted to polygons that were grouped by land-cover classification.
