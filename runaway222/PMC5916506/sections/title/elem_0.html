      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent observations (
         <a><span>1</span></a>, 
         <a><span>2</span></a>) and projections (
         <a><span>3</span></a>, 
         <a><span>4</span></a>) of sea level show that eustatic sea-level rise (SLR) by the end of the 21st century
         could exceed 2.0 m above 2000 levels. Although the precise rates and elevations of
         SLR by 2100 are uncertain, the existing models all suggest that eustatic sea level
         will be significantly higher by the end of the century and that it will have a profound
         impact on low-lying coastal areas. Projections indicate that these effects will be
         amplified in the tropics, where sea level will be higher than the global average (
         <a><span>5</span></a>). Furthermore, the tropics are dotted with thousands of low-lying atoll islands,
         and because many of these islands have maximum elevations less than 4 m and average
         elevations less than 2 m above present sea level, they are expected to experience
         disproportionately greater SLR impacts (
         <a><span>6</span></a>). Most atoll islands have limited adaptation space, land available for human habitation
         (
         <a><span>7</span></a>–
         <a><span>9</span></a>), and water and food sources (
         <a><span>10</span></a>, 
         <a><span>11</span></a>), and most have ecosystems that are vulnerable to seawater inundation (
         <a><span>12</span></a>). In addition, the majority of carbonate islands are positioned on coral reefs, where
         measured vertical reef flat accretion rates [2 to 6 mm/year; (
         <a><span>13</span></a>)] are up to an order of magnitude slower than the rates of projected SLR [8 to 20
         mm/year; (
         <a><span>3</span></a>, 
         <a><span>4</span></a>)]. Projected SLR will, thus, outstrip new reef flat accretion, resulting in a net
         increase in water depth over atolls’ reefs.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wave impacts can be caused by events such as passing tropical storms and cyclones
         but can also occur as “blue sky events” due to large, remotely generated swell (
         <a><span>9</span></a>). SLR will exacerbate the impact of large waves on atolls’ coral reefs by reducing
         wave breaking at the reef crest and increasing the water level over the reef flat,
         which will allow larger waves to reach the shoreline [
         <a>Fig. 1</a>; (
         <a><span>14</span></a>, 
         <a><span>15</span></a>)]. These larger waves will increase wave-driven runup and, thus, total water levels
         at the shoreline (
         <a><span>15</span></a>, 
         <a><span>16</span></a>). Wave-induced overwash and the resulting island flooding threaten terrestrial infrastructure
         (
         <a><span>11</span></a>) and can contaminate an island’s underlying thin freshwater lens with saltwater (
         <a><span>17</span></a>, 
         <a><span>18</span></a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To date, most studies that describe future SLR threats to low-lying atoll islands
         (
         <a><span>7</span></a>, 
         <a><span>8</span></a>) generally have used passive models to simulate SLR inundation of the islands; these
         models do not incorporate the nonlinear interaction between SLR and waves (
         <a><span>14</span></a>, 
         <a><span>15</span></a>), let alone their interaction with island hydrogeology. Our study used field data
         to calibrate oceanographic and hydrogeologic models, which were then used with climate
         change and SLR projections to explore the effect of SLR and wave-driven flooding on
         atoll islands and their freshwater resources. The objective of this effort was to
         reduce risk and increase island resiliency by providing model simulations across a
         range of plausible future conditions, which have large uncertainty in future emissions
         (and thus climate change scenarios) that is largely irreducible. This effort focuses
         on Roi-Namur Island on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI),
         which is home to more than 1100 low-lying islands on 29 atolls. The approach and findings
         presented in this study can serve as a proxy for atolls around the world, most of
         which have a similar morphology and structure (including, on average, even lower land
         elevations) and are the home for numerous island nations and hundreds of thousands
         of people.
