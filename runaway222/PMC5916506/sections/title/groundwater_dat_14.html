      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An assessment of the Roi-Namur shallow groundwater lens was carried out from November
         2013 to April 2015. This assessment included surveys of groundwater levels, temperature,
         and specific conductivity (salinity) in a suite of wells and temporary piezometers
         strategically placed around the island to provide time-series groundwater levels and
         specific conductivity measurements. In addition, depth-specific groundwater samples
         were collected.
