  </a>) of sea level show that eustatic sea-level rise (SLR) by the end of the 21st century could exceed 2.0 m above 2000 levels. Although the precise rates and elevations of SLR by 2100 are uncertain, the existing models all suggest that eustatic sea level will be significantly higher by the end of the century and that it will have a profound impact on low-lying coastal areas. Projections indicate that these effects will be amplified in the tropics, where sea level will be higher than the global average (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). Furthermore, the tropics are dotted with thousands of low-lying atoll islands, and because many of these islands have maximum elevations less than 4 m and average elevations less than 2 m above present sea level, they are expected to experience disproportionately greater SLR impacts (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>). Most atoll islands have limited adaptation space, land available for human habitation (

  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). In addition, the majority of carbonate islands are positioned on coral reefs, where measured vertical reef flat accretion rates [2 to 6 mm/year; (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>)] are up to an order of magnitude slower than the rates of projected SLR [8 to 20 mm/year; (

   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>)]. Projected SLR will, thus, outstrip new reef flat accretion, resulting in a net increase in water depth over atolls’ reefs.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wave impacts can be caused by events such as passing tropical storms and cyclones but can also occur as “blue sky events” due to large, remotely generated swell (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>). SLR will exacerbate the impact of large waves on atolls’ coral reefs by reducing wave breaking at the reef crest and increasing the water level over the reef flat, which will allow larger waves to reach the shoreline [

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>

   <span class="italic">7</span>

  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">

  </a>), let alone their interaction with island hydrogeology. Our study used field data to calibrate oceanographic and hydrogeologic models, which were then used with climate change and SLR projections to explore the effect of SLR and wave-driven flooding on atoll islands and their freshwater resources. The objective of this effort was to reduce risk and increase island resiliency by providing model simulations across a range of plausible future conditions, which have large uncertainty in future emissions (and thus climate change scenarios) that is largely irreducible. This effort focuses on Roi-Namur Island on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), which is home to more than 1100 low-lying islands on 29 atolls. The approach and findings presented in this study can serve as a proxy for atolls around the world, most of which have a similar morphology and structure (including, on average, even lower land elevations) and are the home for numerous island nations and hundreds of thousands of people.
