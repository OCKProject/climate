  </a>). These simulations take into account various stages of higher sea level, estimated saltwater ponding over the surface of Roi, and natural recharge of wells via rainfall. The annual wave events derived from the future oceanographic flood modeling were used to drive overwash. Then, following these overwash events, the temporal evolution of the freshwater-lens seawater contamination (chloride concentrations relative to potability levels) was simulated with the same groundwater pumping rate and timing as occurred in the years following the 2008 flooding event. Future recharge (2080–2099) was estimated using rainfall and evapotranspiration based on future climate modeling of the RCP8.5 scenario. Modeled climate data were processed for historic (1990–2009) and future (2080–2099, RCP8.5) conditions to compute mean monthly change factors for rainfall amount, number of rain days, and reference evapotranspiration to compute recharge for future conditions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future sea levels and worst-case annual seawater flooding scenarios were estimated as described in the “Wave-driven flood modeling” section. SLR scenarios of +0.4, +0.8, +1.2, and +1.6 m (RCP8.5 estimates of SLR at Roi-Namur in 2035, 2055, 2075, and 2090, respectively) and the associated annual wave-driven flooding were simulated. For each scenario, the coastline of the island was reduced accordingly on the basis of island topography, and then the estimated maximum seawater flooding distribution was applied to the model for a 2-day period each year. The response of the freshwater lens was evaluated on the basis of how the salinity (chloride concentration) of water at the skimming well changed during the recovery time period. Under some climatic scenarios, it was necessary to carry out these simulations for several years after a single overwash event so that the full duration of the lens recovery could be resolved. Finally, simulations of three consecutive years of annual overwash and flooding events during dry, average, and wet recharge conditions with representative withdrawal patterns for each year were completed.</p>
