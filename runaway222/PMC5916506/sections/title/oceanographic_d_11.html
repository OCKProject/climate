      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To calibrate and validate the physics-based, numerical nearshore hydrodynamic model,
         an 18-month field experiment was conducted on Roi-Namur Island in Kwajalein Atoll,
         and concurrent far-field, deep-water wave and wind-forcing data were acquired. Together,
         these observations elucidated the influence of water depth (as related to tidal and
         atmospheric forcing) on wave propagation and transformation across the atoll rim and
         over the reef flats for a range of oceanographic and meteorologic conditions. The
         18-month field experiment consisted of three consecutive 6-month deployments in which
         two cross-shore arrays (
         <a><span>16</span></a>) were installed on the north, oceanside coastline of Roi (western portion of Roi-Namur).
         Each cross-shore array consisted of three bottom-mounted RBR wave/tide gauges over
         the reef flat and one on the upper fore reef. Between the two adjacent transects,
         an upward-looking 600-kHz Nortek Acoustic Wave and Current meter was placed on the
         fore reef. In addition, to capture wave and tidal conditions in the lagoon, an RBR
         wave/tide gauge and an RBR tide gauge were placed on a dock pier.
