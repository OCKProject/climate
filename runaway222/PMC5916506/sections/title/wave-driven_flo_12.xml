  </a>). A high-resolution (2- to 50-m grid cells with the finest scale on the island) implementation of XBEACH was used to simulate wave transformation and coastal flooding on Roi-Namur. The XBEACH model was calibrated and validated by comparing modeled and measured wave and water-level data from the December 2013 and March 2014 large wave events. The calibrated and validated XBEACH model was then forced with SLR values (

  </a>) that ranged from +0.2 to +2.9 m (tables S1 and S2). The incident offshore wave parameters used in the model (

  </a>) had offshore wave heights ranging from 2.2 to 5.1 m and periods from 11 to 15 s. The modeled years ranged from 2035 to 2105 at 10-year intervals, and the SLR and wave parameters used for each year were based on interpolation of the SLR (

  </a>) and future wave (
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>) projections. To include the effect of higher bottom roughness on incident wave decay, a spatially varying friction coefficient was incorporated on the basis of the benthic habitat mapping. The 2D model was calibrated for the current friction coefficient by comparing modeled and measured in situ wave and water-level data and the spatially varying habitat data.
