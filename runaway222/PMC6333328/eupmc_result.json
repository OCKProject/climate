    "The formation and characteristics are two important topics in the study of vegetation pattern. In this paper, we focus on the influence of infiltration feedback of surface runoff on the formation and characteristics of banded vegetation pattern on hillsides of semiarid area. Firstly, it is shown that the infiltration feedback of surface runoff is an important formation mechanics of the banded vegetation pattern in semiarid area. Then it is found that the patterns formed within the reasonable parameter space are periodic both in space and time and the wave speed of the periodic vegetation stripes become larger with the increase of the infiltration feedback strength, while the wavelength is negatively correlated with the infiltration feedback strength. At last, it is shown that the mean productivity of grass pattern is lower than that of homogeneous steady state when the infiltration feedback is weak and it is larger than that with stronger infiltration feedback."
