 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous analysis of CMIP5 historical simulations indicates that a starting point in understanding the mechanisms whereby the SC variability influences the PWC is found in the muted hydrological cycle mechanism (
  <a rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" href="#r18">18</a>). As direct observations of precipitation suffer from limited spatiotemporal coverage and homogenization issues (
  <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>), we turn to the reanalyses to examine global signals at lag +1 y in precipitation and water vapor content (WVC). Reanalyses generally indicate an atmospheric moistening at Smax with increases of 0.5% (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.25), 0.7% (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05), and 0.4% (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.4) for 20CR, ERA20, and NCEP, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). Over the ocean only (land grid points masked out) the signals are 0.6% (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05), 0.74% (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05), and 0.57% (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.15). This translates to a global-mean sensitivity of 6.3%/K, 7.7%/K, and 4.2%/K, under global surface warming (per 1 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) of about 0.07, 0.09, and 0.1 K (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). While the WVC is largely controlled by the C-C relation, global precipitation changes are constrained by atmospheric energetics and generally increase at a reduced rate in response to a warmer surface (
  <a rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" href="#r24">24</a>). The SC imprint on global precipitation is more uncertain than the WVC and reanalyses show insignificant positive anomalies at lag +1 (0.06%, 0.1%, and 0.32% for 20CR, ERA20, and NCEP, respectively, generally 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.6). However, the sensitivity of global precipitation changes to surface warming (0.94%/K, 1.15%/K, and 3.17%/K, for 20CR, ERA20, and NCEP, respectively) lies within the spread of responses in the AMIP individual runs (range −0.6–4.2%/K at lag +1 y), which show an ensemble mean increase of 1.92%/K. As expected, percentage increases of global WVC are larger than the corresponding precipitation signals in all AMIP runs, with an ensemble mean WVC sensitivity of 8.84%/K (ensemble range 6.1–11.6%/K). Comparable changes in global hydrology are also found in SOLAR at lag +1. The WVC increases significantly by 0.72% (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01 and range 0.4–1%), while global precipitation increases by merely 0.12% (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.22 and range 0.07–0.2%), implying an ensemble mean sensitivity to the SC of 9.6%/K for WVC and 1.6%/K for precipitation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reanalyses and model results provide evidence for a stronger sensitivity of the global WVC increase versus global precipitation in response to the SC, which is consistent with SC signatures in global hydrology identified in the CMIP5 models and other attribution studies (
  <a rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" href="#r18">18</a>, 
  <a rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" href="#r24">24</a>). According to theory and sensitivity simulations of GHG forcing (
  <a rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" href="#r2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" href="#r25">25</a>), the dominant driver of global hydrological changes is the spatially uniform SST response while the SST pattern (longitudinal distribution of SST anomalies) is of secondary importance. To investigate whether this is also the case for solar forcing, we analyze an AMIP-ZM ensemble, which is identical to AMIP but forced only by zonally averaged SST anomalies from 1950 to 2013 superimposed on the SST climatology (
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s5" href="#s5">
   <span class="italic">Materials and Methods</span>
  </a>). In this way, the longitudinal pattern of SST response to SC forcing is removed and surface temperature anomalies over the Indian and Pacific Oceans are characterized by a zonally uniform warming, which barely exceeds 0.1 K (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1
   <span class="italic">L</span>
  </a>). Analysis of this ensemble confirms that the global-mean WVC and precipitation increase at almost the same rates as in the AMIP (with differences arising mainly over land; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). The muted response of the global hydrology weakens convection and tropical circulation as indicated by the westerly anomalies (up to 300 hPa) in the Far West Pacific (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </a>). Westerly wind anomalies in AMIP-ZM are considerably weaker (&lt;0.2 m/s, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.4 at 800 hPA) than AMIP and show a wider ensemble spread because of the weaker magnitude of the specified SST gradients (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1815060116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S10
  </span>). For this reason, it is not surprising that AMIP-ZM shows insignificant ΔSLP anomalies (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1
   <span class="italic">J</span>
  </a> and 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1815060116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S2 and S5
  </span>). However, we detect a significant (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.1) increase in precipitation which, like the circulation anomalies, is confined to the West Pacific.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison of the AMIP versus AMIP-ZM simulations suggests that while the general response pattern may be determined by the zonal-mean warming, the amplitude of the surface precipitation and wind response as well as the extent of the eastward shift of the PWC, are probably associated with the longitudinal SST response pattern. It is therefore of interest to explore the cause of this SST warming pattern and how it further weakens the PWC.</p>
