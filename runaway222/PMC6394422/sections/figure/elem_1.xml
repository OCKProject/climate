  <p>Bayesian Net for combining disparate information; 30 years after launch of Enhanced Earth Observing Systems. “IAC” denotes the weather satellite infrared spectrometers IASI (EUMETSAT instrument), AIRS (NASA instrument), and CrIS (NOAA instrument). The existing 
   <span class="italic">CERES</span> system is a broadband radiation budget instrument measuring total reflected solar energy and total emitted thermal infrared energy. The “prior” distribution for ECS is the truncated Roe Baker distribution used by the IWGSCC. The unit on the 
   <span class="italic">x</span>-axes for the histogram for ECS is degrees centigrade [C], for Decadal Temp rise, and for the pink and yellow measurement systems, the 
   <span class="italic">x</span>-axis is [C] / decade, while for decadal change in CRF, and its pink and yellow measurement systems, the 
   <span class="italic">x</span>-axis is percentage change in CRF / decade
