 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above results help develop our intuitions for probabilistic reasoning. The ECS estimates themselves depend strongly on the presumed measured values. A more powerful analysis computes the reduction in uncertainty averaged over all possible measurement values. More precisely, we draw a large sample from the joint distribution pictured in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. For each value of each measuring platform, and for each vector of values for each combination of measuring platforms, the conditional expectation and conditional standard deviation of ECS are computed. This computation is possible analytically because the BN realizes the correlations using the normal copula. In other words, the marginal distributions pictured in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> are assumed to be transformations of standard normal variables. Conditionalization of a joint normal distribution can be performed analytically and the results back-transformed to the original variables. The normal copula imposes features like tail independence and symmetric rank scatter plots. More general copula can be used to avoid these restrictions, at much higher computational expense.

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> shows the results. On average, a measurement of Temp by only IAC reduces the uncertainty (standard deviation) of ECS from 1.24 to 0.96. If we employ only the enhanced system for measuring Temp, we find an average posterior standard deviation of ECS of 0.49. On average, the old (pink) systems provide little uncertainty reduction beyond that gained by the enhanced (yellow) systems. These averages conceal the fact that the old pink systems can still add substantial information in some cases, depending on the actual numbers.
