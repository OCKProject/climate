 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two measurements in Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> are strongly conflicting when considered in isolation. Indeed, judging by the resultant expected values for ECS, the enhanced measurements are more discordant than those of the current system. Combining the conflicting results is simply a matter of conditionalizing on both pieces of information. Of course, such conflicting results are unlikely, but if they are observed, we should expect that the enhanced CRF measurement is deflected upward by the noise, while the enhanced_Temp measurement is deflected downward. In other words, given conflicting measured values, the expected errors are negatively correlated (see 
  <a rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec10">appendix</a>). This effect is stronger for the enhanced than for the current systems.

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of propagating both signals through the network are shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, for both the current and enhanced systems. In spite of the conflict, synthesizing both signals yields a significant reduction of uncertainty. Note that the current pink systems leave us with greater uncertainty (standard deviation 0.678 versus 0.289) and yields a smaller shift in the mean estimate of ECS (2.58 versus 2.31). Updating the prior of ECS on both pieces of information constrains the posterior distribution of ECS more than one might expect. The more discordant (yellow) measurements induce more than twice the uncertainty reduction in ECS as the more concordant (pink) measurements.
