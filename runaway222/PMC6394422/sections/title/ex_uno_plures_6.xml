 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a difference between conflicting and concordant signals, however. If the enhanced_CRF result had been 0.841, and the enhanced Temp result had been 0.4, then each measurement by itself would produce the same mean for ECS, 5.27 (left and middle panels of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). However, if the concordant signals are combined, then the re-enforcing effect would raise the mean of ECS from 5.27 to 5.58 and uncertainty in ECS would drop to 0.738. Imagine the scientists saying “your measurement gives the estimate ECS = 5.27, same as mine, so let’s combine our results and estimate ECS = 5.58”. Once again, this is impossible to understand on the simple error model. The explanation lies in the skewed distribution of ECS. The individual measurements would “like” to be higher, but relatively high uncertainties (1.03 for enhanced_CRF, 0.841 for enhanced_Temp) are unable to “drag the prior further upward.” Combining the measurements brings the uncertainty down, allowing the mean value also to rise. The appendix gives a simple mathematical model of this behavior.

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar behavior will be obtained with lower than expected measured values. If enhanced Temp returns 0.229 and enhanced CRF returns zero, the expectations and standard deviations of ECS, when updated on these values individually, are respectively 0.263 ± 0.406 and 0.263 ± 0.501. If ECS is updated on both measured values simultaneously, the result is 2.56 ± 0.325.</p>
