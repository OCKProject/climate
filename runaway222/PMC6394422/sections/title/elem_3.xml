 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A Bayesian Net (BN) is a graphical representation of a multivariate probability distribution. The BN software employed here is UNINET,
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2" href="#Fn2">2</a> developed for the Dutch Ministry of Transport. UNINET was designed for non-parametric continuous and discrete variables in very high dimensions (Ale et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2009</a>) using (conditional) rank correlations and the normal copula (see Section 
  <a rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec8">5</a>). Rank correlation and the Pearson product moment correlation are typically close, and no distinction is made in this exercise (for details on these and other aspects of UNINET, see Hanea (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2008</a>) and Hanea et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2015</a>)). If 
  <span class="italic">Z</span> is an observation of random variable 
  <span class="italic">X</span> with independent error uncertainty 
  <span class="italic">e</span> (
  <span class="italic">X = Z + e</span>), then the correlation of 
  <span class="italic">Z</span> and 
  <span class="italic">X</span> is 
  <span class="italic">σ</span>

  <span class="italic">σ</span> denotes the standard deviation. If

  <span class="italic">σ</span>
  <sub>

  </sub> becomes small, the correlation between

  <span class="italic">X</span> (Leroy et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2008</a>). These ratios of standard deviations are used to determine the correlations in Fig.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows the Bayesian net for current (pink) and new (yellow) measurements of the rate of decadal temperature rise (Temp) and percentage rate of change in CRF. Each measurement adds its own instrument uncertainties which, according to the above, are independent. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> depicts the situation after 30 years before measurements of Temp or CRF. The marginal distributions and correlations are input to the BN which then determines the joint distribution by simulation. Means and standard deviations of the individual variables are shown in the boxes with histograms for each variable. The correlations shown by each arc are determined, as above, by the ratios of standard deviations in the observing and observed systems and the observational time. The joint distribution can then be conditionalized on any set of values of any of the variables. Performing a measurement corresponds to learning a unique value for one or more of the pink and yellow variables. Conditionalization propagates this knowledge through the net thereby reflecting the changes in our uncertainty resulting from the measurement(s).
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After 30 years, the trend uncertainty due to natural variability is fairly small and the correlations between ECS and the theoretical trends (green) are high. Greater accuracy with the yellow systems is reflected in higher correlations with the trending variables. The distribution for 
  <span class="italic">ECS</span> is the truncated Roe Baker distribution used by IWGSCC. The sign convention for CRF decadal change is that positive change indicates increased downward solar energy into the climate system. Units in the figures for temperature trends are given in K/decade and for CRF are given in % CRF/decade.

  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Probabilistic intuitions are engaged by conditionalizing on possible observed values and propagating this information through the network. For example, suppose we observe a value for CRF (1.0) indicating high ECS with the CERES system. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> (left panel) shows the result of propagating this information: the new measurement 
   <span class="italic">increases</span> our uncertainty. The standard deviation of ECS before observing was 1.24, after observing it is 1.34. This “negative learning” (Oppenheimer et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2016</a>) is impossible under the simple error model, yet it is very real and can blindside the unwary: The result is greater uncertainty in ECS post measurement than pre-measurement. The results of propagating a value for the IAC Temp (0.1 K/decade) indicating a low value for ECS are also shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> (right panel). Negative learning does not occur in this case because the prior distribution of ECS is skewed: there is not as much room to maneuver on the low end of ECS values.

  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the measured values in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> were returned by the enhanced systems, the shift in the distribution of ECS would be much more dramatic (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). This is the effect of reducing the error uncertainty in the enhanced measurements. There is no negative learning in this case, yet here again the results would baffle an analyst equipped only with the simple error model. Indeed, how could the pink and yellow measurements return the same numbers yet lead to very different conclusions for ECS? The answer is that with reduced error, the yellow measurements pay less heed to the prior information for ECS. The interactions between measurement error and the prior uncertainty in ECS are complex and easily under-appreciated.

  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two measurements in Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> are strongly conflicting when considered in isolation. Indeed, judging by the resultant expected values for ECS, the enhanced measurements are more discordant than those of the current system. Combining the conflicting results is simply a matter of conditionalizing on both pieces of information. Of course, such conflicting results are unlikely, but if they are observed, we should expect that the enhanced CRF measurement is deflected upward by the noise, while the enhanced_Temp measurement is deflected downward. In other words, given conflicting measured values, the expected errors are negatively correlated (see 
   <a rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec10">appendix</a>). This effect is stronger for the enhanced than for the current systems.
  </p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of propagating both signals through the network are shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, for both the current and enhanced systems. In spite of the conflict, synthesizing both signals yields a significant reduction of uncertainty. Note that the current pink systems leave us with greater uncertainty (standard deviation 0.678 versus 0.289) and yields a smaller shift in the mean estimate of ECS (2.58 versus 2.31). Updating the prior of ECS on both pieces of information constrains the posterior distribution of ECS more than one might expect. The more discordant (yellow) measurements induce more than twice the uncertainty reduction in ECS as the more concordant (pink) measurements.

  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a difference between conflicting and concordant signals, however. If the enhanced_CRF result had been 0.841, and the enhanced Temp result had been 0.4, then each measurement by itself would produce the same mean for ECS, 5.27 (left and middle panels of Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). However, if the concordant signals are combined, then the re-enforcing effect would raise the mean of ECS from 5.27 to 5.58 and uncertainty in ECS would drop to 0.738. Imagine the scientists saying “your measurement gives the estimate ECS = 5.27, same as mine, so let’s combine our results and estimate ECS = 5.58”. Once again, this is impossible to understand on the simple error model. The explanation lies in the skewed distribution of ECS. The individual measurements would “like” to be higher, but relatively high uncertainties (1.03 for enhanced_CRF, 0.841 for enhanced_Temp) are unable to “drag the prior further upward.” Combining the measurements brings the uncertainty down, allowing the mean value also to rise. The appendix gives a simple mathematical model of this behavior.

  </p>
  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar behavior will be obtained with lower than expected measured values. If enhanced Temp returns 0.229 and enhanced CRF returns zero, the expectations and standard deviations of ECS, when updated on these values individually, are respectively 0.263 ± 0.406 and 0.263 ± 0.501. If ECS is updated on both measured values simultaneously, the result is 2.56 ± 0.325.</p>
