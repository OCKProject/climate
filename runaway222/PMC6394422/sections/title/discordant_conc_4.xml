 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Probabilistic intuitions are engaged by conditionalizing on possible observed values and propagating this information through the network. For example, suppose we observe a value for CRF (1.0) indicating high ECS with the CERES system. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> (left panel) shows the result of propagating this information: the new measurement 
  <span class="italic">increases</span> our uncertainty. The standard deviation of ECS before observing was 1.24, after observing it is 1.34. This “negative learning” (Oppenheimer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2016</a>) is impossible under the simple error model, yet it is very real and can blindside the unwary: The result is greater uncertainty in ECS post measurement than pre-measurement. The results of propagating a value for the IAC Temp (0.1 K/decade) indicating a low value for ECS are also shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> (right panel). Negative learning does not occur in this case because the prior distribution of ECS is skewed: there is not as much room to maneuver on the low end of ECS values.

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the measured values in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> were returned by the enhanced systems, the shift in the distribution of ECS would be much more dramatic (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). This is the effect of reducing the error uncertainty in the enhanced measurements. There is no negative learning in this case, yet here again the results would baffle an analyst equipped only with the simple error model. Indeed, how could the pink and yellow measurements return the same numbers yet lead to very different conclusions for ECS? The answer is that with reduced error, the yellow measurements pay less heed to the prior information for ECS. The interactions between measurement error and the prior uncertainty in ECS are complex and easily under-appreciated.
