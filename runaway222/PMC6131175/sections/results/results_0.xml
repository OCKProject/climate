 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In CESM-LE, the mean EEIO thermocline depth shows a strong and significant relationship with IOD properties such as amplitude (i.e., standard deviation), skewness, and the mean zonal SST gradient (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). This significant correlation occurs for both the present-day (blue circles) and future simulations (red circles). When the climatological thermocline is deeper, IOD amplitude tends to be stronger (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) and its skewness is more positive (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>), resulting in a strong positive correlation. The mean depth of the thermocline influences IOD amplitude and skewness through the positive Bjerknes feedback which involves the SST response to the thermocline anomalies, the wind response to SSTAs, and the thermocline response to wind anomalies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. During a positive IOD, the thermocline in the EEIO shoals, bringing cold deep water closer to the surface which reinforces the cold SSTA and the basin-wide zonal temperature gradient. The stronger zonal temperature gradient in turn strengthens the easterly wind anomalies over the central equatorial IO (CEIO; 5°S-5°N, 70°E-90°E), deepening the thermocline in the WEIO whilst shoaling it in the EEIO. Therefore, in simulations where the mean EEIO thermocline is deep, anomalous shoaling of the thermocline is larger and reinforced through the Bjerknes feedback, resulting in a greater IOD amplitude.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Bjerknes feedback also causes positive IOD events to be relatively larger in amplitude than negative IODs (i.e., positive IOD skewness). SSTs respond more strongly to an anomalously shoaling thermocline when the climatological thermocline is deep and hence simulations with a deeper mean thermocline tend to exhibit more positive IOD skewness (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). The IO mean gradient (i.e., the zonal mean SST gradient) displays a significant negative correlation with climatological thermocline depth (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>). A climatologically deeper EEIO thermocline is associated with warmer mean SSTs in the east and therefore the west-minus-east zonal SST gradient tends to be weaker. This behaviour is associated with a stronger (i.e., more westerly) climatological zonal wind along the equator as these winds act to deepen the thermocline in the east, reducing the thermocline slope and thereby weakening the IO mean gradient.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is clear from Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> that the mean thermocline shoals in response to a warmer climate (e.g., compare blue and red circle values on the x-axis). This is due to the projected weakening of the Walker circulation which reduces the climatological westerlies over the CEIO and allows the mean EEIO thermocline to shoal
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. As such, there is a significant difference between the present-day and future IOD skewness and gradient (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b,c</a>; compare values on y-axis). In the future period, the shallower climatological thermocline reduces the response of cold SSTAs to an anomalously shoaling thermocline during a positive event. This weakens the amplitude of positive IODs and thus positive IOD skewness is reduced. Similarly, the shoaling of the climatological thermocline in the east leads to a strengthened (more positive) IO mean gradient as there is little change in mean thermocline depth in the west. In CESM-LE, the response of the EEIO thermocline to increasing greenhouse gases is approximately ten times greater than that over the western IO (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>) and faster (slower) warming over the western (eastern) IO occurs. Previous studies have used the slope (or gradient) of the thermocline across the tropical IO
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>, however in this analysis, we have used EEIO thermocline depth as the IOD is dominated by its eastern pole. Using the climatological thermocline slope does not affect the results considerably (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). Given that the EEIO dominates the IOD, and that the response to increasing greenhouse gases is also largely over the east, we focus on this region. It is clear from Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> that despite the runs being identical in physics and parameterisation, internal climate variability is able to influence the mean state and through this, properties of the IOD.
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spread of IOD properties in the future simulations (e.g., Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, red circles) indicates that internal climate variability is able to generate variations in the IOD’s response to increasing greenhouse gases. This is important for understanding climate projections as future changes may be influenced by internal variability. To highlight the influence of the present-day mean state on projections of IOD properties, we show the relationship between the present-day climatological thermocline depth and the future-minus-present-day change in IOD properties (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). When the present-day climatological thermocline depth is deeper, the change in IOD amplitude tends to be smaller or even negative but overall, the ensemble mean change in amplitude is close to zero (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). This may be caused by the different response of the WEIO and EEIO to a warmer climate with the CESM-LE simulated EEIO (WEIO) SST exhibiting an increase (decrease) in amplitude change

 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A deeper present-day thermocline is associated with a larger change in IOD skewness (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>), with future skewness generally becoming negative whilst present-day skewness is positive (i.e., compare red and blue circles in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). This shows that changes in IOD skewness may arise due to variations in mean thermocline depth and that the deeper the mean present-day thermocline, the larger the change from positive to negative IOD skewness. Simulations with a deep present-day mean thermocline tend to project a larger change in climatological thermocline depth as a deeper thermocline has more ‘room’ to shoal (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). This highlights the importance of the present-day mean state in influencing the response of the tropical IO to a warmer climate. As the climatological thermocline becomes shallower, it becomes more sensitive to anomalous deepening which occurs during a negative IOD event. In contrast the sensitivity to a shoaling thermocline (i.e., a positive IOD) is reduced and therefore IOD skewness becomes more negative in a warmer climate. The change in the IO mean gradient displays a positive correlation with present-day thermocline depth (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>), meaning simulations where the mean depth is deeper tend to have a larger change in the zonal west-minus-east SST gradient. Given that runs with a deeper present-day mean thermocline tend to shoal more in the mean state, this in turn reduces the rate of warming in the EEIO and therefore, the climatological zonal temperature gradient in the future becomes larger (more positive) with the WEIO warming faster than the EEIO.
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparing runs with a climatologically deep thermocline against simulations with a shallow thermocline can provide insight into influence of the mean state on IOD properties and this also highlights their differing response to increasing greenhouse gases. Two smaller ensembles are created to contrast these differences and the simulations in these ensembles are selected based on their deviation from the mean. Runs in the deep ensemble exhibit a present-day climatological thermocline depth greater than one standard deviation from the multi-member ensemble mean (i.e., the right-most blue circles outside of the x-axis error bars in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Similarly, the shallow ensemble is comprised of runs with a present-day mean depth which is less than the ensemble mean minus one standard deviation (i.e., the left-most blue circles outside of the x-axis error bars in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Analysing these two smaller ensembles shows how the positive Bjerknes feedback assists in the present-day mean state. That is, the deep thermocline ensemble exhibits warmer (colder) SSTs in the eastern (western) equatorial IO and the mean zonal wind in the CEIO is more westerly (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,e</a>). The depth of the climatological thermocline along the equator extends further eastward in this ensemble, reaching the coast of Sumatra (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,f</a>). Due to the warmer mean SSTs in the east, precipitation is larger over the EEIO, consistent with the wind and thermocline behaviour.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This mean state with a deeper EEIO thermocline is more favourable for the growth of positive IOD events. When a positive (negative) IOD event occurs, it weakens (strengthens) the mean westerly winds which allows the climatologically warm SSTs in the east to be advected westward (eastward) whilst also shoaling (deepening) the EEIO thermocline. Therefore, a mean state similar to that of the deep ensemble allows positive IODs to grow larger in amplitude as the EEIO thermocline can shoal more when the climatological westerlies are weakened. For the shallow thermocline ensemble, the response during a positive IOD is weaker. Relatively colder mean SSTs in the EEIO and more easterly (or less westerly) mean winds over the CEIO can be observed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>), making it more difficult to generate a strong response during a positive IOD event. The differences between the two ensembles are clearly shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e,f</a>. Using these same runs from the present-day ensembles to compare the future climatology highlights the increased response of models with a deep present-day mean thermocline. In a warmer climate, the deep and shallow ensembles show similar mean SSTs, winds, thermocline, and rainfall (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) as the climatological thermocline in the deep ensemble tends to shoal more in response to increasing greenhouse gases. Given this stronger response and increased similarity between the two ensembles, the deep-minus-shallow ensemble difference is insignificant over most of the tropical IO at the 90% confidence interval (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4e,f</a>, and

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to understand how the mean state of the thermocline influences the components of the positive Bjerknes feedback due to the vital role of the feedback in IOD evolution and growth

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. As mentioned previously, this feedback involves the SSTA response to thermocline depth anomalies, the anomalous wind response to SSTAs, and the thermocline response to wind anomalies. The present-day SSTA response to thermocline depth anomalies (i.e., the thermocline feedback) shows a weak negative correlation with the EEIO mean thermocline depth that is significant at the 90% confidence level (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>). This suggests that simulations with a deeper present-day mean thermocline tend to have a weaker thermocline feedback. In the future period, this relationship strengthens due to the shoaling of the mean thermocline in response to a warmer climate, which increases the sensitivity of SSTs to thermocline depth anomalies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>

  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). However there is a significant positive relationship (99% confidence level) between the thermocline response to zonal wind anomalies and the mean thermocline depth (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>). These positive correlations imply that when the mean thermocline depth is deeper, the anomalous thermocline response to wind anomalies tends to be stronger. For the anomalous wind response to SSTAs, and the anomalous thermocline response to wind anomalies, the multi-member ensemble means show a weakening in the future. In a warmer climate, the stratification of the lower atmosphere increases
