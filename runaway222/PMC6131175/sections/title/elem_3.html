         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) is an ensemble of simulations
            run using a single coupled general circulation model (CGCM), the Community Earth System
            Model (CESM)
            <span><a>29</a></span>. Small differences in round-off level in the atmospheric initial conditions lead
            to each ensemble member having its own unique climate trajectory and therefore, the
            ensemble spread in CESM-LE arises from internal climate variability. CESM involves
            several component models; the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5), the Parallel
            Ocean Program version 2 (POP2), the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4), and the
            Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE). These models are coupled using the version 7 coupler
            (CPL7). The first member of CESM-LE begins at 1850 using initial conditions from a
            randomly selected date in the 1850 control run. Subsequent ensemble members begin
            from 1 January 1920 of ensemble member 1, with member 2 using lagged ocean temperatures.
            Members 3–35 use slightly different initial conditions caused by small round-off differences
            in air temperature. The memory of this small perturbation is typically lost within
            weeks in the atmosphere, after which each member evolves chaotically and through random,
            stochastic processes
            <span><a>29</a></span>. All members of CESM-LE have the same external forcings which follow the CMIP5 design
            protocol
            <span><a>36</a></span>, historical forcings are applied from 1920 to 2005 and representative concentration
            pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) forcing occurs from 2006 to 2100. Further information about CESM-LE
            and its experiment design can be found in Kay 
            <span>et al</span>.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For this analysis, ocean and atmosphere variables from thirty-five simulations are
            utilised. These variables include; SST, thermocline depth (defined as the depth of
            the maximum vertical gradient), zonal wind stress, precipitation, and mean sea level
            pressure. Present-day (Future) data are restricted to the 1920 to 1999 (2020 to 2099)
            period and all variables have been regridded to a 1° by 1° grid. Using a different
            window size (e.g., 1920 to 1969 and 2050 to 2099) or shifting the window location
            (e.g., using periods 1930 to 1979 and 2030 to 2079) does not significantly alter the
            results of this analysis. The IOD is defined by the Dipole Mode Index
            <span><a>1</a></span>, described as area averaged SSTAs in the WEIO (10°S-10°N, 50°E-70°E) minus the EEIO
            (10°S-Eq., 90°E-110°E).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linear correlation and regression are used to identify relationships between IOD properties
            and the mean state of the IO. To examine whether the difference between two smaller
            ensembles is significant, a two-tailed Student’s 
            <span>t</span>-test is used and values greater than the 99% confidence level are considered to be
            significant.
