 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) is an ensemble of simulations run using a single coupled general circulation model (CGCM), the Community Earth System Model (CESM)
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. Small differences in round-off level in the atmospheric initial conditions lead to each ensemble member having its own unique climate trajectory and therefore, the ensemble spread in CESM-LE arises from internal climate variability. CESM involves several component models; the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5), the Parallel Ocean Program version 2 (POP2), the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4), and the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE). These models are coupled using the version 7 coupler (CPL7). The first member of CESM-LE begins at 1850 using initial conditions from a randomly selected date in the 1850 control run. Subsequent ensemble members begin from 1 January 1920 of ensemble member 1, with member 2 using lagged ocean temperatures. Members 3–35 use slightly different initial conditions caused by small round-off differences in air temperature. The memory of this small perturbation is typically lost within weeks in the atmosphere, after which each member evolves chaotically and through random, stochastic processes

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For this analysis, ocean and atmosphere variables from thirty-five simulations are utilised. These variables include; SST, thermocline depth (defined as the depth of the maximum vertical gradient), zonal wind stress, precipitation, and mean sea level pressure. Present-day (Future) data are restricted to the 1920 to 1999 (2020 to 2099) period and all variables have been regridded to a 1° by 1° grid. Using a different window size (e.g., 1920 to 1969 and 2050 to 2099) or shifting the window location (e.g., using periods 1930 to 1979 and 2030 to 2079) does not significantly alter the results of this analysis. The IOD is defined by the Dipole Mode Index
