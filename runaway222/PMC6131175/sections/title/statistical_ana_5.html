      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linear correlation and regression are used to identify relationships between IOD properties
         and the mean state of the IO. To examine whether the difference between two smaller
         ensembles is significant, a two-tailed Studentâ€™s 
         <span>t</span>-test is used and values greater than the 99% confidence level are considered to be
         significant.
