         <p>Future mean state over the tropical Indian Ocean for simulations with a present-day
            deep or shallow thermocline. (
            <span>a</span>) Ensemble mean future climatological SSTs and wind stress from six simulations with
            a deep present-day mean EEIO thermocline (i.e., the same simulations used in Fig. 
            <a>3</a>). (
            <span>b</span>) As in (
            <span>a</span>) but for thermocline depth and precipitation. (
            <span>c</span>,
            <span>d</span>) As in (
            <span>a</span>,
            <span>b</span>) respectively, but for six simulations with a shallow present-day mean EEIO thermocline.
            (
            <span>e</span>) The difference in mean SSTs and wind stress between the two six-member ensembles
            (i.e. (
            <span>a</span>) minus (
            <span>c</span>)). (
            <span>f</span>) As in (
            <span>e</span>) but for thermocline depth and precipitation. Only vectors where either the zonal
            or meridional wind stress difference is significant at the 90% confidence interval
            are shown in (
            <span>e</span>). Only regions where the difference in thermocline is significant at the 90% confidence
            interval are shown in (
            <span>f</span>). The green contours in (
            <span>e</span>) and (
            <span>f</span>) represent regions where the SST and precipitation difference is significant at the
            90% confidence level, respectively. Fig. 
            <a>S3</a> shows the difference without significance highlighted.
