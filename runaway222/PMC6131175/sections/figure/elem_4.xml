  <p>Relationship between thermocline depth and components of the Bjerknes feedback. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Present-day (blue circles) and future (red circles) SON relationship between mean EEIO thermocline depth (ZT) and the SST response to thermocline depth. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>,
   <span class="bold">c</span>) as in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) but for the zonal wind stress response to SST and the thermocline response to zonal wind stress, respectively. SST and ZT are averaged over the EEIO region. The zonal wind stress has been averaged over the central equatorial Indian Ocean (CEIO). The diagonal black lines represent the line of best fit and the error bars indicate 1 standard deviation from the multi-member ensemble mean.
