            EEIO thermocline depth (ZT) and the SST response to thermocline depth. (

            <span>a</span>) but for the zonal wind stress response to SST and the thermocline response to zonal
            wind stress, respectively. SST and ZT are averaged over the EEIO region. The zonal
            wind stress has been averaged over the central equatorial Indian Ocean (CEIO). The
            diagonal black lines represent the line of best fit and the error bars indicate 1
            standard deviation from the multi-member ensemble mean.
