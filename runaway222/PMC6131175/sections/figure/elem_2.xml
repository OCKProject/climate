  <p>Present-day mean state over the tropical Indian Ocean for simulations with a deep or shallow thermocline. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Ensemble mean present-day climatological SSTs and wind stress from six simulations with a deep mean EEIO thermocline. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) As in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) but for thermocline depth and precipitation. (
   <span class="bold">c</span>,
   <span class="bold">d</span>) As in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>,
   <span class="bold">b</span>) respectively, but for six simulations with a shallow mean EEIO thermocline. (
   <span class="bold">e</span>) The difference in mean SSTs and wind stress between the two six-member ensembles (i.e. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) minus (
   <span class="bold">c</span>)). (
   <span class="bold">f</span>) As in (
   <span class="bold">e</span>) but for thermocline depth and precipitation. Only vectors where either the zonal or meridional wind stress difference is significant at the 99% confidence interval are shown in (
   <span class="bold">e</span>). Only regions where the difference in thermocline is significant at the 99% confidence interval are shown in (
   <span class="bold">f</span>). The green contours in (
   <span class="bold">e</span>) and (
   <span class="bold">f</span>) represent regions where the SST and precipitation difference is significant at the 99% confidence level, respectively.
