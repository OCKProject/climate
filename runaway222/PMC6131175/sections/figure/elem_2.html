         <p>Present-day mean state over the tropical Indian Ocean for simulations with a deep
            or shallow thermocline. (
            <span>a</span>) Ensemble mean present-day climatological SSTs and wind stress from six simulations
            with a deep mean EEIO thermocline. (
            <span>b</span>) As in (
            <span>a</span>) but for thermocline depth and precipitation. (
            <span>c</span>,
            <span>d</span>) As in (
            <span>a</span>,
            <span>b</span>) respectively, but for six simulations with a shallow mean EEIO thermocline. (
            <span>e</span>) The difference in mean SSTs and wind stress between the two six-member ensembles
            (i.e. (
            <span>a</span>) minus (
            <span>c</span>)). (

            or meridional wind stress difference is significant at the 99% confidence interval
            are shown in (
            <span>e</span>). Only regions where the difference in thermocline is significant at the 99% confidence
            interval are shown in (

            <span>e</span>) and (
            <span>f</span>) represent regions where the SST and precipitation difference is significant at the
            99% confidence level, respectively.
