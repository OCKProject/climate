   <span class="italic">δ</span> and 
   <span class="italic">ρ</span> were assigned to the human-environment systems climate, fisheries and farming agriculture according to the timescale of the average time spent in one state (see Methods). For farming, a risky policy is likely to be optimal but neither sustainable nor safe. The parameter uncertainty of the other parameters does not allow a clear statement in which parameter regime fisheries are likely to fall. The climate system may lie at the edge of the sweet spot, where all paradigms yield the cautious policy. However, for smaller collapse probability 
   <span class="italic">δ</span> optimization is more likely to yield the risky policy, which becomes also neither sustainable nor safe at this point. This suggests the use of other paradigms for climate policy making
