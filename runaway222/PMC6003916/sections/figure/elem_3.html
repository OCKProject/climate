         <p>Ratios of parameter space volumes for all eight paradigms combination. All parameters
            (
            <span>δ</span>, 
            <span>ρ</span>, 
            <span>γ</span>, 
            <span>r</span><sub>l</sub>/
            <span>r</span><sub>h</sub>, 
            <span>r</span><sub>min</sub>/
            <span>r</span><sub>h</sub>) were chosen linearly between 0 and 1 for both the risky and the cautious policy.
            As a direct consequence of our definitions of the safe operating space paradigm and
            the cautious and risky policy, all paradigm combinations which are safe correspond
            to the use of the cautious policy, in all others the risky policy was applied. A random
            decision making agent within a random tipping element will most likely end up with
            a policy that is neither optimal, neither sustainable nor safe, followed by the parameter
            sweet spot regime where the policy is simultaneously optimal, sustainable and safe.
            Interestingly, the third likeliest option is a parameter regime which is optimal,
            but neither sustainable nor safe
