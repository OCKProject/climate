         <p>Conceptual model of a human-environment tipping element. 
            <span>a</span> Agent-environment interface: based on the state information and received reward,
            the agent chooses an action 
            <span>a</span> from its actions set to gain rewards. 
            <span>b</span> The transition graph gives state transition probabilities and corresponding rewards
            for all triples of state 
            <span>s</span>, action 
            <span>a</span>, next state 
            <span>s</span>′, i.e., in state 
            <span>s</span> the agent takes action 
            <span>a</span> and moves to state 
            <span>s</span>′.
