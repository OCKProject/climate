As a direct consequence of our definitions of the safe operating space paradigm and the cautious and risky policy, all paradigm combinations which are safe correspond to the use of the cautious policy, in all others the risky policy was applied. A random decision making agent within a random tipping element will most likely end up with a policy that is neither optimal, neither sustainable nor safe, followed by the parameter sweet spot regime where the policy is simultaneously optimal, sustainable and safe. Interestingly, the third likeliest option is a parameter regime which is optimal, but neither sustainable nor safe
