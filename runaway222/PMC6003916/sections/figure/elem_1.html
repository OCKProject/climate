         <p>Classification of the risky and cautious policy according to the three policy paradigms:
            
            <span>a</span> optimization, 
            <span>b</span> sustainability, and 
            <span>c</span> safe operating space in the model parameter space (shown here as collapse probability
            
            <span>δ</span> vs. discount factor 
            <span>γ</span>); remaining parameters were chosen as 
            <span>ρ</span> = 0.2, 
            <span>r</span><sub>l</sub>/
            <span>r</span><sub>h</sub> = 0.5, 
            <span>r</span><sub>min</sub>/
            <span>r</span><sub>h</sub> = 0.3 for illustration purposes. Colored regions result from analytically derived
            equations (see Methods). Depending on the parameter region, both risky and cautious
            policy can be optimal and sustainable. Only the cautious policy is safe
