            <span><a>45</a>,
               <a>46</a></span>, in which an agent makes decisions about how to interact with its environment (Fig. 
            <a>1a</a>). Our particular environment can reside in either a prosperous state, which provides
            immediate rewards (also called payoffs) to the agent, or a degraded state, from which
            the agent receives no payoff. At each time step, the agent chooses between two actions
            
            <span>a</span>, exerting either a high or low pressure on the environment. Depending on the current
            state 
            <span>s</span>, the current action 
            <span>a</span> and the subsequent state 
            <span>s′</span>, the agent receives an immediate reward 
            <span>r</span> (Fig. 
            <a>1b</a>). At the prosperous state, taking the low pressure action the agent is guaranteed
            to receive reward 
            <span>r</span><sub>l</sub> and remain at the prosperous state. However, taking the high pressure action, the
            agent may receive reward 
            <span>r</span><sub>h</sub> (which is typically larger than 
            <span>r</span><sub>l</sub>), but risks triggering a collapse of the environment to the degraded system state
            with non-zero probability 
            <span>δ</span> and no immediate reward at all. From there, only the low pressure action opens the
            option to recover to the prosperous state with non-zero probability

            amount of carbon to the atmosphere yielding a reward of high, short-term economic
            output as long as the system has not tipped. The low pressure action resembles emitting
            a reduced amount of carbon, assuming a lower short-term economic output for the guarantee
            to not trigger climate tipping elements into a disastrous state.

            examined paradigms (optimization, sustainability, safe operating space). This yields
            a classification of policies into eight different categories (Fig.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In particular, optimal policies are not necessarily sustainable (opt and not sus:
            Fig. 
            <a>3</a>, red and yellow). This is the case if the normative value threshold 
            <span>r</span><sub>min</sub> is too large. The cautious policy does not return enough value to be sustainable
            (
            <span>r</span><sub>l</sub> &lt; 
            <span>r</span><sub>min</sub>, yellow) and the risky policy at the degraded state produces too little future reward
            to be sustainable, due to the low chance of recovery and lack of farsightedness.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nor are optimal policies necessarily safe (opt and not safe: Fig. 
            <a>3</a>, red and purple). This occurs in parameter regions where the risky policy is optimal.
            The risky policy cannot be safe because of the risk of collapse to the degraded state.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A safe policy does not necessarily imply a sustainable policy either (safe and not
            sus: Fig. 
            <a>3</a>, green and yellow). When the normative threshold value for sustainability 
            <span>r</span><sub>min</sub> exceeds the reward from a low pressure action 
            <span>r</span><sub>l</sub>: 
            <span>r</span><sub>min</sub> &gt; 
            <span>r</span><sub>l</sub>, then the cautious policy is safe but not sustainable. Following a similar line of
            argument, the SOS concept
            <span><a>37</a></span> has been extended to a Safe And Just Operating Space (SAJOS) which additionally accounts
            for social indicators
            <span><a>51</a></span>, such as the number of people living in extreme poverty. Thus, SAJOS policies can
            be interpreted as the overlap of safe with sustainable policies. Within our model,
            we can give a definite criterion for when this form of SAJOS exists: as long as the
            reward from a low pressure action 
            <span>r</span><sub>l</sub> exceeds the normative threshold value 
            <span>r</span><sub>min</sub> (
            <span>r</span><sub>l</sub> &gt; 
            <span>r</span><sub>min</sub>), the cautious policy is both safe and sustainable (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>, cyan and gray).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, there exist also sustainable policies outside the SOS (sus and not safe:
            Fig. 
            <a>3</a>, blue and purple.) These are risky policies (hence, not safe) with simultaneously
            high farsightedness 
            <span>γ</span> and low collapse probability 
            <span>δ</span>. At those parameter regions the degraded state is still evaluated as acceptable due
            to sufficient anticipated future rewards and therefore the risky policy is sustainable.
            The circumstance that parameter regimes exist that are sustainable but not safe and
            vice versa clearly stems from our definition of sustainability which resembles a form
            of weak sustainability
            <span><a>48</a></span>. By doing so we can conceptually separate issues of environmentally safe and socially
            just without compromising the target of a safe and just parameter space regime.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that this classification into the eight different policy paradigm combinations
            also applies to the case of absolute farsightedness (

                     As a direct consequence of our definitions of the safe operating space paradigm and
                     the cautious and risky policy, all paradigm combinations which are safe correspond
                     to the use of the cautious policy, in all others the risky policy was applied. A random
                     decision making agent within a random tipping element will most likely end up with
                     a policy that is neither optimal, neither sustainable nor safe, followed by the parameter
                     sweet spot regime where the policy is simultaneously optimal, sustainable and safe.
                     Interestingly, the third likeliest option is a parameter regime which is optimal,

            sustainable nor safe followed by the parameter sweet spot regime in which all paradigms
            yield the cautious policy as optimal, sustainable and safe. Together they constitute
            a parameter space volume of approx. 45% in which the three paradigms of economic optimization,
            sustainability and safe operating space align with each other in yielding the same
            policy. Interestingly, the third likeliest option is the paradigm combination in which
            the risky policy is optimal but neither sustainable nor safe. This is the most likeliest
            parameter regime among those where the paradigms yield different policies. Thus, blindly
            applying economic optimization in a our stylized tipping element has a significant
            chance of leading to policies that are neither sustainable nor safe.

                     according to the timescale of the average time spent in one state (see Methods). For
                     farming, a risky policy is likely to be optimal but neither sustainable nor safe.
                     The parameter uncertainty of the other parameters does not allow a clear statement
                     in which parameter regime fisheries are likely to fall. The climate system may lie
                     at the edge of the sweet spot, where all paradigms yield the cautious policy. However,
                     for smaller collapse probability

            policy as the advisable way of governing the climate system. However, if the collapse
            probability per time step is smaller (collapse time scale near 50 years and larger)
            the situation is different. Here, an SOS and a sustainable paradigm would still yield
            the cautious policy (Fig. 
            <a>5</a>, cyan), but an optimization paradigm is likely to give the risky policy (Fig. 
            <a>5</a>, red), which at this point is neither sustainable nor safe. We conclude that in climate
            policy, economic welfare optimization alone may neither be sustainable nor safe.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For fishery systems, both transition probabilities certainly depend on a variety of
            factors, e.g., fisher’s technical and cultural traits or the dominant fish species
            in the system, as well as external factors such as climate change influencing habitat
            condition
            <span><a>57</a>,
               <a>58</a></span>. The timescale of a fisheries collapse has been shown to lie within decades
            <span><a>59</a></span>. Roughly consistent with observational and modeled data from the Baltic sea, where
            the stable regime of high cod biomass lasted approximately from 1970 to 1990
            <span><a>57</a>,
               <a>60</a></span>, we assume a typical collapse timescale of around 20 years. Concerning the typical
            recovery time scale, successful attempts of fish stocks recovery lasted for decades
            <span><a>61</a></span>, but is estimated to generally exceed this duration
            <span><a>62</a></span>. We therefore assume a larger typical recovery timescale of around 50 years. The
            color gradient in Fig. 
            <a>5</a> at the fisheries point does not clearly single out a paradigms regime, indicating
            the dependence on the other parameters at this point. A risky policy might be economically
            optimal (Fig. 
            <a>5</a>, red), but leads eventually to the collapse of fish stock (c.f
            <span><a>59</a></span>.). At the collapsed and degraded state the conditions for the fishers are not acceptable.
            Therefore they have to leave the system and cannot wait for the fish’s recovery. But
            further investigation is needed to reduce the uncertainty with respect to the other
            parameters.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Last, we look at the case of land degradation by farming in our stylized model. Land
            degradation and restoration is a complex topic with many influencing factors
            <span><a>63</a></span>. Nevertheless, land degradation by farming has been identified as a tipping element
            by Kinzig and others
            <span><a>64</a></span>, where the authors discuss the case of the western Australian wheatbelt with a typical
            collapse timescale of about 100 years. Soil recovery is estimated to take place within
            20 to 1000 years
            <span><a>65</a></span>, which is roughly consistent to Kitzing et al., where the duration to reach equilibrium
            again is estimated with up to 300 years. We therefore assume a typical recovery timescale
            of about 300 years. In contrast to climate and fisheries, the transition probabilities
            we associated with the process of land degradation by farming suggest, that here an
            optimality paradigm is very likely to yield the risky policy which is neither sustainable
            nor safe despite considerate parameter uncertainty (red area in Fig. 
            <a>5</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taken together, it is interesting to see that in particular the climate system may
            reside at the edge of the parameter regime where economic welfare optimization becomes
            neither sustainable nor safe (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>). For land degradation by farming, our assessment suggests that an optimal policy
            is likely to yield a non-sustainable and non-safe policy whereas for fisheries the
            situation is less clear.
