      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We classify policies according to whether they are economic welfare optimal or not,
         sustainable or not, and safe or not. For the sake of simplicity we focus on two deterministic
         policies, distinguishing whether the agent should apply the low or the high pressure
         action at the prosperous state (Fig. 
         <a>1c</a>): the risky policy (
         <span>π</span><sub><span>r</span></sub>(
         <span>p</span>) = 
         <span>h</span>, 
         <span>π</span><sub><span>r</span></sub>(
         <span>d</span>) = 
         <span>l</span>), applying the high pressure action at the prosperous state and the low pressure
         one at the degraded state and the cautious policy (
         <span>π</span><sub><span>c</span></sub>(
         <span>p</span>) = 
         <span>l</span>, 
         <span>π</span><sub><span>c</span></sub>(
         <span>d</span>) = 
         <span>l</span>), applying the low pressure action at the prosperous, as well as the degraded state.

         a policy. Second, a sustainable policy should sustain the ability to meet the needs

         the definition of the safe operating space states constitutes a normative judgment
         about the risk the decision maker is willing to tolerate. In the subsequent analyses

         all three rewards come in arbitrary units, the policy classification only depends
         on their ratios.
