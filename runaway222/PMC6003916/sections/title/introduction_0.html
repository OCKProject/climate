      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Sustainable Development Goals
         <span><a>1</a></span> and the Paris climate agreement set the target of prosperous development for people
         and our planet. Yet, it remains challenging to translate these aims into concrete
         policy implementations, accounting for non-linearities, such as tipping elements
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>3</a></span>, regime shifts
         <span><a>4</a>,
            <a>5</a></span>, and multi-stabilities
         <span><a>6</a></span>, as well as multiple kinds of uncertainties
         <span><a>7</a>–
            <a>9</a></span>, and extreme events
         <span><a>10</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To support the decision making processes in these contexts, we ask the question how
         the three prominent decision making paradigms of economic welfare optimization, sustainability
         and safe operating space compare with each other. Specifically, we investigate the
         parameter regimes for synergies and trade-offs when applying these paradigms to the
         management of tipping elements
         <span><a>11</a></span> and how these findings relate to the three real-world systems of climate, fisheries
         and farming.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Optimization approaches have emerged as the primary guiding principle to derive a
         policy strategy for environmental governance
         <span><a>12</a>,
            <a>13</a></span>. Most often, the present value of macroeconomic social welfare, i.e., the sum of
         discounted future benefits minus costs, is the target to be optimized. Such optimization
         approaches have been criticized regarding the discount rates used, delivering short
         term gains at the expense of long-term environmental degradation
         <span><a>14</a>,
            <a>15</a></span>. Further criticism targets the lack of a systems perspective required to understand
         the structural landscape of model dynamics, as well as the assumptions made due to
         imperfect information
         <span><a>6</a>,
            <a>9</a>,
            <a>10</a></span>. This critique is partly dealt with in optimization variants, such as robust
         <span><a>7</a>,
            <a>16</a></span> or viable
         <span><a>17</a>–
            <a>19</a></span> control, which are dealing with multiple types of uncertainty
         <span><a>20</a></span>. Naturally, other or multiple objectives
         <span><a>21</a></span> and criteria
         <span><a>22</a>,
            <a>23</a></span> with possible constraints
         <span><a>24</a></span> can be optimized as well. In this work, we use the term solely in the narrow economic
         sense of maximizing the present value as defined in Eq. 
         <a>1</a> below.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recognition of increasing environmental and social threats
         <span><a>25</a></span> the policy paradigm of sustainability has emerged in the scientific and political
         discourse
         <span><a>26</a>,
            <a>27</a></span>. The economics of sustainability has brought up many definitions of sustainability
         alone
         <span><a>28</a>–
            <a>31</a></span>. In these analyses sustainability is usually imposed as a constraint within an economic
         welfare optimization paradigm. Trade-offs to economic welfare optimization are well
         known
         <span><a>28</a>,
            <a>32</a></span>. However, these classic social welfare optimization approaches are challenged through
         the increasing recognition of non-linearities, such as tipping points, regime shifts,
         uncertainties and the risk of catastrophic outcomes
         <span><a>6</a>,
            <a>9</a></span>. Taking up these challenges, e.g., non-convexities
         <span><a>33</a></span> and climate tipping elements
         <span><a>34</a>,
            <a>35</a></span> have been studied within an economic framework. Here, we derive our formal definition
         of sustainability from the Brundtland report
         <span><a>26</a></span>. Its design is deliberately simple and targeted to the mathematical framework we
         use (see below). We do not intend our definition to be applicable to a general model
         of a welfare economy
         <span><a>12</a>,
            <a>27</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent advances in sustainability science have brought forth tolerable windows
         <span><a>36</a></span> or safe operating spaces
         <span><a>37</a>,
            <a>38</a></span> as a policy paradigm to derive concrete actions from
         <span><a>39</a></span>. These concepts originate from resilience thinking
         <span><a>40</a></span> and a precautionary principle
         <span><a>41</a></span> to deal with potential dangerous tipping elements in the environmental governance
         system. Trade-offs but also synergies with optimization thinking have been therefore
         discussed
         <span><a>42</a></span>. Also formal analyses studying relations between resilience as a system property
         and sustainability were conducted
         <span><a>43</a>,
            <a>44</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the reciprocal relationships between these three paradigms of economic optimization,
         sustainability and safe operating space is still insufficiently explored. Such an
         understanding is important in order to judge, for example, when economic optimization
         is, or is not, an appropriate policy goal. Also, guidance is required when a sustainability
         paradigm may conflict with a safe operating space paradigm and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we report progress towards a better understanding of the mutual relationships
         between these three paradigms of economic optimization, sustainability and safe operating
         space by applying them to a stylized model of a human-environment tipping element.
         We do so because of the increasing importance of tipping points and regime shifts
         in environmental governance. Our model is deliberately stylized, thereby applicable
         across multiple cases and scales, to gain a deeper understanding more complex models
         might miss. The formal definitions of the three paradigms are designed to fit our
         mathematical framework (see below). Since we do not focus on intragenerational justice
         in this article, one agent suffices as a decision making subject, in contrast to a
         multiagent setting. We find that there exists no master paradigm between the three
         examined, i.e., a policy can be any combination of optimal or not, sustainable or
         not and safe or not. This is of special relevance to the climate system which may
         reside at the edge in the parameter regime where economic welfare optimization becomes
         neither sustainable nor safe. This suggests the use of more advanced paradigms to
         support decision making in climate policy.
