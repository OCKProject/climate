 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above policy classification offers valuable insights for the governance of real-world human-environment systems. We discuss how our analysis relates to the cases of the climate system, fisheries and farming. Our purpose is to gain a qualitative understanding how our model relates to important real-world challenges of environmental governance, not a detailed assessment of the latter. Therefore, we roughly estimate the respective collapse and recovery probabilities per time step 
  <span class="italic">δ</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ρ</span> of our model via the typical timescales on which these systems remain in one state or the other (see Methods). Additionally, we added a parameter sensitivity analysis by visualizing the likelihood of ending up in a certain parameter regime by color gradients between regimes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>).

     <span class="italic">ρ</span> were assigned to the human-environment systems climate, fisheries and farming agriculture according to the timescale of the average time spent in one state (see Methods). For farming, a risky policy is likely to be optimal but neither sustainable nor safe. The parameter uncertainty of the other parameters does not allow a clear statement in which parameter regime fisheries are likely to fall. The climate system may lie at the edge of the sweet spot, where all paradigms yield the cautious policy. However, for smaller collapse probability 
     <span class="italic">δ</span> optimization is more likely to yield the risky policy, which becomes also neither sustainable nor safe at this point. This suggests the use of other paradigms for climate policy making

 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the climate system, we acknowledge that several interacting tipping elements contribute to the system’s behavior
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> and its representation as a single tipping element is a huge simplification on its own. Nevertheless, we assume that the current state of the climate system is still comparable to the prosperous one of our model and relevant timescales for triggering a collapse of 30 to 50 years under business-as-usual socio-economic development scenarios
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span>. Regarding the recovery timescale it has been shown that human perturbations of the climate system already changed its trajectory on a multi-millennial timescale
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. Therefore we assume a recovery probability per time step 
  <span class="italic">ρ</span> close to zero (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For sufficiently large collapse probabilities (collapse time scale near 20 years and smaller), the climate system is likely to reside in a parameter sweet spot (gray area), where applying an optimization, sustainability or SOS paradigm results in the cautious policy as the advisable way of governing the climate system. However, if the collapse probability per time step is smaller (collapse time scale near 50 years and larger) the situation is different. Here, an SOS and a sustainable paradigm would still yield the cautious policy (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, cyan), but an optimization paradigm is likely to give the risky policy (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, red), which at this point is neither sustainable nor safe. We conclude that in climate policy, economic welfare optimization alone may neither be sustainable nor safe.

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For fishery systems, both transition probabilities certainly depend on a variety of factors, e.g., fisher’s technical and cultural traits or the dominant fish species in the system, as well as external factors such as climate change influencing habitat condition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>. The timescale of a fisheries collapse has been shown to lie within decades
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. Roughly consistent with observational and modeled data from the Baltic sea, where the stable regime of high cod biomass lasted approximately from 1970 to 1990
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span>, we assume a typical collapse timescale of around 20 years. Concerning the typical recovery time scale, successful attempts of fish stocks recovery lasted for decades
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span>, but is estimated to generally exceed this duration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span>. We therefore assume a larger typical recovery timescale of around 50 years. The color gradient in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> at the fisheries point does not clearly single out a paradigms regime, indicating the dependence on the other parameters at this point. A risky policy might be economically optimal (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, red), but leads eventually to the collapse of fish stock (c.f
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>.). At the collapsed and degraded state the conditions for the fishers are not acceptable. Therefore they have to leave the system and cannot wait for the fish’s recovery. But further investigation is needed to reduce the uncertainty with respect to the other parameters.

 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Last, we look at the case of land degradation by farming in our stylized model. Land degradation and restoration is a complex topic with many influencing factors
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span>. Nevertheless, land degradation by farming has been identified as a tipping element by Kinzig and others
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span>, where the authors discuss the case of the western Australian wheatbelt with a typical collapse timescale of about 100 years. Soil recovery is estimated to take place within 20 to 1000 years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span>, which is roughly consistent to Kitzing et al., where the duration to reach equilibrium again is estimated with up to 300 years. We therefore assume a typical recovery timescale of about 300 years. In contrast to climate and fisheries, the transition probabilities we associated with the process of land degradation by farming suggest, that here an optimality paradigm is very likely to yield the risky policy which is neither sustainable nor safe despite considerate parameter uncertainty (red area in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taken together, it is interesting to see that in particular the climate system may reside at the edge of the parameter regime where economic welfare optimization becomes neither sustainable nor safe (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). For land degradation by farming, our assessment suggests that an optimal policy is likely to yield a non-sustainable and non-safe policy whereas for fisheries the situation is less clear.
