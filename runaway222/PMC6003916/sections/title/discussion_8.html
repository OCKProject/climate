      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, our results show that there exists no master paradigm among the three examined
         in our model of environmental governance of a stylized tipping element. Policies can
         be classified by any combination of optimal, sustainable and safe. A master paradigm,
         in contrast, would guarantee fulfilling requirements imposed by other paradigms. Consequently,
         the selection of appropriate policy paradigms, especially in more complex settings
         and models, can be critical for effective environmental governance.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Specifically, our results show theoretically, as well as empirically that economic
         welfare optimization for managing tipping elements may be neither sustainable nor
         safe. For example, the volume of the corresponding paradigm combination in parameter
         space is the largest among those in which the three paradigms actually yield different
         policies. This suggests the conclusion that the mere structure of a tipping element
         causes a comparable high chance of obtaining a policy that is neither sustainable
         nor safe when blindly following an optimization paradigm. On the other hand, our model
         also indicates parameter regimes where economic optimization can safely and sustainably
         be used.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We derived simple heuristics to anticipate when a policy is economic welfare optimal,
         sustainable and safe. A risky policy may be optimal when the probability of collapse
         and/or the farsightedness are sufficiently small. It may be sustainable when the probability
         of a collapse is sufficiently small but the farsightedness is sufficiently large.
         However, it cannot be safe. A cautious policy may be optimal when the collapse probability
         and/or the farsightedness are sufficiently large. It is sustainable if its immediate
         reward exceeds the normatively chosen minimum acceptable reward and it is always safe.
         The absence of a master paradigm is of special relevance for governing the climate
         system, since the latter may reside at the edge between parameter regimes where economic
         welfare optimization becomes neither sustainable nor safe.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extensions are possible in many directions. Constrained optimization
         <span><a>24</a></span> is a straight-forward way to combine the paradigms examined. Policy makers could
         aim for the maximum economic welfare delivering a policy that is safe and sustainable,
         or least-cost safe target strategies
         <span><a>15</a></span>. This is certainly a better approach than relying on economic welfare optimization
         alone for model-based policy advice. Examples of models for policy advice certainly
         include integrated assessment models or the use of the maximum sustainable yield in
         fisheries management. However, one might not desire to obtain the welfare optimal
         safe and sustainable policy but e.g., the most resilient one, which calls for an operationalization
         of modern social-ecological resilience concepts
         <span><a>66</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The application of our model to real-world systems in this article is of qualitative,
         illustrative nature. A more detailed analysis of real world tipping elements in which
         typical transition probabilities might be estimated from empirical time series could
         be a way forward to systematize and draw lessons from the multitude of human-environmental
         tipping elements
         <span><a>67</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Applying our analyses to larger, more complex Markov decision processes would be a
         way to extend the understanding of the relationships between the paradigms examined.
         Moreover, it may be desirable to include further policy paradigms into the analyses,
         e.g., aiming for a large option space of future decision makers
         <span><a>30</a>,
            <a>68</a></span>. Based on such analyses, policy makers could make better informed decisions on how
         to translate the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris climate agreement into
         concrete policy implementations.
