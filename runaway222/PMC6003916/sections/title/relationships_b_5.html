      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that policies can be classified along all logical combinations of the three
         examined paradigms (optimization, sustainability, safe operating space). This yields
         a classification of policies into eight different categories (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>).

               <p>Paradigms classification for risky and cautious policy. There exist policies in parameter
                  space of our model for all logical combinations of paradigm classifications. 
                  <span>a</span> i.e. a policy can be any combination of (not) optimal, (not) sustainable and (not)
                  safe. Remaining parameters where chosen as 
                  <span>ρ</span> = 0.2, 
                  <span>r</span><sub>l</sub>/
                  <span>r</span><sub>h</sub> = 0.5 for illustration purposes (c.f. Methods). For a sufficiently low normative
                  threshold value 
                  <span>r</span><sub>min</sub> ≤ 
                  <span>r</span><sub>l</sub> (here 
                  <span>r</span><sub>min</sub>/
                  <span>r</span><sub>h</sub> = 0.3) a Safe And Just Operating Space (SAJOS) exists, which we identified as the
                  overlap of safe and sustainable policies 
                  <span>b</span>, 
                  <span>d</span> (gray and cyan area). For a sufficiently large 
                  <span>r</span><sub>min</sub> &gt; 
                  <span>r</span><sub>l</sub> (here 
                  <span>r</span><sub>min</sub>/
                  <span>r</span><sub>h</sub> = 0.7) a SAJOS does not exist

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In particular, optimal policies are not necessarily sustainable (opt and not sus:
         Fig. 
         <a>3</a>, red and yellow). This is the case if the normative value threshold 
         <span>r</span><sub>min</sub> is too large. The cautious policy does not return enough value to be sustainable
         (
         <span>r</span><sub>l</sub> &lt; 
         <span>r</span><sub>min</sub>, yellow) and the risky policy at the degraded state produces too little future reward
         to be sustainable, due to the low chance of recovery and lack of farsightedness.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nor are optimal policies necessarily safe (opt and not safe: Fig. 
         <a>3</a>, red and purple). This occurs in parameter regions where the risky policy is optimal.
         The risky policy cannot be safe because of the risk of collapse to the degraded state.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A safe policy does not necessarily imply a sustainable policy either (safe and not
         sus: Fig. 
         <a>3</a>, green and yellow). When the normative threshold value for sustainability 
         <span>r</span><sub>min</sub> exceeds the reward from a low pressure action 
         <span>r</span><sub>l</sub>: 
         <span>r</span><sub>min</sub> &gt; 
         <span>r</span><sub>l</sub>, then the cautious policy is safe but not sustainable. Following a similar line of
         argument, the SOS concept
         <span><a>37</a></span> has been extended to a Safe And Just Operating Space (SAJOS) which additionally accounts
         for social indicators
         <span><a>51</a></span>, such as the number of people living in extreme poverty. Thus, SAJOS policies can
         be interpreted as the overlap of safe with sustainable policies. Within our model,
         we can give a definite criterion for when this form of SAJOS exists: as long as the
         reward from a low pressure action 
         <span>r</span><sub>l</sub> exceeds the normative threshold value 
         <span>r</span><sub>min</sub> (
         <span>r</span><sub>l</sub> &gt; 
         <span>r</span><sub>min</sub>), the cautious policy is both safe and sustainable (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>, cyan and gray).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, there exist also sustainable policies outside the SOS (sus and not safe:
         Fig. 
         <a>3</a>, blue and purple.) These are risky policies (hence, not safe) with simultaneously
         high farsightedness 
         <span>γ</span> and low collapse probability 
         <span>δ</span>. At those parameter regions the degraded state is still evaluated as acceptable due
         to sufficient anticipated future rewards and therefore the risky policy is sustainable.
         The circumstance that parameter regimes exist that are sustainable but not safe and
         vice versa clearly stems from our definition of sustainability which resembles a form
         of weak sustainability
         <span><a>48</a></span>. By doing so we can conceptually separate issues of environmentally safe and socially
         just without compromising the target of a safe and just parameter space regime.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that this classification into the eight different policy paradigm combinations
         also applies to the case of absolute farsightedness (
         <span>γ</span> = 1; see the tops of Fig. 
         <a>3b–e</a>). Thus, the trade-offs between the examined paradigms do not vanish, as one might
         presume considering the debate about appropriate discount rates
         <span><a>14</a>,
            <a>52</a></span>.
