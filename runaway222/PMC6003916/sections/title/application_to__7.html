      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above policy classification offers valuable insights for the governance of real-world
         human-environment systems. We discuss how our analysis relates to the cases of the
         climate system, fisheries and farming. Our purpose is to gain a qualitative understanding
         how our model relates to important real-world challenges of environmental governance,
         not a detailed assessment of the latter. Therefore, we roughly estimate the respective
         collapse and recovery probabilities per time step 
         <span>δ</span> and 
         <span>ρ</span> of our model via the typical timescales on which these systems remain in one state
         or the other (see Methods). Additionally, we added a parameter sensitivity analysis
         by visualizing the likelihood of ending up in a certain parameter regime by color
         gradients between regimes (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>).

                  <span>δ</span> versus recovery probability 
                  <span>ρ</span>. Color indicates the paradigms combination similarly as in Fig. 
                  <a>3</a>. Here, additional gradual changes between the color regimes indicate the probability
                  of being in a certain paradigms combinations regime under parameter uncertainty ranges.

                  <span>δ</span> and 
                  <span>ρ</span> were assigned to the human-environment systems climate, fisheries and farming agriculture
                  according to the timescale of the average time spent in one state (see Methods). For
                  farming, a risky policy is likely to be optimal but neither sustainable nor safe.
                  The parameter uncertainty of the other parameters does not allow a clear statement
                  in which parameter regime fisheries are likely to fall. The climate system may lie
                  at the edge of the sweet spot, where all paradigms yield the cautious policy. However,
                  for smaller collapse probability 
                  <span>δ</span> optimization is more likely to yield the risky policy, which becomes also neither
                  sustainable nor safe at this point. This suggests the use of other paradigms for climate
                  policy making

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the climate system, we acknowledge that several interacting tipping elements
         contribute to the system’s behavior
         <span><a>2</a></span> and its representation as a single tipping element is a huge simplification on its
         own. Nevertheless, we assume that the current state of the climate system is still
         comparable to the prosperous one of our model and relevant timescales for triggering
         a collapse of 30 to 50 years under business-as-usual socio-economic development scenarios
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>53</a>,
            <a>54</a></span>. Regarding the recovery timescale it has been shown that human perturbations of the
         climate system already changed its trajectory on a multi-millennial timescale
         <span><a>55</a>,
            <a>56</a></span>. Therefore we assume a recovery probability per time step 
         <span>ρ</span> close to zero (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For sufficiently large collapse probabilities (collapse time scale near 20 years and
         smaller), the climate system is likely to reside in a parameter sweet spot (gray area),
         where applying an optimization, sustainability or SOS paradigm results in the cautious
         policy as the advisable way of governing the climate system. However, if the collapse
         probability per time step is smaller (collapse time scale near 50 years and larger)
         the situation is different. Here, an SOS and a sustainable paradigm would still yield
         the cautious policy (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>, cyan), but an optimization paradigm is likely to give the risky policy (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>, red), which at this point is neither sustainable nor safe. We conclude that in climate
         policy, economic welfare optimization alone may neither be sustainable nor safe.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For fishery systems, both transition probabilities certainly depend on a variety of
         factors, e.g., fisher’s technical and cultural traits or the dominant fish species
         in the system, as well as external factors such as climate change influencing habitat
         condition
         <span><a>57</a>,
            <a>58</a></span>. The timescale of a fisheries collapse has been shown to lie within decades
         <span><a>59</a></span>. Roughly consistent with observational and modeled data from the Baltic sea, where
         the stable regime of high cod biomass lasted approximately from 1970 to 1990
         <span><a>57</a>,
            <a>60</a></span>, we assume a typical collapse timescale of around 20 years. Concerning the typical
         recovery time scale, successful attempts of fish stocks recovery lasted for decades
         <span><a>61</a></span>, but is estimated to generally exceed this duration
         <span><a>62</a></span>. We therefore assume a larger typical recovery timescale of around 50 years. The
         color gradient in Fig. 
         <a>5</a> at the fisheries point does not clearly single out a paradigms regime, indicating
         the dependence on the other parameters at this point. A risky policy might be economically
         optimal (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>, red), but leads eventually to the collapse of fish stock (c.f
         <span><a>59</a></span>.). At the collapsed and degraded state the conditions for the fishers are not acceptable.
         Therefore they have to leave the system and cannot wait for the fish’s recovery. But
         further investigation is needed to reduce the uncertainty with respect to the other
         parameters.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Last, we look at the case of land degradation by farming in our stylized model. Land
         degradation and restoration is a complex topic with many influencing factors
         <span><a>63</a></span>. Nevertheless, land degradation by farming has been identified as a tipping element
         by Kinzig and others
         <span><a>64</a></span>, where the authors discuss the case of the western Australian wheatbelt with a typical
         collapse timescale of about 100 years. Soil recovery is estimated to take place within
         20 to 1000 years
         <span><a>65</a></span>, which is roughly consistent to Kitzing et al., where the duration to reach equilibrium
         again is estimated with up to 300 years. We therefore assume a typical recovery timescale
         of about 300 years. In contrast to climate and fisheries, the transition probabilities
         we associated with the process of land degradation by farming suggest, that here an
         optimality paradigm is very likely to yield the risky policy which is neither sustainable
         nor safe despite considerate parameter uncertainty (red area in Fig. 
         <a>5</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taken together, it is interesting to see that in particular the climate system may
         reside at the edge of the parameter regime where economic welfare optimization becomes
         neither sustainable nor safe (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). For land degradation by farming, our assessment suggests that an optimal policy
         is likely to yield a non-sustainable and non-safe policy whereas for fisheries the
         situation is less clear.
