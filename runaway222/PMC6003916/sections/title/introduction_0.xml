  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To support the decision making processes in these contexts, we ask the question how the three prominent decision making paradigms of economic welfare optimization, sustainability and safe operating space compare with each other. Specifically, we investigate the parameter regimes for synergies and trade-offs when applying these paradigms to the management of tipping elements
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span> and how these findings relate to the three real-world systems of climate, fisheries and farming.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Optimization approaches have emerged as the primary guiding principle to derive a policy strategy for environmental governance
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Most often, the present value of macroeconomic social welfare, i.e., the sum of discounted future benefits minus costs, is the target to be optimized. Such optimization approaches have been criticized regarding the discount rates used, delivering short term gains at the expense of long-term environmental degradation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. Further criticism targets the lack of a systems perspective required to understand the structural landscape of model dynamics, as well as the assumptions made due to imperfect information
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> the policy paradigm of sustainability has emerged in the scientific and political discourse

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. In these analyses sustainability is usually imposed as a constraint within an economic welfare optimization paradigm. Trade-offs to economic welfare optimization are well known

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. However, these classic social welfare optimization approaches are challenged through the increasing recognition of non-linearities, such as tipping points, regime shifts, uncertainties and the risk of catastrophic outcomes

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. Its design is deliberately simple and targeted to the mathematical framework we use (see below). We do not intend our definition to be applicable to a general model of a welfare economy

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span> and a precautionary principle
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span> to deal with potential dangerous tipping elements in the environmental governance system. Trade-offs but also synergies with optimization thinking have been therefore discussed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. Also formal analyses studying relations between resilience as a system property and sustainability were conducted

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the reciprocal relationships between these three paradigms of economic optimization, sustainability and safe operating space is still insufficiently explored. Such an understanding is important in order to judge, for example, when economic optimization is, or is not, an appropriate policy goal. Also, guidance is required when a sustainability paradigm may conflict with a safe operating space paradigm and vice versa.</p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we report progress towards a better understanding of the mutual relationships between these three paradigms of economic optimization, sustainability and safe operating space by applying them to a stylized model of a human-environment tipping element. We do so because of the increasing importance of tipping points and regime shifts in environmental governance. Our model is deliberately stylized, thereby applicable across multiple cases and scales, to gain a deeper understanding more complex models might miss. The formal definitions of the three paradigms are designed to fit our mathematical framework (see below). Since we do not focus on intragenerational justice in this article, one agent suffices as a decision making subject, in contrast to a multiagent setting. We find that there exists no master paradigm between the three examined, i.e., a policy can be any combination of optimal or not, sustainable or not and safe or not. This is of special relevance to the climate system which may reside at the edge in the parameter regime where economic welfare optimization becomes neither sustainable nor safe. This suggests the use of more advanced paradigms to support decision making in climate policy.</p>
