  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In particular, optimal policies are not necessarily sustainable (opt and not sus: Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, red and yellow). This is the case if the normative value threshold 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>min</sub> is too large. The cautious policy does not return enough value to be sustainable (
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>l</sub> &lt; 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>min</sub>, yellow) and the risky policy at the degraded state produces too little future reward to be sustainable, due to the low chance of recovery and lack of farsightedness.
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nor are optimal policies necessarily safe (opt and not safe: Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, red and purple). This occurs in parameter regions where the risky policy is optimal. The risky policy cannot be safe because of the risk of collapse to the degraded state.
  </p>
  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A safe policy does not necessarily imply a sustainable policy either (safe and not sus: Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, green and yellow). When the normative threshold value for sustainability 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>min</sub> exceeds the reward from a low pressure action 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>l</sub>: 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>min</sub> &gt; 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>l</sub>, then the cautious policy is safe but not sustainable. Following a similar line of argument, the SOS concept
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span> has been extended to a Safe And Just Operating Space (SAJOS) which additionally accounts for social indicators
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
   </span>, such as the number of people living in extreme poverty. Thus, SAJOS policies can be interpreted as the overlap of safe with sustainable policies. Within our model, we can give a definite criterion for when this form of SAJOS exists: as long as the reward from a low pressure action 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>l</sub> exceeds the normative threshold value 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>min</sub> (
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>l</sub> &gt; 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>min</sub>), the cautious policy is both safe and sustainable (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, cyan and gray).
  </p>
  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, there exist also sustainable policies outside the SOS (sus and not safe: Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, blue and purple.) These are risky policies (hence, not safe) with simultaneously high farsightedness 
   <span class="italic">γ</span> and low collapse probability 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>. At those parameter regions the degraded state is still evaluated as acceptable due to sufficient anticipated future rewards and therefore the risky policy is sustainable. The circumstance that parameter regimes exist that are sustainable but not safe and vice versa clearly stems from our definition of sustainability which resembles a form of weak sustainability
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
   </span>. By doing so we can conceptually separate issues of environmentally safe and socially just without compromising the target of a safe and just parameter space regime.

  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that this classification into the eight different policy paradigm combinations also applies to the case of absolute farsightedness (

   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b–e</a>). Thus, the trade-offs between the examined paradigms do not vanish, as one might presume considering the debate about appropriate discount rates

As a direct consequence of our definitions of the safe operating space paradigm and the cautious and risky policy, all paradigm combinations which are safe correspond to the use of the cautious policy, in all others the risky policy was applied. A random decision making agent within a random tipping element will most likely end up with a policy that is neither optimal, neither sustainable nor safe, followed by the parameter sweet spot regime where the policy is simultaneously optimal, sustainable and safe. Interestingly, the third likeliest option is a parameter regime which is optimal, but neither sustainable nor safe

  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observe the most likely option to be the regime that is neither optimal, neither sustainable nor safe followed by the parameter sweet spot regime in which all paradigms yield the cautious policy as optimal, sustainable and safe. Together they constitute a parameter space volume of approx. 45% in which the three paradigms of economic optimization, sustainability and safe operating space align with each other in yielding the same policy. Interestingly, the third likeliest option is the paradigm combination in which the risky policy is optimal but neither sustainable nor safe. This is the most likeliest parameter regime among those where the paradigms yield different policies. Thus, blindly applying economic optimization in a our stylized tipping element has a significant chance of leading to policies that are neither sustainable nor safe.</p>
  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, the volume of the safe and just operating space (gray and cyan bars in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) is comparable to the most likeliest (black) regime. Thus, about one out of four random decision making agents interacting with a random tipping element will end up in the safe and just operating space.

We discuss how our analysis relates to the cases of the climate system, fisheries and farming. Our purpose is to gain a qualitative understanding how our model relates to important real-world challenges of environmental governance, not a detailed assessment of the latter. Therefore, we roughly estimate the respective collapse and recovery probabilities per time step 
   <span class="italic">δ</span> and 
   <span class="italic">ρ</span> of our model via the typical timescales on which these systems remain in one state or the other (see Methods).

The parameter uncertainty of the other parameters does not allow a clear statement in which parameter regime fisheries are likely to fall. The climate system may lie at the edge of the sweet spot, where all paradigms yield the cautious policy. However, for smaller collapse probability 
      <span class="italic">δ</span> optimization is more likely to yield the risky policy, which becomes also neither sustainable nor safe at this point. This suggests the use of other paradigms for climate policy making

  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the climate system, we acknowledge that several interacting tipping elements contribute to the system’s behavior

   </span> and its representation as a single tipping element is a huge simplification on its own. Nevertheless, we assume that the current state of the climate system is still comparable to the prosperous one of our model and relevant timescales for triggering a collapse of 30 to 50 years under business-as-usual socio-economic development scenarios

  </p>
  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For sufficiently large collapse probabilities (collapse time scale near 20 years and smaller), the climate system is likely to reside in a parameter sweet spot (gray area), where applying an optimization, sustainability or SOS paradigm results in the cautious policy as the advisable way of governing the climate system. However, if the collapse probability per time step is smaller (collapse time scale near 50 years and larger) the situation is different. Here, an SOS and a sustainable paradigm would still yield the cautious policy (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, cyan), but an optimization paradigm is likely to give the risky policy (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, red), which at this point is neither sustainable nor safe. We conclude that in climate policy, economic welfare optimization alone may neither be sustainable nor safe.

  <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For fishery systems, both transition probabilities certainly depend on a variety of factors, e.g., fisher’s technical and cultural traits or the dominant fish species in the system, as well as external factors such as climate change influencing habitat condition

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
   </span>, we assume a typical collapse timescale of around 20 years. Concerning the typical recovery time scale, successful attempts of fish stocks recovery lasted for decades
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
   </span>, but is estimated to generally exceed this duration
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
   </span>. We therefore assume a larger typical recovery timescale of around 50 years. The color gradient in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> at the fisheries point does not clearly single out a paradigms regime, indicating the dependence on the other parameters at this point. A risky policy might be economically optimal (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, red), but leads eventually to the collapse of fish stock (c.f
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
   </span>.). At the collapsed and degraded state the conditions for the fishers are not acceptable. Therefore they have to leave the system and cannot wait for the fish’s recovery. But further investigation is needed to reduce the uncertainty with respect to the other parameters.

  <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Last, we look at the case of land degradation by farming in our stylized model. Land degradation and restoration is a complex topic with many influencing factors
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
   </span>. Nevertheless, land degradation by farming has been identified as a tipping element by Kinzig and others
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
   </span>, where the authors discuss the case of the western Australian wheatbelt with a typical collapse timescale of about 100 years. Soil recovery is estimated to take place within 20 to 1000 years
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
   </span>, which is roughly consistent to Kitzing et al., where the duration to reach equilibrium again is estimated with up to 300 years. We therefore assume a typical recovery timescale of about 300 years. In contrast to climate and fisheries, the transition probabilities we associated with the process of land degradation by farming suggest, that here an optimality paradigm is very likely to yield the risky policy which is neither sustainable nor safe despite considerate parameter uncertainty (red area in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taken together, it is interesting to see that in particular the climate system may reside at the edge of the parameter regime where economic welfare optimization becomes neither sustainable nor safe (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). For land degradation by farming, our assessment suggests that an optimal policy is likely to yield a non-sustainable and non-safe policy whereas for fisheries the situation is less clear.
