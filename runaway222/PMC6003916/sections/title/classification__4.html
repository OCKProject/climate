         <a>1</a> and 
         <a>2</a> we analytically compute whether the risky and the cautious policy are optimal or
         not, sustainable or not and safe or not depending on the model parameters (

               <p>Classification of the risky and cautious policy according to the three policy paradigms:
                  
                  <span>a</span> optimization, 
                  <span>b</span> sustainability, and 
                  <span>c</span> safe operating space in the model parameter space (shown here as collapse probability
                  
                  <span>δ</span> vs. discount factor 
                  <span>γ</span>); remaining parameters were chosen as 
                  <span>ρ</span> = 0.2, 
                  <span>r</span><sub>l</sub>/
                  <span>r</span><sub>h</sub> = 0.5, 
                  <span>r</span><sub>min</sub>/
                  <span>r</span><sub>h</sub> = 0.3 for illustration purposes. Colored regions result from analytically derived
                  equations (see Methods). Depending on the parameter region, both risky and cautious
                  policy can be optimal and sustainable. Only the cautious policy is safe

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observe that above a certain critical value of the collapse probability δ the cautious
         policy becomes optimal (Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>, pink), despite the smaller immediate reward 
         <span>r</span><sub>l</sub> = 0.5
         <span>r</span><sub>h</sub>. This result confirms previous findings on optimal management with regime shifts
         <span><a>50</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further, we find a decreasing critical collapse probability with increasing farsightedness
         
         <span>γ</span>. Hence, for more farsighted societies the risky policy is optimal only for small
         collapse probabilities δ (orange).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Provided the low pressure reward exceeds the normative minimum acceptable value threshold,
         
         <span>r</span><sub>l</sub> ≥ 
         <span>r</span><sub>min</sub>, then the cautious policy is sustainable for all parameter combinations 
         <span>δ</span>, 
         <span>ρ</span>, 
         <span>γ</span>, 
         <span>r</span><sub>l</sub>/
         <span>r</span><sub>h</sub> (Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>, blue and purple). Only for small collapse probabilities 
         <span>δ</span> and simultaneously high farsightedness 
         <span>γ</span> the risky policy becomes sustainable as well (purple). This is because in this parameter
         region the risky policy is acceptable also at the degraded state (Methods).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cautious policy is a safe policy independently from the parameter combinations
         
         <span>δ</span>, 
         <span>ρ</span>, 
         <span>γ</span>, 
         <span>r</span><sub>l</sub>/
         <span>r</span><sub>h</sub>, 
         <span>r</span><sub>min</sub>/
         <span>r</span><sub>h</sub> (Fig. 
         <a>2c</a>, green). It is important to emphasize that there is no combination of parameters
         at which the risky policy is safe.
