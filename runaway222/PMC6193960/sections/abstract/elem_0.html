      <p>A pressing question is whether biodiversity can buffer ecosystem functioning against
         extreme climate events. However, biodiversity loss is expected to occur due to climate
         change with severe impacts to tropical forests. Using data from a ca. 15 year-old
         tropical planted forest, we construct models based on a bootstrapping procedure to
         measure growth and mortality among different species richness treatments in response
         to extreme climate events. In contrast to higher richness mixtures, in one-species
         plots we find growth is strongly regulated by climate events and we also find increasingly
         higher mortality during a consecutive four year dry event. Based on these results
         together with indicators of loss of resilience, we infer an effect of diversity on
         critical slowing down. Our work generates new methods, concepts, and applications
         for global change ecology and emphasises the need for research in the area of biodiversity-ecosystem
         functioning along environmental stress gradients.
