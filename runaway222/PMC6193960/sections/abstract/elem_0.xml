 <p id="Par1">A pressing question is whether biodiversity can buffer ecosystem functioning against extreme climate events. However, biodiversity loss is expected to occur due to climate change with severe impacts to tropical forests. Using data from a ca. 15 year-old tropical planted forest, we construct models based on a bootstrapping procedure to measure growth and mortality among different species richness treatments in response to extreme climate events. In contrast to higher richness mixtures, in one-species plots we find growth is strongly regulated by climate events and we also find increasingly higher mortality during a consecutive four year dry event. Based on these results together with indicators of loss of resilience, we infer an effect of diversity on critical slowing down. Our work generates new methods, concepts, and applications for global change ecology and emphasises the need for research in the area of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning along environmental stress gradients.</p>
