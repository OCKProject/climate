         <p>Indicators of critical slowing down. (
            <span>a</span>) Temporal autocorrelation at lag-1 of basal area increment time-series averaged over
            plots of the same species richness and (
            <span>b</span>) power spectrum of basal area increment time series averaged over plots of the same
            species richness and SPEI. We find that there is not a clear distinction between different
            species richness treatments and an increase in autocorrelation for dry conditions
            (i.e. increasingly negative SPEI). Monocultures and two-species mixtures have most
            of their variance in the lower frequency spectrum. This variance shifts to the right
            or to higher frequencies as richness increases.
