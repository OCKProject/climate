  <p>Indicators of critical slowing down. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Temporal autocorrelation at lag-1 of basal area increment time-series averaged over plots of the same species richness and (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) power spectrum of basal area increment time series averaged over plots of the same species richness and SPEI. We find that there is not a clear distinction between different species richness treatments and an increase in autocorrelation for dry conditions (i.e. increasingly negative SPEI). Monocultures and two-species mixtures have most of their variance in the lower frequency spectrum. This variance shifts to the right or to higher frequencies as richness increases.
