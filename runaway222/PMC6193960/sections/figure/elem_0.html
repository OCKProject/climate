         <p>Development phase for the even-aged stands at Sardinilla. Two trajectories are shown
            for monocultures (black) and mixtures (red). As plot basal area increases the number
            of trees per hectare decreases over time starting in 2006, and the trajectory moves
            upwards and to the left as it converges to the self-thinning line with slope âˆ’3/2
            (blue dotted line).
