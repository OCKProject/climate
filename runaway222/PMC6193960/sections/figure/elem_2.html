            <span>a</span>) Growth model and (
            <span>b</span>) mortality model. Average effect size (AES) over plots in monoculture, two-species
            mixtures, three-species mixtures, and five-species mixtures through time are shown.
            The error bars correspond to the mean ± the standard deviation for each year. SPEI-12
            for a given year is indicated by the colour of the tick marks on the 
            <span>x</span>-axis: normal is black, moderate wet is grey, moderate dry is coral, extreme wet is
            dark blue, and extreme dry is red. We find a clear distinction between growth and
            mortality between monocultures and higher species richness treatments compared to
            their null expectation which is represented by the honeydew band between [−2.0, 2.0].
