  <p>Development phase for the even-aged stands at Sardinilla. Two trajectories are shown for monocultures (black) and mixtures (red). As plot basal area increases the number of trees per hectare decreases over time starting in 2006, and the trajectory moves upwards and to the left as it converges to the self-thinning line with slope âˆ’3/2 (blue dotted line).</p>
