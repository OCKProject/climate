 <div class="caption">
  <p>(
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Growth model and (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) mortality model. Average effect size (AES) over plots in monoculture, two-species mixtures, three-species mixtures, and five-species mixtures through time are shown. The error bars correspond to the mean ± the standard deviation for each year. SPEI-12 for a given year is indicated by the colour of the tick marks on the 
   <span class="italic">x</span>-axis: normal is black, moderate wet is grey, moderate dry is coral, extreme wet is dark blue, and extreme dry is red. We find a clear distinction between growth and mortality between monocultures and higher species richness treatments compared to their null expectation which is represented by the honeydew band between [−2.0, 2.0].
