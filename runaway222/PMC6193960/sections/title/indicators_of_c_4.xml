 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of SPEI on TAC at lag-1 shows a positive trend as SPEI decreases for all diversity treatments with confidence bands overlapping (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). Consequently, the strongest effect of SPEI on TAC is seen during dry relative to wet years. The power spectrum (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>) indicates that both the monocultures and two-species plots have most of their variance in tree growth at lower frequencies, while the three-species plots have their variance at intermediate frequencies, and the five-species treatments have their variance spread over all frequencies. Furthermore, the monoculture spectrum seems to closely follow the spectrum computed for the SPEI.

We find that there is not a clear distinction between different species richness treatments and an increase in autocorrelation for dry conditions (i.e. increasingly negative SPEI). Monocultures and two-species mixtures have most of their variance in the lower frequency spectrum. This variance shifts to the right or to higher frequencies as richness increases.
