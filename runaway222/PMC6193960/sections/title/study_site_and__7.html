      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our case study is a ca. 15 year-old tropical planted forest in Sardinilla, Central
         Panama (9° 19′N, 79° 38′W) (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). It was established in 2001 as part of a network of tree biodiversity-ecosystem
         functioning (BEF) experiments called TreeDivNet (
         <span>http://www.treedivnet.ugent.be/</span>). A total of 5,566 tree seedlings &lt;6-months old were planted in 24 contiguous 45 m
         by 45 m plots in a pasture of ~5 ha with mean 231.9 ± 8.93 seedlings per plot. Planting
         distances between individuals was 3 m following standard practices of reforestation
         in Panama. The planted forest has a substitutive randomised block design with species
         richness (monoculture, three-species, and six-species) and species combinations randomly
         allocated to allow quantification of biodiversity effects
         <span><a>56</a></span>. Six native tree species are represented based on their range of relative growth
         rates
         <span><a>57</a>–
            <a>59</a></span>. The fastest growing species are 
         <span>Luehea seemanni</span> [Triana &amp; Planch, Tiliaceae] and 
         <span>Cordia alliodora</span> [(Ruiz &amp; Pavon) Oken, Boraginaceae], the intermediate growing species are 
         <span>Anacardium excelsum</span> [(Bertero &amp; Balb. ex Kunth) Skeels, Anacardiaceae] and 
         <span>Hura crepitans</span> [Linné, Euphorbiaceae], and the slow growing species are 
         <span>Cedrela odorata</span> [Liné, Meliaceae] and 
         <span>Tabebuia rosea</span> [(Bertol.) DC, Bignoniaceae]. 
         <span>C. alliodora</span> suffered massive mortality in the monocultures and mixtures probably due to undrained
         and compact soil
         <span><a>60</a></span>. For this reason we do not include 
         <span>C. alliodora</span> in our experiment. Consequently, we make comparisons using the actual diversity.
         At planting, there were 12 monocultures plots (two replicates of each of six species),
         6 three-species plots, and 6 six-species plots. Using actual diversity removing 
         <span>C. alliodora</span>, there are 10 monoculture plots (two replicates of each of five-species), 3 two-species
         plots, 3 three-species plots, and 6 five-species plots. The five-species plots were
         designed to have the same neighbourhoods whereas the two- and three-species plots
         all have different species compositions from each other. Undergrowth was manually
         cleared in the plantation three times per year to avoid competition with herbaceous
         vegetation. Measurements of tree height, diameter at breast height (~1.4 m) or DBH,
         and basal diameter (10 cm from the ground) were made every year at the onset of the
         dry season (end of December, early January) starting in 2001.

                  are shown. The species 
                  <span>Cordia alliodora</span> (Ca), which died in monoculture and in mixture, is excluded from this study and is
                  indicated in red. The five remaining species are: 
                  <span>Anacardium excelsum</span> (Ae), 
                  <span>Cedrela odorata</span> (Co), 
                  <span>Hura crepitans</span> (Hc), 
                  <span>Luehea seemanni</span> (Ls), and 
                  <span>Tabebuia rosea</span> (Tr).
