 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We hypothesized that differences in growth and mortality along a gradient of species richness should manifest mostly during extreme climate events. To test this hypothesis we construct two different null models: a growth model and a mortality model, which represent our null expectation for each diversity treatment if climate is not driving year to year differences in performance. For each null model, we use R statistical software version 3.4.3 (2017-11-30) to generate 1000 boostrap samples for each plot by randomly sampling, with replacement, alive and dead trees with appropriate survival probabilities whilst preserving species identity in a given plot
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span>. For the growth model, the pool is made of basal area increments for each tree in a plot over all years and we select a living tree with a probability of survival calculated for that year. We use a pool of increments from all years as a conservative choice which does not presuppose a relationship between plot-level growth and climate (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). For the mortality model, the pool is made up of the basal area increments for the trees present in a given plot in a given year and we select a tree with a probability of survival which is constant year on year. Edge trees are removed from our analysis with the reasoning that those trees likely do not benefit from any full biodiversity effect. An effect size is computed to compare actual growth and mortality compared to the null expectation based on a probit-transformation of the one-tailed probability 0 &lt;

  </span>. We will thus consider that AES larger than 2.0 units indicates represents a significant effect of climate on growth/mortality at a given diversity level. AES that lie within the above interval are not significantly different from each other. We say that there is a biodiversity effect if differences between monocultures and mixtures manifest.
