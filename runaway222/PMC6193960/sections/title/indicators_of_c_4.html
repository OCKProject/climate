      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of SPEI on TAC at lag-1 shows a positive trend as SPEI decreases for all
         diversity treatments with confidence bands overlapping (Fig. 
         <a>4a</a>). Consequently, the strongest effect of SPEI on TAC is seen during dry relative to
         wet years. The power spectrum (Fig. 
         <a>4b</a>) indicates that both the monocultures and two-species plots have most of their variance
         in tree growth at lower frequencies, while the three-species plots have their variance
         at intermediate frequencies, and the five-species treatments have their variance spread
         over all frequencies. Furthermore, the monoculture spectrum seems to closely follow
         the spectrum computed for the SPEI.

               <p>Indicators of critical slowing down. (
                  <span>a</span>) Temporal autocorrelation at lag-1 of basal area increment time-series averaged over
                  plots of the same species richness and (
                  <span>b</span>) power spectrum of basal area increment time series averaged over plots of the same
                  species richness and SPEI. We find that there is not a clear distinction between different
                  species richness treatments and an increase in autocorrelation for dry conditions
                  (i.e. increasingly negative SPEI). Monocultures and two-species mixtures have most
                  of their variance in the lower frequency spectrum. This variance shifts to the right
                  or to higher frequencies as richness increases.
