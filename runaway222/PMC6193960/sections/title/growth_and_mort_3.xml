 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We built null models of growth and mortality assuming a time-independent distribution which would be the case if extreme climate events were not driving inter-annual variations in growth or mortality at a given diversity level (see Methods). The growth model shows that in 2010, the extremely wet year, monocultures grew significantly better than expected by the null hypothesis (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). In plots with species richness, the effect of the 2010 wet year is less pronounced; three- and five-species mixtures do no better than expected at random. During the drought episodes, which last from 2013 through to 2016, we see that although all mixtures experience a decrease in growth, monocultures experience the largest decrease and five-species mixtures the smallest decrease (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). In the mortality model, we see that the number of dead trees is pushed further from the null expectation for monocultures during the continuous drought period from 2013 to 2016 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). Mixtures show no significant difference from the null expectation in mortality during this period.

     <span class="bold">a</span>) Growth model and (
     <span class="bold">b</span>) mortality model. Average effect size (AES) over plots in monoculture, two-species mixtures, three-species mixtures, and five-species mixtures through time are shown. The error bars correspond to the mean ± the standard deviation for each year. SPEI-12 for a given year is indicated by the colour of the tick marks on the 
     <span class="italic">x</span>-axis: normal is black, moderate wet is grey, moderate dry is coral, extreme wet is dark blue, and extreme dry is red. We find a clear distinction between growth and mortality between monocultures and higher species richness treatments compared to their null expectation which is represented by the honeydew band between [−2.0, 2.0].
