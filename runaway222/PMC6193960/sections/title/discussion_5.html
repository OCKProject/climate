      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the concepts of resistance and resilience as proposed by Pimm
         <span><a>36</a></span> are very general, their expressions may be context dependent. For example, new standardised
         indices of resistance and resilience have been introduced to handle wet-dry cycles
         that are able to determine differences in stability between contrasting soils
         <span><a>48</a></span>. The effect sizes generated by our growth model are very similar to measures of resistance;
         however, our measure is adapted to studying stability in trees because we account
         for the large individual variation by adopting a bootstrapping procedure to compute
         both means and variances. Our results show strong indications of a positive diversity-stability
         relationship through a species richness effect on growth/mortality response to stress.
         This suggests that background variation may be especially relevant when considering
         how stress affects stability of ecosystem functioning in forest ecosystems contributing
         to BEF literature.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taken together, the results from the mortality model, temporal autocorrelation, and
         the power spectrum suggest that monocultures may exhibit greater sensitivity to extreme
         conditions than mixtures. We found that during the successive dry years from 2013
         to 2016 there was increasingly higher mortality in monocultures compared to mixtures,
         which suggests that intraspecific competition is greater than interspecific competition
         during extreme climate events. Furthermore, in monocultures we found an increase in
         temporal autocorrelation as conditions become drier as well as most of its variation
         in tree growth in lower frequencies. These results suggest that the die-off present
         in monocultures may be indicative of slowing down, or a loss of resilience. On the
         other hand, monocultures may simply be mirroring the environment. For example, we
         found that the spectral densities for monocultures closely follow that of the SPEI
         especially during dry years. Our results and methods should facilitate the inference
         of a relationship between diversity and slowing down from experiments with a longer
         time series and with more extreme stresses. For example, massive mortality in some
         tropical forests have be observed for precipitation values less than 1,500 mm ⋅ yr
         <span>−1 </span><span><a>42</a></span>. However, the precipitation at our site was never less than 1,900 mm ⋅ yr
         <span>−1</span>. This suggests that perhaps there exists a threshold at which a distinction in slowing
         down between diversity treatments can be found under more extreme stress.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that monocultures grow less than mixtures during a dry period from 2013 to
         2016, culminating in the period from 2015 and 2016. Furthermore, mixtures experience
         less mortality than monocultures during these dry conditions. Higher growth and lower
         mortality in mixtures compared to monocultures is indicative of insurance effects
         <span><a>45</a></span>. Species complementarity in water uptake strategies is a possible mechanism for stress
         buffering in mixtures
         <span><a>11</a></span>. In fact, a series of studies conducted in Sardinilla between July 2007 and August
         2008 found that complementary water uptake strategies between species was most pronounced
         during the dry season
         <span><a>49</a>–
            <a>51</a></span>. One of these studies
         <span><a>49</a></span> also proposed that one of the deep soil water exploiters, 
         <span>Tabebuia rosea</span>, may facilitate other species through hydraulic redistribution of water resources.
         The stress gradient hypothesis also predicts that per capita changes in species interactions
         under stressful conditions can explain the stress buffering effect of mixtures
         <span><a>33</a></span>. However, we currently have no theory predicting the relative importance of complementarity
         and per capita interactions for stress buffering. Testing such predictions would most
         likely require that empirical BEF studies include the measurement of individual interaction
         strength during stress events
         <span><a>52</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mortality in five-species mixtures is significantly different from mixtures with intermediate
         levels of species richness during the drought period from 2013 to 2016, although both
         experienced less mortality than monocultures. This difference between intermediate
         diversity levels and five-species mixtures suggests that there may be a strong dependence
         of species composition on mortality, which has been demonstrated previously in tropical
         forests
         <span><a>53</a></span>. This explanation seems likely because all the two- and three-species mixtures have
         different compositions while all five-species plots have the same species composition.
         The relative importance of richness and composition could be explored further, for
         example, by considering functional diversity
         <span><a>54</a></span> of traits related to water uptake and soil nutrients and may help to clarify the
         relationship between diversity, mortality, and stability under stress in forests.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As more data becomes available from tree BEF experiments
         <span><a>55</a></span>, we anticipate our work will set a benchmark to determine the impact of climate change
         on planted forests worldwide as our detection procedure is sensitive to the variation
         of individual trees. Furthermore our measure is based on standardised measures enabling
         comparisons of stability between sites in different forest types and climates can
         be made. Our study has shown that species richness buffers growth in response to strong
         drought episodes in agreement with theory on the relationship between abiotic stress,
         complementarity, and per capita interactions. We found that there was higher mortality
         in monocultures than mixtures, which increases when subjected to higher stress intensity.
         By accounting for mortality in the context of stability, we found evidence for slowing
         down in monocultures and posited a diversity-slowing down relationship. More mechanistic
         investigations are required to fully disentangle the relationship between stress and
         BEF. We anticipate that our work will add to the growing literature on BEF across
         environmental stress gradients, which have application across many ecological systems.
