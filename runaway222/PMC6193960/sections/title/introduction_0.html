      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Projections of future climate change include higher mean temperatures, water deficit
         intensity, and more intense El Niño-Southern Oscillation events
         <span><a>1</a></span>. How biological systems will respond to stress due to changes in temperature and
         moisture regimes is therefore paramount
         <span><a>2</a></span>. Forecasting the impact a changing climate will have on forest ecosystems is particularly
         important because they cover 30% of the land surface, support 80% of the world’s terrestrial
         biodiversity, and perform essential ecosystem functions and services such as carbon
         sequestration
         <span><a>3</a>,
            <a>4</a></span>. These impacts may include reduced growth and increases in mortality
         <span><a>5</a></span>. Several recent studies in forests have investigated the stability of ecosystem functioning,
         such as growth or productivity, in response to drought
         <span><a>6</a>–
            <a>13</a></span> and suggest that there may be a positive link to diversity.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we define stability as the ability of a community to defy change (i.e. resistance
         and resilience)
         <span><a>14</a></span>. The basis for positive diversity-stability relationships is the insurance hypothesis.
         First proposed by
         <span><a>15</a></span> and refined by
         <span><a>16</a>–
            <a>19</a></span>, the insurance hypothesis posits that species richness can act as a buffer against
         fluctuations in the environment. A key mechanism underlying insurance is species asynchrony,
         i.e. that species may independently have different responses to similar environmental
         conditions
         <span><a>20</a></span>. How these species respond to environmental conditions may be driven by biological
         traits
         <span><a>21</a></span> as well as demography
         <span><a>22</a></span>. Furthermore, there may be more relevant aspects of diversity from which to discern
         diversity-stability relationships
         <span><a>23</a></span>. In a recent study
         <span><a>24</a></span>, the authors found empirical evidence for decreased stability in certain functions
         from an analysis of species abundances in five different functional groups (i.e. decomposition,
         carbon sequestration, pollination, pest control, and cultural values) which they posit
         is due to a weakened insurance capacity. They claim that there is a higher risk of
         failure in these functions under future environmental perturbations, although they
         do not consider perturbations of higher frequency and magnitude. Incidentally, stress,
         defined as extreme environmental conditions which are detrimental to ecosystem functioning
         <span><a>25</a></span>, is largely ignored, both empirically and theoretically, in biodiversity-ecosystem
         functioning (BEF) research
         <span><a>25</a>,
            <a>26</a></span> although there are exceptions
         <span><a>27</a>–
            <a>32</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multiple mechanisms may drive BEF relationships during stressful events
         <span><a>33</a></span>. Niche complementarity predicts that heterogenous environments lead to higher mortality
         in monocultures than in mixtures because resources are used more efficiently in mixtures
         than in monocultures thus mediating the community-level response to stress intensity
         <span><a>34</a></span>. Complementary effects can also come from changes in the functional contribution
         of facilitative interactions among species. However, a stressful environment can also
         change the strength of per capita species interactions. Specifically, it is posited
         that the performance of more diverse communities improves relative to that of low
         diversity communities in stressful environments because of the emergence of interspecific
         facilitative interactions among individuals
         <span><a>35</a></span>. Both species-specific (complementarity) and per capita (stress gradient hypothesis)
         mechanisms suggest a stronger impact of stress events on monocultures than on mixture
         communities.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Detection of community-level stress response has been inferred from measures of resistance
         and resilience to stress. Pimm
         <span><a>36</a></span> defined resistance as the magnitude of change in a response variable during a perturbation
         and resilience as how fast recovery occurs following a perturbation. Subsequently,
         there have been many different mathematical interpretations of these measures. In
         particular, resistance and resilience have been interpreted as “components” of temporal
         stability
         <span><a>37</a></span> (and references therein). A recent study
         <span><a>38</a></span> further proposes a bivariate framework for resilience in terms of normalized resistance
         and recovery metrics based on the undisturbed state in order to have a comparable
         measure of resilience between different systems. When introducing the concept of stress,
         including extreme climate events and tree stress response, individual variation becomes
         important and a new detection problem emerges. Therefore, separating the background
         variation in functioning from the signal due to stress means developing an approach
         to measure stability accounting for this variation.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ability of trees to recover may be dampened by periods of stress such as drought
         or extreme heat
         <span><a>39</a>,
            <a>40</a></span>. This loss of resilience or critical slowing down can push forests to the boundary
         of massive die-off
         <span><a>41</a></span>. Recently it has been shown using satellite data from evergreen tropical forests
         in South America, Africa, and Asia/Australia that slowing down may be driven by low
         levels of precipitation (i.e. mean annual precipitation values which are less than
         1,500 mm ⋅ yr
         <span>−1</span>)
         <span><a>42</a></span>. There are many indicators which may infer slowing down
         <span><a>43</a>,
            <a>44</a></span>. Such indicators are related to the resilience, and in particular the shape of the
         basin of attraction, of the current state. As environmental drivers push the current
         state to a tipping point, the slope of the basin of attraction decreases and, consequently,
         resilience to small perturbations decreases
         <span><a>23</a></span>. If one were to measure the temporal autocorrelation (TAC) at lag-1 of this state,
         it would approach 1 as consecutive states in time are closer to one another due to
         a flattened basin. However, lag-1 autocorrelation does not account for variation at
         higher lags; the power spectrum can show changes in the spectral properties of a time
         series before a transition. In other words, a power spectrum can determine how similar
         states are at higher lags by decomposing a time series into its component frequencies.
         Systems closer to a transition may exhibit spectral reddening (i.e. most of the variation
         in the series occurs at lower frequencies) because states tend to change slowly in
         time about this flattened basin. A particularly important question which, to the best
         of our knowledge, has not yet been explored in the literature is how diversity might
         impact slowing down. TAC and spectral reddening have the potential to provide novel
         insights to slowing down following extreme climate events.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we focus on the detection of stress response in forest communities. As our case
         study, we consider a long-running tropical tree diversity experiment
         <span><a>45</a></span> and identify stressful events at the site from the standardised precipitation-evapotranspiration
         index
         <span><a>46</a></span> (SPEI). We study how growth and mortality along diversity gradients are impacted
         by extreme climate events based on bootstrapping of tree data to generate the statistics
         need to account for potentially large individual variability. We hypothesize that
         differences in growth along a gradient of species richness should manifest mostly
         during wet or dry extreme climate events. In other words, monocultures should have
         greater variability in their growth compared to higher richness mixtures during stress.
         We also predict that mortality will be higher in monocultures during intense spells
         of drought as a result of lower resilience than higher diversity treatments. To determine
         whether the hypothesized mortality for monocultures may indicate sudden massive die-off
         we compute the temporal autocorrelation at lag-1 and the spectral density of growth
         time series. To study the relationship between species richness and slowing down,
         we compare these indicators across diversity treatments. Specifically we expect monocultures
         to exhibit spectral reddening whereas the power spectrum should become more flat at
         higher richness. Our approach improves our understanding and our ability to quantify
         stability under stress for forest ecosystems, and gives momentum to the study of the
         relationship between diversity and slowing down.
