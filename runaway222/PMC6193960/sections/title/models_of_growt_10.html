      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We hypothesized that differences in growth and mortality along a gradient of species
         richness should manifest mostly during extreme climate events. To test this hypothesis
         we construct two different null models: a growth model and a mortality model, which
         represent our null expectation for each diversity treatment if climate is not driving
         year to year differences in performance. For each null model, we use R statistical
         software version 3.4.3 (2017-11-30) to generate 1000 boostrap samples for each plot
         by randomly sampling, with replacement, alive and dead trees with appropriate survival
         probabilities whilst preserving species identity in a given plot
         <span><a>60</a></span>. For the growth model, the pool is made of basal area increments for each tree in
         a plot over all years and we select a living tree with a probability of survival calculated
         for that year. We use a pool of increments from all years as a conservative choice
         which does not presuppose a relationship between plot-level growth and climate (Fig. 
         <a>S1</a>). For the mortality model, the pool is made up of the basal area increments for the
         trees present in a given plot in a given year and we select a tree with a probability
         of survival which is constant year on year. Edge trees are removed from our analysis
         with the reasoning that those trees likely do not benefit from any full biodiversity
         effect. An effect size is computed to compare actual growth and mortality compared
         to the null expectation based on a probit-transformation of the one-tailed probability
         0 &lt;

         <span>qnorm</span> in the R statistical software version 3.4.3 (2017-11-30). The probit-transform accounts
         for skewness in data and is asymptotically equal to the standardised effect size introduced
         by

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We built our null models by assuming that growth or mortality are time-independent
         which would be the case if extreme climate events were not driving inter-annual variations
         in growth or mortality. For the growth model, we sampled from replacement a pool of
         BAGR from surviving trees in a given plot 
         <span>over all years</span>. In this model, mortality is allowed to vary year on year. For the mortality model,
         mortality is similarly assumed 
         <span>to be constant over the period of our analysis</span>. The instantaneous mortality rate 
         <span>m</span> for each plot is then computed from

         effect of climate on growth/mortality at a given diversity level. AES that lie within
         the above interval are not significantly different from each other. We say that there
         is a biodiversity effect if differences between monocultures and mixtures manifest.
