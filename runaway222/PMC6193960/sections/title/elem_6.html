         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our case study is a ca. 15 year-old tropical planted forest in Sardinilla, Central
            Panama (9° 19′N, 79° 38′W) (Fig. 
            <a>5</a>). It was established in 2001 as part of a network of tree biodiversity-ecosystem
            functioning (BEF) experiments called TreeDivNet (
            <span>http://www.treedivnet.ugent.be/</span>). A total of 5,566 tree seedlings &lt;6-months old were planted in 24 contiguous 45 m
            by 45 m plots in a pasture of ~5 ha with mean 231.9 ± 8.93 seedlings per plot. Planting
            distances between individuals was 3 m following standard practices of reforestation
            in Panama. The planted forest has a substitutive randomised block design with species
            richness (monoculture, three-species, and six-species) and species combinations randomly
            allocated to allow quantification of biodiversity effects
            <span><a>56</a></span>. Six native tree species are represented based on their range of relative growth
            rates
            <span><a>57</a>–
               <a>59</a></span>. The fastest growing species are 
            <span>Luehea seemanni</span> [Triana &amp; Planch, Tiliaceae] and 
            <span>Cordia alliodora</span> [(Ruiz &amp; Pavon) Oken, Boraginaceae], the intermediate growing species are 
            <span>Anacardium excelsum</span> [(Bertero &amp; Balb. ex Kunth) Skeels, Anacardiaceae] and 
            <span>Hura crepitans</span> [Linné, Euphorbiaceae], and the slow growing species are 
            <span>Cedrela odorata</span> [Liné, Meliaceae] and 
            <span>Tabebuia rosea</span> [(Bertol.) DC, Bignoniaceae]. 
            <span>C. alliodora</span> suffered massive mortality in the monocultures and mixtures probably due to undrained
            and compact soil
            <span><a>60</a></span>. For this reason we do not include 
            <span>C. alliodora</span> in our experiment. Consequently, we make comparisons using the actual diversity.
            At planting, there were 12 monocultures plots (two replicates of each of six species),
            6 three-species plots, and 6 six-species plots. Using actual diversity removing 
            <span>C. alliodora</span>, there are 10 monoculture plots (two replicates of each of five-species), 3 two-species
            plots, 3 three-species plots, and 6 five-species plots. The five-species plots were
            designed to have the same neighbourhoods whereas the two- and three-species plots
            all have different species compositions from each other. Undergrowth was manually
            cleared in the plantation three times per year to avoid competition with herbaceous
            vegetation. Measurements of tree height, diameter at breast height (~1.4 m) or DBH,
            and basal diameter (10 cm from the ground) were made every year at the onset of the
            dry season (end of December, early January) starting in 2001.

                     <span>Cordia alliodora</span> (Ca), which died in monoculture and in mixture, is excluded from this study and is
                     indicated in red. The five remaining species are:

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The region has a pronounced dry season from January to March
            <span><a>61</a></span>. Long-term meteorological data is available from nearby (≈30 km) Barro Colorado Island
            (BCI) research station
            <span><a>62</a></span>. It has a humid tropical climate
            <span><a>63</a></span> with 25–50 mm per month during the dry season (January-March) and 250 mm per month
            wet season (May-November)
            <span><a>64</a></span>. The annual mean daily temperature is 33.1 °C and minimum is 21.7 °C
            <span><a>64</a></span>. We classify a year as being extremely dry/wet event, moderately dry/wet event or
            normal event by constructing the 12 month standardised precipitation-evapotranspiration
            index (SPEI-12
            <span><a>46</a></span>) from rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data at BCI. SPEI has been used as
            a drought index to study BEF in many studies (e.g
            <span><a>12</a>,
               <a>29</a></span>.). Unlike the standardised precipitation index (SPI
            <span><a>65</a></span>) the SPEI includes the effects of temperature; higher daily minimum temperature can
            increase water losses through evapotranspiration
            <span><a>66</a></span>. The SPEI is constructed as follows
            <span><a>46</a></span>. The 
            <span>D</span>-series for month 
            <span>i</span> is the difference between the precipitation, 
            <span>P</span><sub><span>i</span></sub>, and potential evapotranspiration, 
            <span>PET</span><sub><span>i</span></sub>: 
            <span>D</span><sub><span>i</span></sub> = 
            <span>P</span><sub><span>i</span></sub> − 
            <span>PET</span><sub><span>i</span></sub>. 
            <span>D</span><sub><span>i</span></sub>’s can be aggregated at different timescales, i.e. one month, three months, six months,
            twelve months, etc. Selection of the most appropriate distribution to model the 
            <span>D</span>-series was based on extreme values and found to be described by a log-logistic distribution,
            
            <span>F</span>(
            <span>x</span>). Then, the SPEI is given by the standardized values of

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We hypothesized that differences in growth and mortality along a gradient of species
            richness should manifest mostly during extreme climate events. To test this hypothesis
            we construct two different null models: a growth model and a mortality model, which
            represent our null expectation for each diversity treatment if climate is not driving
            year to year differences in performance. For each null model, we use R statistical
            software version 3.4.3 (2017-11-30) to generate 1000 boostrap samples for each plot
            by randomly sampling, with replacement, alive and dead trees with appropriate survival
            probabilities whilst preserving species identity in a given plot
            <span><a>60</a></span>. For the growth model, the pool is made of basal area increments for each tree in
            a plot over all years and we select a living tree with a probability of survival calculated
            for that year. We use a pool of increments from all years as a conservative choice
            which does not presuppose a relationship between plot-level growth and climate (Fig. 
            <a>S1</a>). For the mortality model, the pool is made up of the basal area increments for the
            trees present in a given plot in a given year and we select a tree with a probability
            of survival which is constant year on year. Edge trees are removed from our analysis
            with the reasoning that those trees likely do not benefit from any full biodiversity
            effect. An effect size is computed to compare actual growth and mortality compared
