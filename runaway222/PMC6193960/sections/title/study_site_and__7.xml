 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our case study is a ca. 15 year-old tropical planted forest in Sardinilla, Central Panama (9° 19′N, 79° 38′W) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). It was established in 2001 as part of a network of tree biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiments called TreeDivNet (

A total of 5,566 tree seedlings &lt;6-months old were planted in 24 contiguous 45 m by 45 m plots in a pasture of ~5 ha with mean 231.9 ± 8.93 seedlings per plot. Planting distances between individuals was 3 m following standard practices of reforestation in Panama. The planted forest has a substitutive randomised block design with species richness (monoculture, three-species, and six-species) and species combinations randomly allocated to allow quantification of biodiversity effects

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. The fastest growing species are 
  <span class="italic">Luehea seemanni</span> [Triana &amp; Planch, Tiliaceae] and 
  <span class="italic">Cordia alliodora</span> [(Ruiz &amp; Pavon) Oken, Boraginaceae], the intermediate growing species are 
  <span class="italic">Anacardium excelsum</span> [(Bertero &amp; Balb. ex Kunth) Skeels, Anacardiaceae] and 
  <span class="italic">Hura crepitans</span> [Linné, Euphorbiaceae], and the slow growing species are 
  <span class="italic">Cedrela odorata</span> [Liné, Meliaceae] and 
  <span class="italic">Tabebuia rosea</span> [(Bertol.) DC, Bignoniaceae]. 
  <span class="italic">C. alliodora</span> suffered massive mortality in the monocultures and mixtures probably due to undrained and compact soil
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span>. For this reason we do not include 
  <span class="italic">C. alliodora</span> in our experiment. Consequently, we make comparisons using the actual diversity. At planting, there were 12 monocultures plots (two replicates of each of six species), 6 three-species plots, and 6 six-species plots. Using actual diversity removing 
  <span class="italic">C. alliodora</span>, there are 10 monoculture plots (two replicates of each of five-species), 3 two-species plots, 3 three-species plots, and 6 five-species plots. The five-species plots were designed to have the same neighbourhoods whereas the two- and three-species plots all have different species compositions from each other. Undergrowth was manually cleared in the plantation three times per year to avoid competition with herbaceous vegetation. Measurements of tree height, diameter at breast height (~1.4 m) or DBH, and basal diameter (10 cm from the ground) were made every year at the onset of the dry season (end of December, early January) starting in 2001.
