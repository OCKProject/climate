  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on a 21 year period from 1995 to 2016, we identify extreme climate events occurring approximately 20% of the time, moderate dry and wet events each occurring 25% of the time, and normal conditions persisting 30%. Normal years are identified based on the climate data (i.e. rainfall and evapotranspiration) over a 21 year period; because of the way SPEI is computed there is an unavoidable shifting baseline which depends on the period chosen. Climate extremes defined only using data from the early (or late) 1900s, would probably have identified more (or fewer) extreme climate events

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We chose the timeframe from 2006 to 2016 to construct our models and test our central hypotheses in order to control for stand development (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). We see that from 2003 to 2005, the plots are in the establishment phase during which juveniles recruit into the size class in which diameter at breast height (DBH) can be measured (1.3 m). By 2015, plots are just reaching the self-thinning line of slope −3/2. Along this line, mortality is mostly driven by strong competition between stems. By 2006, plots in both monocultures and mixtures are out of the early development phase and on a trajectory towards self-thinning, but have not reached it. Therefore, this appears to be the period over which climate may be the main driver of growth and mortality

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this timeframe, we find an extreme La Niña year in 2010 followed by two moderately wet years. Subsequently there is a series of dry years: 2013 and 2014 are moderately dry, and in 2015 and 2016 there are strong El Niño years with very dry conditions (Fig.

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We built null models of growth and mortality assuming a time-independent distribution which would be the case if extreme climate events were not driving inter-annual variations in growth or mortality at a given diversity level (see Methods). The growth model shows that in 2010, the extremely wet year, monocultures grew significantly better than expected by the null hypothesis (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). In plots with species richness, the effect of the 2010 wet year is less pronounced; three- and five-species mixtures do no better than expected at random. During the drought episodes, which last from 2013 through to 2016, we see that although all mixtures experience a decrease in growth, monocultures experience the largest decrease and five-species mixtures the smallest decrease (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). In the mortality model, we see that the number of dead trees is pushed further from the null expectation for monocultures during the continuous drought period from 2013 to 2016 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). Mixtures show no significant difference from the null expectation in mortality during this period.

Average effect size (AES) over plots in monoculture, two-species mixtures, three-species mixtures, and five-species mixtures through time are shown. The error bars correspond to the mean ± the standard deviation for each year. SPEI-12 for a given year is indicated by the colour of the tick marks on the 
      <span class="italic">x</span>-axis: normal is black, moderate wet is grey, moderate dry is coral, extreme wet is dark blue, and extreme dry is red. We find a clear distinction between growth and mortality between monocultures and higher species richness treatments compared to their null expectation which is represented by the honeydew band between [−2.0, 2.0].

  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of SPEI on TAC at lag-1 shows a positive trend as SPEI decreases for all diversity treatments with confidence bands overlapping (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). Consequently, the strongest effect of SPEI on TAC is seen during dry relative to wet years. The power spectrum (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>) indicates that both the monocultures and two-species plots have most of their variance in tree growth at lower frequencies, while the three-species plots have their variance at intermediate frequencies, and the five-species treatments have their variance spread over all frequencies. Furthermore, the monoculture spectrum seems to closely follow the spectrum computed for the SPEI.

We find that there is not a clear distinction between different species richness treatments and an increase in autocorrelation for dry conditions (i.e. increasingly negative SPEI). Monocultures and two-species mixtures have most of their variance in the lower frequency spectrum. This variance shifts to the right or to higher frequencies as richness increases.
