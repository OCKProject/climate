      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on a 21 year period from 1995 to 2016, we identify extreme climate events occurring
         approximately 20% of the time, moderate dry and wet events each occurring 25% of the
         time, and normal conditions persisting 30%. Normal years are identified based on the
         climate data (i.e. rainfall and evapotranspiration) over a 21 year period; because
         of the way SPEI is computed there is an unavoidable shifting baseline which depends
         on the period chosen. Climate extremes defined only using data from the early (or
         late) 1900s, would probably have identified more (or fewer) extreme climate events

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We chose the timeframe from 2006 to 2016 to construct our models and test our central
         hypotheses in order to control for stand development (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). We see that from 2003 to 2005, the plots are in the establishment phase during
         which juveniles recruit into the size class in which diameter at breast height (DBH)
         can be measured (1.3 m). By 2015, plots are just reaching the self-thinning line of
         slope −3/2. Along this line, mortality is mostly driven by strong competition between
         stems. By 2006, plots in both monocultures and mixtures are out of the early development
         phase and on a trajectory towards self-thinning, but have not reached it. Therefore,
         this appears to be the period over which climate may be the main driver of growth
         and mortality

               <p>Development phase for the even-aged stands at Sardinilla. Two trajectories are shown
                  for monocultures (black) and mixtures (red). As plot basal area increases the number
                  of trees per hectare decreases over time starting in 2006, and the trajectory moves
                  upwards and to the left as it converges to the self-thinning line with slope −3/2
                  (blue dotted line).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this timeframe, we find an extreme La Niña year in 2010 followed by two moderately
         wet years. Subsequently there is a series of dry years: 2013 and 2014 are moderately
         dry, and in 2015 and 2016 there are strong El Niño years with very dry conditions
         (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>).
