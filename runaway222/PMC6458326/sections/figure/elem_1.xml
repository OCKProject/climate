  <p>The stochastic cusp model—from three-dimensional to two-dimensional representation. (
   <span class="italic">a</span>) The typical three-dimensional representation of the cusp model where North Atlantic cod SB dynamics depend on two controlling variables 
   <span class="italic">α</span> (fishing mortality—
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>M</sub>) set by fisheries management and 
   <span class="italic">β</span> (sea surface temperature—SST) controlling whether SB follows a continuous or discontinuous path. (
   <span class="italic">b,c</span>) Two-dimensional projection of the plane. The bifurcation area under the folded three-dimensional phase plane is shaded in grey and light blue (representing where the data of this stock can be found in the plane). Filled dots in (
   <span class="italic">b</span>) and (
   <span class="italic">c</span>) represent SB with the radius scaling relative to stock size. The red dots are highlighted in order to show the last 
   <span class="italic">ca</span> 10 years of the time series. (
   <span class="italic">c</span>) The vertical dotted line represents the present management target, in this case 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>MSY</sub>, which can be found in the electronic supplementary material, table S3. Note that the 
   <span class="italic">y</span>-axis is reversed with temperature increasing downwards.
