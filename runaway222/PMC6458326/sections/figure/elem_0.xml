  <p>Spawner biomass (SB) trends and change points. Scaled SB (between 0 and 1, SB−min(SB)/max(SB)−min(SB)) time series of Atlantic cod stocks. Blue smoother lines indicate time trends and were fitted using generalized additive modelling (no smoother was fitted to stocks that mainly oscillate, in order to differentiate the two different stocks dynamics). Dotted vertical lines represent the major change points in the time series (red lines indicated negative, light-blue lines positive change points) derived by Bayesian change point and trend analysis (explained in the electronic supplementary material). Stock names and numbers according to the electronic supplementary material, table S1. (Online version in colour.)</p>
