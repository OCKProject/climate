 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We applied stochastic cusp modelling to 19 cod stocks from both sides of the North Atlantic (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F3" href="#RSPB20182877F3">figure 3</a>). To our knowledge, our study is one of the few to apply this methodology to empirical data from an ecological system [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C62" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C62">62</a>]. The model evaluation exploring the percentage and bimodality of the observations in the bifurcation area [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C48">48</a>] revealed 16 out of the 19 cusp models to be valid (electronic supplementary material, tables S4 and S5 and figure S3). Moreover, generally, the cusp model provided better statistical fits to the data than alternative linear and logistic models for all Atlantic cod stocks (
  <a rid="RSPB20182877TB1" ref-type="table" href="#RSPB20182877TB1">table 1</a>). Importantly, the model results indicate that in 13 out of the 16 valid cusp models, SST was a significant predictor of cod SB dynamics. Additionally, fishing mortality was a significant predictor in five cases, and the only significant predictor in two cases (
  <a rid="RSPB20182877TB1" ref-type="table" href="#RSPB20182877TB1">table 1</a>). These results show that Atlantic cod stock dynamics are well described by discontinuous, catastrophic behaviours determined by fishing pressure and temperature, as also suggested by previous studies [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastern Atlantic cod stocks best demonstrate this catastrophic behaviour, as also shown for North Sea cod (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F1" href="#RSPB20182877F1">figure 1</a>). Warming moves the trajectory of the stock towards the discontinuous region (i.e. down the 
  <span class="italic">y</span>-axis) and into the bifurcation set (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F3" href="#RSPB20182877F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">a–c</span>; electronic supplementary material, figure S4). Here, even minute changes of fishing mortality are sufficient to drive the stock to collapse, because the stock is on the verge of the fold. Similar dynamics are observed for western Atlantic stocks (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F3" href="#RSPB20182877F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">d–f</span>; electronic supplementary material, figure S4) where most of the SB observations are found within the bifurcation set. The bifurcation set is the area of the fold where just one unstable equilibrium exists [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C45" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C45">45</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C64">64</a>], indicating unstable dynamics [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C65" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C65">65</a>]. Therefore, western stocks seem to be more vulnerable to catastrophic changes, probably owing to differences in life-history traits, local oceanic conditions and exploitation history [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C20">20</a>,

  <a rid="RSPB20182877C67" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C67">67</a>]. Apart from stocks in the Baltic Sea and at the Norwegian coast (electronic supplementary material, figure S4), eastern Atlantic cod stocks show higher instabilities owing to the temperature increase in recent years (highlighted in red in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F3" href="#RSPB20182877F3">figure 3</a>). This recently very low resilience of the eastern cod stocks advocates for the application of more precautionary management measures, i.e. harvest control rules with lower fishing opportunities to counteract the high uncertainties in cod stock dynamics [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The stochastic cusp model allowed us to better understand the interacting effects of fishing pressure and ocean warming on Atlantic cod dynamics. All stocks, except the highly vulnerable Norwegian coastal and northern cod (where most of the data points are in the bifurcation set), collapsed at a fishing mortality well above sustainable levels, i.e. 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>MSY</sub> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F3" href="#RSPB20182877F3">figure 3</a>; electronic supplementary material, figure S4 and table S3), indicating the paramount importance of fishing pressure in regulating cod stock size [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C69" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C69">69</a>]. Specifically, fishing below or around 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>MSY</sub> would have maintained larger stock sizes and reduced the vulnerability of these stocks to SST changes, as indicated by stocks falling outside the bifurcation set (see especially North Sea and West of Scotland cod; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F3" href="#RSPB20182877F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">a,b</span>). Recent management efforts have often reduced fishing mortality to near or far below 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>MSY</sub> such as in north and Irish Sea cod (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F3" href="#RSPB20182877F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">a,c</span>). While these stocks can be considered recovering (electronic supplementary material, figures S1 and S2), SB remains in most cases far below historical levels at similar or higher exploitation pressure. This hysteresis towards recovery is particularly evident in the western Atlantic stocks (e.g. southern Gulf of St Lawrence) (electronic supplementary material, figure S4), which after more than 20 years still reside in a depleted state. According to our cusp models, such hysteresis is owing to temperature changes that modified the relationship between fishing mortality and SB from linear to discontinuous, causing limited recovery of the biomass even after the reduction in fishing mortality [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C45" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C45">45</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results confirm the importance of fishing pressure and oceanic temperature conditions and, for the first time to our knowledge, identify their interacting effects on fish populations [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C20">20</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C21">21</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C70" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C70">70</a>]. In particular, the hysteresis effect is in most of the cod stocks caused by an increase in SST. SST can have an effect directly on cod stocks through recruitment [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C54">54</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C57" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C57">57</a>], growth [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C56" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C56">56</a>] and mortality as well as indirectly through predator–prey switches or habitat degradation [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C71" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C71">71</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C72" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C72">72</a>]. Moreover, hysteresis could also be because of trophic cascading observed in many cod-dominated systems, where the decrease in cod has induced increases of forage fishes hindering the comeback of cod [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C22">22</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C24">24</a>,

  <a rid="RSPB20182877C73" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C73">73</a>]. Thus, the presence of hysteresis implies that recovery may only occur after a prolonged period of very low fishing mortality, or may not happen at all. Sudden increases in SB are theoretically possible as demonstrated by the recently recovered Flemish Cap cod (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F3" href="#RSPB20182877F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">g</span>). Still, a long-term reduction in fishing mortality is necessary to increase survival and year-class strength and to eventually initiate a positive feedback that leads to recovery. The failed or delayed recovery of the stocks highlights furthermore the importance to detect discontinuous dynamics in advance, in order to avoid unpleasant surprises [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change will continue to cause a considerably warmer Atlantic Ocean [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C75" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C75">75</a>] and our results show that increasing SST will have negative repercussions for most of the Atlantic cod stocks that already live at their upper thermal tolerance limits [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C66">66</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C76" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C76">76</a>]. Indeed, the increase in temperature in these areas will strongly reduce the productivity of most of the cod stocks as shown in other studies [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C51" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C51">51</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C66">66</a>]. However, the few stocks residing at or close to their lower thermal tolerance limits are expected to benefit from warming (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F3" href="#RSPB20182877F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">i–h</span>). Warming and reduced fishing pressure initiated the recovery of the Icelandic cod stock, which could be even more pronounced if fishing mortality would be reduced to below 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>MSY</sub>. To date, northeast Arctic cod is benefiting the most from ocean warming [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C77" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C77">77</a>]. According to our cusp model, the northeast Arctic cod population resides in (or is on the verge of) a high SB stable state (recent high SB values are outside or at the tip of the bifurcation area; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F3" href="#RSPB20182877F3">figure 3</a>

  <a rid="RSPB20182877C78" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C78">78</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results demonstrate how ocean warming induces a nonlinear and discontinuous relationship between stock size and fishing pressure in most of the Atlantic cod stocks. These catastrophic dynamics are fundamental to understand because they can lead to management failure and unpleasant ecological surprises [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C64">64</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C79" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C79">79</a>]. Even though recorded in many areas and at different ecosystem levels, catastrophic dynamics are still largely ignored in fisheries and ecosystem management because of the challenges of analysing them and the few models available [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C15">15</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C80" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C80">80</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C81" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C81">81</a>]. We show that application of catastrophe theory can help to better understand discontinuous dynamics, but also the interaction of external drivers, resilience and proximity to tipping points.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study has limitations resulting in particular from uncertainties in the stock assessment data used. Also, the methodological confines of the stochastic cusp modelling approach, such as deficiencies in accounting for autocorrelation in time series [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C49">49</a>] and known uncertainties in model comparison using indices such as R
  <span class="sup">2</span> [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C48">48</a>] and AIC [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C82" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C82">82</a>] might influence the validity of our results. While improving the methodology is beyond the scope of our study, we conducted a careful approach to validate our modelling results using multiple criteria as suggested and applied in other studies [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C48">48</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C82" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C82">82</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C83" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C83">83</a>]. The results of this multifaceted validation approach give us confidence that the stochastic cusp model is a valid model to describe the dynamics of Atlantic cod stocks and is frequently superior to the more simpler linear and logistic models.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, we acknowledge that a theoretical model such as the stochastic cusp model cannot reveal the underlying ecological processes which can only be proven applying an experimental approach. Unfortunately, large natural populations such as Atlantic cod are impossible to manipulate experimentally. Hence, we acknowledge that a detailed understanding of the effect of temperature on biological processes such as growth [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C84" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C84">84</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C85" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C85">85</a>] and recruitment [

  <a rid="RSPB20182877C87" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C87">87</a>] or ecosystem changes such as trophic cascades is needed to better explain our statistical model results and should be performed at the stock level. Nonetheless, we believe our modelling results provide advances in explaining the interacting effects of the two drivers in identifying catastrophic dynamics of Atlantic cod stocks and their possible recovery potential.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we here contribute a novel assessment of the vulnerability of Atlantic cod stocks to climate change, explicitly accounting for the potential of nonlinear and state-dependent dynamics that will be useful for ecosystem-based management of the oceans. Other resource species may follow similar catastrophic dynamics as we have here demonstrated for Atlantic cod, and as such we suggest that a precautionary approach accounting for environmental change is warranted for the sustainable management of living resources under the expected future climate change [

  <a rid="RSPB20182877C81" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C81">81</a>]. Finally, we demonstrated the usefulness of the stochastic cusp modelling approach to explain abrupt changes in ecological systems, which hopefully will spur application as seen in other scientific disciplines.
