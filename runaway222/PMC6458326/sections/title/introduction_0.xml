  <a rid="RSPB20182877C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C13">13</a>]. Typically, such events are characterized by multiple external drivers that interact in causing abrupt changes and show hysteresis, a delayed or absent response to restoration and recovery efforts [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C3">3</a>]. Anticipating and considering regime shifts is hence a crucial challenge for marine ecosystem-based management that has the goal of a sustainable exploitation of the oceans [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The demise of Atlantic cod (
  <span class="italic">Gadus morhua</span>) stocks, which has been often linked to a combination of unsustainable fishing pressure and unfavourable climatic conditions, resulting in trophic cascades and feedback loops, constitutes a text book example of the consequences of overexploiting marine living resources (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F1" href="#RSPB20182877F1">figure 1</a>) [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C17">17</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C24">24</a>]. Given the dire ecological and socio-economic consequences of these collapses [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C25">25</a>], a wide range of management measures has been implemented in the attempt to promote the recovery of cod on both sides of the North Atlantic [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C26">26</a>]. Unfortunately, most of these recovery measures have proved inefficient, indicating that cod recovery might be hindered by complex synergistic, antagonistic or additive interactions between multiple pressures [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C27">27</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C28">28</a>]. We here analysed trends of 19 collapsed cod stocks (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F1" href="#RSPB20182877F1">figure 1</a>; electronic supplementary material, text and tables S1 and S2) finding only two stocks fully recovered, and six in the process of recovering (electronic supplementary material text, and figures S1 and S2). Eleven cod stocks can still be considered depleted, causing a great deal of controversy regarding the underlying processes of failed recovery both in the scientific literature [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C20">20</a>] but also in popular media [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C26">26</a>]. Here, we address the question of how fishing pressure and climatic changes (represented by sea surface temperature (SST)) interact to cause patterns of collapse and recovery of Atlantic cod stocks, applying an approach based on catastrophe theory. The approach allows us to detect how multiple drivers can interact to cause discontinuous dynamics and we suggest that its application can facilitate the understanding of the recovery potential of depleted living marine resources in general. Understanding the recovery potential of Atlantic cod is especially important because the species is not only a fundamental component of marine ecosystems, but also one of the most requested living marine resource species on the international market [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Catastrophe theory is a branch of bifurcation theory in the field of nonlinear dynamical systems that studies and classifies phenomena characterized by sudden shifts in behaviour derived from small changes in external conditions [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C31">31</a>]. The theory, developed by the French mathematician René Thom in the 1960s [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C32">32</a>] and popularized by Christopher Zeeman in the 1970s [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C33">33</a>], became somewhat an intellectual fad [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C31">31</a>]. Catastrophe theory was believed to be applicable to every branch of science and hence was quickly embraced by scientists in diverse fields. Examples of applications in marine ecology and resource management questions included models of fishery dynamics [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C34">34</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C36" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C36">36</a>] and predator–prey interactions of Great Lakes trout [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C37">37</a>]; but as quickly as it became popular, the theory started to be heavily criticized [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C38">38</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C41" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C41">41</a>] which resulted in a major debate on its usefulness and potential misuse, in particular owing to its original deterministic framework (responses appeared in 
  <span class="italic">Science</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Nature</span> in 1977 [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C42">42</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C44" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C44">44</a>]). This debate gradually undermined the support for using catastrophe theory and led to a widespread dismissal until the 2000s [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C31">31</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Standard catastrophe theory differentiates seven elementary catastrophes (canonical forms) that can describe systems characterized by abrupt shifts with up to six dimensions in control and state variables [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C32">32</a>]. Most of the applications of catastrophe theory use the two simplest forms, the fold and the cusp. The fold catastrophe describes sudden changes of a dynamic system in response to a single pressure variable and has been widely used in ecology to discuss concepts such as resilience and hysteresis [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C45" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C45">45</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C46" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C46">46</a>]. The cusp catastrophe, in contrast with the fold, considers a three-dimensional system (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182877F2" href="#RSPB20182877F2">figure 2</a>) where a second external variable acts as splitting factor that can modify the system's response to the principal external driver from linear and continuous to nonlinear and discontinuous. The cusp catastrophe is hence an ideal model to evaluate the effect of two interacting drivers such as fishing pressure and environmental forces on ecological systems, a potential that has not been sufficiently exploited yet (but see [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C47">47</a>]). A major criticism of early studies applying the deterministic catastrophe theory was their descriptive nature owing to the lack of a stochastic framework [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C48">48</a>]. The recent development of such a framework to cusp modelling has revived interest in the concept with an increasing number of publications in disciplines such as economy [
  <a rid="RSPB20182877C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182877C49">49</a>], sociology and behavioural science [
