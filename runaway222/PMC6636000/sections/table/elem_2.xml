    <td>Intervention Characteristic</td>
    <td>Design Quality and Packaging</td>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: dedicated team for NCD Management</td>
    <td>If we are to truly focus on NCD services for patients, a dedicated team should be developed at the clinic. (paramedic, 34 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td rowspan="6">Outer Setting</td>
    <td rowspan="3">Patient Needs and Resources</td>
    <td>Perceived barrier: non-compliance to appointment time</td>
    <td>Most of our patients [here] are elderly. Their children will drop them off early in the morning before going off to work. They [elderly patients] will congregate [at the clinic] at the same time. We cannot implement the staggered-time appointment, even when we emphasised it. [That is why] the small OPD [outpatient department] area is congested [because] many patients are waiting there. (professional, 33 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Perceived barrier: patients’ beliefs</td>
    <td>People always have this concept about KK [health clinic], it’s a place to take medicine and medical certificate [MC]. But they never thought of KK as a place [for] health [improvement] opportunity. (professional, 36 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: clinic location</td>
    <td>Most patients love to come here [clinic] because it’s near to town and is easy since consultation, blood tests and analyses can be completed within one day. (professional, 49 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Cosmopolitanism</td>
    <td>Perceived barrier: lack of inter-facility networking</td>
    <td>Whenever patient [is] discharged from a hospital, they will bring a [referral] letter from the hospital to come to the clinic. That is the only thing [document]...we do not have any other way [to access information]. Sometimes, the letter might not complete, investigations done might not be there (professional, 28 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: relationship and networking with NGO and community</td>
    <td>If that is true [collaborating with KOSPEN], it [will be] very helpful because we do not have [the] opportunity [to perform] screening. Sometimes, a patient, especially elderly, is afraid of the clinics [staff]. But if its KOSPEN, [patients] will come [for screening] (professional, 42 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>External Policy and Incentives</td>
    <td>Perceived barrier: top-down mandates with new unplanned programme</td>
    <td>Sometimes the programmes [directives from top management] come suddenly and they want the result immediately...it is disruptive, given [short] period of time and we have to rush. (paramedic, 32 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td rowspan="16">Inner Setting</td>
    <td>Structural Characteristics</td>
    <td>Perceived barrier: physical space constraints to deliver services</td>
    <td>We are sharing room for fundus assessment with dental services. Because dental officers will come our clinic once a month. So, when there is an appointment for dental, the room becomes a dental room and will not be open for fundus assessment. So when a patient comes for a fundus appointment that coincidentally clashes with a dentist slot, his/her assessment will be postponed to another day. (paramedic, 27 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Networks and Communications</td>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: Information sharing</td>
    <td>If we need [something], we just can talk [share the information] …. If not, during the morning briefing, anything urgent we can discuss with the head of unit [about] any problem or current issues, and they will highlight [and] go through it. (professional, 56 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Culture</td>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: teamwork</td>
    <td>Relationship [between staff] is better, good, because we have no blocks [no barrier] here. I mean, the last time we have an OPD [outpatient department] wing and a MCH [Maternal Child Health] wing. Now, no [more]...we are all under one clinic. (professional, 55 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Perceived barrier: divided zone leads to silos working culture</td>
    <td>We are divided into two zones/areas here [for family doctor concept]—a blue zone and a pink zone. Previously, there were no zones, only one area; we would automatically help each other. But when there are zones like this, there’s no initiative from staffs at the pink zone to help the blue zone or vice versa (paramedic, 31 years old)</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: Standardisation of work process</td>
    <td>Work process. The patient flow... That’s why things are not standardised. (laboratory technician, 36 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: Improving documentation process</td>
    <td>For every single thing you have to documentation … documentation … documentation.... But you are doing the repetitive work...for the medical assistants or nurses every month, they have to repeatedly key-in all these work into their computers to send to the [state] office. (professional, 40 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: Improving consultation time</td>
    <td>We don’t have enough time to counsel patients. Because when the number of patients increases, everyone wants to be fast and we are unable to focus. NCD has lots of factors [things to talk about] but we only have five minutes to counsel [patients]. (professional, 27 years old)</td>

     <p>ii) Compatibility</p>
    </td>
    <td>Perceived barrier: lack of proper tracking mechanism</td>
    <td>We have received referrals from KOSPEN, but the issue is patient does not come [for appointments] sometimes … there is no mechanism that states how we want to cater [to all referrals]. (Professional, 42 years old)</td>

    </td>
    <td>Perceived barrier: minimal manpower</td>
    <td>We only have two staff at the community clinic, one working at the clinic and the other one does home visits. So the one who is out for home visit, even in an isolated area, will be working alone as we only have one transportation. (paramedic, 45 years old)</td>

     <p>Readiness for Implementation</p>
     <p>iii) Access to Knowledge and Information</p>
    </td>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: SOP and guidelines made available</td>
    <td>Now there’s a SOP that everyone supposed to know. They should know what readings should be read; what to do about it … meaning there is already a guideline. It makes its easier to handle NCD cases. (paramedic, 45 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Perceived barrier: insufficient information to introduce new programme</td>
    <td>An example of programmes that I would like to mention is the FDC [family doctor concept]—it was not proper, not clear. We forced ourselves to make it clear for us because we have to implement the program. (professional, 32 years old)</td>

    <td rowspan="4">Characteristic of Individual</td>
    <td>Knowledge and Beliefs</td>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: regular updating knowledge</td>
    <td>To me, [the proposed] EnPHC has many good sides. When we take good care of our patients, their health will improve. In the end, it will benefit us [providers] too, as indirectly, our patient load will be reduced. We think in future, the workload will be diminished. No more people will suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure. (paramedic, 45 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Self-efficacy</td>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: own capability to perform</td>
    <td>Why are we so eager about it? One, we have an indicator that needs to be pursued. The second one, one of the main duties of the assistance medical officer is a prevention programme. So, I take as my responsibility to make sure the programme is running. (paramedic, 30 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Individual Stage of Change</td>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: embrace new ideas for improvement</td>
    <td>I prefer when a new person comes to the clinic, he has a new idea. So, there may be new ways to implement....we can try and improve our programme. Because sometimes when an outsider comes in, we have new ideas. (paramedic, 30 years old)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Individual Identification with Organisation</td>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: work commitment</td>

    <td>Other Personal Attributes</td>
    <td>Perceived facilitators: professionalism and value</td>
    <td>We actually want to give more [health education] to patients, but we don’t have enough [time] since many patients are waiting, so we have to make the consultation short...I will usually try to extend time [for] each session. I do not mind skipping my lunch, as long my patients are okay. (professional, 32 years old)</td>
