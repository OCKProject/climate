 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data transcription and analysis were carried out immediately after each interview. All interviews were transcribed verbatim into Microsoft Word and subsequently transferred to Nvivo11™ to facilitate data management and coding process. Interviews in Malay language were transcribed without translations, but coded in English. The selected quotes in Malay were translated into English for report writing and publication purposes.</p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An open coding approach was applied to the transcripts at the first order coding before subsequent grouping in second order coding. To imbue sense into the thematic codes, a framework analysis approach guided by CFIR was carried out. A codebook was developed by adopting from CFIR’s website prior to third order coding [

Hence, only the four domains of ‘Intervention Characteristics’, ‘Outer Setting’, ‘Inner Setting’ and ‘Characteristics of Individual’ were used for analysis. Operational definitions for these constructs were developed with regard to EnPHC implementation to capture contextual factors that might influence implementation effectiveness. Coders are members of EnPHC-Process Evaluation team who are familiar with and understand that CFIR constructs were required to strictly adhere to the predetermined operational definition and apply codes without making inferences from the data. However, analysis was not limited only to CFIR constructs because flexibility to create new subdomains and categories that may arise from the data inductively was allowed. The coding process was done independently in pairs, during which the same transcript was read by two persons who coded it separately, followed by consensual validation among the researchers before codes and verbatim quotes were regrouped into major themes. The codebook was continuously revised throughout the data analysis process, during which additional subdomains and their definitions were added or removed.
