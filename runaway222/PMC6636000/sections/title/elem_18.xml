 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This exploratory study aimed to assess the organisational receptiveness to change among primary healthcare providers prior to implementation of new interventions. Key findings from this study will help guide policy-makers and future research. We found almost all constructs to have positive presence, which supports the justification to implement the proposed intervention and suggests a potential smooth implementation. Previous studies reported that readiness at the organisational level is important for any implementation of complex interventions and changes in the healthcare system [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the negative presences or perceived barriers identified were within the construct of ‘Outer Setting’ and ‘Inner Setting’, partly due to external agents, physical structure, resources and culture, which appear to be common in any organisation. Organisational leaders often introduce goal-oriented system-wide changes in an effort to address the ever-changing population needs. When these changes are introduced, differences and conflicts between organisation leaders and members might arise that may eventually affect the success of the implementation of an intervention. Barriers or concerns raised by organisation members need to be addressed prior to the introduction of a new intervention. To resolve conflicts, organisation members (HCPs within the clinic), beliefs and comprehension about the changes need to be aligned with the organisation leaders for the changes to be implemented successfully [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction of new interventions should be aligned with daily activities of the HCPs in the clinics to motivate HCP work values. HCPs believed the current health delivery system needs change, specifically the system and work process, to address the increasing demands of the population (such as insufficient consultation time). This issue should be incorporated when designing a new intervention that meets the needs of both HCPs and the service quality for the population. Proposed interventions such as standardising work processes or improvising patient flow in the clinic [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>] seemed to be supported positively by HCPs. Given the limited resources in the primary healthcare setting, additional programmes or new interventions are often perceived as additional burdens to the clinic. Considering the limitation of public primary healthcare clinics to hire additional staff, organisation leaders need to review, strategise and maximise existing internal resources.
 </p>
 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Collaboration between primary health clinics and hospitals is reflected in the ‘Cosmopolitanism’ construct in the CFIR framework. Poor communication and networking between these facilities were seen as barriers in our study. Establishing a patient referral tracking [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>] and utilising technology for information sharing between two facilities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>] might possibly overcome the obstacles, especially since it affects patient outcomes. Additionally, ‘Patient Needs and Resources’ must also be integral to the implementation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other barriers were collective attitudes and perspectives of those within the organisation such as physical structure limitations and the organisation’s work culture. Space constraints in an old building can act as a barrier for new interventions that require space. Organisation leaders who can provide flexibility in task execution and flexible organisation policies may reinforce staff’s readiness [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. Establishment of teamwork and trust among team members also encourages the perception of readiness among the staff [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>], and silo-based thinking within the organisation also needs to be addressed. Silos were unintentionally created as staff members focused on fulfilling the task at hand instead of achieving the overall outcome for the organisation, which is further disaggregated by the assigned zone, job types or job functions. Studies have addressed the silo working culture by establishing common performance goals, clear communication regarding vision [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], using a system thinking approach and encouraging communities of practice [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>] and inter-professional team-based training that help improve clinic health delivery services [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Those are important strategies that the organisation leaders could explore prior to implementing the proposed interventions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Learning Climate’ determines the openness of the leaders’ fallibility and willingness to embrace teamwork, feedback and input, thereby making team members feel needed, essential and valued [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. This was supported by the satisfaction achieved when their feedback and suggestions seem to be accepted by their superiors. Sharing and engaging staffs regarding the vision and objectives of any new intervention would also most likely be welcomed by the organisation members. Leaders who engage their organisations by encouraging and influencing their staffs in achieving learning and operation-oriented goals might promote creative decisions and surrounding environments that are both stimulating and caring [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>], all of which facilitate employees’ readiness towards change. Therefore, leadership and two-way communication play important roles in strengthening the organisation’s commitment.
 </p>
 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To effectively implement the change and generate anticipated benefits, composed and coordinated behaviour of organisational members is crucial [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. This statement aligns with our findings that all constructs under ‘Individual Characteristics’ showed positivity towards change among HCPs. Individual characteristics and behaviours are critical in influencing organisational outcomes and thus, are closely associated with organisational culture [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>], which is defined as norms, values and basic assumptions of a given organisation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. If the characteristics of organisational culture are unclear and poorly communicated, the employees’ composed perspectives and their behaviours will be inconsistent and will become a challenge for readiness [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. However, we found that this was not the case for the HCPs in our study, as the interviews indicate the organisational culture leaned towards positive impressions.

  <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Ministry of Health Malaysia plans to implement the EnPHC initiative, a complex intervention package, to improve NCD health service delivery in primary healthcare clinics. Findings from this exploratory study provide the baseline information on the perception of HCPs of various categories about their day-to-day clinic activities and local settings. Insights obtained from the findings will help programme planners and stakeholders plan the intervention deployment strategies. We found that applying the CFIR for formative evaluation provided better understanding of the components of outer and inner settings, as well as individual characteristics. Findings that were explored using the CFIR constructs also established a contextual knowledge platform that can be applied to other primary healthcare settings in the future. The focus group discussions and in-depth interviews allowed for deep understanding of the perceptions and local issues HCPs encountered in the clinic setting.</p>
  <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were two limitations in our study. Firstly, the CFIR constructs were only applied later for analysis and were not used during the development of interview guidelines. Nevertheless, comprehensiveness of analysis guided by CFIR facilitates exploration of data from different dimension. Secondly, this study adopted only qualitative approach. Although qualitative data can provide rich information, quantitative measurement for the seriousness and severity of issues raised was not performed in the study. Future study, possibly using mixed method approach of a larger scale for an additional structured questionnaire on an item-scale (Likert for example) assessing the key readiness question in an indirect manner could explore perception as a cross-check measure.</p>
