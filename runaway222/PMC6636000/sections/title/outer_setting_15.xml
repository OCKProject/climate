 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The outer setting has four constructs that refer to factors outside of the organisation. Three out of the four constructs (‘Patient Needs and Resources’, ‘Cosmopolitanism’ and ‘External Policies and Incentives’) were noted to have possible barriers. In contrast, clinic location and good networking with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and community were seen as possible facilitators for implementing a new NCD programme. However, the perception of clinic location and accessibility as facilitators may vary depending on the facility location.</p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Patients’ non-compliance with appointment times was perceived as a barrier, especially among elderly patients who depend on their children for transportation. Consequently, the clinics’ current implementation of a time-slot appointment system (referred to as the ‘staggered appointment system’) did not run as intended. Additionally, HCPs noticed that the patients and the surrounding community have limited comprehension on the clinics’ role; they believed that patients perceived clinics as a curative centre rather than a place for learning about health. Professionals among the HCPs commonly recommended restructuring patients’ beliefs about the clinics’ role.</p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The construct of ‘Cosmopolitanism’ assessed the degree to which an organisation is networked with other external organisations. Lack of inter-health facility networking was perceived as a barrier in information transfer between primary healthcare clinics and hospitals, which affected patients’ care continuity. This challenge became more prominent when NCD patients who were discharged from hospitals were asked to continue their chronic care management in the primary care facilities within their localities. Nevertheless, the HCPs shared that the presence of good networking and relationships with other external organisations such as NGOs and other ministries were viewed as an advantage for interventions that require external support. For example, the community health empowerment programmes such as 
  <span class="italic">Komuniti Sihat Perkasa Negara</span> (KOSPEN) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], was viewed as a good platform to introduce any preventive or health education activities.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another barrier perceived by the HCPs was under the construct for ‘External Policies and Incentives’. It is related to mandates from top management that could sometimes be a challenge, especially for ad hoc directives that require urgent/immediate action. This often affected task prioritisation over on-going programmes, which has a further negative impact when the clinic has existing issues with insufficient resources. The participants shared this dilemma because they were concerned that the proposed new intervention will be implemented as an additional directive without proper planning or realignment with existing activities.</p>
