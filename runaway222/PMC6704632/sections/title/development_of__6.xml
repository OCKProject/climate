 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In total, 12 scientific experts from five countries designed the MOOC based on a face-to-face course at Heidelberg University. The endeavor to realize these three MOOCs was mainly driven by the efforts of a single senior faculty member (RS). A professional course and multimedia development team of the Centre Virchow-Villermé supported the design and implementation of the three MOOCs on the respective online learning platforms. They also actively supported participants in the MOOCs. The MOOC-GP and MOOC-PM were filmed in Europe in a small movie studio of the Centre Virchow-Villermé. The MOOC-AFR was filmed in Burkina Faso, and the majority of the experts that were teaching in the MOOC-AFR were Burkinabe themselves, as was the ownership and organization of this MOOC. The Centre Recherche en Santé Nouna in Burkina Faso coordinated and included lecturers from national universities and meteorological department of Burkina Faso. The MOOC-AFR was actively supported by French-speaking experts of the collaborating institute (CRSN) who helped answer discussion forum questions for 6 weeks (February – March 2017).</p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MOOC-GP was actively supported for 5 weeks (February–March 2016), and included weekly live question-and-answer sessions and a discussion forum supported by experts who answered student questions.</p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MOOC-PM had five chapters on why health is critical for climate negotiations and was actively supported for 5 weeks (from January–February 2016).</p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MOOCs were translated from face-to-face courses resulting in readings and quizzes with mainly traditional instructional methods comprising lecture segments (with an average runtime of 9 minutes), potentially not engaging the participants actively enough. Collaborative elements were included in the MOOCs that followed instructional design principles, such as (i) problem-centered learning (real-world problems of climate change and health were discussed in video segments, such as health co-benefits of improving nutritional diets, of riding your bike, of reducing indoor air pollution), with (ii) application (through a real-life project) and (iii) integration of knowledge (tasks to discuss course topics in the discussion forum with fellow participants). More collaborative activities may engage participants even further in the topic area and could comprise of teamwork-based exercises and discussion forums, additional exchange spaces for collaboration like social networking or interest groups, as well as instructor feedback by the respective MOOC instructor and by peers.</p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the actively supported phase, all three MOOCs were still available on the respective learning platforms, as were the discussion boards for students to exchange information and discuss various topics. But further support to participants’ questions was no longer covered by course developers and involved experts. The MOOCs were still available online, however, no further strategy has yet been put in place on how to keep contents updated. Potentially, at one point the MOOCs are archived and materials may be used as the base for a new MOOC on the topic.</p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To lower the language barrier of participants’ to take part in the MOOCs subtitles were provided for the MOOC-GP and MOOC-PM in different languages (MOOC-GP: Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, English, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish; MOOC-PM: Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Indonesian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish). The subtitles were translated by native speakers, mostly doctoral and Master course students, who were familiar with the domain language of climate change and health (cf. [

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To reach participants of different backgrounds, such as participants from outside the realm of the “usual suspects”, such as decision-makers, participants from low resource contexts and non-academic participants, we followed a “blended marketing” strategy, which combined online and “real-life” or offline marketing. This included reaching out in meetings or conferences or using the Universities’ alumni networks.</p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, the MOOC-PM was launched at the World Health Summit.</p>
