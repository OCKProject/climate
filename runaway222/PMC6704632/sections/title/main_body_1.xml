 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We developed three MOOCs addressing the link between climate change and health to take advantage of the methodologyâ€™s broad reach and accelerate knowledge dissemination on the nexus of climate change and health. The primary objective was to translate an existing face-to-face short course that only reached a few participants on climate change and health into globally accessible learning opportunities. In the following, we share and comment on our lessons learned with the three MOOCs, with a focus on global teaching in the realm of climate change and health.</p>
