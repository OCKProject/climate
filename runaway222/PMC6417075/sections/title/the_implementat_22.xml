 <p id="Par78" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ICS is an 18-item measure addressing to what extent an organization supports the implementation of EBP [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. It includes six subscales: focus on EBP, educational support for EBP, recognition for EBP, rewards for EBP, selection for EBP, and selection for openness. The scale is scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (to a very great extent). Both the LOCI leaders, the therapists, and the executive rate the organizational climate. The ICS has excellent internal consistency and convergent and discriminant validity. The ICS has an overall Cronbachâ€™s alpha of .91.
