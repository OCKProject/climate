 <p id="Par77" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MLQ is a 36-item measure addressing transformational and transactional leadership [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. Transformational leadership is assessed by four subscales: (1) idealized Influence (8 items), (2) inspirational motivation (4 items), (3) intellectual stimulation (4 items), and (4) individual consideration (4 items). Transactional leadership is assessed by two subscales: (1) contingent reward (4 items) and (2) active management-by-exception (4 items). The questionnaire is scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (frequently, if not always). LOCI leaders rate themselves to which they engage in specific behaviors measured by the MLQ, and therapists do the same for their LOCI leader. The MLQ has good to excellent psychometric properties with Cronbachâ€™s alphas ranging from .76 to .90.
