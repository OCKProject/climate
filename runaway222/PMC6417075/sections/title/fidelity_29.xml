  <span class="italic">TF-CBT Brief Practice Fidelity Checklist</span> is an adjusted version of the TF-CBT checklist [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. The checklist is scored as “child session,” “caregiver session,” or “child and caregiver session.” It is measured from 0 “Not Used,” 1 “Medium Extensiveness,” to 3 “High Extensiveness”. Each TF-CBT component must be addressed in the right order (if there are no therapeutic decisions on excluding a component, or to change the order of the practice), and the therapist needs to progress from one component to the next within “a reasonable time period given that the treatment should be completed within 16 sessions for usual cases and up to 20 for complex cases” [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Also, therapists must include parallel work with caregivers. The TF-CBT brief practice fidelity checklist will be validated during the project.
