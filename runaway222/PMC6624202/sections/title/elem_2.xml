Comparison with thawing degree days derived from the MODIS-based land surface temperature (LST) product MOD11A1 V6 show that the variation observed across the sites during the study period represents the variation seen in the region from 2001–2017 (Supplementary Fig.

   </span>. The characteristics of the archaeological deposits were modelled based on the site-specific observations of porosity, bulk density and total organic content; the total mean of all samples from all sites was applied. Mean daily air temperatures and precipitation rates were used as meteorological input in the model. Air temperature equivalents were derived from the MODIS-based land surface temperature product MOD11A1 V6, in agreement with previous work

Measured summer soil temperatures and water contents (2017) from the four remaining key sites were used to test the model (Supplementary Figs 8–10 Initially, this was done after adjusting only the meteorological input data to site-specific conditions. However, the soil thermal conductivity proved to be a crucial parameter that had to be calibrated separately for each site. High r
   <span class="sup">2</span> values (0.55–0.97) and low mean differences (−0.65–0.19 °C) for both the calibration and test runs show that the model can describe variations in the overall temperature regimes of the different sites (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). The model also represents accurately the amount of observed TDD (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>), and confirms its overall robustness to describe the amount of energy available during the frost-free period. No significant differences (p = 0.39; paired t-test) are seen between simulated and observed values of soil water contents (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S9</a>). However, compared to the simulations of soil temperatures, there is a larger discrepancy between simulated and observed values of soil water, especially for the absolute soil water content (Supplementary Fig.

The total observed degradation rate derived from the oxygen consumption measurement was considered to be a sum of three pool-specific rates with turnover times under drained conditions at 5 °C of 1, 50 and &gt;4,000 years, respectively.

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results show that a 2.5 °C (RCP 4.5) and 5.0 °C (RCP 8.5) warming from 2017–2100 could increase mean annual temperatures at the five sites (0.4 m depth) by 0.4–1.0 °C and 1.2–2.6 °C respectively. Depending on the climate change scenario, this will increase the amount of TDD with 196–379 °C or 425–760 °C (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>) and prolong the duration of the frost-free period with 23–75 days or 53–104 days. Currently 0.3–0.8% of the slow OC pool (containing the archaeological OC fraction) is lost per year at 0.4 m. If temperatures increase as predicted, the loss may increase to 0.5–1.1% year
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (RCP 4.5) and 0.8–1.6% year
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (RCP 8.5). As a result, 20–63% of the current slow OC pool in 0.4 m could be lost within the next 80 years (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). When integrated over the upper 0.5 m of the deposits for the same time period, results show that 30–70% of the slow OC fraction could be lost. The most rapid degradation appears to occur in the relatively dry continental inland parts of the study region, where many important remains of the Norse Viking Age settlers are found

   <sub>,</sub> this has little relevance for the loss of significance of archaeological remains. Because very limited knowledge is available concerning the long-term degradation of archaeological materials and artefacts, it is not possible to estimate how long it will take to destroy remains of for example human hair, bone collagen or DNA. However, we expect the loss of OC in the organic deposits to be closely linked to a loss in quality of buried organic artefacts

The degradation rates observed in the Nuuk area are on average 3 times slower than those at Qajaa, and the Nuuk deposits are much thinner (&lt;1 m compared to 3 m). This explains the low heat production potential and confirms that the archaeological deposits in the “warmer” Nuuk area are already significantly degraded.

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model applied here represents considerable progress in developing methods to pinpoint vulnerable sites in the Arctic. Despite the studied deposits varying greatly with respect to origin, age and exposure to different environmental conditions, it was possible to describe the thermal and hydrological characteristics of the deposits using total mean values (mean of all samples from all sites) of porosity, bulk density and total organic content. This, combined with the fact that it was possible to model soil temperatures and the TDD accurately based on globally-available MODIS data (available at 1 × 1 km resolution since 2001), is very promising. However, the projections also reveal considerable uncertainties, especially in relation to modelling the soil water content. As is the case for most parts of the Arctic, no reliable model for regional precipitation and snow currently exists for the study region. Instead, we used data calculated from regressions between site-specific measurements and two official meteorological stations in the area. While producing the best available data, this highlights some uncertainties, especially in the Arctic where local precipitation patterns, wind, topography and aspect may have a great influence on precipitation rates and on snow depths. As a result, thermal conductivity had to be calibrated separately for each site in the model to compensate for uncertainties in soil water. The subsequent simulations were made with current precipitation rates, but using a dynamic snow model. For the Nuuk area, it is predicted that precipitation rates will increase by approx. 10% from 2017 to 2100 while evapotranspiration and runoff are also likely to increase
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span>. We acknowledge that the present-day water balance and vegetation cover may not represent the future accurately.
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One major limitation of the model applied is that it only considers degradation of OC. Although we expect the loss of OC to reflect a loss of organic artefacts, the actual rates of degradation of different types of archaeological materials/artefacts are unknown. Future degradation experiments should therefore include a broad spectrum of organic archaeological materials and artefacts. This would provide the fundamental knowledge needed to improve the model to include differential degradation patterns and ultimately help to predict the time period at which different types of information are lost.</p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Almost 6000 archaeological sites are currently registered in Greenland out of which ~250 are located in our study region. Our results highlight that organic deposits at many of these sites may be damaged or partly lost as soil temperatures and water contents change within the next century. The methods described here may help to identify particularly vulnerable sites and thereby help to direct limited resources to where they are most needed. We acknowledge that this is only a step towards saving these important records of the past. So far, very little has been done to develop methods for mitigation of archaeological sites in the Arctic, and therefore excavation is the only solution for rescuing archaeological remains at risk. Excavations are, however, expensive and time-consuming, and there are no designated funds or programmes for archaeological rescue excavations. Thus, we must also be realistic and acknowledge that it will be necessary to prioritise sites in order to focus limited resources on the most valuable sites.</p>
