The triplicates were placed in vials, which were sealed using a disc of transparent plastic commercial oxygen barrier film (EscalTM), a silicone gasket and a screw cap with an aperture. Oxygen sensor foil (SF-PSt5-1223-01, PreSens) was glued to the inside of the oxygen barrier film, and the OxoDish® readers were placed on top of the vials. The decrease of headspace O

Measurements were first made at 1 °C and then at 5, 10 and 15 °C. Between each run the vials were flushed with atmospheric air. Samples were incubated for 45 days in total. The measured oxygen consumption rates (mg O

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>

When the ground was covered by snow, the surface temperature was adjusted by a weighting factor based on thermal conductivities of the upper soil layer and the snow density in addition to the thickness of both layers. Snow was modelled by assuming that precipitation consisted only of snow when air temperatures were below 0.5 °C. The duration of the snow cover season was adjusted based on images captured daily by automatic cameras installed at three of the sites. As no snow depth measurements were made at the study sites, we tested the snow model using data from the Nuuk Basis research station
