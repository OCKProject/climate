 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model applied here represents considerable progress in developing methods to pinpoint vulnerable sites in the Arctic. Despite the studied deposits varying greatly with respect to origin, age and exposure to different environmental conditions, it was possible to describe the thermal and hydrological characteristics of the deposits using total mean values (mean of all samples from all sites) of porosity, bulk density and total organic content. This, combined with the fact that it was possible to model soil temperatures and the TDD accurately based on globally-available MODIS data (available at 1 × 1 km resolution since 2001), is very promising. However, the projections also reveal considerable uncertainties, especially in relation to modelling the soil water content. As is the case for most parts of the Arctic, no reliable model for regional precipitation and snow currently exists for the study region. Instead, we used data calculated from regressions between site-specific measurements and two official meteorological stations in the area. While producing the best available data, this highlights some uncertainties, especially in the Arctic where local precipitation patterns, wind, topography and aspect may have a great influence on precipitation rates and on snow depths. As a result, thermal conductivity had to be calibrated separately for each site in the model to compensate for uncertainties in soil water. The subsequent simulations were made with current precipitation rates, but using a dynamic snow model. For the Nuuk area, it is predicted that precipitation rates will increase by approx. 10% from 2017 to 2100 while evapotranspiration and runoff are also likely to increase

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One major limitation of the model applied is that it only considers degradation of OC. Although we expect the loss of OC to reflect a loss of organic artefacts, the actual rates of degradation of different types of archaeological materials/artefacts are unknown. Future degradation experiments should therefore include a broad spectrum of organic archaeological materials and artefacts. This would provide the fundamental knowledge needed to improve the model to include differential degradation patterns and ultimately help to predict the time period at which different types of information are lost.</p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Almost 6000 archaeological sites are currently registered in Greenland out of which ~250 are located in our study region. Our results highlight that organic deposits at many of these sites may be damaged or partly lost as soil temperatures and water contents change within the next century. The methods described here may help to identify particularly vulnerable sites and thereby help to direct limited resources to where they are most needed. We acknowledge that this is only a step towards saving these important records of the past. So far, very little has been done to develop methods for mitigation of archaeological sites in the Arctic, and therefore excavation is the only solution for rescuing archaeological remains at risk. Excavations are, however, expensive and time-consuming, and there are no designated funds or programmes for archaeological rescue excavations. Thus, we must also be realistic and acknowledge that it will be necessary to prioritise sites in order to focus limited resources on the most valuable sites.</p>
