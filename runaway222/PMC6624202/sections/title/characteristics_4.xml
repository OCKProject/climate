 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil pits were made at all study sites to obtain soil samples for measuring the physical and chemical properties, as well as the degradability of the archaeological deposits. Measurements of porosity, loss on ignition and soil bulk density were conducted on a total of 22 samples from seven sites (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). The site mean porosities ranged from 71–82 vol.% with a total mean = 77.1 ± 2.9 vol. % (±1 s.d., n = 7), the site mean loss on ignition varied between 18 and 39 wt% dw
  <span class="sup">−1</span> with a total mean = 30.3 ± 6.5 wt% dw
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (±1 s.d., n = 7) and the site mean bulk densities varied from 254–673 kg m
  <span class="sup">−3</span> with a total mean = 458 ± 120 kg m
  <span class="sup">−3</span> (±1 s.d., n = 7). Loss on ignition and bulk densities showed considerable variations within and across sites (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>).

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The thermal conductivity (
  <span class="italic">kh</span>) and heat capacity (
  <span class="italic">hc</span>) were measured 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> (unfrozen conditions) at the five key sites (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>). The variation of 
  <span class="italic">kh</span> and 
  <span class="italic">hc</span> was just as much within study sites as between sites, with variations significantly positively correlated to the soil water content (linear regression for 
  <span class="italic">kh</span>: r
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.70, p &lt; 0.01, n = 46; linear regression for 
  <span class="italic">hc</span>: r
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.68, p &lt; 0.01, n = 46) (Supplementary Fig.

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The degradation potential of the archaeological deposits was investigated using the oxygen consumption method
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Measurements were made on 17 depth-specific samples from the five key sites at 1, 5, 10 and 15 °C (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>). This was done in four separate runs from low to high temperatures with a total incubation time of 45 days. Site mean rates at 5 °C varied between 0.01 and 0.03 mg O

  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>). Oxygen consumption rates showed considerable variations within and across sites. A significant increase in reactivity with increasing temperature was observed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>; Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). The increase in oxygen consumption per 10 °C temperature change (the Q
  <sub>10</sub> value) varied between 1.5 and 2.7 with a mean value of 2.3 ± 0.4 (±1 s.d., n = 17) which agrees with previous studies of both organic archaeological deposits and permafrost-affected soils
