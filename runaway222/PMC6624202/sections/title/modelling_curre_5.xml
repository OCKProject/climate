  </span>. This model has previously been used to investigate the importance of microbial heat production on permafrost thawing and degradation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in Arctic soils, including an organic archaeological deposit
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. The characteristics of the archaeological deposits were modelled based on the site-specific observations of porosity, bulk density and total organic content; the total mean of all samples from all sites was applied. Mean daily air temperatures and precipitation rates were used as meteorological input in the model. Air temperature equivalents were derived from the MODIS-based land surface temperature product MOD11A1 V6, in agreement with previous work

  </span>. The model was initially calibrated for 2.5 years of measured soil temperatures and water contents at the site of Kangeq (1
  <span class="sup">st</span> January 2015–31
  <span class="sup">st</span> August 2017) (Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7</a>). Measured summer soil temperatures and water contents (2017) from the four remaining key sites were used to test the model (Supplementary Figs 8–10 Initially, this was done after adjusting only the meteorological input data to site-specific conditions. However, the soil thermal conductivity proved to be a crucial parameter that had to be calibrated separately for each site. High r
  <span class="sup">2</span> values (0.55–0.97) and low mean differences (−0.65–0.19 °C) for both the calibration and test runs show that the model can describe variations in the overall temperature regimes of the different sites (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). The model also represents accurately the amount of observed TDD (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>), and confirms its overall robustness to describe the amount of energy available during the frost-free period. No significant differences (p = 0.39; paired t-test) are seen between simulated and observed values of soil water contents (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S9</a>). However, compared to the simulations of soil temperatures, there is a larger discrepancy between simulated and observed values of soil water, especially for the absolute soil water content (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S10</a>).
