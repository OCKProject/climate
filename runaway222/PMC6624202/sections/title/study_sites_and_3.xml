 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seven archaeological sites are located along a transect stretching from the sea in the West and approx. 120 km inland towards the Inland Ice Sheet to the East (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). They originate from the three main cultures of Greenland: Saqqaq (2,500–800 BC), Dorset (300BC–600AD), and Thule (1,300AD–present), as well as from the Norse Viking Age settlers who inhabited the area from approximately 985–1,350 AD

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate climatic variations in the study region, automated weather stations were installed at five key sites (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Results show that the sites are subject to very different weather conditions, with inland sites having almost twice as many thawing degree days (TDD) as sites at the outer coast. Inland sites received significantly less rain (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The observed variations in precipitation are reflected in soil water contents during the summer. Upper soil layers become drier with increasing distance from the outer coast (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). Comparison with thawing degree days derived from the MODIS-based land surface temperature (LST) product MOD11A1 V6 show that the variation observed across the sites during the study period represents the variation seen in the region from 2001–2017 (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>).
