      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The West African Sahel is defined as the sub-Saharan region that stretches from the
         western coasts of Senegal to the Central-Eastern edges of Chad between 10°N to 18°N.
         Observed daily rainfall records, of ordinary raingauges, weighing bucket and tipping
         bucket gauges
         <span>,</span> were provided by the meteorological services and agencies of the WASCAL member countries
         (
         <span>www.wascal.org</span>) following specific data sharing policies 
         <a>[1]</a>. This database was complemented by daily measurements from the Global Historical
         Climatology Network 
         <a>[2]</a> and the AMMA database (African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis 
         <a>[3]</a>). The daily rainfall time series (1960–2010) from synoptic, climate, agro-meteorological,
         and rainfall stations are assessed for quality and consistency before extreme values
         are extracted. This was achieved by checking erroneous measurement values (e.g., negative
         precipitation, temporal sequences with the same measurement value), dates and coordinates.
         The generation of multiple data plots enabled a comprehensive visual inspection of
         each time series. In combination with local meteorological knowledge and experience,
         the outliers, mostly caused by data entry typesetting errors, are identified and deleted
         
         <a>[4]</a>. Daily rainfall records are not interpolated when records are missing. Only the 72
         longest time series, from different rain gauge types well-spread over the study area
         (
         <a>Fig. 1</a>), were selected to extract the datasets of daily rainfall extremes above the 90th,
         95th, and 99th percentiles of each rainy season.
