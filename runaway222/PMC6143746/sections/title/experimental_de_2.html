      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scheme for the identification of extreme rainfall events was described by Salack
         et al. 
         <a>[1]</a>. In this article a brief summary of this method is given. To extract precipitation
         measurements above the 99th (95th, 90th) percentile for each station, a vector of
         daily rainfall values RR (RR ≥ 1 mm) of each year was created and sorted in ascending
         order for each station. Then, we multiply 99% (95%, 90%) by the total number of those
         values of this vector to generate a rank index. The rank index is used to extract
         the corresponding value from the ordered vector based on the 99th (95th, 90th) percentile
         threshold value. The latter is used to extract all extreme rainfall events (ERE) greater
         or equal to it in each season׳s record. It is an improved peak-above-threshold method.
         Each ERE case(s) of a season is (are) identified with respect to the date(s)-of-occurrence
         (DTO) (DOY), the corresponding week(s)-of-the-year (WOY) and the daily amount(s) (INT).
         At each rain gauge location (longitude, latitude), any daily accumulated rainfall
         amount is considered as extreme rainfall if it belongs to the class of ERE which is
         greater than or equal to the 99th (95th, 90th) percentile (
         <a>Fig. 2</a>).
