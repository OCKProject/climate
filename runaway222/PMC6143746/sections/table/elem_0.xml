This was achieved through checking for erroneous measurement values dates and coordinates. A comprehensive visual inspection in combination with local meteorological expert knowledge and experience enabled the identification of outliers. Daily rainfall records were not interpolated when records are missing. Only the longest homogeneous time series, from 72 sites are processed.</span>
