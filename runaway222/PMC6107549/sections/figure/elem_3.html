         <p>(a) (top panel): The ratios of the first moments (
            <span>S</span><sub>1</sub>(Δ
            <span>t</span>)) to RMS moments (
            <span>S</span><sub>2</sub>(Δ
            <span>t</span>)
            <span>1/2</span>) for the same data used in Fig. 
            <a>2b</a>. The slopes give the exponent 
            <span>aC</span><sub>1</sub> (see the text). Using estimates of 
            <span>a</span> = 0.86 (see Methods), reference lines with various intermittency exponents 
            <span>C</span><sub>1</sub> are shown. Gaussian processes are independent of scale Δ
            <span>t</span>, they would lie along the dashed line. Since each curve is from 
            <span>ratios</span> of statistics taken from data at different resolutions, we do not expect that the
            separate curves will be part of a single overall curve as they were in Fig. 
            <a>1</a>. (b) (bottom panel): The same as (
            <span>a</span>) but for the transects used in Fig. 
            <a>2c</a>.
