  <p>(a) (top panel): The probability distribution for absolute changes in the time series of Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a> are shown. For clarity, they have been shifted to the right by factors left to right, respectively: 10, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32). As discussed in Methods, reference lines give estimates of −

   </sub> indicated in the figure and in Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>. Also shown for reference (dashed curves) are the Gaussian distributions that give the same mean and standard deviations. (b) (bottom panel): The same as (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) but for the transects used in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>. Note that there plausible arguments that numerical model outputs and reanalyses (the two middle curves) tend to be too smooth and to underestimate extremes; this might explain some of the larger
