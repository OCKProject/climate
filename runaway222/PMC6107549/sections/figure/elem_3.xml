 <div class="caption">
  <p>(a) (top panel): The ratios of the first moments (
   <span class="italic">S</span>
   <sub>1</sub>(Δ
   <span class="italic">t</span>)) to RMS moments (
   <span class="italic">S</span>
   <sub>2</sub>(Δ
   <span class="italic">t</span>)
   <span class="sup">1/2</span>) for the same data used in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>. The slopes give the exponent 
   <span class="italic">aC</span>
   <sub>1</sub> (see the text). Using estimates of 
   <span class="italic">a</span> = 0.86 (see Methods), reference lines with various intermittency exponents 
   <span class="italic">C</span>
   <sub>1</sub> are shown. Gaussian processes are independent of scale Δ
   <span class="italic">t</span>, they would lie along the dashed line. Since each curve is from 
   <span class="italic">ratios</span> of statistics taken from data at different resolutions, we do not expect that the separate curves will be part of a single overall curve as they were in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. (b) (bottom panel): The same as (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) but for the transects used in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>.
