         <p>A multifractal simulation of a 2048 point series (lower left) with spike plot (upper
            left), and the corresponding spectrum (black, right). In the spike plot, the lower
            horizontal line corresponds to the maximum expected for a Gaussian process, the top
            dashed line indicates the 10
            <span>−10</span> probability level. This realization was one of 5000 that were made with multifractal
            parameters 
            <span>H</span> = 1/3, C
            <sub>1</sub> = 0.05, α = 1.8 (see Methods and Table 
            <a>1</a>). The smooth blue curve is the ensemble average of the process (with theory and numerics
            superposed: they cannot be distinguished). Above the blue curve, is an orange 2 standard
            deviation curve, and (red), 3, 4 standard deviation curves (probabilities 0.1%, 0.003%
            respectively). The arrows indicate spikes with Gaussian
