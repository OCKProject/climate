         <p>(a) (top panel): Temperature spike plots for weather, macroweather, climate (left
            to right) and time and space (top and bottom). The solid horizontal black line indicates
            the expected maximum for a Gaussian process with the same number of points (360 for
            each with the exception of the lower right which had only 180), the dashed lines are
            the corresponding Gaussian probability levels 
            <span>p</span> = 10
            <span>−6</span>, 
            <span>p</span> = 10
            <span>−9</span>, two of the spikes exceed 14; 
            <span>p</span> &lt; 10
            <span>−77</span>. The upper left is Montreal at 1 hour resolution (data set #3; these numbers refer
            to Table 
            <a>1</a>), upper middle, Montreal at 4 month resolution (#4), upper right, GRIP at 240 year
            resolution (#5), lower left, aircraft at 280 m resolution (#9), ECMWF, space, one
            month, 1° in space (#11), Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20 CR), 140 year res, 2° in
            space at 45°N, (#12). (
            <span>b</span>) (middle panel): Left: similar to (
            <span>a</span>) but for time only, and all series have 1000 points; the original series (normalized
            by their standard deviations and displaced vertically by 15 units for clarity) are
            shown on the right in the corresponding order. Bottom to top: The data are from sets
            #1,#2, #3, #4, #5, #7, #8 (Table 
            <a>1</a>). The “mC” and “MC” are for macro and mega climate respectively. The solid horizontal
            lines are the Gaussian levels corresponding to probability of 10
            <span>−3</span>, the dashed lines are for 10
            <span>−6</span>, 10
            <span>−9</span>. (c) (bottom panel): Same as (
            <span>a</span>) but for transects, bottom to top: length 1000 (aircraft, data #9), daily reanalysis
            (360 points, #10), monthly reanalysis, #11, 360 points, 140 year resolution, #12,
            180 points.
