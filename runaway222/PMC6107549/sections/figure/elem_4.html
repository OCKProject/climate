         <p>(a) (top panel): The probability distribution for absolute changes in the time series
            of Fig. 
            <a>2b</a> are shown. For clarity, they have been shifted to the right by factors left to right,
            respectively: 10, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32). As discussed in Methods, reference lines give
            estimates of −
            <span>q</span><sub><span>D</span></sub> indicated in the figure and in Table 
            <a>2</a>. Also shown for reference (dashed curves) are the Gaussian distributions that give
            the same mean and standard deviations. (b) (bottom panel): The same as (
            <span>a</span>) but for the transects used in Fig. 
            <a>2c</a>. Note that there plausible arguments that numerical model outputs and reanalyses
            (the two middle curves) tend to be too smooth and to underestimate extremes; this
            might explain some of the larger 
            <span>q</span><sub><span>D</span></sub> values (for weather and macroweather).
