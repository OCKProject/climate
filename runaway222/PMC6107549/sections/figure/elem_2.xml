  <p>A multifractal simulation of a 2048 point series (lower left) with spike plot (upper left), and the corresponding spectrum (black, right). In the spike plot, the lower horizontal line corresponds to the maximum expected for a Gaussian process, the top dashed line indicates the 10
   <span class="sup">−10</span> probability level. This realization was one of 5000 that were made with multifractal parameters 
   <span class="italic">H</span> = 1/3, C
   <sub>1</sub> = 0.05, α = 1.8 (see Methods and Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The smooth blue curve is the ensemble average of the process (with theory and numerics superposed: they cannot be distinguished). Above the blue curve, is an orange 2 standard deviation curve, and (red), 3, 4 standard deviation curves (probabilities 0.1%, 0.003% respectively). The arrows indicate spikes with Gaussian
