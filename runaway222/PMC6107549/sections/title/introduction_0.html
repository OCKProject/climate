      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quasi-oscillatory model of atmospheric variability was first clearly articulated
         at the dawn of the paleo climate revolution by M. Mitchell
         <span><a>1</a></span> who admitted that it was largely “an educated guess”. In spite of weak empirical
         support, it survived because even sophisticated analysis techniques were only applied
         over narrow ranges of scale so that the bigger picture was obscured. In addition,
         analyses were not sufficiently 
         <span>simple</span>. Figure 
         <a>1a</a> spanning over 17 orders of magnitude in time (updated from
         <span><a>2</a></span>), clearly and simply shows how temperature and paleo temperatures vary with time
         scale; Fig. 
         <a>1b</a> shows examples of corresponding spatial statistics which are also scaling over large
         ranges.

               <p>(a) (top panel): A wide scale range composite of temporal Root Mean Square (RMS) Haar
                  temperature fluctuations with the data described in Table 
                  <a>1</a> in thick lines (from left to right, the solid curves are data set #1, bottom, #2,
                  top #3), #4, #5, #7, #8). The dashed lines are reproduced from ref.
                  <span><a>2</a></span> left to right, datasets #2, #6, #7, #8. Here as in b, the fluctuations were multiplied
                  by the canonical calibration constant of 2 so that when the slopes are positive, the
                  fluctuations are close to difference fluctuations. The various scaling regimes are
                  indicated at the bottom. (b) (bottom panel): Same as (
                  <span>a</span>) but for spatial transects. The bottom aircraft (data set #9) and top (daily resolution,
                  data set #10) data are in the weather regime (“W”), the line labelled “M” is in the
                  macroweather regime (data set #11), and the one labelled (“C”), the climate regime
                  (data set #12, see Table 
                  <a>1</a> for details). At scales &gt;≈2500 km, the aircraft fluctuations from a single flight,
                  have a dip caused by poor statistics. The breaks in the other (weather, macroweather
                  and climate) transects only occur at scales of about 10,000 km (upper right).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">New clarity was possible thanks to the rejuvenation of a fluctuation definition first
         proposed over a century ago
         <span><a>3</a></span>. For a time series 
         <span>T</span>(
         <span>t</span>), the Haar fluctuation Δ
         <span>T</span>(Δ
         <span>t</span>) over a time scale Δ
         <span>t</span>, is simply the difference between the average of the first and second halves of the
         interval Δ
         <span>t</span>. Although technically, the Haar fluctuation is a wavelet, one doesn’t need any knowledge
         of wavelets to use them. The utility of the Haar fluctuation is not only that it is
         easy to define and implement numerically - even on series with missing data - but
         rather that its 
         <span>interpretation</span> is simple. In regimes where the average fluctuations Δ
         <span>T</span>(Δ
         <span>t</span>) increase with scale Δ
         <span>t</span>, it is nearly the same as the difference 
         <span>T</span>(
         <span>t</span>) − 
         <span>T</span>(
         <span>t</span> − Δ
         <span>t</span>), in regimes where the average fluctuation decreases with scale, it is nearly the
         same as the anomaly – the average value of segments of length Δ
         <span>t</span> of a series whose mean has been removed
         <span><a>4</a></span>. The Haar fluctuations are adequate as long as the fluctuation exponent 
         <span>H</span> is in the range −1 to 1 and this includes nearly all geophysical series (time) and
         transects (space; see below). With Haar fluctuations, wide scale range composites
         are both easy to produce and to interpret.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yet, this is more than just new picture for classifying atmospheric variability. In
         this paper, we explore some of its consequences: extremes, sparseness, spurious spectral
         spikes, oscillations, outliers and tipping points.
