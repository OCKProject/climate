      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following are detailed descriptions of the data described in Table 
         <a>1</a> and analyzed in the text. In Fig. 
         <a>1a</a> the solid lines are analyzed over the ranges indicated; the dashed lines are from
         the same sources but analyzed over wider scale ranges. The dashed and solid analyses
         of data # 2 differ lightly due to different daily and annual detrendings,

               <p>A series of 97,480 measurements from a thermistor (about 1 mm in size) that were taken
                  at 15 Hz, from a location 0.44 m above the roof of the Physics building, McGill University,
                  Montreal. The data was broken into 270 segments 24 s long.

               <p>Hourly temperature data from a station in Lander, USA (2006–2009). The data were detrended
                  daily and annually and 144 sections (20 days each) were analyzed: 144 × 240 = 34,560
                  points in all.

               <p>Hourly temperature data from a station in Montreal, Canada (2000–2016). The data were

                  <span>th</span> Century Reanalysis (2° × 2°, monthly resolution) from 1871–2011 were used
                  <span><a>19</a></span>. Data from 0 to 40 °N (21 latitude bands, 180 longitude bands) were broken into five
                  28 year segments (=336 months each), a total of 21 × 180 × 5 × 336 = 6,350,400 points.
                  28 years is roughly the longest possible without the low frequencies being dominated
                  by anthropogenic warming.

                  with a series 1032 points long (87,720 years). For analysis, this was broken into
                  20,000 year segments (the rough limit of the climate regime).

                  ref.

                  calibration. The data from the first 6.85 million year were averaged to a 5,000 year
                  resolutions (with only 3 missing data points being interpolated), 1,368 points in
                  all. To avoid the larger scale mega-climate regime, this was then segmented into 8
                  segments each 855,000 years long to roughly represent the macroclimate period. The
                  full length of the series was analyzed in ref.

                  <a>5a</a>), the range was broken into 1000 intervals (553 k year resolution) and the missing
                  data was filled by linear interpolation. For the scaling exponents, the data was further
                  degraded to 1.54 M year resolution to avoid the macroclimate regime at small scales
                  (Fig. 
                  <a>1a</a> which also shows the full analysis from ref.
                  <span><a>2</a></span>, where it is indicated by a dashed line). The temperature calibration was the recommended
                  value −4.5 °C/mil. This was the only series with significant interpolation (visible
                  in Fig.
