      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
         <a>2</a> shows that superficially routine series and transects can hide enormous nonclassical
         statistical variability. Until revealed by the spike plots, these fluctuations are
         virtually invisible yet they do not hide from spectral analysis which is highly sensitive
         to jumps. To explore this, we made a sample of 5000 realizations of a mildly intermittent
         multifractal process with parameters similar to those of the spiky regimes in Fig. 
         <a>2</a>, see Table 
         <a>1</a> and Methods; here 
         <span>H</span> = 0.33, 
         <span>C</span><sub>1</sub> = 0.05, α = 1.6 and each realization had 2048 points. Figure 
         <a>3</a> (bottom left) shows one of the simulations and the corresponding spike plot (top
         left) confirming that while the process itself is apparently only weakly variable
         (bottom left), it is nevertheless highly spiky and non-Gaussian with two of the spikes
         having Gaussian 
         <span>p</span> ≪ 10
         <span>−9</span>. The spikiness is well detected by the spectral analysis which itself has spikes.
         The spectrum (the black curve) is of a single realization, it is a “periodogram” obtained
         with a standard Hanning window. The right panel of Fig. 
         <a>3</a> reveals that with respect to the ensemble averaged spectrum (over 5000 periodograms
         from the same process, smooth, blue), nearly a dozen spectral spikes exceeded the
         conventional 2 standard deviation significance level (the arrows), with some exceeding
         the 4 standard deviation level (
         <span>p</span> ≈ 10
         <span>−5</span>). Although to make our point, we subjectively chose one of the more extreme of the
         first 50 simulations, this mild selection effect cannot explain the numerous strong
         spectral spikes. However, these spikes were to be expected since for each frequency,
         the tail of the probability distribution of the Fourier components was found to be
         a power law (here with exponent 
         <span>q</span><sub><span>D</span></sub> ≈ 5, see below).

               <p>A multifractal simulation of a 2048 point series (lower left) with spike plot (upper
                  left), and the corresponding spectrum (black, right). In the spike plot, the lower
                  horizontal line corresponds to the maximum expected for a Gaussian process, the top
                  dashed line indicates the 10
                  <span>−10</span> probability level. This realization was one of 5000 that were made with multifractal
                  parameters 
                  <span>H</span> = 1/3, C
                  <sub>1</sub> = 0.05, α = 1.8 (see Methods and Table 
                  <a>1</a>). The smooth blue curve is the ensemble average of the process (with theory and numerics
                  superposed: they cannot be distinguished). Above the blue curve, is an orange 2 standard
                  deviation curve, and (red), 3, 4 standard deviation curves (probabilities 0.1%, 0.003%
                  respectively). The arrows indicate spikes with Gaussian

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Imagine that we performed a spectral analysis, but didn’t know what to expect; e.g.
         an early analysis of ice core paleo temperatures. Encouraged by the idea that variability
         is synonymous with oscillations (e.g. the NOAA paleo-data website states that “because
         a particular phenomenon is called an oscillation, it does not necessarily mean there
         is a particular oscillator causing the pattern. Some prefer to refer to such processes
         as variability”, cited in ref.
         <span><a>2</a></span>), we might attempt to find a physical interpretation for some of the stronger spectral
         spikes. This temptation would be strengthened by the finding that some spikes are
         broad whereas (Gaussian) theory leads us to expect nearly independent Fourier components.
         Using sophisticated statistical methods such as multi-taper analysis (MTA) or singular
         spectral analysis (SSA), we could estimate the precise positions of the spectral spikes
         (see e.g. ref.
         <span><a>9</a></span>). With this, we could judge their statistical significance. The conventional null
         hypothesis is that the background residuals are autoregressive order 1 Gaussian processes.
         For many of the spikes in Fig. 
         <a>3</a>, we could reject this null hypothesis with very highly levels of confidence. For
         example, out the 100 lowest Fourier components shown, 10 would be significant at the
         95% level (the arrows) and one would have a probability of less than 10
         <span>−6</span>. With a confidence level exceeding 99.9999%, we would be sorely tempted to postulate
         that we had uncovered strong evidence for the presence of a new quasi-periodic process.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is tempting to conclude that many ephemeral (and presumably spurious) claims of
         oscillatory atmospheric (and other) processes might have been consequences of fast
         computers, Fast Fourier Transforms, combined with inappropriate null hypotheses.
