      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The emerging picture of atmospheric dynamics is based on processes acting over wide
         ranges of scale occasionally interspersed with narrow scale range, quasi periodic
         processes, most notably the daily, annual and Milankovitch cycles. This picture not
         only clarifies the distinction between weather, macroweather and climate, it has implications
         for our understanding of spectra, intermittency and extremes. To make these obvious,
         we introduced spike plots that highlight hidden extreme jumps in series and transects,
         showing that the only regime plausibly compatible with Gaussian assumptions was macroweather
         in time. Unsurprisingly, Fourier analysis is sensitive to these jumps so that we expected
         (and found) random spikes in Fourier space (spectra) as well, potentially explaining
         numerous ephemeral claims of quasi-periodic behaviour.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spikes have two features: they are clustered, occurring on sparse fractal sets,
         and their probability distributions have “fat” power law tails. Both features can
         be quantified by a codimension function 
         <span>c</span>(γ) that quantifies how the sparseness changes with resolution, and is itself determined
         by three parameters. The first was quantified by estimating the exponent 
         <span>C</span><sub>1</sub> from the variation of the ratio of the first and RMS moments, another (α) by the
         curvature of 
         <span>c</span>(γ), and a final parameter (
         <span>q</span><sub><span>D</span></sub>) from log-log plots of the probabilities of exceeding thresholds. We argued that
         in the atmosphere, strong intermittency and extreme black swan events are ubiquitous
         and that this has numerous consequences including for spectral analysis and for distinguishing
         “normal”, “expected” extremes from tipping points.
