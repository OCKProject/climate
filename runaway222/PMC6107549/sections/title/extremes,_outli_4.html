         <span>c</span>(γ) quantifies the 
         <span>rate</span> at which – due to the clustering - the spike levels λ
         <span>γ</span> build up as a function of the range of scales over which the dynamical processes
         act (eq. 
         <a>3</a>). 
         <span>c</span>(γ) is nonlinear, requiring at least two parameters: the codimension near the mean
         (
         <span>C</span><sub>1</sub>) and the multifractal index α that determines its curvature near the mean (eq. 
         <a>M3</a>). However, it generally requires an additional third parameter 
         <span>q</span><sub><span>D</span></sub> that characterizes the large γ behaviour, i.e. the tails of the probability distributions
         (eq. 
         <a>M8</a>). This is because scaling in space and/or time generically gives rise to power law
         probability distributions (also known as “Pareto” or “fat-tailed” distributions).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To get an idea of how extreme the extremes can be, consider an example with 
         <span>q</span><sub><span>D</span></sub> = 5 (as has been estimated for the wind or temperature going back to ref.
         <span><a>10</a></span> see Fig. 
         <a>5</a> and Table 
         <a>2</a>). With this exponent, temperature fluctuations 10 times larger than typical fluctuations
         occur only 10
         <span>5</span> times less frequently. In comparison, for a Gaussian, they would be ≈10
         <span>23</span> times less likely; they would never be observed. Understanding the nature of the
         extremes is fundamental since it determines our interpretation of large events as
         either extreme - but nevertheless within the expected range, and hence “normal” -
         or outside this range, hence an “outlier” or perhaps even a “tipping point”.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A relevant example is global warming. Over about a century, there has been 1 °C warming
         of the globally averaged temperature - a roughly a 5 standard deviation event (with
         Gaussian probability ≈3 × 10
         <span>−6</span>). In spite of this, climate skeptics claim that it is no more than a Giant Natural
         Fluctuation (GNF) i.e. a change that might nevertheless be normal - albeit extreme.
         The relevant extreme centennial changes are indeed non-Gaussian, and bounding the
         probability tail between power laws with 4 &lt; 
         <span>q</span><sub><span>D</span></sub> &lt; 6, ref.
         <span><a>11</a></span> showed that the probability of extremes were enhanced by a factor of as much a factor
         of 1000. Yet the GNF hypothesis could nevertheless be statistically rejected with
         more than 99.9% confidence.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the log-log plots shown in Fig. 
         <a>5</a>, we see that - as expected from eq. 
         <a>5</a> - most of the distributions show evidence of log-log linearity near the extremes.
         When judging possible deviations, it could be recalled that due to inadequate instrumental
         response times, post-processing noise reduction procedures (e.g. smoothing) or via
         “outlier” elimination algorithms, that extremes can easily be underestimated. Also,
         several of the distributions in Fig. 
         <a>5</a> are from reanalyses which are numerical model outputs. Since physically, the extremes
         are consequences of variability building up over a wide range of spatial scales, the
         models’ small hyperviscous scale range (truncated at ≈10
         <span>5</span> m rather than at the viscous scale of ≈10
         <span>−3</span> m), effectively truncates the extreme tails. Any of these effects could explain deviations
         from perfect power law tails or might explain some of the larger (i.e. less extreme)
         
         <span>q</span><sub><span>D</span></sub> values in Table 
         <a>2</a>. Finally, while power law probabilities arise naturally in scaling systems, the distributions
         are not 
         <span>necessarily</span> power laws; non-power law (curved tails in Fig. 
         <a>5</a>) may simply correspond to the special cases where

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In any event, for each empirical distribution, Fig. 
         <a>5</a> shows the Gaussian with the same mean and standard deviation (dashed). We see that
         the empirical distributions are generally quite far from Gaussian.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The power law fluctuations in Fig. 
         <a>5a,b</a> are so large that according to classical assumptions, they would be outliers. While
         Gaussians are mathematically convenient and can be justified when dealing with measurement
         errors, in atmospheric science thanks to the scaling, very few 
         <span>processes</span> are Gaussian. Extremes occur much too frequently, a fact that colleagues and I regularly
         underscored starting in the 1980’s (for a review see Table 5.1a,b. in ref.
         <span><a>8</a></span>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At best, Gaussians can be justified for additive processes, with the added restriction
         that the variance is finite. However, once this restriction is dropped, we obtain
         “Levy distributions” with power law extremes, but with exponents 
         <span>q</span><sub><span>D</span></sub> &lt; 2. The Gaussian assumption also fails for the additive but scaling 
         <span>H</span> model
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>12</a></span>. Most importantly, Gaussians are irrelevant for multiplicative 
         <span>processes</span>: these generally lead to power law extremes but without any restriction on the value
         of 
         <span>q</span><sub><span>D</span></sub><span><a>7</a>,
            <a>13</a></span>. Related models include Self-Organized Criticality
         <span><a>14</a></span> and Correlated Additive and Multiplicative noise
         <span><a>15</a></span>. Note that purely multiplicative random 
         <span>variables</span> lead to somewhat less extreme log Levy and lognormal distributions (i.e. the logarithms
         are Levy or Gaussian; for the latter, see
         <span><a>16</a></span> for an early review: their tails are “long” but not “fat”). The enhanced variability
         of multiplicative processes when compared to multiplicative variables is due to the
         singular small scale limit of the former; it has been theorized in the framework of
         multifractal phase transitions
         <span><a>17</a></span>. We could also mention that power law distributions also appear as the special (Frechet)
         case of Generalized Extreme Value Distributions although due to long range statistical
         dependencies, standard Extreme Value theory does not generally apply to scaling processes.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To underscore the importance of nonclassical extremes, Taleb
         <span><a>18</a></span> introduced the terms “grey and black swans”. Originally, the former designated Levy
         extremes, and the latter was reserved for extremes that were so strong that they were
         outliers with respect to any existing theory. However, the term “grey swan” never
         stuck, and the better-known expression “black swan” is increasingly used for any power
         law extremes.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All of this is important in climate science where extreme events are often associated
         with tipping points. The existence of black swan extremes leads to a conundrum: since
         black swans already lead to exceptionally big extremes, how can we distinguish “mere”
         black swans from true tipping points?
