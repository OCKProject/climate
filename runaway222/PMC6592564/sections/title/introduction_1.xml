 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The availability of “Big Data”, i.e. huge and complex datasets, commonly generated by automated data acquisition systems (for example sensor arrays, imaging systems, social networks, search engines, smart meters etc.) is quickly revolutionizing many fields of the mathematical, natural and social sciences. Data scientists have to deal with the increased complexity and size of the data to be processed, developing specific methods, quite different from the ones usually employed in the traditional statistical practice. While other sciences, such as biology [

  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref002">2</a>] are already employing these very advanced techniques, the immense modelling and interpretative power of Big Data Analytics [

  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref004">4</a>] is being discovered right now by economists, behavioural scientists and policy analysts, including those active in energy and climate change research.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change has shown itself to be one of the biggest and most important policy issues of the 21st century, and an important component of the ‘greening’ of economic systems rests on reducing energy demand at the level of households [
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref005">5</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref006">6</a>]. Several programmes aimed at increasing energy efficiency in the residential sector have been tested over the years, ranging from economic and informational interventions, to more psychologically oriented programmes [
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref007">7</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref015">15</a>]. The energy industry has moved towards becoming a provider of energy services, enabling individuals to perceive their energy footprint and act on it. In Europe alone almost 200 million smart meters will be installed by 2020, and they will have the ability to provide users with immediate, high frequency feedback on their energy consumption behaviour. Nonetheless, there is mixed evidence about about the effectiveness of smart meter interventions to reduce energy consumption [
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref016">16</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref020">20</a>], and few high quality and high frequency data bases about smart metering exist. While smart meters and consumer demand response techniques can be used as very powerful policy levers, their actual impact has proven quite difficult to assess.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper we analyse an original dataset, coming from a field experiment of real time electricity feedback through in-home displays carried out in Italy during a period of three years. We address two policy-relevant research questions, concerning energy disaggregation and energy saving devices and techniques. Our overarching goal is that of providing an enhanced understanding of consumer behaviour, and to test on the field to what extent high frequency energy data can deliver both energy savings as well as a shift of consumption over the day. This question is paramount since many programmes are now in place not only to incentivize lower energy consumption, but also to promote a more rational use of energy through the day [
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref021">21</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref022">22</a>]. Currently, typical load curves are characterized by highly variable daily consumption. Being able to smooth energy consumption depending on the available energy sources can provide significant economic benefits, as testified by the significant differences in electricity prices throughout the day, a phenomenon further exacerbated by the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources. High frequency data provides us with temporal consumption patterns which can allow testing for load curve change as a result of having real time feedback. In addition, we assess the drivers of electricity consumption throughout the day, correlating it to household characteristics such as the ownership of electric appliances.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The technique of choice in our case is Functional Data Analysis (FDA) [
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref023">23</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref027">27</a>], a novel branch of Statistics which deals with data that can be represented using a function with some degree of continuity and/or smoothness. The statistical units of FDA are functions, observed in a continuous domain, and lying in a functional space. Thus, FDA is suited at analysing data coming from high frequency readings, such as smart energy meters, or any data with a important temporal dimension. Functional Data Analysis is particularly apt to deal with the intrinsic noisiness of load curves and with their high dimensionality, allowing to detect when during the day a given consumption pattern takes place, and if a reduction in energy consumption is to be attributed to a given appliance or a given set of appliances. Moreover, FDA is able to model not only data curves, but also their derivatives, thus extending the insight one could extract from the data to the rate of change of electricity consumption, an important consideration for the balance of the energy system and the analysis of consumption behaviour. The fitness of FDA techniques in analysing data coming from the energy realm is testified by the presence of some previous works tackling important problems in the energy modelling community, such as the statistical forecasting of demand and supply curves [

  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref030">30</a>], the forecasting of household level consumption curves [
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref031">31</a>], and the analysis of aggregated consumption curves to extract information about households [
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref032">32</a>]. The objective of our work is different with regards of the previous ones: to our knowledge this is the first attempt to use functional testing techniques in the energy modelling realm, and the first attempt to use functional linear models for energy disaggregation.
