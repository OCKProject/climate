 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We were granted access to data from a field experiment implemented by a large European energy utility that took place in the years 2012-2014. The project provided households of a province in central Italy with a display able to yield real time feedback on electricity consumption (N = 1064). This In-Home Display (IHD) informs about instantaneous electric power use, as well as daily, weekly and monthly summaries. The device is also able to show the current billing slot, and the time at which the next slot will enter into force. If a customer enters information about billing, the display is also able to provide feedback on monetary expenditures. The device was delivered over a period of almost two years, with the first deliveries in September 2012, while the full scale experiment began a a year later. For a subset of the families involved in the experiment (N = 425), a survey was carried out by the energy utility to gather further data, especially ownership of 34 electrical appliances, as well socio-demographics. We have three different data sources that were merged together: an “Administrative” dataset, where billing and commercial information about energy clients were provided, a “Load Curves” dataset, where high frequency consumption data for given households and for a variable fraction of the 3 years of the experiment was provided and a “Profilation” dataset, that gave us more detailed information about the structure and appliance ownership of the households involved in the experiment.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Electricity load curves are sampled every 15 minutes, meaning that we have 96 measurements for each day in which consumption was measured, for 1064 households.during approximately two years. The Profilation dataset consists of a survey conducted on a subset of 425 household to gather information about the specific households involved in the project, such as the size of the home they live in, and the type of electric appliances they own. A summary of the data gathered can be seen in Table A in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218702.s001" href="#pone.0218702.s001">S1 File</a>, together with a list of the appliances about which we own ownership data, along with some summary statistics (Table 2 in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218702.s001" href="#pone.0218702.s001">S1 File</a>). In practice, apart from the social and administrative covariates, we have, for the 425 households involved in the survey, a time series of varying length (across the households) of load curves sampled every 15 minutes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combination of high frequency electricity reading with surveys about household characteristics allows us to try answering the following key research questions.</p>
 <div list-type="order" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Do household electric appliances have a specific “load signature” that can be identified in the various consumption curves?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Has the introduction of the smart meter devices affected the energy consumption at the household level, and, if so, does it depend on the type of appliance ownership pattern?</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first question aims at identifying drivers of electricity consumption and its distribution during the day. There are several works in the literature who have looked at the determinants of energy consumption, and some of them include, among other covariates, information about appliance ownership [
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref033">33</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218702.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218702.ref034">34</a>]. However -to the best of our knowledge- the existing literature has not looked at the whole temporal domain of daily energy consumption, but rather has focused on aggregated measures such as mean consumption or maximum and idle consumption. Evaluating the load curves for the whole day is an important advancement, given the wide temporal variability of consumption, prices and environmental impacts, and the complexity of consumption patterns. FDA techniques are naturally apt at this kind of investigation. For the second question, the absence of a control group prevents us from carrying out a fully fledged impact evaluation. Nonetheless, comparing differences in consumption before and after having received the IHD at home allows us to test whether there is a specific role for appliances in the change of behaviour which we attribute to having received the smart meter. Moreover to our knowledge, this is the very first attempt in the literature at identifying correlations between appliance ownership and energy consumption reduction.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main independent variable in our analysis is the ownership of energy technologies, as available from the survey. The stock of energy appliances is an important determinant of electricity use, and most relevant for our analysis, it is likely to influence the temporal distribution of the load curves. We control for other socio-demographics in Section 8 in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218702.s001" href="#pone.0218702.s001">S1 File</a>. We begin by creating meaningful clusters of similar technologies, and then use FDA techniques to evaluate the temporal impact of technology clusters on electricity consumption throughout the day, its rate of change and the impact of having real time feedback in home displays.
