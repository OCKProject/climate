  <p>(
   <span class="bold">A</span>) Comparison of the Pacific SST response (°C per SD) over the present-day (1900–1999; blue bars) and future (2000–2099; orange bars) 100-year periods in the 17 selected models. The four models that simulate an increase in response are grayed out. Error bars in the multimodel mean are calculated as 2 SDs (a 95% confidence interval based on normal distribution) of the 10,000 inter-realizations of a bootstrap method (see “Bootstrap test” section in Materials and Methods). The Pacific SST response is measured by regression coefficients of grid-point D0JF1 equatorial Pacific (5°S to 5°N and 160°E to 90°W) SST anomalies onto the Atl-EOF index (see “Sign-dependent average” section in Materials and Methods).

   <span class="bold">C</span>) Comparison of the occurrence ratio of Atlantic Niño (Atl-EOF index &gt; 0.5 SD) followed by La Niña (Niño3.4 index &lt; −1 SD) over the total Atlantic Niño events (B) and that of Atlantic Niña (Atl-EOF index &lt; −0.5 SD) followed by El Niño (Niño3.4 index &gt;1 SD) over the total Atlantic Niña events (C) over the present-day (1900–1999; 
   <span class="italic">x</span> axis) and future (2000–2099; 
   <span class="italic">y</span> axis) 100-year periods in the 17 selected models. Numbers in the top left (bottom right) indicate the number of models that produce stronger (weaker) impact of Atlantic Niño/Niña on ENSO under future climate.
