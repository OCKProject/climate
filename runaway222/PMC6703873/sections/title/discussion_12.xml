 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, the Atlantic Niño–Pacific Ocean connection is likely to weaken under greenhouse warming, as the midtroposphere warms faster than the near surface, increasing the thermal stability of the atmosphere. This leads to a reduced response of equatorial Atlantic convection to SST anomalies, hence a weakened connection to the Pacific Ocean. Although bias exists in the CMIP5 models, there is no evidence to suggest that either the warm SST bias in the equatorial Atlantic mean state (fig. S9A; intermodel correlation between biases and simulated changes, −0.13) or the bias of Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection itself (fig. S9B; intermodel correlation between biases and simulated changes, 0.01) contributes to the weakened Pacific SST response under future climate. Our result suggests that the recent strengthening in the Atlantic Niño–Pacific Ocean connection may not be induced by greenhouse warming. Furthermore, the projected future increase in the frequency of extreme El Niño and La Niña events (
