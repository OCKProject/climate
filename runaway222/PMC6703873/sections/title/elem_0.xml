 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An Atlantic Niño, characterized by warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the equatorial east Atlantic, typically peaks in boreal summer and is the dominant mode of interannual variability in the equatorial Atlantic (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). Dynamics of an Atlantic Niño are somewhat similar to those of a Pacific El Niño, involving Bjerknes positive feedback. That is, initial warm SST anomalies in the equatorial eastern Atlantic lead to weaker trade winds, driving an eastward propagating equatorial oceanic downwelling Kelvin wave and a deeper thermocline, which, in turn, causes further warming in a coupled oceanic-atmospheric process (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). An Atlantic Niño promotes the occurrence of a Pacific La Niña in the ensuring winter (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>). Specifically, the associated anomalous heating enhances local convections (fig. S1), inducing an intensified Walker circulation with an ascending branch over the Atlantic and a descending branch over the central Pacific during boreal summer (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>). The latter causes equatorial easterly anomalies, triggering Bjerknes positive feedback in the equatorial Pacific, and the development of a La Niña event (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>). The opposite operates for an Atlantic Niña to induce an El Niño.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An El Niño induced by an Atlantic Niña tends to have an anomaly center in the eastern Pacific (
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>), a type of event that is strong in strength and impact. The 1982 and 1997 extreme El Niño, the strongest events of the 20th century, were both preceded by an Atlantic Niña (table S1). The strongest La Niña events over the 20th century, 1988 and 1998, which caused billions in damage and loss of tens of thousands of lives (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>), although associated with heat discharge from the El Niño in the previous year, were both preceded by an Atlantic Niño (table S1). Thus, the equatorial Atlantic forcing of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has provided an additional source of memory for ENSO prediction (
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>). In particular, incorporation of information on equatorial Atlantic SST markedly improves the prediction across boreal spring of major El Niño events (
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>). Therefore, how such Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection may change under greenhouse warming is not only an important scientific issue but also of practical utilities.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection became statistically significant only after the late 1960s or early 1970s (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>). Although early studies (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>) suggested that the post-1970 connection may be linked to the negative phase of Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV), inclusion of recent data shows that the connection persists through to the positive AMV phase since 2000 (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>), possibly associated with decadal variability of a transbasin SST difference (
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>). An issue arises as to whether greenhouse warming contributes to the recent persistent connection. Here, we show that greenhouse warming leads to a weakening impact of Atlantic Niño/Niña on the Pacific Ocean.
