 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The normalized PC time series (defined as Atl-EOF index) was used to represent the temporal variability of Atlantic Niño. Although the Atlantic Niño was the dominant mode (EOF1) of tropical Atlantic in observations, it may appear as the second mode in some CMIP5 models (

  </a>). We thus calculated linear correlation of the leading two PCs and the following D0JF1 equatorial Pacific (5°S to 5°N and 160°E to 90°W) SST anomaly at each grid point, and computed the sign-dependent average correlations. Since the observed Atlantic Niño (JJA0) and Pacific SST (D0JF1) were negatively correlated, the minimum value between the correlation results of the two PCs was taken as a measurement of the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection, with the corresponding 200-year PC time series being the model Atl-EOF index (table S2).
