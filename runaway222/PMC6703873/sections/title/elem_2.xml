  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To depict the observed Atlantic Niño and its impact on the Pacific Ocean, we applied empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to quadratically detrended SST anomalies (see “EOF analysis” section in Materials and Methods) averaged over boreal summer (June, July, and August or JJA0, where “0” refers to current year), in which an Atlantic Niño peaks. This yields a dominant principal pattern, and a principal component (PC) time series scaled to have a standard deviation (SD) of 1. In place of an index commonly taken as an average over a fixed area (

   </a>, 
   <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
    <span class="italic">11</span>
   </a>), we take the PC time series as the Atlantic Niño/Niña index, hereafter referred to as Atl-EOF index. Together with its associated pattern, the Atl-EOF index describes the anomaly pattern and evolution of the Atlantic Niño/Niña.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that the impact on the tropical Pacific reaches a maximum two seasons later (i.e., December, January, and February or D0JF1, where “1” refers to the following year), we measure the evolution of Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection by a correlation between the Atl-EOF index (i.e., PC1 at JJA0) and D0JF1 SST anomalies averaged over the equatorial Pacific (5°S to 5°N and 160°E to 90°W), in sliding 20-year windows with the result recorded in the last year of the window (black curve in 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>). Substantial fluctuations in the connection are seen, culminating in a persistent strong connection since the late 1960s. Considering that the relationship might not be statistically significant over the entire area of the equatorial Pacific, for each 20-year period, we calculated correlations with grid-point D0JF1 SST anomalies, but only significant grid-point correlations are averaged (red points in 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>) (see “Sign-dependent average” section in Materials and Methods). This confirms a persistent connection since the late 1960s.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The persistent connection reflects an important relationship between ENSO events (defined by National Ocean Atmosphere Administration) and the Atlantic Niño events (defined by a 0.5 SD threshold of Atl-EOF index) (table S1). A total of 10 of 17 Atlantic Niño events are followed by La Niña events, including the more extreme events of 1988 and 1998. Eight of 17 Atlantic Niña events were followed by El Niño events, including the 1982, 1997, and 2015 extreme El Niño events. Because of the recent persistent correlation, a statistically significant Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection over the 1900–1999 period is seen in much of the equatorial Pacific (black bar in 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a> and hashed area in 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>). Recent studies have shown that including this equatorial Atlantic influence improves ENSO prediction (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simulation of the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identify CMIP5 models that are able to simulate the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection. As for the observations, we applied EOF analysis to JJA0 SST anomalies quadratically detrended over the full 200 years (1900–2099). This allows our models to have an Atlantic Niño pattern that is different from the observed and different from one model to another. As in our analysis of the observed data, we correlate the Atl-EOF index (JJA0 PC time series) with grid-point D0JF1 equatorial Pacific SST anomalies over the 1900–1999 period, referred to as the present-day climate (see “Model selection” section in Materials and Methods). We use an average correlation over grid points with a significant coefficient to evaluate whether a model is able to simulate the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection (see “Sign-dependent average” section in Materials and Methods). These approaches are adapted to select as many models as possible. A total of 17 models simulate a connection reminiscent of the observed, although the locations of correlation could be different (
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1, B and D</a>). Ten models produce no such connection, whereas six models produce an opposite connection (
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1, B and E</a>), consistent with previous findings that the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection is not simulated by all models (

   </a>–
   <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
    <span class="italic">25</span>
   </a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Atlantic Niño pattern simulated by the 17 selected models is comparable to that in the observation, although they are generally weaker and more equatorially confined than the observed pattern (fig. S2). Our approach is to examine how the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection, as simulated by a model, may change under greenhouse warming. An intermodel relationship shows that correlation over the full 100-year period increases with the maximum of 20-year sliding correlations over the same 100 years (fig. S3). Thus, as in the observed data, the correlation coefficient over the 100-year period is contributed by period(s) of large statistically significant correlation embedded in multidecadal fluctuations. The 17 models in aggregation produce the observed forcing of Atlantic Niño on the Pacific, i.e., an Atlantic Niño leads to a Pacific La Niña and an Atlantic Niña leads to a Pacific El Niño (compare figs. S1 and S4), through the Pacific Bjerknes feedback involving winds, SST, and the thermocline.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compare the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection in the 17 selected models between the present period and the future period (2000–2099). There is no consistent change in variability of Atlantic Niño (fig. S5). For each period, we regress grid-point SST anomalies onto the Atl-EOF index, yielding the response of the equatorial Pacific grid-point SST (D0JF1), per SD of the Atl-EOF time series. We obtain an average of regression coefficients over the grid points with statistically significant correlation coefficients above the 95% confidence level (see “Sign-dependent average” section in Materials and Methods). A total of 13 of 17 selected models, or 76%, generate a reduced response (
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>). Aggregated over the 17 models, there is a reduction of 47.8%, from −0.178°C SD
   <span class="sup">−1</span> in the present-day climate to −0.093°C SD
   <span class="sup">−1</span> in the future climate. This reduction is statistically significant above the 99% confidence level, according to the bootstrap method (see “Bootstrap test” section in Materials and Methods) (fig. S6A), supported by a comparison in the evolution of the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection for the two periods (fig. S4), showing a conspicuous weakening in the connection.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reduced connection translates to a general reduction in Atlantic Niño/Niña events that are followed by Pacific Niña/Niño events. Using 0.5 SD as a threshold to define Atlantic Niño (|Atl-EOF index| &gt; 0.5 SD) events and 1.0 SD to define ENSO (|Niño3.4| &gt; 1.0 SD), most models generate a decreased occurrence ratio of Atlantic Niño (Niña) followed by La Niña (El Niño) in future climate (
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, B and C</a>). This reduction generally translates into a decreased occurrence ratio in future climate in terms of Atlantic Niño followed by strong La Niña or Atlantic Niña followed by strong El Niño (fig. S6, B and C), in which a strong El Niño and strong La Niña is defined as when the amplitude of SST anomalies in their respective centers are greater than 1.5 and 1.75 SDs, respectively (see “E-index and C-index” section in Materials and Methods, describing SST variability at eastern Pacific for strong El Niño and at central Pacific for strong La Niña). Thus, the projected increase in frequency of strong El Niño and La Niña events under greenhouse warming, reported by other studies (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increased tropospheric stability under greenhouse warming also occurs in the equatorial Pacific. In the Pacific, however, this is offset by an increased probability of atmospheric deep convection over the equatorial eastern Pacific, where the fastest warming in the tropics occurs (fig. S8), leading to an increased rainfall response of SST anomalies under greenhouse warming (
   <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
    <span class="italic">26</span>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further confirm the above result by two sets of 20-member experiments using a coupled model of intermediate complexity (see “Model description” section in Materials and Methods), under a control [355 parts per million (ppm), constant] and 4× CO

We analyze the response to the initial condition in the ensuing year.
