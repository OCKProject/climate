 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the seesaw simulations, the temperature response of the Arctic is dominated by the sign of the heat flux imposed on the North Pacific, such that an increase in North Pacific heat flux and SST results in an increase in Arctic temperature, despite an equivalent heat flux into the ocean imposed on the North Atlantic (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The NP-Cool/NA-Warm simulation results in Arctic cooling (−1.88 ± 0.14°C) and sea-ice advance (+4.07 ± 0.21% of total ice fraction), as well as a global cooling of −0.39 ± 0.03°C relative to the control simulation, despite an initial perturbation of 0 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> in the global mean. The NP-Warm/NA-Cool simulation results in an overall more heterogeneous response, with a mean Arctic warming of +0.34 ± 0.22°C and a mean global temperature change of −0.03 ± 0.03°C relative to the control simulation. The difference in the magnitude of the Arctic climate impacts between these simulations in part reflects the non-linear response to positive and negative ocean heat fluxes. Negative perturbations result in a greater temperature response (both globally and in the Arctic) than equivalent positive heat flux anomalies, as can be seen in the single-basin positive/negative heat flux simulations (Figs.

    <p>Surface air temperature anomalies in the zonally redistributed heat flux simulations. The NP-Cool/NA-Warm simulation (

     <span class="sup">2</span> global) compensated with an equivalent positive North Atlantic Q-flux perturbation (+1 W/m
     <span class="sup">2</span> global), such that the net global energy perturbation is zero. The sign of the heat flux perturbations in the NP-Warm/NA-Cool simulation (
