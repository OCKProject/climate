      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The larger net moisture transport into the Arctic in the NP-Warm case results in enhanced
         Arctic surface warming through a number of processes and feedbacks: greater latent
         heat transfer from the subpolar extratropics to Arctic, greater increase in the area
         of low clouds in the Arctic and attendant absorption of infrared radiation, and greater
         amounts of atmospheric water vapor in the Arctic and attendant clear-sky absorption
         of infrared radiation. The relative magnitude of these effects discussed above (2.6 W/m
         <span>2</span> of increased total atmospheric energy convergence, 2.9 W/m
         <span>2</span> of increased cloud-sky surface longwave radiation, 10.7 W/m
         <span>2</span> of increased clear-sky surface longwave radiation, respectively) suggests that all
         three mechanisms play an important role in Arctic warming. There is additionally greater
         sea-ice decline, which increases surface radiation absorption through reduction in
         surface albedo (ice-albedo feedback) (Fig. 
         <a>6</a>). As sea-ice retreats, evaporation increases, driving additional low-cloud formation
         and atmospheric moistening. Changes in moisture transport from the sub-Arctic to the
         Arctic thus plausibly provide the initial driver for Arctic change and these changes
         are then amplified by local processes.

               <p>Schematic of major processes contributing to Arctic surface warming in the NP-Warm
                  and NA-Warm simulations. Enhanced ocean heat flux increases the water vapor and latent
                  heat transport into the Arctic, stimulating sea-ice retreat and an increase in low-cloud
                  formation. The reported values are the mean anomalies integrated for the Arctic region for
                  the NP-Warm simulation (

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What facilitates greater moisture transport into the Arctic in the positive North
         Pacific heat flux perturbation relative to the positive North Atlantic heat flux perturbation?
         Plausible mechanisms include: topographic mediation of atmospheric flow trajectories,
         the different areal extent of the North Atlantic and North Pacific basins and attendant
         impacts on surface albedo and air–sea moisture exchange, or the land–sea configuration
         and associated atmospheric pressure anomalies related to land–sea thermal gradients.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to test the first hypothesis, we ran identical simulations to the NP-Warm
         and NA-Warm cases with global land topography equivalent to a geopotential height
         of sea level (NP-Warm-Notopo, NA-Warm-Notopo). These simulations show an overall similar
         pattern to the heat flux perturbations with realistic land topography (Supplementary
         Figure 
         <a>6</a>), with surface air temperatures in the Arctic more strongly influenced by the positive
         heat flux anomalies sourced from the North Pacific (+3.23°C) than from the North Atlantic
         (+2.43°C) (Table 
         <a>1</a>). The reduction in topographic relief facilitates greater moisture transport from
         mid-latitudes to the Arctic, resulting in a slight increase in annual Arctic surface
         warming in both the NP-Warm-Notopo and NA-Warm-Notopo cases relative to the NP-Warm
         and NA-Warm cases, further supporting the central role of moisture transport as a
         major influence on the Arctic climate response. These results indicate that the atmospheric
         flow patterns influenced by land topography are not the causal mechanism for the greater
         moisture fluxes into the Arctic arising from the North Pacific heat flux anomalies
         (relative to the North Atlantic heat flux anomalies).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to test the second hypothesis, we reconfigured the North Pacific heat flux
         anomaly to an area equivalent to the North Atlantic heat flux anomaly (Supplementary
         Figure 
         <a>7</a>) and ran an additional simulation with a positive heat flux anomaly in the Northeast
         Pacific (NEP-Warm). The NEP-Warm simulation results in a slightly reduced mean Arctic
         and global surface warming (2.55 ± 0.68 and 0.91 ± 0.24°C, respectively) relative
         to the original NP-Warm simulation (3.08 ± 0.20 and 0.95 ± 0.03°C, respectively),
         however, these changes are still greater than the equivalent area NA-Warm case (Table 
         <a>1</a>, Supplementary Figure 
         <a>8</a>). The larger errors associated with the NEP-Warm simulation in part reflects a more
         limited integration window (40–60 yr compared to 40–100 yr for the other simulations).
         However, the global temperature evolution of the NP-Warm and NEP-Warm simulations
         are statistically indistinguishable from one another throughout the entire overlapping
         simulation interval (1–60 yr: Supplementary Figure 
         <a>9</a>). This indicates that the greater area of the North Pacific heat flux relative to
         the North Atlantic heat flux anomaly in the original simulations does not have an
         appreciable effect on the resulting global and Arctic surface temperature response,
         at least in so far as we can ascertain from our simulations here.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Commonalities between the sea-level pressure anomalies in the simulations with no
         topography and realistic land topography provide insight into atmospheric pressure
         patterns that are primarily controlled by land–sea thermal contrasts rather than topography
         (the third hypothesis). Sea-level pressure changes in the NA-Warm simulation produce
         a high-pressure anomaly over the North Pacific that is most pronounced in winter (Supplementary
         Figure 
         <a>10</a>), indicating a general weakening of the Aleutian Low in response to a positive North
         Atlantic heat flux. A stronger Aleutian Low is associated with the transport of warm
         moist air from the North Pacific into the Arctic through the Bering Strait
         <span><a>36</a></span>, whereas a weakened Aleutian Low shifts the North American ridge into the central
         Pacific, where it effectively blocks west-to-east propagating storm systems that carry
         moisture northward
         <span><a>37</a></span>. In contrast, the NP-Warm simulation produces a low-pressure anomaly that extends
         from the Northeastern Pacific into the Arctic during winter.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NP-Warm-Notopo and NA-Warm-Notopo sea-level pressure anomalies result in a more
         homogenous northern hemisphere pattern than the NP-Warm and NA-Warm sea-level pressure
         anomalies (Supplementary Figure 
         <a>11</a>), which exhibit strong differences in their response over the North Pacific. Nevertheless,
         both the NP-Warm and NP-Warm-Notopo simulations do share a common low-pressure ‘breach’
         along the Northeastern Pacific and North American continent that punctures the high-pressure
         ring encircling the Arctic from 45 to 60°N. In contrast, NA-Warm-Notopo exhibits a
         sea-level pressure pattern more in line with a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation,
         with a continuous high-pressure ridge that helps to isolate the Arctic from subtropical
         heat and moisture intrusions.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We thus infer that the land–sea configuration is likely the primary mechanism that
         leads to greater moisture flux into the Arctic in response to the North Pacific heat
         flux anomalies. Some of the asymmetry in the Arctic climate response to North Pacific
         or North Atlantic heat fluxes in our simulations may in part be related to model biases
         or poor representations of cloud physics and shallow convective processes, such as
         the overly strong Pacific center of the wintertime Arctic Oscillation observed in
         many climate models
         <span><a>38</a></span>, or the tendency for models to underestimate moisture intrusions to the Arctic through
         the North Atlantic gateway and overestimate moisture intrusions from the Pacific sector
         <span><a>39</a></span>. However, the fact that much of the total latent heat energy entering the Arctic
         is channeled through the North Atlantic gateway in response to North Pacific warming
         (NP-Warm; Fig. 
         <a>5b</a>) makes it unlikely that this latter factor
         <span><a>39</a></span> can fully account for the asymmetries in the poleward moisture transport in the NP-Warm
         and NA-Warm simulations.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the stronger Arctic temperature response elicited from the North Pacific (in
         comparison to North Atlantic) heat flux anomalies, the global temperature response
         is more sensitive to North Pacific warming and cooling, implying enhanced climate
         sensitivity to SST perturbations in this region (Table 
         <a>1</a>, Supplementary Figure 
         <a>9</a>). However, our simulations do not have bearing on the sensitivity of the Arctic to
         changes in heat fluxes northward of 60°N, which is today a region of high ocean heat
         flux due to deep water formation in the Nordic Seas, and may thus be a potentially
         dynamic region for changes in ocean heat flux in the past
         <span><a>40</a></span>. Nevertheless, changes in ocean heat flux sourced from the North Pacific have been
         largely overlooked as a mechanism for Arctic change in the past, in part due to a
         weaker modern overturning circulation compared to the Atlantic, which results in smaller
         magnitudes of ocean-to-atmosphere heat flux (Supplementary Figure 
         <a>1</a>). However, both paleoclimate data and modeling studies suggest the patterns of ocean
         heat flux and circulation between the North Atlantic and North Pacific may have been
         significantly different or even reversed in the past
         <span><a>41</a></span>. Our simulations suggest that more diffusely distributed ocean heat fluxes in the
         North Pacific may have the capacity to exert stronger influences on global and Arctic
         climate than more concentrated heat fluxes in the North Atlantic through modulations
         in low-cloud cover and poleward moisture transport.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the slab-ocean configuration limits the assessment of ocean feedbacks that may
         amplify or dampen the atmospheric feedbacks outlined here, these simulations highlight
         the strong downwind impacts of ocean thermal anomalies; SST changes in the North Pacific
         can have substantial impacts on the Atlantic sector of the Arctic, and SST changes
         in the North Atlantic can influence the Northwestern Pacific and Pacific sector of
         the Arctic. Our results are broadly consistent with surface air temperature anomaly
         patterns generated in a coupled general circulation model in response to forced SST
         cooling in the North Pacific
         <span><a>42</a></span>. We note that North Atlantic heat flux anomalies result in relatively weak SST anomalies
         in the Northeastern sector of the Pacific in our study, consistent with many model
         studies that exhibit either weak or even reversed temperature anomalies in the Northeastern
         Pacific in response to forced perturbations in North Atlantic circulation
         <span><a>41</a>,
            <a>43</a></span>. In contrast, past SST reconstructions suggest that SST changes of similar magnitudes
         between the North Atlantic and Northeastern Pacific occurred in conjunction with abrupt
         Arctic changes
         <span><a>21</a>–
            <a>23</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>1c</a>), challenging the pervasive assumption that abrupt North Pacific warming events in
         the past were merely a downwind response to North Atlantic ocean circulation changes.
         Collectively, these data and model results may instead point towards unidentified
         mechanisms of North Pacific “regime shifts” that result in amplified SST warming along
         the Northeastern Pacific.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Models predict the greatest SST increases in the North Pacific in the coming century,
         with SSTs up to 3°C greater than equivalent latitudes in the North Atlantic, attributed
         to the shallow North Pacific mixed layer depth, which allows a more rapid equilibration
         with atmospheric temperature increase
         <span><a>19</a></span>. This “North Pacific Rapid Response” may help to provide a mechanistic framework
         for understanding the initiation of rapid SST changes in the North Pacific that coincide
         with the timing of rapid pulses of atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> in the past, as well as the close coupling of SSTs in the Northeastern Pacific with
         trends in atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> over the past 18,000 years
         <span><a>22</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>1c</a>). The North Pacific Rapid Response may act to propagate and amplify the signal of
         radiative forcing through close coupling with Arctic amplification feedbacks.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our simulations suggest that surface ocean warming in the North Pacific may have a
         particularly pronounced effect on Arctic temperature and sea-ice extent, and may help
         to explain the record-breaking Arctic surface warming and sea-ice decline in recent
         years
         <span><a>16</a></span> that accompanied unusually warm ocean temperatures in the Northeast Pacific
         <span><a>17</a></span>. Observational records indicate low clouds have been increasing in the Arctic in
         the past few decades, especially in the Beaufort-Laptev region, and are associated
         with declines in sea ice and warmer surface air temperatures in winter, spring, and
         autumn
         <span><a>34</a>,
            <a>35</a></span>. The North Pacific has been identified as the dominant moisture source to this region
         of the Arctic in recent decades
         <span><a>44</a></span>, where enhanced moisture transport is associated with accelerated sea-ice retreat
         <span><a>45</a>,
            <a>46</a></span>. Furthermore, the unprecedented decline in Arctic sea-ice extent in 2007 has been
         linked to anomalous heat and moisture intrusions from the Northwestern Pacific, through
         an accompanying increase in downwelling longwave radiation
         <span><a>47</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, our experiments reveal a strong global and Arctic climatic dependence
         on the magnitude of water vapor and latent heat transfer from the mid-latitude oceans
         to the Arctic, with accompanying cloud, ice-albedo, and temperature responses that
         enhance Arctic warming. This linkage implies that projections of Arctic climate are
         highly sensitive to subpolar extratropical surface ocean temperature changes, making
         it essential to accurately estimate the magnitude of SST increase likely to occur
         in northern hemisphere oceans in response to rising greenhouse gases. Systematic cold
         biases in North Pacific and North Atlantic SSTs in CMIP5 models
         <span><a>48</a></span> may thus partly lead to an underestimation of Arctic warming and sea-ice decline
         in climate projections, with important ramifications for climate and ecological tipping
         points in the Arctic.
