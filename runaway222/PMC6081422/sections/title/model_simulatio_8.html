      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We employ simulations with the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Community
         Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.0.4
         <span><a>30</a></span>, which incorporates the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model version 4 (CICE4
         <span><a>49</a></span>), the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4
         <span><a>50</a></span>), and the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4
         <span><a>51</a></span>), coupled to a slab ocean. The atmosphere and land components are simulated on a
         0.9° × 1.5° grid, whereas the ice and ocean components are on an approximately 1° × 1°
         grid. A total of 12 simulations are conducted under preindustrial atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations (284.7 ppm) with various modifications to the ocean surface or mixed
         layer heat flux (Q-flux) and land topography (Table 
         <a>1</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use the routine available in the standard CESM download, which uses monthly oceanic
         fields of temperature, salinity, surface velocities, boundary layer depth, surface
         heat flux, melting and freezing fluxes to generate the Q-flux for a specific mixed
         layer depth. The mixed layer is an annual average to balance the seasonal cycle
         <span><a>52</a></span>. We use an 80-year average from a multi-millennia coupled control simulation with
         preindustrial forcing to generate a climatological reference state, which globally
         and annually average to a zero Q-flux. The annual net Q-flux is a small residual of
         a strong seasonal cycle, with the same pattern as the surface heat flux, only with
         a smaller amplitude. In the equilibrium state, the heat flux at the surface and mixed
         layer depth are the same, since the slab-ocean simulation does not allow lateral transport.
         The annual-mean climatological Q-flux compares well with observations and is dominated
         by tropical upwelling regions taking up heat and Western boundary currents, the Nordic
         seas, and the Southern Ocean releasing heat to the atmosphere
         <span><a>31</a>,
            <a>53</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then apply the globally non-zero Q-flux pattern as a negative (i.e., heat flux
         out of the mixed layer depth into the ocean) and positive (i.e., heat flux into atmosphere)
         ocean heat uptake forcing inducing a global warming and cooling. The idealized Q-flux
         anomaly patterns are sine-shaped functions being bound to zero at 30°N and 60°N and
         rising to a maximum value at 45°N. The global imbalance was tuned to +1 W/m
         <span>2</span> and −1 W/m
         <span>2</span> global-equivalent, which implies the Pacific local maximum is smaller (31.5 W/m
         <span>2</span>) than the Atlantic local maximum (54 W/m
         <span>2</span>), since the Pacific area is larger (Supplementary Figure 
         <a>1</a>). We also configured a Q-flux anomaly for the North Pacific that was the equivalent
         area as the heat flux imposed on the North Atlantic to eliminate the potential effects
         of the different areas of the North Pacific and North Atlantic heat flux anomalies
         on global and Arctic climate. The local anomalous Q-flux is in the same order of magnitude
         as the climatological annual-mean flux, but smaller than the local seasonal cycle.
         The mixed layer depth is kept at the climatological control simulation annual average
         (spatially varying).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The naming convention for the simulations is as follows: NP-Warm (North Pacific +1 W/m
         <span>2</span>), NP-Cool (North Pacific −1 W/m
         <span>2</span>), NA-Warm (North Atlantic +1 W/m
         <span>2</span>), NA-Cool (North Atlantic −1 W/m
         <span>2</span>) for the single-basin Q-flux perturbations, and NP-Warm/NA-Cool and NP-Cool/NA-Warm
         denoting the compensating “seesaw” Q-flux perturbations. Simulations were also run
         with the positive ocean-to-atmosphere Q-flux perturbations in each basin with modified
         land topography, such that the global land surface was set to a geopotential height
         of zero (NP-Warm-Notopo and NA-Warm-Notopo). A simulation was run with a positive
         heat flux imposed in the Northeast Pacific that was approximately equivalent to the
         area of the Atlantic heat flux (NEP-Warm).
