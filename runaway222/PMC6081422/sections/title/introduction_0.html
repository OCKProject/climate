      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Arctic (66.6–90°N) is the region experiencing the most rapid increase in surface
         temperature in response to global warming
         <span><a>1</a>–
            <a>4</a></span>; it is projected to warm by about three times the global average in future greenhouse
         gas emission scenarios
         <span><a>4</a></span>. The amplified climate response in the Arctic makes this region particularly susceptible
         to tipping points in both physical and ecological systems in the near future, with
         loss of summer sea ice often argued to be the most imminent
         <span><a>5</a>,
            <a>6</a></span>. Arctic warming and sea-ice decline is progressing at rates faster than most models
         project
         <span><a>7</a></span>, indicating that there are processes contributing to Arctic amplification that are
         not being fully captured in the current generation of global climate models.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The feedbacks underlying Arctic amplification include the ice-albedo feedback, lapse
         rate, and Plank feedbacks, which lead to less efficient re-radiation to space at high-latitudes,
         as well as cloud feedbacks
         <span><a>8</a>–
            <a>11</a></span>. However, the role of the subpolar extratropics in modulating these feedbacks is
         not well-understood. Observed warming of the mid-troposphere in the Arctic indicates
         a role for enhanced atmospheric meridional heat transport in recent Arctic warming
         <span><a>1</a>,
            <a>12</a>,
            <a>13</a></span>, most likely linked to increasing tropical and extratropical ocean temperatures.
         However, it is unclear which ocean regions may dominate this enhanced heat transport,
         and therefore exert the greatest influence on Arctic temperature and sea-ice feedbacks.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decadal-scale modes of variability such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Atlantic
         Multidecadal Oscillation have been implicated in Arctic sea-ice variability
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>14</a>,
            <a>15</a></span>, indicating patterns of ocean-atmospheric variability may affect Arctic climate differently.
         Record-breaking Arctic warming and sea-ice decline has ensued in recent years
         <span><a>16</a></span>, paralleling anomalous ocean warming in the Northeast Pacific
         <span><a>17</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>1a, c</a>). Furthermore, sea surface temperature (SST) pattern formation is predicted to be
         non-stationary in response to changes in radiative forcing, with the most pronounced
         increase in surface ocean temperatures projected to occur in the North Pacific in
         the coming decades to centuries (Fig. 
         <a>1b</a>); an effect attributed to the shallow mixed layer depth that allows fast equilibration
         with the atmosphere
         <span><a>18</a>,
            <a>19</a></span>. We refer to this amplified SST response in the North Pacific on decadal to centennial
         time scales in response to radiative forcing as the ‘North Pacific Rapid Response’
         (as distinguished from slower responses that might occur after adjustment of large
         ice sheets and deep ocean properties). In contrast to the North Pacific Rapid Response,
         SSTs in the subpolar North Atlantic are predicted to remain lower than global averages
         in the coming century due to deeper convection and mixing with cool subsurface waters
         (Fig. 
         <a>1b</a>, e.g., ref.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the observed coupling between abrupt Arctic temperature fluctuations and rapid
         SST changes in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific in the past, and the projected
         asymmetries in SST patterns in the near future, it is important to disentangle the
         relative impacts of changes in ocean heat flux sourced from each basin on Arctic temperature
         and sea ice extent to identify the teleconnections to which the Arctic may be most
         sensitive. Understanding such remote controls on Arctic climate will not only help
         to identify mechanisms that may lead to non-linear Arctic climate response in relation
         to changing SST patterns, but may help to reveal the primary sources of model bias
         that lead to underestimation of Arctic warming and sea-ice decline.
