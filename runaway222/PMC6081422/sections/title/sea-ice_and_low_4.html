      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In both the NP-Warm and NA-Warm simulations, Arctic sea-ice decline is most pronounced
         in regions with the greatest increase in low-cloud formation. Low clouds can be both
         a consequence and cause of sea-ice decline. Low clouds exert two opposing effects
         on the surface radiation budget; firstly, the enhanced albedo of cloud droplets decreases
         surface absorption of incoming shortwave radiation, and secondly, low clouds reduce
         outgoing longwave radiation
         <span><a>3</a></span>. Low-cloud formation in the subpolar extratropics results in a net surface cooling
         through the first mechanism. In the Arctic, however, enhanced low-cloud formation
         results in an overall surface warming effect in winter, spring, and autumn due to
         the second mechanism
         <span><a>32</a></span>. The net change in the cloud radiative effect at the top of the atmosphere may still
         be negative at high latitudes as a result of reflected incoming shortwave feedback
         and cloud brightening in response to increasing temperature
         <span><a>33</a></span>, however, we focus here on the net radiative effects at the surface, given the influences
         on Arctic surface temperature and sea-ice extent.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seasonal trends in sea-ice reveal a strong correlation between sea-ice decline
         and low-cloud formation, as the two patterns covary in all seasons except summer,
         when the radiative effect of low clouds reverses sign (Supplementary Figure 
         <a>2</a>, 
         <a>3</a>). The retreat of sea-ice has been shown to promote low-cloud formation through latent
         heat release and evaporation at the surface
         <span><a>34</a>,
            <a>35</a></span>; thus these two processes are likely coupled and reinforce one another. A linear
         regression of the change in sea-ice area and vertically integrated low-cloud fraction
         shows a high negative correlation between these variables in our simulations (Supplementary
         Figure 
         <a>4</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all simulations, increased ocean heat fluxes to the atmosphere drive decreases
         in mid-latitude cloud cover; changes of opposite sign in heat flux have effects of
         the opposite sign in cloud cover (Figs. 
         <a>3</a> and 
         <a>4</a>). In both the NP-Warm and NA-Warm simulation, the reduction in low clouds over the
         extratropical oceans increases shortwave absorption, further warming the sea surface
         and overlying air, decreasing relative humidity and increasing atmospheric moisture
         content that can be transported poleward.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within the Arctic, the NP-Warm simulation increases the low-cloud formation more (+12.4 ± 0.89%)
         than the NA-Warm simulation (+9.5 ± 0.87%). The effect of low clouds accounts for
         an additional 2.9 ± 0.22 W/m
         <span>2</span> of surface longwave radiative forcing within the Arctic for the NP-Warm simulation
         versus an additional 2.2 ± 0.22 W/m
         <span>2</span> in the NA-warm simulation (calculated as the difference in downwelling longwave radiation
         at the surface between all-sky and clear-sky conditions). Clear-sky downwelling longwave
         radiation also increases more strongly in the NP-Warm case (10.7 ± 0.71 W/m
         <span>2</span>) than in the NA-Warm case (7.3 ± 0.69 W/m
         <span>2</span>). The enhanced longwave radiation contributes to surface warming and sea-ice retreat,
         increasing the net shortwave radiation absorbed at the sea surface through the reduction
         in surface albedo (+1.7 ± 0.42 and 0.9 ± 0.37 W/m
         <span>2</span> for the NP-Warm and NA-Warm simulations, respectively).
