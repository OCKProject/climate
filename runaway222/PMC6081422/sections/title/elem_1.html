         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the seesaw simulations, the temperature response of the Arctic is dominated by
            the sign of the heat flux imposed on the North Pacific, such that an increase in North
            Pacific heat flux and SST results in an increase in Arctic temperature, despite an
            equivalent heat flux into the ocean imposed on the North Atlantic (Fig. 
            <a>2</a>). The NP-Cool/NA-Warm simulation results in Arctic cooling (−1.88 ± 0.14°C) and sea-ice
            advance (+4.07 ± 0.21% of total ice fraction), as well as a global cooling of −0.39 ± 0.03°C
            relative to the control simulation, despite an initial perturbation of 0 W/m
            <span>2</span> in the global mean. The NP-Warm/NA-Cool simulation results in an overall more heterogeneous
            response, with a mean Arctic warming of +0.34 ± 0.22°C and a mean global temperature
            change of −0.03 ± 0.03°C relative to the control simulation. The difference in the
            magnitude of the Arctic climate impacts between these simulations in part reflects
            the non-linear response to positive and negative ocean heat fluxes. Negative perturbations
            result in a greater temperature response (both globally and in the Arctic) than equivalent
            positive heat flux anomalies, as can be seen in the single-basin positive/negative
            heat flux simulations (Figs. 
            <a>3</a> and 
            <a>4</a>; Table 
            <a>1</a>).

                     The NP-Cool/NA-Warm simulation (
                     <span>a</span>) prescribes a negative heat flux perturbation in North Pacific (−1 W/m
                     <span>2</span> global) compensated with an equivalent positive North Atlantic Q-flux perturbation
                     (+1 W/m
                     <span>2</span> global), such that the net global energy perturbation is zero. The sign of the heat
                     flux perturbations in the NP-Warm/NA-Cool simulation (
                     <span>b</span>) are reversed relative to the NP-Cool/NA-Warm simulation. In both simulations, the
                     North Pacific heat flux anomaly dominates the surface air temperature response in
                     the Artic. Gray areas indicate changes not significant at the 95% confidence level

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To elucidate the mechanisms by which the North Pacific dominates the Arctic temperature
            response, we evaluate the climate feedbacks involved in the single-basin heat flux
            experiments. The additional ocean-to-atmosphere heat flux of +1 W/m
            <span>2</span> global-equivalent from the North Pacific (NP-Warm) results in annual surface temperature
            increases ranging from 0.5 to 6°C across the entire northern hemisphere, with warming
            concentrated across the North Pacific Ocean and Arctic (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>). Annual-mean Arctic sea ice is reduced by 7.36 ± 0.54% relative to the control simulation,
            with the greatest decline focused along the sea-ice edge in the Greenland and Barents
            Seas and in the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>). Surface warming is most pronounced in winter months (December–February) and is
            amplified along the North Atlantic sea-ice edge and northern Siberia (Supplementary
            Figure 
            <a>2</a>), where surface temperature anomalies reach 6–7°C in winter. The mean global and
            Arctic temperature anomalies in the NP-Warm simulation are +0.95 ± 0.03 and +3.08 ± 0.20°C,
            respectively.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the NA-Warm simulation elicits a more muted northern hemisphere warming compared
            to the NP-Warm simulation, with reduced surface warming in the Arctic, Northeastern
            Pacific, and North American continent. Annual-mean SSTs increase by 5–6°C near the
            region of modified heat flux, with smaller magnitudes of warming seen elsewhere in
            the northern hemisphere (0.5–3°C) (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>). Annual-mean sea-ice area decreases by 4.98 ± 0.56% relative to the control simulation,
            with the greatest decline in the Beaufort Sea, along the perimeter of northern Alaska.
            The mean global and Arctic temperature anomalies in the NA-Warm simulation are +0.79 ± 0.02
            and +2.12 ± 0.20°C, respectively.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In both the NP-Warm and NA-Warm simulations, Arctic sea-ice decline is most pronounced
            in regions with the greatest increase in low-cloud formation. Low clouds can be both
            a consequence and cause of sea-ice decline. Low clouds exert two opposing effects
            on the surface radiation budget; firstly, the enhanced albedo of cloud droplets decreases
            surface absorption of incoming shortwave radiation, and secondly, low clouds reduce
            outgoing longwave radiation
            <span><a>3</a></span>. Low-cloud formation in the subpolar extratropics results in a net surface cooling
            through the first mechanism. In the Arctic, however, enhanced low-cloud formation
            results in an overall surface warming effect in winter, spring, and autumn due to
            the second mechanism
            <span><a>32</a></span>. The net change in the cloud radiative effect at the top of the atmosphere may still
            be negative at high latitudes as a result of reflected incoming shortwave feedback
            and cloud brightening in response to increasing temperature
            <span><a>33</a></span>, however, we focus here on the net radiative effects at the surface, given the influences
            on Arctic surface temperature and sea-ice extent.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seasonal trends in sea-ice reveal a strong correlation between sea-ice decline
            and low-cloud formation, as the two patterns covary in all seasons except summer,
            when the radiative effect of low clouds reverses sign (Supplementary Figure 
            <a>2</a>, 
            <a>3</a>). The retreat of sea-ice has been shown to promote low-cloud formation through latent
            heat release and evaporation at the surface
            <span><a>34</a>,
               <a>35</a></span>; thus these two processes are likely coupled and reinforce one another. A linear
            regression of the change in sea-ice area and vertically integrated low-cloud fraction
            shows a high negative correlation between these variables in our simulations (Supplementary
            Figure 
            <a>4</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all simulations, increased ocean heat fluxes to the atmosphere drive decreases
            in mid-latitude cloud cover; changes of opposite sign in heat flux have effects of
            the opposite sign in cloud cover (Figs. 
            <a>3</a> and 
            <a>4</a>). In both the NP-Warm and NA-Warm simulation, the reduction in low clouds over the
            extratropical oceans increases shortwave absorption, further warming the sea surface
            and overlying air, decreasing relative humidity and increasing atmospheric moisture
            content that can be transported poleward.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within the Arctic, the NP-Warm simulation increases the low-cloud formation more (+12.4 ± 0.89%)
            than the NA-Warm simulation (+9.5 ± 0.87%). The effect of low clouds accounts for
            an additional 2.9 ± 0.22 W/m
            <span>2</span> of surface longwave radiative forcing within the Arctic for the NP-Warm simulation
            versus an additional 2.2 ± 0.22 W/m
            <span>2</span> in the NA-warm simulation (calculated as the difference in downwelling longwave radiation
            at the surface between all-sky and clear-sky conditions). Clear-sky downwelling longwave
            radiation also increases more strongly in the NP-Warm case (10.7 ± 0.71 W/m
            <span>2</span>) than in the NA-Warm case (7.3 ± 0.69 W/m
            <span>2</span>). The enhanced longwave radiation contributes to surface warming and sea-ice retreat,
            increasing the net shortwave radiation absorbed at the sea surface through the reduction
            in surface albedo (+1.7 ± 0.42 and 0.9 ± 0.37 W/m
            <span>2</span> for the NP-Warm and NA-Warm simulations, respectively).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decompositions of the total northward atmospheric energy transport into the dry static
            energy (sensible heat and geopotential energy terms) and moist (latent heat term)
            energy terms indicate that the total atmospheric northward energy transport into the
            Arctic is larger in the NP-Warm case (0.054 PW) than in the NA-Warm Case (0.043 PW),
            and that this difference is primarily driven by a larger increase in northward latent
            energy transport in the NP-Warm case (0.081 PW) than in the NA-Warm case (0.068 PW)
            (Fig. 
            <a>5a</a>). The increase in northward latent energy transport is partially offset by a decrease
            in dry static energy transport that is similar between the NP-Warm (−0.028 PW) and
            NA-Warm (−0.025 PW) cases. This translates to a total of 2.6 W/m
            <span>2</span> of direct Arctic heating from atmospheric energy convergence in the NP-Warm case
            and 2.1 W/m
            <span>2</span> in the NA-Warm case. Analysis of the longitudinal distribution of the northward latent
            energy transport along the Arctic boundary indicates the dominant regions that this
            latent energy is entering the Arctic in each case (Fig. 
            <a>5b</a>). In both the NA-Warm and NP-Warm cases, the total latent heat transport (i.e., amount
            of moisture intrusion) is enhanced across the Pacific and Atlantic basins relative
            to the control. The NP-Warm simulation shows a greater total latent heat transfer
            across the Arctic boundary through the Atlantic gateway, whereas the NA-Warm simulation
            shows greater total latent heat transfer over Siberia, relative to the NP-Warm case.

                     in the NP-Warm case relative to the NA-Warm case.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A further decomposition of the total atmosphere-integrated latent energy transport
            into the mean and eddy components show that the longitudinal structure of the change
            in total transport follows the change in mean transport (Supplementary Figure 
            <a>5</a>). The eddy transport term shows different longitudinal patterns for each case, with
            the NP-Warm case resulting in greater eddy transport across the North Pacific and
            North American continent, whereas the NA-Warm case shows an increase in eddy transport
            across most latitudes except the Northwestern Pacific and eastern North American continent.
            The longitudinal integral of each term indicates that the mean and eddy changes contribute
            22.9 and 77.1% of the total latent energy transport increase in the NA-Warm Case and
            23.6 and 76.4% in the NP-Warm case.
