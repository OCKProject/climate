      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decompositions of the total northward atmospheric energy transport into the dry static
         energy (sensible heat and geopotential energy terms) and moist (latent heat term)
         energy terms indicate that the total atmospheric northward energy transport into the
         Arctic is larger in the NP-Warm case (0.054 PW) than in the NA-Warm Case (0.043 PW),
         and that this difference is primarily driven by a larger increase in northward latent
         energy transport in the NP-Warm case (0.081 PW) than in the NA-Warm case (0.068 PW)
         (Fig. 
         <a>5a</a>). The increase in northward latent energy transport is partially offset by a decrease
         in dry static energy transport that is similar between the NP-Warm (−0.028 PW) and
         NA-Warm (−0.025 PW) cases. This translates to a total of 2.6 W/m
         <span>2</span> of direct Arctic heating from atmospheric energy convergence in the NP-Warm case
         and 2.1 W/m
         <span>2</span> in the NA-Warm case. Analysis of the longitudinal distribution of the northward latent
         energy transport along the Arctic boundary indicates the dominant regions that this
         latent energy is entering the Arctic in each case (Fig. 
         <a>5b</a>). In both the NA-Warm and NP-Warm cases, the total latent heat transport (i.e., amount
         of moisture intrusion) is enhanced across the Pacific and Atlantic basins relative
         to the control. The NP-Warm simulation shows a greater total latent heat transfer
         across the Arctic boundary through the Atlantic gateway, whereas the NA-Warm simulation
         shows greater total latent heat transfer over Siberia, relative to the NP-Warm case.

               <p>Decompositions of atmospheric energy transport. The total atmospheric energy transport
                  across latitude, decomposed into dry static energy (sensible heat and geopotential
                  energy terms) and moist (latent heat term) energy (
                  <span>a</span>). Control values are in gray (as absolute values), NA-Warm anomalies relative to
                  the control are in red, and NP-Warm anomalies are in blue. Inset shows a blow-up of
                  the difference in the two cases from 60 to 90°N. The increase in latent heat transport
                  dominates the total change in northward atmospheric energy transport, and is greater
                  in the NP-Warm case relative to the NA-Warm case.

                  (66.6°N), depicting the longitudinal distribution of the change in latent heat transport
                  (i.e., moisture intrusions), with the Pacific and Atlantic basins shaded in light
                  gray for reference. The values in the upper right corner depict the total latent heat
                  transfer (integrated throughout the atmosphere) across the Arctic boundary. Control
                  values are the dashed line (as absolute values), whereas the NA-Warm anomalies are
                  in red, and NP-Warm anomalies are in blue

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A further decomposition of the total atmosphere-integrated latent energy transport
         into the mean and eddy components show that the longitudinal structure of the change
         in total transport follows the change in mean transport (Supplementary Figure 
         <a>5</a>). The eddy transport term shows different longitudinal patterns for each case, with
         the NP-Warm case resulting in greater eddy transport across the North Pacific and
         North American continent, whereas the NA-Warm case shows an increase in eddy transport
         across most latitudes except the Northwestern Pacific and eastern North American continent.
         The longitudinal integral of each term indicates that the mean and eddy changes contribute
         22.9 and 77.1% of the total latent energy transport increase in the NA-Warm Case and
         23.6 and 76.4% in the NP-Warm case.
