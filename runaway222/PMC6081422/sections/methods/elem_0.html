         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We employ simulations with the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Community
            Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.0.4
            <span><a>30</a></span>, which incorporates the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model version 4 (CICE4
            <span><a>49</a></span>), the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4
            <span><a>50</a></span>), and the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4
            <span><a>51</a></span>), coupled to a slab ocean. The atmosphere and land components are simulated on a
            0.9° × 1.5° grid, whereas the ice and ocean components are on an approximately 1° × 1°
            grid. A total of 12 simulations are conducted under preindustrial atmospheric CO
            <sub>2</sub> concentrations (284.7 ppm) with various modifications to the ocean surface or mixed
            layer heat flux (Q-flux) and land topography (Table 
            <a>1</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use the routine available in the standard CESM download, which uses monthly oceanic
            fields of temperature, salinity, surface velocities, boundary layer depth, surface
            heat flux, melting and freezing fluxes to generate the Q-flux for a specific mixed
            layer depth. The mixed layer is an annual average to balance the seasonal cycle
            <span><a>52</a></span>. We use an 80-year average from a multi-millennia coupled control simulation with
            preindustrial forcing to generate a climatological reference state, which globally
            and annually average to a zero Q-flux. The annual net Q-flux is a small residual of
            a strong seasonal cycle, with the same pattern as the surface heat flux, only with
            a smaller amplitude. In the equilibrium state, the heat flux at the surface and mixed
            layer depth are the same, since the slab-ocean simulation does not allow lateral transport.
            The annual-mean climatological Q-flux compares well with observations and is dominated
            by tropical upwelling regions taking up heat and Western boundary currents, the Nordic
            seas, and the Southern Ocean releasing heat to the atmosphere
            <span><a>31</a>,
               <a>53</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then apply the globally non-zero Q-flux pattern as a negative (i.e., heat flux
            out of the mixed layer depth into the ocean) and positive (i.e., heat flux into atmosphere)
            ocean heat uptake forcing inducing a global warming and cooling. The idealized Q-flux
            anomaly patterns are sine-shaped functions being bound to zero at 30°N and 60°N and
            rising to a maximum value at 45°N. The global imbalance was tuned to +1 W/m
            <span>2</span> and −1 W/m
            <span>2</span> global-equivalent, which implies the Pacific local maximum is smaller (31.5 W/m
            <span>2</span>) than the Atlantic local maximum (54 W/m
            <span>2</span>), since the Pacific area is larger (Supplementary Figure 
            <a>1</a>). We also configured a Q-flux anomaly for the North Pacific that was the equivalent
            area as the heat flux imposed on the North Atlantic to eliminate the potential effects
            of the different areas of the North Pacific and North Atlantic heat flux anomalies
            on global and Arctic climate. The local anomalous Q-flux is in the same order of magnitude
            as the climatological annual-mean flux, but smaller than the local seasonal cycle.
            The mixed layer depth is kept at the climatological control simulation annual average
            (spatially varying).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The naming convention for the simulations is as follows: NP-Warm (North Pacific +1 W/m
            <span>2</span>), NP-Cool (North Pacific −1 W/m
            <span>2</span>), NA-Warm (North Atlantic +1 W/m
            <span>2</span>), NA-Cool (North Atlantic −1 W/m
            <span>2</span>) for the single-basin Q-flux perturbations, and NP-Warm/NA-Cool and NP-Cool/NA-Warm
            denoting the compensating “seesaw” Q-flux perturbations. Simulations were also run
            with the positive ocean-to-atmosphere Q-flux perturbations in each basin with modified
            land topography, such that the global land surface was set to a geopotential height
            of zero (NP-Warm-Notopo and NA-Warm-Notopo). A simulation was run with a positive
            heat flux imposed in the Northeast Pacific that was approximately equivalent to the
            area of the Atlantic heat flux (NEP-Warm).

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model output analysis</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All simulations were run for 100 model years and annual and seasonal averages were
            calculated for years 40–100 of the model output, with the exception of the NEP-Warm
            simulation, which was run for 60 model years with mean values calculated from years
            40 to 60. Reported errors are calculated as the standard error of the mean multiplied
            by 1.96, which is the number of standard deviations required to contain 95% of the
            area of a normal distribution. The calculation of the standard error of the mean assumes
            a sample size of 
            <span>N</span> independent samples, which in our case are the individual model years. Autocorrelation
            between model years, however, reduces the number of independent samples, as described
            by Santer et al.
            <span><a>54</a></span> This autocorrelation is corrected for by using Eq. (6) of Santer et al.
            <span><a>54</a></span> to determine an “effective sample size”, 
            <span>N</span><sub>e</sub>, that adjusts the original sample size for this autocorrelation.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculate the global climate feedback parameter (
            <span>α</span>) as 
            <span>F</span>/Δ
            <span>T</span>, where 
            <span>F</span> is the applied global radiative forcing (±1 W/m
            <span>2</span>) and Δ
            <span>T</span> is the change in global average surface air temperature
            <span><a>55</a></span>. The Arctic amplification factor is calculated as the ratio of the change in global
            surface air temperature to the change in Arctic surface air temperature (Δ
            <span>T</span><sub>global</sub>/Δ
            <span>T</span><sub>arctic</sub>) (Table 
            <a>1</a>). The cloud radiative forcing at the TOA is calculated as the difference in the net
            radiative flux between all-sky and clear-sky conditions. The greenhouse effect of
            clouds in the Arctic is calculated as the difference in the downwelling longwave radiation
            at the surface between all-sky and clear-sky conditions
            <span><a>56</a></span>. We calculate the surface albedo forcing related to changes in sea-ice as the difference
            in upwelling shortwave radiation at the surface in clear-sky conditions. However,
            the enhanced absorption of shortwave radiation at the surface due to sea-ice retreat
            is in part compensated by enhanced shortwave reflection at the TOA due to changes
            in Arctic cloudiness. For example, the greater increase in Arctic cloud fraction in
            the NP-Warm contributes to an annual-mean negative cloud radiative effect at the top
            of the atmosphere (TOA) (−2.0 ± 0.36 and −1.7 ± 0.26 W/m
            <span>2</span> for the NP-Warm and NA-Warm simulations, respectively). However, this is composed
            of a positive cloud radiative effect from trapped longwave in winter—when the maximum
            Arctic warming occurs—and a negative cloud radiative effect from reflected shortwave
            in the summer, during which season the decreased albedo from sea-ice loss more than
            compensates for the increased cloud reflection. Thus, the warming effect of low clouds
            and sea-ice retreat together more than compensate for the reduction in incoming shortwave
            at the TOA due to enhanced cloud albedo.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The net change in shortwave radiation at the surface is interpreted as the effective
            shortwave absorption due to both cloud and sea-ice changes. Moisture convergence in
            the Arctic is defined as precipitation minus the surface water flux. Changes in Arctic
            sea-ice and cloud fraction are reported as the percent change in the area fraction
            relative to the control simulation. All calculations for the Arctic are defined as
            north of 66.6°.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) surface air temperature anomalies
            for 2080–2100 (Fig. 
            <a>1b</a>) in the RCP 8.5 scenario were calculated as an average of the following 23 models
            relative to their average surface air temperature of the historical simulations: ACCESS1-0,
            ACCESS1-3, bcc-csm1-1-m, bcc-csm1-1, BNU-ESM, CanESM2, CCSM4, CESM1-BGC, CESM1-CAM5,

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The surface heat flux anomalies for RCP 8.5 were calculated using one model simulation
            from 37 CMIP5 models, based on the time-mean of years 2081–2100 in the RCP 8.5 scenario
            relative to the time-mean for the preindustrial control run over the first 200 years
            (Supplementary Figure 
            <a>12</a>).
