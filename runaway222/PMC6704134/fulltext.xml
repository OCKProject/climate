Despite much research, understanding of temperature sensitivity of SOC under long-term agricultural management is very limited. The main objective of this study was to evaluate SOC and nitrogen (N) dynamics under grasslands and winter wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L)-based crop rotations in the inland Pacific Northwest (IPNW), USA, and measure SOC mineralization under ambient and elevated incubation temperatures. Soil samples were collected from 0&#x02013;10 and 10&#x02013;20&#x02009;cm depths from an undisturbed grassland (GP), winter wheat-pea (<italic>Pisum sativum</italic> L) rotations under conventional tillage (WP-CT) and no-tillage (WP-NT), and winter wheat-fallow rotation under conventional tillage (WF-CT) and analyzed for SOC and N pools. Soil samples were incubated at 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 10 weeks, and SOC mineralization rates were estimated using the first order kinetic model. The GP had the greatest amounts of SOC, total N (TN), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and WP rotations had higher inorganic N content than other treatments. The SOC mineralization at elevated incubation temperature was 72&#x02013;177% more than at the ambient temperature, and the greatest effect was observed in GP. The SOC storage under a given management did not have consistent effects on soil carbon (C) and N mineralization under elevated temperature. However, soil disturbance under WP-CT and WF-CT accelerated SOC mineralization leading to soil C loss. Reducing tillage, integrating legumes into crop rotations, and growing perennial grasses could minimize SOC loss and have the potential to improve soil health and agroecosystem resilience under projected climate warming.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Agroecology</kwd><kwd>Agroecology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>United States Department of Agriculture | National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011-68002-30191</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghimire</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Soils release more than 60 Gt of C to the atmosphere annually as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), seven times more than the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> released from fossil fuel burning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

In an undisturbed system, soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux is often balanced by total C input through root production, root exudates, and residue inputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, whereas SOC balance in agricultural soils depend on how crop and soil management practices affect biomass C inputs and soil C loss through organic matter decomposition and erosion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Soil disturbance (tillage) often triggers SOC loss from agricultural soils because it increases soil biological activity and brings organic residues in contact with decomposers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In contrast, reduced- and no-tillage minimize SOC loss. Crop rotation and cropping intensification and diversification increase diversity and abundance of microbial substrates, microbial biomass and activity, and ultimately increase SOC sequestration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, increasing interest in understanding sensitivity of agriculture sector to increased climate change and variability and improving soil health and resilience underscores the need for more research on how long-term management and potential changes in soil temperature affect SOC dynamics under diverse management systems.</p><p id="Par3">Long-term experiments provide valuable information required for understanding management effects on SOC dynamics and such information is a prerequisite for designing sustainable agroecosystems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The Pendleton long-term experiments (PLTEs), some of which date back to 1931, have provided a wealth of knowledge on how long-term tillage, crop residue, and cropping systems management influenced SOC and N dynamics and dryland wheat production in the IPNW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

Typically, grassland systems sequester more SOC than agricultural soils, but the SOC is sensitive to disturbance that accrued SOC is easily lost when the grasslands are cultivated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The decline in SOC will continue, particularly under intensively tilled crop-fallow systems, until a new equilibrium is reached<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In contrast, alternative management systems that contribute to belowground C and nutrient inputs and reduce soil disturbance can accumulate SOC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Studies show that reduced tillage and higher cropping intensity lowers soil temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and favors SOC sequestration.

Currently, at least a 10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C increase in summer temperatures compared to winter temperatures is observed in the IPNW of USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Seasonal temperature differences are expected to increase with climate change, which will undoubtedly influence soil microbial activity and SOC storage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

However, the relative SOC mineralization rate in elevated temperature compared to ambient temperature was lower in WP rotations (WP-NT and WP-CT) than grassland or WF-CT. Increase in the fresh organic matter and quality due to improved management (e.g., no-tillage, legume integration) can affect microbial utilization of substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and resulting changes in SOC storage.

It appears that SOC dynamics under projected warming in IPNW will be N-limited and the relative response will vary with cropping system. More research will reveal the effects of diverse management practices on soil N dynamics under warming conditions. Similarly, further research on soil pH, soil microbial community structure and their influence on nutrient cycling under range of temperatures would help IPNW farmers to understand potential changes in agroecosystems and their impacts to crop production.

In fact, there is a discrepancy in the literature about how and the extent to which soils and agroecosystems will respond to projected climate change. The observed increase in labile SOC with a decrease in decomposition rate constant (<italic>k</italic>) under elevated temperatures compared to ambient temperature emphasizes the need for conservation systems that reduce soil disturbance and maintain vegetation or surface residue cover. Such systems have the potential to sequester SOC by the physical protection of organic matter from increased microbial activity, chemical protection by stabilization of root and shoot residue-derived organic compounds in the soil, support of more fungal than bacterial growth, and biochemical protection of root exudates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

These temperatures are close to long-term annual average soil surface air temperature (19.6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) and a maximum summer soil surface air temperature (29.3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, i.e., long-term average of June-August) at the experimental site.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Statistical analysis and modeling</title><p id="Par26">Data for soil properties were tested for normality and homogeneity of variance and analyzed statistically by using a MIXED procedure of SAS for randomized complete block experiments with a split-plot arrangement (v.9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Soil pH, SOC, TN, inorganic N, and MBC data were analyzed considering treatments as the main plot (fixed) factor, soil depths as a split-plot (fixed) factor, and replication as a random factor. Cumulative SCM and SNM data were analyzed using treatments, incubation temperature, and soil depths as fixed factors and replication as a random factor. Since SOC and TN contents in soil were not consistent in all treatments, the cumulative SCM and SNM data were normalized to SOC and TN content, respectively, and analyzed using the same procedure. Treatment means differing in F-test were separated using the LSMEAN procedure of SAS. Statistical significance was evaluated at <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 unless otherwise stated. Additionally, the observed SOC mineralization rates (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>min</italic></sub>) after 70 days of incubation were fitted to the first-order kinetic model that describes SOC mineralization as a function of labile SOC content and decomposition time.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
