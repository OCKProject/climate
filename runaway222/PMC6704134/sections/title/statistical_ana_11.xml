 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data for soil properties were tested for normality and homogeneity of variance and analyzed statistically by using a MIXED procedure of SAS for randomized complete block experiments with a split-plot arrangement (v.9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Soil pH, SOC, TN, inorganic N, and MBC data were analyzed considering treatments as the main plot (fixed) factor, soil depths as a split-plot (fixed) factor, and replication as a random factor. Cumulative SCM and SNM data were analyzed using treatments, incubation temperature, and soil depths as fixed factors and replication as a random factor. Since SOC and TN contents in soil were not consistent in all treatments, the cumulative SCM and SNM data were normalized to SOC and TN content, respectively, and analyzed using the same procedure. Treatment means differing in F-test were separated using the LSMEAN procedure of SAS. Statistical significance was evaluated at 
  <span class="italic">P</span> ≤ 0.05 unless otherwise stated. Additionally, the observed SOC mineralization rates (
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">min</span>
  </sub>) after 70 days of incubation were fitted to the first-order kinetic model that describes SOC mineralization as a function of labile SOC content and decomposition time.
