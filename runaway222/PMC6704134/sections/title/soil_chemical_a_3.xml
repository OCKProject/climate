  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Soil pH averaged for two depths was significantly greater under GP (6.4) than under all wheat-based rotations (WP-NT, WP-CT, and WF-CT) in which soil pH ranged from 4.8 to 5.2. The SOC content was 78% greater in 0–10 cm than in 10–20 cm depth in GP, but it was not significantly different between soil depths in WP and WF treatments (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). In 0–10 cm depth, SOC content was highest under GP, which was not significantly different from WP-NT but was significantly greater than WP-CT and WF-CT. In 10–20 cm depth, SOC content ranged between 10.8 to 14.3 g kg

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil TN content in 0–10 cm depth was highest in GP (1.9 g kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), which was not significantly different than WP-NT but was significantly higher than WP-CT and WF-CT. Soil TN content in 10–20 cm depth ranged between 0.71 to 1.07 g kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and was not significantly different among treatments. Soil inorganic N content was about 18 and 2.6 times greater in 0–10 cm depth than in the 10–20 cm depth in GP and WP-NT, respectively, and it was not significantly different between soil depths in WP-CT and WF-CT (Table
