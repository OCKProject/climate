 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soils release more than 60 Gt of C to the atmosphere annually as carbon dioxide (CO
  <sub>2</sub>), seven times more than the amount of CO
  <sub>2</sub> released from fossil fuel burning
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Climate change is predicted to alter SOC dynamics and thereby affect net agroecosystem C balance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. The inland Pacific Northwest (IPNW) of USA is expected to experience a rise in average temperature of 2.9 °C by 2040 and 5.4 °C by 2080 compared to the 1970–1999 average temperature with high variability in temperature extremes during the 2040 and 2080
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. The predicted warming is expected to alter soil C dynamics and nutrient cycling under natural as well as agricultural systems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. In an undisturbed system, soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> efflux is often balanced by total C input through root production, root exudates, and residue inputs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, whereas SOC balance in agricultural soils depend on how crop and soil management practices affect biomass C inputs and soil C loss through organic matter decomposition and erosion
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. Soil disturbance (tillage) often triggers SOC loss from agricultural soils because it increases soil biological activity and brings organic residues in contact with decomposers
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. In contrast, reduced- and no-tillage minimize SOC loss. Crop rotation and cropping intensification and diversification increase diversity and abundance of microbial substrates, microbial biomass and activity, and ultimately increase SOC sequestration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. However, increasing interest in understanding sensitivity of agriculture sector to increased climate change and variability and improving soil health and resilience underscores the need for more research on how long-term management and potential changes in soil temperature affect SOC dynamics under diverse management systems.
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Long-term experiments provide valuable information required for understanding management effects on SOC dynamics and such information is a prerequisite for designing sustainable agroecosystems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. The Pendleton long-term experiments (PLTEs), some of which date back to 1931, have provided a wealth of knowledge on how long-term tillage, crop residue, and cropping systems management influenced SOC and N dynamics and dryland wheat production in the IPNW
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. The PLTEs compare diverse crop rotations, tillage, crop residues, and nutrient management practices
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. The soils under the diverse management practices may respond differently to projected climate change, and the PLTEs could be a valuable resource to understand how alternative management practices feedback to changes in climatic variables (i.e., temperature and precipitation) to influence the agricultural sustainability.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil warming could accelerate soil respiration and SOC loss because the rise in temperature enhances soil microbial activity and accelerates residue decomposition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. However, response of SOC to soil warming vary with agroecosystem type, diversity in root and residue inputs, and disturbance level
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Typically, grassland systems sequester more SOC than agricultural soils, but the SOC is sensitive to disturbance that accrued SOC is easily lost when the grasslands are cultivated
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. The decline in SOC will continue, particularly under intensively tilled crop-fallow systems, until a new equilibrium is reached
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. In contrast, alternative management systems that contribute to belowground C and nutrient inputs and reduce soil disturbance can accumulate SOC
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. Studies show that reduced tillage and higher cropping intensity lowers soil temperature
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span> and favors SOC sequestration. There is inconsistency in the literature about how SOC accumulated under alternative management systems responds to seasonal climate variability and projected climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Currently, at least a 10 °C increase in summer temperatures compared to winter temperatures is observed in the IPNW of USA
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Seasonal temperature differences are expected to increase with climate change, which will undoubtedly influence soil microbial activity and SOC storage
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Besides, precipitation and evapotranspiration are expected to change by the end of the century in the IPNW
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>, which will affect crop yield and biomass C input
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. Cultivated soils in the dryland IPNW have already lost 30–60% of SOC in the past century. Soil warming could accelerate SOC loss and subsequently affect agricultural productivity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is difficult to assess the extent to which projected changes in temperature and precipitation affect the regional agriculture because the effects of climate change are confounded with seasonal and inter-annual variability of weather parameters
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Designing controlled experiments to evaluate the role of individual factors (e.g., temperature) on SOC dynamics may provide information on the relative response of diverse management systems to changes in climatic variables
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Integrating mineralization kinetic models in controlled laboratory studies could further explain the decomposition characteristics of SOC. The first-order kinetic model has been used for estimating the decomposition characteristics of organic materials, specifically 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>0</sub>, the labile fraction of SOC that is sensitive to changes in management or the environment, and 
  <span class="italic">k</span>, the decomposition rate constant
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. This information is necessary to facilitate the management changes needed to improve agricultural sustainability under changing climate. Specifically, information on the effect of elevated temperature on SOC dynamics in dryland agroecosystems in the IPNW is lacking.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main objectives of this study were to i) evaluate chemical and biological soil properties at 0–10 cm and 10–20 cm depths under selected long-term plots of the PLTEs representing diverse crop rotations and tillage systems, ii) evaluate SOC mineralization at 20 °C and 30 °C temperatures under these treatments, and iii) model the temperature sensitivity of SOC mineralization using a first-order kinetic model.</p>
