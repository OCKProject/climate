 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">High incubation temperature stimulated SOC mineralization across all treatments during the 70-day incubation period. The first-order kinetic model predicted SOC mineralization with a good fit as indicated by high 
  <span class="italic">r</span> and low root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), specifically at 0–10 cm depth (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). The SOC mineralization rate was considerably higher in the first week followed by a gradual decrease for the next few weeks and ultimately leveling off across all treatments after four weeks of incubation. Comparing 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>0</sub>, the labile SOC fraction, and 
  <span class="italic">k</span>, the decomposition rate constant, between treatments revealed that 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>0</sub> was dependent on crop residue inputs as well as soil temperature, and 
  <span class="italic">k</span> was dependent on soil temperature. The 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>0</sub> was 153%, 225%, and 79% greater in GP, WP-NT, and WP-CT, respectively than in WF-CT at ambient temperature, and it was 135%, greater in GP and WP-NT and 47% greater in WP-CT at the elevated temperature. However, 
  <span class="italic">k</span> was 27% lower at elevated temperature than at ambient temperature and did not differ significantly between treatments. The SOC mineralization increased under elevated temperature, but model parameters were not significantly different between treatments at 10–20 cm depth (data not presented).
