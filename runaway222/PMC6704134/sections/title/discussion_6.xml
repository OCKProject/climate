 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study revealed the benefit of reducing soil disturbance and integrating legumes under current condition and projected warming. Soil warming can increase soil microbial activity and thereby accelerate organic residue decomposition. We observed higher SOC mineralization under elevated incubation temperature than ambient temperature across the agricultural systems and grassland. However, the relative SOC mineralization rate in elevated temperature compared to ambient temperature was lower in WP rotations (WP-NT and WP-CT) than grassland or WF-CT. Increase in the fresh organic matter and quality due to improved management (e.g., no-tillage, legume integration) can affect microbial utilization of substrates
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span> and resulting changes in SOC storage. Some microorganisms are better adapted to climate change and variability than others, which affect their substrate utilization and thereby SOC dynamics in grasslands and agricultural soils
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. In-field response of soil warming also varies with soil type, environmental conditions, and crop management practices
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Nevertheless, the relative difference in SOC mineralization under high incubation temperature suggests that diversified systems lose less C than grass-only systems under projected warming conditions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Long-term SOC balance in agroecosystems depends on how global warming alter C inputs, outputs, and residence time in the soils. High temperature can increase plant biomass production in the temperate ecosystems, leading to greater C inputs to the soil and potentially higher microbial biomass and activity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. Studies from IPNW reveal high variability in precipitation and temperature with potential for an overall increase in precipitation and decrease in evapotranspiration in most of the wheat producing area
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>, and total grain yield by the 2070 s in the region is projected to increase in the range of 18–48% (RCP 4.5) and 30–65% (RCP 8.5) compared to the baseline scenario
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. Under such conditions, C input and microbial activity are expected to increase, which can accelerate SOC mineralization and lead to SOC loss via CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions to the atmosphere if appropriate conservation practices are not adopted
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. The greater SOC and N stocks we observed under GP and WP-NT than under WP-CT and WF-CT suggested that agricultural systems that minimize soil disturbance, maintain permanent ground cover, and include legumes in the rotation have the potential to restore SOC lost due to intensive cultivation in drylands of IPNW.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While we observed the increase in labile SOC fractions with elevated incubation temperature, the decomposition rate constant (
  <span class="italic">k</span>) was decreased, suggesting that SOC inputs and management practices play a critical role in stabilizing SOC under warming conditions. More importantly, the difference in SOC mineralization coefficient (
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>0</sub>) was smaller under WP rotations than under GP and WF-CT, which also suggests the greater potential of stabilization of labile C accrued under legume-integrated systems compared to grass-only systems. The difference between response of legume-integrated and grass-only systems was also observed in SCMN, an indicator of microbial substrate quality. Diverse crops produce a variety of microbial substrates
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>, and each of these compounds has their own kinetic properties. The response of these compounds may vary under soil warming depending on the gross kinetic energy for the substrate decomposition and shifts in the microbial community structure
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Crop residues not protected in soil aggregates or freshly released C compounds are more sensitive to elevated temperature than SOC that is stabilized or protected in the soil aggregates
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Greater C inputs through root and aboveground residues and associated microbial community, along with reduced- or no soil disturbance under GP and WP-NT, could produce a greater amount of labile substrates and ultimately increase SOC sequestration.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Information is limited on the effects of elevated temperature on N dynamics compared to SOC dynamics. It appears soil N responds differently to SOC under warming conditions than under ambient conditions. There was no response of SNM and SNMN to an increase in incubation temperature, possibly due to a different rates of microbial C and N utilization or greater use of N due to increased microbial biomass and activity under elevated temperature
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. The significant differences in SNM under higher incubation temperature, mainly in 0–10 cm depth of GP and WP rotations and 10–20 cm depth of WP-NT and WF-CT suggested that soil N from the root and aboveground biomass decomposition is more likely to mineralize due to soil warming. It appears that SOC dynamics under projected warming in IPNW will be N-limited and the relative response will vary with cropping system. More research will reveal the effects of diverse management practices on soil N dynamics under warming conditions. Similarly, further research on soil pH, soil microbial community structure and their influence on nutrient cycling under range of temperatures would help IPNW farmers to understand potential changes in agroecosystems and their impacts to crop production. This study, conducted at the oldest long-term experiment in the western US, provides valuable information on potential changes in soil C and N dynamics under project climate change and variability in the region.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span> reported up to 21% recovery of SOC by adopting conservation tillage systems in fields that were previously tilled. The SOC content was the highest in GP, the grassland system that has not been disturbed for more than 80 years, and the lowest in WF-CT, an intensively tilled winter wheat-fallow system. Inorganic N, on the other hand, was greater in WP-NT than all other treatments, potentially because no-tillage provided a more favorable environment for N cycling than conventional system. No-tillage maintains a consistent soil environment for microbial growth and activity, conserves soil moisture, and helps in the soil aggregation that ultimately leads to improved nutrient storage and cycling

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. Pea in rotation may have accumulated inorganic N in the soil through atmospheric N fixation, and no-tillage management conserved the accrued N. Studies show that legumes in rotation support crop production through atmospheric N fixation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. Since we did not have a non-legume fallow replacement crop, it’s hard to distinguish whether N accumulation in WP-NT was due to N fixation by legume or due to fallow replacement. Van Kessel and Hartley
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span> reported that including pea in crop rotation or intercropping with other crops could replace up to 84% of the N needed for the following crop. Our observation of two to three times more inorganic N in 0–20 cm soil profile supports the previous observations of improved N availability and increased crop production in legume-based crop rotations.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adoption of no-tillage and more intensive crop rotations has potential to improve soil health and resilience through their positive effects on microbial substrate availability and quality, microbial growth, SOC accumulation, and nutrient cycling

  </span>. Average and maximum summer temperatures in IPNW were used to evaluate the maximum potential changes on SOC mineralization, which may not exactly reflect the projected climate change scenarios, but this study provides insights on SOC and N responses to the potential impact of warming and seasonal temperature changes in the labile SOC content. In fact, there is a discrepancy in the literature about how and the extent to which soils and agroecosystems will respond to projected climate change. The observed increase in labile SOC with a decrease in decomposition rate constant (
  <span class="italic">k</span>) under elevated temperatures compared to ambient temperature emphasizes the need for conservation systems that reduce soil disturbance and maintain vegetation or surface residue cover. Such systems have the potential to sequester SOC by the physical protection of organic matter from increased microbial activity, chemical protection by stabilization of root and shoot residue-derived organic compounds in the soil, support of more fungal than bacterial growth, and biochemical protection of root exudates

  </span>. Soils from diverse management systems were exposed to the same experimental condition (temperature gradient, moisture), which allowed us to compare relative response of diverse management practices to potential warming. Increasing crop diversity by including pea in crop rotation appears to reduce SOC loss under projected climate change and has the potential to mitigate climate change impacts in dryland agriculture in IPNW.
