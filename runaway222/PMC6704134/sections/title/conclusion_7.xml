 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study examined soil properties at surface and subsurface soils under diverse crop rotation and tillage management systems and estimated the temperature sensitivity of SOC mineralization in surface soil using a first-order kinetic model. Increased SOC loss under elevated temperature compared to ambient temperature suggested high sensitivity of SOC to projected climate warming. Soil C mineralization increased with increasing incubation temperature. However, potential effects of warming varied with tillage management and cropping systems. Traditional tilled crop-fallow system substantially depleted SOC that also appears to be more vulnerable to warming. A smaller difference in C mineralization rate in WP-NT than other treatments, specifically the difference in

No-tillage and diversified crop rotations that integrate legume have a potential to improve soil health and reduce negative feedback to projected climate change in semiarid agroecosystems such as IPNW of USA.
