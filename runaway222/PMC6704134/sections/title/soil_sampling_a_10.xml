 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil cores were collected from 0–10 cm and 10–20 cm depths of the WP-CT, WP-NT, and WF-CT cropping systems and from three randomly selected three locations within the GP field using a core sampler (inner diameter 1.85 cm) in summer of 2015. At least four soil cores were collected from each plot, composited by depth increment, thoroughly homogenized, and brought to the laboratory for long-term incubation as well as for soil microbial biomass, SOC, N, and soil pH analyses.</p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the laboratory, soil samples were stored in a refrigerator (4 °C) for soil microbial biomass and potential soil C mineralization (SCM) measurements. All visible plant materials (roots, stems, and leaves) and crop residues were removed, and the soil was sieved using a 2-mm sieve before laboratory analysis. Soil water content was determined gravimetrically by oven drying 10-g soil samples at 105 °C for 24 hr and water content was calculated as a difference between the wet and dry weight of soil samples. Soil pH was measured using an Orion Star A215 pH/conductivity meter (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) on 1:2 soil to 0.01 M CaCl
  <sub>2</sub> extracts after a 30-min equilibration time

  </span>. Total C and N contents were determined by dry combustion analysis (Flash EA 1112 series, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) of oven-dried (60 °C, 72 hr) and finely ground (&lt;0.05 mm) soil samples. Soils were ground in a Shatter 1 Box 8530 ball mill (Spex Sample Prep., Metuchen, NJ) for 2 min. Soil pH, which was less than 6.6 in all samples, was used to indirectly detect inorganic C. Studies show that total C in soils with pH &lt; 7.4 is mostly SOC
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Therefore, total C content in soil was considered to be SOC. Soil inorganic N was analyzed as the sum of KCl- extractable NO
  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">−</span>N and NH
  <sub>4</sub>-N in an autoanalyzer (Astoria-Pacific, Inc. Clackamas, OR). For this, 5 g of soil were extracted with 25 ml of 1 M KCl solution. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) was determined by the fumigation incubation method
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span> in which approximately a 10-g soil (dry weight equivalent) sample was fumigated in a vacuum desiccator for 48 hr using chloroform, and the samples were incubated for a week in 1-L glass jars. The headspace CO
  <sub>2</sub>-C released from samples during a week-long incubation was determined by a single-cell IRGA system (specifically, the LI-820 CO
  <sub>2</sub> analyzer by LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. An efficiency factor of 0.41 was used for MBC calculations without subtracting to non-fumigated control
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. Long-term soil C mineralization was analyzed by aerobic incubation of approximately 20 g of soil in 1-L glass jars for 70 days, and CO
  <sub>2</sub>-C released from the incubated samples were measured in LI-820. For this, soil samples were weighed in plastic specimen cups, brought to field capacity (23% g/g water content), and incubated at 20 °C and 30 °C in an HC30 accelerated aging chamber incubator (Hoffman Manufacturing, Inc. Corvallis, OR) in a dark place, and CO
  <sub>2</sub>-C released from the soil samples was measured with LI-820 after 24 h, 3 days, 8 days, and 14 days, and on a weekly interval thereafter. After each gas sampling, CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration and air pressure were re-equilibrated by opening the lids of incubation jars and flushing with a vacuum air pump (Ted Pella Inc. Redding, CA). The specimen cups were weighed every week to determine the soil moisture loss, and the soil water content was brought to 23% by adding deionized water. The SNM was determined as inorganic N on soil samples incubated for SCM. The selected incubation temperature for SCM and SNM represents the maximum possible increases in soil temperature in the IPNW region of USA
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. These temperatures are close to long-term annual average soil surface air temperature (19.6 °C) and a maximum summer soil surface air temperature (29.3 °C, i.e., long-term average of June-August) at the experimental site.
