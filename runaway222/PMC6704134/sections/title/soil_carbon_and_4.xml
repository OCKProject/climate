  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). In 0–10 cm depth, SCM under WP-NT was comparable with GP, but it was significantly greater than under WP-CT and WF-CT under both temperatures (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Soil incubation under elevated temperature increased SCM by 125 to 177% compared to SCM under ambient temperature. The greatest increase in SCM at higher incubation temperature was observed in GP, followed by WF-CT, WP-CT, and WP-NT. The WP-NT had significantly greater SCM than all other treatments in 10–20 cm depth, and the effects of elevated temperature were not consistent across treatments. In this depth, elevated temperature resulted in higher cumulative SCM in GP, WP-NT, and WF-CT by 72 to 126% compared to ambient condition, while no effects were observed in WP-CT.

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SCM normalized to SOC (SCMN) was significantly influenced by cropping systems treatment, temperature, depth, and treatment × temperature interaction (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). Overall, SCMN was 36% greater in 0–10 cm depth than in 10–20 cm depth, and it was 114% greater under elevated temperature (30 °C) than under ambient temperature (20 °C) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The SCMN was not significantly different between WP-NT and WP-CT under ambient temperature, but SCMN under these treatments was significantly greater than SCMN under GP and WF-CT. Under higher incubation temperature, SCMN was significantly greater under WP-NT than other treatments. The temperature response, however, was highest in WF-CT with 159% greater SCMN at 30 °C than at 20 °C followed by 153% in GP, 99% in WP-NT, and 72% in WP-CT.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Significant treatment × temperature × depth interactions on soil nitrogen mineralization (SNM) were observed (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). In 0–10 cm depth at ambient temperature, SNM was significantly greater under WP-NT (49.3 mg kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) than all other treatments (Fig.

  <span class="sup">−1</span>. With elevated temperature, SNM increased significantly in GP, WP-NT, and WP-CT. There was no significant difference in SNM between the ambient and elevated temperature in WF-CT. The SNM under elevated temperature was highest under GP, followed by WP-NT, WP-CT; SNM under these treatments was significantly greater than SNM under WF-CT. At ambient temperature, SNM in the 10–20 cm depth was considerably lower in WF-CT than in all other treatments, and SNM content did not differ among GP, WP-NT, and WP-CT at ambient temperature. At elevated temperature, SNM under WP-NT was significantly higher than SNM under other treatments in the 10–20 cm soil depth profile. At this temperature, no significant differences in SNM were observed among the GP, WP-CT, and WF-CT treatments (Fig.
