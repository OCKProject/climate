  <p>Soil nitrogen mineralization normalized to total nitrogen (SNMN) at 0–10 cm and 10–20 cm depths under different management systems. GP, grass pasture; WP-NT, wheat-pea rotation under no-tillage; WP-CT, wheat-pea rotation under conventional tillage; and WF-CT, wheat-fallow rotation under conventional tillage. Error bars indicate standard error, same lowercase letters indicate no significant difference between treatments within a soil depth and same uppercase letters indicate no significant difference between soil depths within a treatment (p=0.05, Tukey test).</p>
