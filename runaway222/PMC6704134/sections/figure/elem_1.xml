  <p>Soil temperature effects on soil carbon mineralization normalized to soil organic carbon in 0–20 cm depth. GP, grass pasture; WP-NT, wheat-pea rotation under no-tillage; WP-CT, wheat-pea rotation under conventional tillage; and WF-CT, wheat-fallow rotation under conventional tillage. SCMN, soil carbon mineralization normalized to soil organic carbon. Error bars indicate standard error, same lowercase letters indicate no significant difference between treatments within an incubation temperature and same upper case letters indicate no significant difference between incubation temperatures within a treatment (p = 0.05, Tukey test).</p>
