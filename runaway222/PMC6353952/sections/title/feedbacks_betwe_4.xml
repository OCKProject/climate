 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The previous section describes the impact of ice-load-driven changes to the elevation of the solid Earth surface and gravity field on ice dynamics. Many ice-sheet modelling studies account for ice-driven isostatic adjustment
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>
  </span>, but over multiple glacial cycles several other processes also alter the underlying topography. Thermal subsidence following tectonic extension has lowered central West Antarctica by several hundred metres over the last ~34 Ma (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>
  </span>) and changes in dynamic topography over the last 3 Ma are postulated to have altered the stability of some sectors of East Antarctica
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>
  </span>. However, since the inception of the AIS, glacially-driven erosion and sedimentation, and the accompanying isostatic response
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">91</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>
  </span>, have been the main drivers of topographic change across Antarctica. This topographic change has, in turn, played a role in controlling the sensitivity of the ice sheet to climate forcing. This section focuses on the extent to which feedbacks between the ice sheet and the solid Earth have shaped the long-term evolution of both.
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to 34 Ma, Antarctica was characterised by a fluvial landscape
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">95</a>
  </span> and higher mean topography
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">96</a>
  </span>. Dated offshore sediment packages are testament to the volume of material that has been removed from Antarctica since 34 Ma (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">97</a>
  </span>). Backstripping techniques can be used to unpick the history of progradation and isostatic subsidence, and hence reconstruct the palaeotopography of the continental shelf
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">98</a>
  </span>. It is more challenging to reconstruct onshore palaeotopography due to the difficulty of determining the volume of material that has been removed, and the source of that material. By using assumed drainage pathways
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>
  </span> or process-based erosion modelling tuned to match offshore sediment volumes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>
  </span>, and accounting for the isostatic response to ice and ocean loading, as well as sediment erosion and deposition, bounds can be placed on the pre-glaciation topography of Antarctica
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">96</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">99</a>
  </span>. Current palaeotopography reconstructions have been used to suggest that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could have formed much earlier than previously thought, during the Eocene-Oligocene transition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">100</a>
  </span>. However, when two palaeotopography end members are used to define boundary conditions for ice-sheet growth under ‘cold’ mid-Miocene conditions, the difference in modelled ice volume is equivalent to 20 m sea level
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">101</a>
  </span>, with the shallower topography leading to the growth of a larger ice sheet. It is clear that the configuration of the ice sheet is highly sensitive to the underlying topography, but the question remains as to how Antarctic topography has evolved, and the degree to which this evolution was coupled to ice-sheet change via glacial erosion and the resulting isostatic response.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand the role of internal, i.e., non-climatic, processes in controlling long-term ice-sheet change it is necessary to consider feedbacks between ice dynamics, erosion, deposition, isostasy, and water depth change. Extending the coupled ice sheet - sea level modelling approach described above to account for landscape evolution processes would allow the testing of hypotheses that seek to explain the dramatic changes that took place as Antarctica evolved from a terrestrial to a marine ice sheet against a background of long-term cooling. Specifically, between 34 and 14 Ma the volume of the AIS fluctuated significantly
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">102</a>
  </span>, then at 14 Ma there was a switch to cold, polar conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" href="#CR103">103</a>
  </span>, which resulted in the establishment of a cold-based, less erosive ice sheet
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">104</a>
  </span>. A range of hypotheses have been proposed to explain this transition to the current ‘icehouse’ world
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" href="#CR105">105</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" href="#CR106">106</a>
  </span>, but it remains to be tested whether landscape evolution played a role, either through a rapid change in topographic boundary conditions or by causing the system to pass some internal threshold as large portions of the ice sheet became marine grounded.
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ice sheet-driven processes that will have had an impact on ice-sheet dynamics include progradation of the continental shelf and long wavelength erosion and deposition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. The resulting isostatic response of onshore uplift and offshore subsidence will have focused erosion on the inner shelf
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>
  </span>, leading to the development of a reverse bed slope that is too deep to support ice-sheet advance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">98</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">107</a>
  </span> and is susceptible to unstable grounding line retreat
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
  </span>. These processes are conceptually simple, but they will have been subject to control by spatially variable sea-level change. As the mean topography of Antarctica decreased through erosion, the ice sheet will have become more sensitive to sea-level change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" href="#CR108">108</a>
  </span> and ocean forcing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" href="#CR109">109</a>
  </span>. Applying appropriate boundary conditions to understand long-term ice-sheet change is challenging due to uncertainties associated with palaeotopography and the growth of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, but initial studies that have explored the impact of spatially variable sea-level change on the pre-Pleistocene ice sheet highlight the importance of accounting for peripheral bulge growth when considering ice
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" href="#CR110">110</a>
  </span> and ocean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111" href="#CR111">111</a>
  </span> dynamics, and the damping effects of ice sheet - sea level feedbacks in regions of weak mantle viscosity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. The impact of spatial variability in Earth rheology on coupled ice sheet - landscape evolution has not yet been investigated.
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regions of the AIS that are currently located on over-deepened reverse bed slopes have been suggested to be fundamentally unstable
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>
  </span>. The details of how the ice sheet and the underlying topography reached this state are not known, but it is clear that feedbacks will have played a role as the fluvially- and tectonically-controlled topography of 34 Ma was eroded and warped into its current configuration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>
  </span>, and it has been suggested that future landscape evolution will render the ice sheet even more unstable
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Models that seek to explore the past and future long-term evolution of the AIS should account for evolution of the underlying topography due to both sediment redistribution and isostasy, ideally within a coupled framework. The development of such models will improve understanding of sediment transport pathways, permitting stronger conclusions to be drawn from provenance studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112" href="#CR112">112</a>
  </span>. Better quantification of bedrock erosion rates and offshore sediment packages are important targets for improving our understanding of feedbacks between ice sheet and landscape change.
