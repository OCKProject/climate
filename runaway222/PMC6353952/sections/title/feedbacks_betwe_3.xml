 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has long been recognised that the evolution of ice sheets is influenced by the geometry and deformation of the underlying solid Earth
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span>, and that the stability and dynamics of marine ice sheets (ice sheets which rest on ground below sea level) are sensitive to the depth of water at their grounding lines, i.e., the point where they begin to float
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>
  </span>. Marine-terminating ice sheets such as Antarctica lose most of their mass following the flow of grounded ice across their grounding lines into floating ice shelves (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). The ice flux across the grounding line is very sensitive to the thickness of ice there, and the thickness is in turn proportional to the depth of water such that a small increase in water depth at the grounding line leads to a large reduction in grounded ice
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>
  </span>. Marine ice sheets are widely thought to be prone to runaway retreat when resting upon beds that slope down towards the interior of the ice sheet, i.e., reverse bed slopes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>
  </span>, as is the case for West Antarctica and much of East Antarctica. This canonical argument is based on the idea that when the grounding line retreats into deeper water, the ice loss at the grounding line increases, leading to further retreat (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). However, this reasoning does not account for the fact that as ice mass loss occurs, the solid Earth rebounds, and the gravitational attraction of the ice on the surrounding water is diminished, lowering the local sea surface (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>). The bathymetry shallows and bed slopes are altered near the margins of the ice sheet where ice mass loss is occurring. Within a modelling framework this local shallowing of water reduces the loss of ice across the grounding line, acting to stabilise the modelled ice sheet
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>
  </span>, slowing, and in some cases halting, migration of the modelled grounding line along reverse bed slopes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Ongoing viscous uplift of the bed following a halt in ice sheet retreat can also initiate readvance of the grounding line in marine areas (e.g., Fig.

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water depth changes can also influence the degree to which ice shelves are able to stabilise the ice sheet. Ice shelves play an important role in the stability and evolution of marine ice sheets by providing resistance to the flow of grounded ice across the grounding line. The spreading of ice shelves is inhibited by friction along their sides and base, particularly where the ice shelf becomes locally grounded on bumps or pinning points in the bathymetry, forming ice rises
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>
  </span>. A local decrease in water depth can enhance grounding of the ice shelf at ice rises, stabilising the ice sheet, while an increase in water depth can lead to ungrounding at the ice rise, enhancing flow across the grounding line of the ice sheet. Modelling studies of the AIS have shown that accelerated retreat and thinning and eventually large-scale collapse of marine sectors of the ice sheet can occur when the surrounding ice shelves break up
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>
  </span>, but that if ice shelves are able to re-ground, this can have a stabilising effect on the ice sheet
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, changes in bathymetry may have implications for ocean circulation and heat transfer under the ice shelves. The role of these and other ice shelf processes in controlling the dynamics of the grounded portion of the ice sheet are discussed in more detail in a companion paper by Smith et al. (manuscript submitted).

One is a relatively high viscosity Earth model with a thick lithosphere (HV), similar to models adopted in global GIA studies, and the other is representative of the Earth structure beneath much of West Antarctica, having a thinned lithosphere and a zone of low viscosity down to 200 km in the upper mantle (LVZ). For each of the time periods considered in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>, the timing and extent of ice-sheet retreat is sensitive to the adopted Earth rheology, and the predicted contribution of Antarctica to sea-level rise is lowered in the LVZ simulation as compared to the HV simulation. In the LVZ case the solid Earth responds faster to ice loading changes and deformation is localised to near the edges of the ice sheet where the ice loss occurs. The resulting sea-level fall at the grounding line can more effectively act to slow ice-sheet retreat as compared to the simulations with the HV Earth model.

  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6c, d</a> highlights that the influence of Earth structure on ice sheet evolution depends on both the strength of the climate forcing and the physics adopted in the ice-sheet model. For a moderate climate warming, uplift of the LVZ Earth model preserves much of West Antarctica as compared to the simulation with the HV Earth model (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6c</a>). While, for the simulation where strong RCP 8.5 climate warming is applied and new rapid-retreat-promoting ice physics are added (hydrofracturing and cliff failure
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>

  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), no single, radial Earth model is able to accurately represent all of Antarctica and hence consideration of lateral variations in Earth structure is motivated. Incorporating lateral variations in Earth structure into a coupled ice sheet–sea level model represents a large jump in computational cost. Gomez et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>

They show that substantial localised differences can arise in ice cover, sea level and crustal movement, which introduces substantial uncertainty into the GIA corrections that should be applied to contemporary geodetic observations.
