 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The solid Earth, along with the oceans and the atmosphere, exerts a strong influence on the dynamics of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS). The pre-glacial topography of the Antarctic continent determined the location and style of glacial inception ~34 Ma ago
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>, whereas today the shape of the bed and the properties of the ice-bed interface exert a first-order control on the contemporary pattern of ice flow
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. In the intervening period the bed of the AIS has been continuously reshaped by erosion and sedimentation, periodically flexed by glacial isostasy, and abruptly altered by tectonic and volcanic activity, with the latter two processes also playing a role in determining the thermal conditions at the bed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Basal heat flux affects ice flow via its influence on subglacial hydrology and ice rheology
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>, but its spatial variation is currently poorly quantified
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Parts of Antarctica are underlain by active volcanoes, notably West Antarctica (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). This is of interest because in other regions, e.g., Iceland
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>, volcanism has been shown to increase during periods of deglaciation. However, little is known of this phenomenon in Antarctica
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span> and a detailed review of this effect is therefore not possible. We instead focus on those processes that are better known and that control long-wavelength changes to the shape of the bed beneath Antarctica – glacial isostasy and erosion – and feedbacks between these processes and ice sheet evolution.

    <p>Summary of interactions between the solid Earth and the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Local isostatic uplift occurs in response to ice-sheet thinning or retreat, isostatic subsidence occurs in response to ice-sheet thickening or advance. Subglacial volcanism and basal heat flux alter thermal conditions at the base of the ice sheet. Erosion and deposition also trigger an isostatic response (not shown).

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interactions between ice sheets and the solid Earth have long been studied within the field of Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA)—defined here as the response of the solid Earth and the global gravity field to changes in the distribution of ice and water on Earth’s surface. The first numerical models of GIA were developed in the 1970s
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span> but they have received renewed attention over the last decade, reflecting the important role they play in the interpretation of satellite measurements of contemporary ice-sheet change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. A number of recent studies have also sought to understand the strength of feedbacks acting in the opposite direction, that is, the impact of solid Earth deformation on ice dynamics and the potential for this deformation to delay or prevent unstable ice-sheet retreat
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Such feedbacks were first considered in the 1980s
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span> but have only recently begun to be implemented into fully-coupled models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>, where the evolving shape of the solid Earth and the depth of the ocean adjacent to an ice sheet grounded below sea level act as fundamental boundary conditions on the dynamics of the ice sheet.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strength of any feedbacks between glacial isostasy and ice dynamics depends on the rate at which the solid Earth responds to ice-sheet change, which, in turn, depends on the rheological properties of the mantle. Seismic evidence
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span> indicates that there are significant spatial variations in mantle properties beneath Antarctica, which suggests mantle viscosities, and hence relaxation timescales, may vary by up to several orders of magnitude from the global mean. Indeed, in the northern Antarctic Peninsula, geodetic evidence
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span> suggests that contemporary ice loss is triggering a viscous response orders of magnitude more rapidly than was previously assumed possible in Antarctica – on decadal rather than millennial timescales. Feedbacks on ice dynamics are likely to be enhanced in such regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, and the ongoing GIA signal is likely to be dominated by recent ice-sheet change (few millennia or less), as opposed to the ice loss that followed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Here, we define the GIA signal to be the ongoing response of the solid Earth, the gravity field, and/or relative sea level to past ice-sheet change.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The growth and decay of the AIS is driven by a combination of climate forcing and non-climatic feedbacks, but modelling studies that seek to understand the controls on AIS change often neglect to consider how the ice sheet alters its own boundary conditions. Over the timescale of the last deglaciation, GIA model output
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> suggests that the response to surface load change can alter bed slopes across West Antarctica by 0.25–0.4 m/km (values may be an underestimate due to assumptions of strong mantle rheology) and that water-depth change around the margin of the ice sheet can deviate from eustatic by &gt;100 m. Coupled ice sheet-sea level models can now be used to quantify the impact of such changes on ice sheet evolution
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Over timescales of millions of years, changes to the shape of the ice sheet bed will additionally reflect processes associated with erosion and deposition, the isostatic response to sediment redistribution, and mantle convection. Feedbacks between ice sheet evolution and long-term landscape evolution have been hypothesised
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>, but they have not been modelled within a coupled framework. The impacts of long-wavelength isostasy-driven changes to ice sheet boundary conditions are reviewed here, but smaller-scale subglacial controls, such as the material properties of the bed and variations in subglacial hydrology and geomorphology, are discussed elsewhere
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this review we proceed by briefly summarising the current state of knowledge on ice-sheet change and glacial isostasy across Antarctica, before discussing the impact of spatial variations in Earth rheology on glacial isostasy and the impact of GIA on ice dynamics. Feedbacks between ice sheet and landscape evolution are discussed, and we conclude by identifying a number of future research priorities that link ice history, Earth rheology, and the overarching issue of global sea-level change.</p>
