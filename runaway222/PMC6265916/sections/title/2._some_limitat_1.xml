 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation (V&amp;A) assessments are designed to provide insights into current and projected future risks of climate variability and change, as well as options for preparing for and effectively managing these risks [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-15-02370">19</a>]. Numerous health vulnerability and adaptation assessments have been completed (e.g., [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-15-02370">5</a>,
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-15-02370">20</a>,
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-15-02370">21</a>]), with many more underway. Since climate change and health is a relatively new issue for ministries and departments of health, and due to limited human and financial resources for conducting V&amp;A assessments and short planning cycles, these assessments tend to focus on reducing vulnerability to current climate variability for a limited number of climate-sensitive health outcomes. In response to these assessments, policies and measures are being implemented to enhance local to national level preparedness within, for example, vector-borne disease control programs.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">V&amp;A assessments are rarely comprehensive; a wide range of adverse health outcomes that are expected to be exacerbated by the consequences of climate change are frequently not considered, such as increases in mental health disorders or the population health impacts of migration [
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-15-02370">22</a>]. The importance of considering mental health in assessments was illustrated by the lingering mental health effects of the 2016 and 2017 western Canada wildfires that prompted the Canadian Mental Health Association to create telephone help lines for people experiencing trauma and distress due to the fires [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-15-02370">23</a>]. This support was particularly needed when British Columbia declared a state of emergency as hundreds of wildfires raged throughout the province in summer 2018 [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-15-02370">24</a>]. The 2016 US climate change and health assessment [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-15-02370">5</a>] included a chapter on mental health, and the next Canadian assessment will include information on this issue.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another limitation of V&amp;A assessments is that guidance is not designed to identify climate shocks and stresses outside the current range of experience that, alone or in combination with other pressures, could undermine the effectiveness of health system functioning and impact health outcomes. Existing guidance focuses on investigating the effectiveness, strengths, and weaknesses of policies and programs aimed at reducing health risks from current climate variability and recent climate change [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-15-02370">19</a>]. V&amp;A guidance does not include evaluation of the day-to-day challenges health systems may face in realistic, but difficult to project, scenarios in an era absent of climactic stationarity. Further, tipping points resulting from cumulative and/or compounding impacts are rarely considered. A climate and health stress test provides an avenue to explore, in detail, what climate change shocks or stresses may mean for the operational capacity of health systems.
