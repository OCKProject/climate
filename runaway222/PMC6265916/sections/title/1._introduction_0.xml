 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate and other global environmental changes are fundamentally altering our future. Possible futures include a “hothouse earth” if self-reinforcing feedbacks result in continued warming, despite reductions in greenhouse gas emissions [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-15-02370">1</a>]. Even stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures is projected to result in a significantly warmer future within the next few decades [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-15-02370">2</a>]. Climate variability and change, including increasing temperatures, alterations in the hydrologic cycle, and increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather and climate events, are associated with a range of adverse health consequences. Impacts can be direct, such as illnesses and deaths from heatwaves and severe storms; or can arise from indirect pathways, such as poor health outcomes associated with human migration, ecosystem changes (e.g., vector-borne diseases), food insecurity, and economic decline [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-15-02370">3</a>,
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-15-02370">4</a>,
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-15-02370">5</a>]. Some impacts of climate change, such as effects on mental health (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, violence, suicide) may occur in the short-term or extend over several years, with associated implications for their management by health systems [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-15-02370">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to these climatic shifts, demographic changes (e.g., aging, migration), urbanization, land use change, and other social determinants of health, will also change, with potential implications for vulnerability to climate-related hazards [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-15-02370">6</a>]. All these changes will interact, with possible amplifications of the challenges that individuals, communities, and health systems are projected to face. Health systems include all facets of healthcare (e.g., acute care, chronic care, long-term care, and mental healthcare), as well as all aspects of care delivery (e.g., workforce, care facilities, supply chains, and pharmaceuticals), health governance and leadership, and health information and technology, including surveillance and financing [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-15-02370">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The focus of health adaptation to climate change has been on strengthening health systems to better manage its impacts. The WHO 
  <span class="italic">Operational Framework for Building Climate Resilient Health Systems</span> describes the possible implications of climate change for the six building blocks of health systems: leadership and governance, health workforce, health information systems, essential medical products and technologies, service delivery, and climate and health financing [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-15-02370">7</a>]. This framework was used, for example, to inform toolkits designed in the United States [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-15-02370">8</a>] and Canada [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-15-02370">9</a>], and by the Pan American Health Organization [
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-15-02370">10</a>] to increase the sustainability and resiliency of healthcare facilities in the Americas [
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-15-02370">11</a>]. While incremental improvements to modify current programs are important first steps to increase resilience, they may lead to inadequate preparation of health systems and overconfidence in their ability to manage multiple concurrent and synergistic climate-related exposures outside the range of historic experiences, as expected with climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These challenges are compounded for health systems struggling to manage the current health risks of climate variability and change due to limited adaptive capacity [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-15-02370">3</a>], such as those in many low- and middle-income countries. The Solomon Islands provides an example to illustrate the potentially severe climate-related impacts and challenges for health systems. In that country, many health facilities, including the only tertiary hospital in the country, are located on the seashore, with limited seawall protection and at high risk of storm surges, flooding, and sea level rise [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-15-02370">12</a>]. A dengue outbreak in 2013, and flash flooding in 2014, illustrated the extreme weakness and vulnerability of the health system and health facilities due to structural damage and increased patient demand. Following the flooding event, 31 acute and subacute deaths were recorded, as well as a diarrhea outbreak that affected 8584 people. This resulted in a surge of inpatients that strained healthcare staff and depleted medical supplies. Damage to the hospital and surrounding clinics, serving 26,000 people, led to the evacuation of patients [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-15-02370">13</a>]. Without major adaptation measures—and, eventually, relocation—the majority of facilities in the Solomon Islands will be inundated in the coming decades [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-15-02370">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extended timeframe associated with climate change necessitates a broader scope for risk assessment and risk reduction efforts, increasing the time horizons for decisions. This results in other dynamics within and outside the health sector becoming increasingly important. Health sector capacity, particularly for highly vulnerable populations, will depend on poverty rates [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-15-02370">15</a>], healthcare financing [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-15-02370">16</a>], and other policy choices [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-15-02370">17</a>]. Vulnerabilities will shift because of changes in climate as well as migration, urban form, technology, and access to safe water and improved sanitation, among other development trends [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-15-02370">6</a>,
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-15-02370">18</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To increase resilience to a relatively unexplored aspect of climate-related health risks—increases in shocks and stresses with additional climate change—we propose conducting climate and health stress tests, in conjunction with or following a vulnerability and adaptation assessment to identify and prioritize interventions that promote climate-smart health systems and increase resilience. </p>
