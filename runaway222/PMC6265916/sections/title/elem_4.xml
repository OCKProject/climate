 <sec id="sec5dot1-ijerph-15-02370" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5.1. Stage 1: Prepare the Study</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Decide the key issues on which to focus</span>: To begin, the ministry of health, health department, or other health administrative unit engaged with the stress test should decide which aspects of health systems and services to include, such as focusing on the preparedness of facilities and infrastructure, acute care and emergency department capacity, pharmacies, first responders, public health services, and non-governmental organizations, such as the Red Cross/Red Crescent society. These choices will inform decisions about which individuals should comprise the stress test team.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Form the stress test team</span>: Ideally, the climate change and health stress test team should include specialists (e.g., public health officials, doctors, nurses) knowledgeable about the health risks of climate change, projections of climate change for the geographic region of interest, health system policies and programs of relevance for climate change and health, policies, and programs in other sectors that could impact population health, local and national plans (e.g., those affecting urbanization), and the local demographics of particularly vulnerable groups. Team members could come from the ministry or department of health, healthcare delivery organizations, universities, non-governmental organizations, and others. As local context is critical, inclusion of participants with intimate knowledge of local health system disaster planning and, crucially, actual disaster experience, is key. Including someone from the local meteorological service would be very helpful to provide insights on the local or regional risks associated with specific types of extreme weather events. Every situation is different, therefore, the team should utilize the specifics of a given context, as well as aim to integrate with existing coordination mechanisms where possible. For example, many countries have a climate change and health technical working group that could be engaged in the process. The team should include the breadth and depth of expertise needed, without becoming too large to be effective. Jurisdictions with specific climate hazards of concern to health systems, for example, mental health impacts in rural, isolated, or northern communities, may require participation of specialists, such as psychologists or social support workers.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determining the stress test timeframe is key, as the type, magnitude, and frequency of climate-related hazards, as well as the population structure, and issues such as land-use and insurance coverage will vary considerably, depending on the time horizon. Other stipulations, such as the extent of the disaster (which would affect the availability of aid) and impacts on other sectors (e.g., power generation, transport, etc.) should also be determined.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Conduct a stocktake and review/generate data and information</span>: In this step, the team gathers data and information to inform the stress test. Stocktaking identifies relevant data, studies, reports, or plans developed by the ministry of health and other organizations. Publications, documents, and reports should be sought that provide details on recent climate-related shocks and stresses, and the effectiveness of health systems in preparing for, and managing, associated morbidity and mortality. For example, in the Vancouver Coastal Health jurisdiction of British Columbia, Canada, a scoping report provided information on climate projections for the region, possible risks that threaten facilities, and recommendations for taking adaptation actions in order to inform efforts to prepare facilities for the impacts of climate change [
   <a rid="B45-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-15-02370">45</a>]. The stocktake and review should leverage efforts already undertaken, particularly results from health V&amp;A assessments and adaptation planning documents.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examples of relevant information include (1) trends in temperature, precipitation, and extreme events over recent decades; (2) national or subnational research on the health risks of climate change; (3) national or subnational research on sectors that affect population health, such as the possible impacts of climate change on water and food safety and security; (4) information about the health system (e.g., number and types of specific health workers, number of hospitals and services offered at each, frequency of stockouts, description of supply-chains, baseline health metrics, etc.); (5) information on the spatial distribution of vulnerable groups, particularly those that are likely to need additional assistance or ad hoc services in a disaster, such as those with electricity-dependent life-sustaining devices at home, those on hemodialysis, those on opioid replacement therapy, and pregnant women, among others; (6) information on health- and other insurance coverage, and on the capitalization of the health system, as well as standing plans for rescue support including, but not limited to, mutual aid agreements, emergency, and other sources of funding, and other needed support for disaster recovery; and (7) recent national and subnational climate change and health V&amp;A assessments. Additionally, it may be advantageous to collect other information on physical infrastructure (structure and vulnerabilities of the electricity grid, road networks, etc.) that may be vulnerable during extreme weather events and which affect health systems. 
   <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-15-02370" href="#app1-ijerph-15-02370">Appendix A</a> suggests guiding questions to identify where impacts may occur today or in the future. Additional questions will arise based on specifics of the local context.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depending on the hypothetical situations (scenarios) of interest, it could be helpful to collect additional data and/or conduct modeling to generate further details for the stress test. For example, if the interest is in extreme events, then it could be informative to model possible increases in the intensity of events in the tail of the distribution in mid-century. The modeling could also consider where and when urbanization could increase, population aging, and other factors that could affect vulnerability to the event.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although access to data and other resources will improve the stress test, in low-resource situations, it is possible to utilize realistic scenarios (e.g., based on events experienced in similar jurisdictions) in place of those tailored specifically to the jurisdiction in question. In this sense, stress testing both increases the accessibility of climate resilience analysis and may result in the buy-in necessary for senior decision-makers to allocate resources needed for a broader V&amp;A assessment or other forms of analysis.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Identify priority health system functions to be considered in the stress test</span>: The stress test team will identify a preliminary list of critical health system functions to consider in the stress test, including measures of effective function, such as minimum number of healthcare professionals, access to essential medical products (including supply chain needs), and financing needed. Health system functions of potential interest include how to manage changes in the magnitude and pattern of climate-sensitive health outcomes over the coming decades with additional climate change, such as increases in the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme weather and climate events, and the spread of infectious diseases [
   <a rid="B3-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-15-02370">3</a>]. Informal interviews with ministry of health staff, researchers, and other experts may identify other parameters of potential interest. General metrics of health system competency (e.g., daily all-cause mortality rates, in-hospital mortality rates, and cause-specific morbidity and mortality rates for vulnerable populations) are also important to consider because they provide generalizable indicators that are not specific to particular hazards, and because they capture health effects on populations that are not as directly affected. The stocktake will help with the other steps; for example, information from recent national and local assessments will be useful in identifying priority health system functions for the stress test, considered from the perspective of potential changes in the components of risk: hazards, exposure, and vulnerability. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Develop desk-based hypothetical situations (scenarios) of shocks and stresses</span>: The climate and health stress test team should develop several possible hypothetical scenarios for consideration in the workshop. These can range from relatively simple (e.g., heatwave outside historic experience during which the power grid fails) to more complex scenarios, including, for example, interacting and cascading events (e.g., heatwave coupled with wildfires that significantly affect air quality and also affect agricultural productivity) and/or events that affect supply chains (e.g., flooding that limits the ability to bring in needed supplies of medicines, food, and water, or the ability of affected individuals to reach healthcare). The scenarios could be informed by events that occurred in the past or in other regions. Basing the premise of the scenario in past real-world events, particularly those that took place in similar countries and regions, may help increase engagement from local decision-makers. Scenarios should be tailored to the region of interest, accounting for local factors that could affect the magnitude and pattern of the hazard or response. However, they should also describe threats that are beyond historic experience to account for possible future climate change impacts. The scenarios should test the capacity of health systems to manage shocks and stresses projected with climate change in the coming decades, with lower probabilities but more severe consequences. Real-world events experienced in similar geographic settings and plausible, yet currently infrequent, events, may be used in cases where high-quality data and modelling capacity are low. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the selection of the aspects of health systems and services of interest in the stress test, the scenarios should incorporate relevant information on the status and location of critical infrastructure (e.g., the probability that the power grid could fail during a heatwave, putting additional people at risk) and other factors that will affect the ability of the health system to manage the situation (e.g., a disease outbreak that significantly increases emergency department visits, increases hospital admission rates, decreases discharge rates, or stresses critical care capacity). A short description of each should be developed for discussion during the climate change and health stress test workshop (stage 2).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Map stakeholders for inclusion in the stress test workshop</span>: Strong partnerships, social networks, and inclusiveness are key characteristics of resilience and are important facilitators of effective ad hoc disaster response in the health sector [
   <a rid="B46-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-15-02370">46</a>]. A climate change and health stress test is an opportunity to identify and strengthen connections among stakeholders. To be effective, the workshop should engage a broad range of stakeholders, from local to national governments and civil society. These stakeholders should include officials in charge of health system entities vulnerable to shocks and stresses, as well as individuals who have decision-making roles in developing and implementing resilience-building strategies, including for upstream drivers of population health. Other potential stakeholders include technical staff at the ministry of health; representatives of healthcare facilities and medical clinics; representatives from the mental health and long-term care sectors, pharmacists, health emergency managers, supply chain workers, public health officials, emergency responders, and others. Additionally, it is generally desirable to have representation from actors serving in national to local organizations and/or government initiatives (e.g., public utilities/service providers, planning agencies, public-private agencies providing household services, etc.); private sector officials (e.g., chambers of commerce, industry groups, etc.); NGOs and community groups; and schools, universities, and research institutes. For health authorities with many pressing priorities, it can be difficult to allocate the time and financial and human resources to undertake a stress test. Including a broad range of stakeholders based on strong social networks and partnerships can help address these challenges.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5.2. Stage 2: Conduct the Climate Change and Health Stress Test</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The stress test will present and discuss the scenarios, as well as any necessary background information to evaluate how well health systems and services could function during and after the scenario. If other modalities, such as modeling, are used, the findings from these efforts also should be discussed. These discussions should identify what additional resources, tools, and policies could prevent or ameliorate adverse consequences for health system functioning or population health. The discussions could also identify where collaborations could be strengthened, such as among health authorities at different levels of government and among various sectoral partners, for example, the ministry of health and electric and water utilities.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Together, the team conducting the stress test, the ministry/department of health, and other key stakeholders, should draft the agenda and presentations, as well as identify the draft list of participants. Including a relatively large number of participants in the workshop will facilitate information sharing and more diverse discussions. The ministry/department of health and other government partners can be helpful in disseminating invitations to key stakeholders. If particular key stakeholders are not able to attend, then the stress test team should meet with these individuals separately to gather their insights for the exercise.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The stress test workshop length depends on the need to provide participants with detailed background and contextual information on climate change impacts on health and health systems and on the hypothetical scenarios. The goal is to assess the extent to which the assembled actors could manage real events based on the scenarios, and to identify what additional policies, capacity building, and resources would be needed to effectively handle these situations. This is an opportunity for diverse stakeholders to exchange views on risks that could constrain the health system from achieving its goals to promote and protect healthy populations. The discussions can provide insights on what additional information, resources, policies, programs etc. would be needed for the health system to be resilient to the impacts of climate change. For example, the stress test workshop may highlight opportunities for education on key issues of concern, such as the risks of heatwaves on mental wellness, or the long-term psychosocial treatment needs related to trauma from extreme weather events. 
   <a ref-type="app" rid="app2-ijerph-15-02370" href="#app2-ijerph-15-02370">Appendix B</a> lists possible modules to include in stress test workshops, and 
   <a ref-type="app" rid="app3-ijerph-15-02370" href="#app3-ijerph-15-02370">Appendix C</a> provides guiding questions to facilitate discussions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examples of additional actions for health systems to manage shocks and stresses associated with climate change are presented in 
   <a ref-type="app" rid="app4-ijerph-15-02370" href="#app4-ijerph-15-02370">Appendix D</a>. There are several factors that participants should consider when recommending which actions to undertake, including:
   <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Necessity—which actions are most critical;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Timing—when a particular facility, program or other health system function may be vulnerable to certain climate impacts and when particular actions should be taken in to prepare for and respond to the timing of the hazard and other preparation and response activities;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Capacity—whether current surge capacity levels and available expertise are sufficient to handle projected impacts, or whether these need to be increased;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Likely losses—expected increases in morbidity and mortality; facilities where adaptation is prohibitively expensive and should not be undertaken; areas where programs or polices will need to be reevaluated due to unavoidable impacts (e.g., health transportation and supply lines that rely on ice roads); and contingent additional losses if mutual aid is not available); and</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Costs—the economic, political, environmental, and social costs of taking actions to increase resilience, whether they are manageable and how they compare to the costs of inaction.</p>
    </div>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prioritizing actions and investments can be done through multi-criteria analyses, or risk-based prioritization. More specific examination of whether the costs of adaptation warrant investment in specific measures may use cost–benefit analyses or cost-effectiveness analyses [
   <a rid="B19-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-15-02370">19</a>]. The approach used will often depend on the data, expertise, and timeframe available for the analysis and the needs of decision-makers. For example, cost-effectiveness analysis would require robust information on the expected effectiveness of the suite of adaptation options under consideration; this information may be limited, or not available. The recommendations can be categorized into urgent and immediate actions (e.g., capacity building, data collection, records management, social network development, etc.), medium- and longer-term actions (new program development, infrastructure modifications or re-siting, etc.), and measures to strengthen contingency planning for shocks and stresses, thereby reducing the vulnerability of the health system. The recommendations should address specific climate-sensitive health risks, and include measures to protect vulnerable communities, groups, or assets, in the context of low-carbon development.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stress test participants should attempt to collectively agree on the major findings from the climate change and health stress test, with respect to the ability of different elements of the health system to manage the hypothetical scenarios, as well as additional policies, programs, and actions that could increase their capacity to prepare for and manage the changes. Moreover, there should be discussion of who should follow-up on recommended actions and on next steps for using the results to inform policies to increase resilience to climate variability and change. Participants should also stipulate a timeframe to reassess planning efforts going forward.</p>

 <sec id="sec5dot3-ijerph-15-02370" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5.3. Stage 3: Communicate the Results to Decision-Makers and the Public</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate and health stress test results and recommendations should be communicated to decision-makers in health systems and to other stakeholders through, for example, a summary report and other materials (e.g., policy briefs), taking into consideration the best mechanisms, opportunities, and products to communicate the findings. For example, an investigation of critical public health infrastructure vulnerabilities in California included a map showing the location of hospitals on California’s coast, and current risks associated with a 100-year coastal flood event and future risk from projected sea level rise [
   <a rid="B47-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-15-02370">47</a>]. Report recommendations should be informed by results from recent climate change and health V&amp;A assessments to provide additional insights into the timing and level of adaptation ambition, taking into account factors such as the likelihood and timing of the threats, competing demands, windows of opportunity based on current and planned projects, and stakeholder concerns and preferences. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The report also should discuss the limitations of the stress test. The analyzed scenarios are hypothetical situations that, while outside the range of recent experiences, could still underestimate the speed with which vector-borne diseases could change their range or the severity of future extreme weather and climate events, and could overestimate the effectiveness of the health (or other) system responses. The report should indicate how the results could be combined with the findings from other studies, or integrated into future assessments, to maximize a health system unit’s understanding of climate change threats and the opportunities to adapt.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a component of the iterative management of the health risks of climate change, the stress test should be repeated every few years, if possible, using the previously assessed scenario and updated scenarios, to measure the extent to which preparedness is changing over time, and whether resilience is increasing or decreasing relative to baseline indicators. Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted in the perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses. The findings, and their implications, should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.</p>
