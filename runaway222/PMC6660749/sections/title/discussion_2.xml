 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the influence of social networks on individual beliefs and behaviors, the role of climate change discussions with friends and family has received little research attention. Here we find that discussion can generate a feedback loop where people who discuss global warming become more likely to learn influential facts such as the scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming, which encourages further discussion. Importantly, indirect effects of discussion were significantly stronger than those of the scientific consensus, suggesting that encouraging people to discuss global warming with their friends and family may be a productive way to initiate the social feedback loop, but that the actual content of the discussion itself (e.g., scientific agreement) plays a key role in changing relevant beliefs.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of global warming discussion among one’s own social network may be especially important given the powerful influence of messengers on message effects (

  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>). For example, when the message comes from close friends and family, people less engaged with the issue may be more receptive than when an identical message is communicated by someone not part of their close social network.

Discussion with others in one’s close social network, on the other hand, appears to be an important route by which people learn key facts about an issue, such as the scientific consensus. Without discussing global warming, people may never learn important facts about climate change, or that close friends and family care about the issue. Our findings show that, through discussion, people can engage their friends and family in a positive feedback loop that encourages deeper engagement with the issue of climate change.
