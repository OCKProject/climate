  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Respondents were recruited as part of the Climate Change in the American Mind project to participate in a survey on global warming beliefs, attitudes, and policy preferences. To measure global warming discussion, we asked, “How often do you discuss global warming with your family and friends?” (1 = 
   <span class="italic">Never</span>, 4 = 
   <span class="italic">Often</span>). Respondents reported their estimates of scientific agreement by answering, “To the best of your knowledge, what percentage of climate scientists think that human-caused global warming is happening?” (0–100%). The question gauging whether respondents believe global warming is happening was “...Do you believe that global warming is or is not happening?” (1 = 
   <span class="italic">No</span>, 2 = 
   <span class="italic">Don’t Know</span>, 3 = 
   <span class="italic">Yes</span>). For human-causation, respondents answered, “Assuming global warming is happening, do you think it is...” (1 = 
   <span class="italic">None of the above because global warming is not happening</span>, 2 = 
   <span class="italic">Caused mostly by natural changes in the environment</span>, 3 = 
   <span class="italic">Caused mostly by human activities</span>). To measure worry about global warming, respondents were asked, “How worried are you about global warming?” (1 = 
   <span class="italic">Not at all worried</span>, 4 = 
   <span class="italic">Very worried</span>). Questions were identical at both time points.
