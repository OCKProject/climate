 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A nationally representative probability sample of US adults (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,263) was surveyed at 2 time points about 7 mo apart. We used the SEM module in STATA (version 15) to conduct a cross-lagged panel analysis investigating 1) changes in perceptions of scientific consensus as a result of discussion with family and friends, 2) changes in climate change discussion as a result of perceptions of the scientific consensus, and 3) the indirect effects of discussion and consensus beliefs on cognitive and affective judgments about climate change.
