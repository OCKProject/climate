  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>. The results provide evidence for reciprocal causality. That is, discussion of global warming at time 1 led to increased perceptions of scientific agreement at time 2 (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.080, 95% CI [0.029, 0.131]), and, equally, perceptions of scientific agreement at time 1 led to increases in global warming discussion at time 2 (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.100, 95% CI [0.042, 0.156]). These findings demonstrate a change in each variable at time 2 because the model controls for scores of the same variables at time 1 (see ref.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increases in perceptions of scientific agreement over time, in turn, led to significant increases in the belief that global warming is happening and human-caused, as well as worry about global warming. Increases in discussion over time did not lead to downstream increases in the belief that global warming is happening or human-caused, but did lead to increases in worry (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indirect effect of discussion via an increase in perceptions of scientific agreement was significant for the belief that global warming is happening (

  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.025, 95% CI [0.021, 0.030]), and worry (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.018, 95% CI [0.013, 0.023]). Likewise, the indirect effect of perceptions of scientific agreement via an increase in global warming discussion was significant for the belief that global warming is happening (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.004, 95% CI [0.003, 0.004]), the belief that global warming is human-caused (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.003, 95% CI [0.002, 0.004]), and worry (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.007, 95% CI [0.001, 0.012]). Compared with the indirect effects of perceived scientific agreement, the indirect effects of discussion were significantly stronger for the belief that global warming is happening (
  <span class="italic">Z</span> = 13.879, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001), the belief that global warming is human-caused (
