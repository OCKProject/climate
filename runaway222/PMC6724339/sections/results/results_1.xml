  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. There were slightly more female respondents than male respondents and the most common working sector was the municipal sector. Most of the respondents came from Estonia (38%) or the Russian Federation / former Soviet Union (30%). The mean time since getting a license to practice a profession in Finland was 5.2 years. Almost half of the respondents had turnover intentions and 14.5% had considered leaving the country. Seventy-four percent were satisfied with living in Finland (gaining a rating of 8–10 on a scale ranging from 0 to 10; the mean score was 8.3).

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Logistic regression analyses showed that discrimination, employment barriers, satisfaction with living in Finland and team climate were significantly associated with turnover intentions in fully adjusted model (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). High levels of discrimination and employment barriers were associated with a higher likelihood of turnover intentions. Those who had high satisfaction regarding living in Finland were about half less likely to have turnover intentions compared to those with low satisfaction. High levels of team climate were associated with a lower likelihood of turnover intentions. To be able to evaluate the relative importance of these significant variables, we calculated standardized beta weights for them according to King’s [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>] instructions. Standardized beta weights were 0.086 for discrimination, 0.085 for employment barriers, − 0.068 for satisfaction with living in Finland and − 0.086 for team climate. Thus, satisfaction with living in Finland had lower power compared to other variables.
