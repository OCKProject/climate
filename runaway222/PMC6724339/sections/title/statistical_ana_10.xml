 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effects of independent variables on turnover intentions and intentions to leave the country were examined with binary logistic regression analyses (in separate analyses). The analyses were conducted in two steps. First, the effects of gender, age, employment sector, country of birth and the number of years from getting a practicing license in Finland were examined (Model A). In the second step, discrimination, language problems, employment barriers, satisfaction with living in Finland, team climate, job satisfaction and patient-related stress were added to the former model (Model B). A multi-collinearity analysis of the study variables was performed. The variance inflation factors (VIF) associated with the variables were all below 1.5, showing that multi-collinearity is not a concern in this study [
