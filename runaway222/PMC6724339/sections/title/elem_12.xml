 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study examined foreign-born physicians’ turnover intentions and intention to leave Finland. Our results showed that those who had high satisfaction regarding living in Finland were less likely to have turnover intentions and intentions to leave the country compared to those with low satisfaction regarding living in Finland. Moreover, high levels of discrimination and employment barriers were associated with a higher likelihood of turnover intentions, and high levels of language problems were associated with a higher likelihood of intentions to leave the country. In contrast, high levels of team climate were associated with a lower likelihood of turnover intentions.</p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our finding that satisfaction with living in Finland was associated with both turnover intentions and intentions to leave the country is congruent with previous findings. For example, in Ireland almost half of the foreign-born physicians planned to migrate onwards and dissatisfaction with living in Ireland was associated with these migratory intentions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Among Canadian family physicians, dissatisfaction with professional life was the most powerful predictor of planning migration abroad and interprovincial migration [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. Thus, satisfaction with living in the host country, professional life and work–life balance are important factors that attach foreign-born physicians to their workplaces and host country. Fortunately, a previous study showed that foreign-born physicians had better life satisfaction compared to those physicians who remained in their source country and even compared to native physicians in the host country [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study found that discrimination was associated with turnover intentions but not with intentions to leave the country. This is logical given that the present study measured work-related discrimination coming from management, colleagues and patients, and thus, the discrimination is experienced more as a problem with the current job, not as a problem with the host country. Perceived discrimination (also) outside work environment would perhaps associate better with intentions to leave the country. Thus, to retain their foreign-born physicians, health care organisations should focus on eliminating discrimination in the workplace. For example, diversity training; resource development and provision; systems to monitor staff and client outcomes including self-assessment; flexible working arrangements and new culturally-specific networks have been suggested as means to reduce culture-based discrimination in the workplaces [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. However, it seems that there is still a lot to do in this regard given that foreign-born physicians have been found to encounter insensitivity, discrimination and isolation in their workplaces [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. Moreover, foreign-born physicians face threats or violence from patients [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>], harassment from their colleagues [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>] and difficulties in interpersonal interactions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. Physicians and nurses with African origin seem to be especially vulnerable to discrimination in Europe [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A major problem among foreign-born physicians is poor language skills in regard to host country’s mother tongue [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>], which has come up also in Finland [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>], and according to our results, this also pushes foreign-born physician to move away from Finland. Language problems may make physicians’ work in a foreign country very difficult as it may lead to diagnostic errors and inappropriate treatment, as well as result in communication problems [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. It has been found that foreign-born physicians’ language problems burden work teams and increase responsibility in patient care, especially that of nursing personnel [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Foreign-born physicians’ language problems have been found to be most evident within face-to-face doctor–patient conversations and doctor-patient consultations on the telephone [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that those who experienced that employment barriers – such as employer attitudes, insufficient relationships with people of Finnish origin and one’s uncertainty – hindered them from getting a job were more eager to change their current job. Thus, it is possible that those who experienced difficulties in getting employed were more likely to be in jobs that were not ideal for them. Previous studies show that migrant employees face discrimination in occupational attainment and often have to work in lower-level jobs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Migrated physicians coming from African countries have been found to experience de-skilling, problems in the recognition of their qualifications and the need for extra training in Europe [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to our results, foreign-born physicians have less turnover intentions in workplaces where the team climate is good. Thus promoting a good team climate in cross-cultural work teams may help retain foreign-born physicians. For maintaining good team climate in multicultural teams organizations should focus on management of communication, putting emphasis on shared universal values, offering regular team reflections, decreasing time constraints, and giving formal leadership coaching [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. For leaders it is important to focus on role-modelling civil engagement, reflections and willingness to receive feedback, allowing for minority opinions and avoiding blame and criticism [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. The conflict management is complex in multicultural teams [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>] and it has been previously shown that a poor team climate is especially a risk in culturally diverse work units [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>], thus it is also important to recognize the role of emotions and how to use emotions in facilitating team processes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. A good team climate may also promote high quality care because it may increase professional support and shared objectives [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]. A good team climate promotes free communication, information sharing and experiences of acceptance [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surprisingly job satisfaction and patient-related stress were not associated with turnover intentions or intentions to leave the country in our study. This is congruent with a previous finding among Swedish foreign-born physicians showing that patient-related stress was not associated with turnover intentions after adjusting for control over work pace and empowering leadership [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Instead that study found that actual threats or violence from patients was associated with turnover intentions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Our findings are, however, discrepant to previous studies showing that job satisfaction is associated with turnover intentions, for example, among physicians working in United States [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>] and in Guangdong [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. One reason for the discrepancy may be related to the sample: our sample included only foreign-born physicians, whereas above mentioned studies included mostly native physicians.
 </p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show that if countries worldwide wish to keep their foreign-born physicians, they should invest in good work and living conditions, language training and employment possibilities. This is especially important in countries having high numbers of foreign-born physicians such as United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada where approximately every fourth physician can be foreign-born [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. However, in their immigration policies countries should also consider that there can be big negative ramifications and ethical problems in reliance on foreign-born physicians. The emigration can be a great loss to the health systems of the source country which quite often are lower-income countries [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. There are financial and human capital investments that are lost in the source countries [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>]. Therefore, countries with high levels of foreign-born physicians should also consider investing on nation’s own domestic medical education.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations</div>
  <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study relied on self-reported measures, thus inflation of the strengths of relationships and common method variance may have caused problems. Moreover, residual confounding may be an issue here even though we controlled for age, gender, employment sector, country of birth and the number of years from getting a practicing licence in Finland. We cannot draw any causal inferences because of the cross-sectional nature of our study. Moreover, our study has some representative issues because we were not able to get information about citizenship or country of birth from the registers when drawing the sample. Thus, having a mother tongue that is a language other than Finnish or Swedish (the official languages in Finland) was used as an inclusion criterion to attempt to ensure the exclusion of native Finnish physicians who have studied abroad. However, this also excluded foreign-born physicians whose mother tongue was Swedish. Nonetheless, they comprise a very small portion of foreign-born physicians working in Finland (in 2010 they accounted for approximately 2% of foreign-born physicians working in Finland [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]).
  </p>
  <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, when interpreting our results it is important to keep in mind that physicians’ intentions to leave will not necessarily translate into action. However, the intention to leave has gained support as an important predictor of actual staff turnover (a typical correlation being 0.50) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. Moreover, it has been found that physicians who reported that they were very likely to leave their current practice were 2.4 times more likely to have done so 4 years later than those who reported that they were very unlikely to leave [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>]. However, there also exist findings suggesting that intention to leave is not a very powerful indicator of actually leaving, given that only 35% of those who had intended to leave clinical practice had actually left in a three-year follow-up [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. Another measure of turnover intention than our measure could perhaps be more strongly associated with actual turnover. For example, asking about firm plans to change within the next year or inquiring about moving or getting a new job within the past 3 months might be stronger indicators of actual turnover.
