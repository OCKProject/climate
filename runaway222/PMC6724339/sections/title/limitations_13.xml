 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study relied on self-reported measures, thus inflation of the strengths of relationships and common method variance may have caused problems. Moreover, residual confounding may be an issue here even though we controlled for age, gender, employment sector, country of birth and the number of years from getting a practicing licence in Finland. We cannot draw any causal inferences because of the cross-sectional nature of our study. Moreover, our study has some representative issues because we were not able to get information about citizenship or country of birth from the registers when drawing the sample. Thus, having a mother tongue that is a language other than Finnish or Swedish (the official languages in Finland) was used as an inclusion criterion to attempt to ensure the exclusion of native Finnish physicians who have studied abroad. However, this also excluded foreign-born physicians whose mother tongue was Swedish. Nonetheless, they comprise a very small portion of foreign-born physicians working in Finland (in 2010 they accounted for approximately 2% of foreign-born physicians working in Finland [

 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, when interpreting our results it is important to keep in mind that physiciansâ€™ intentions to leave will not necessarily translate into action. However, the intention to leave has gained support as an important predictor of actual staff turnover (a typical correlation being 0.50) [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. Moreover, it has been found that physicians who reported that they were very likely to leave their current practice were 2.4 times more likely to have done so 4 years later than those who reported that they were very unlikely to leave [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>]. However, there also exist findings suggesting that intention to leave is not a very powerful indicator of actually leaving, given that only 35% of those who had intended to leave clinical practice had actually left in a three-year follow-up [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. Another measure of turnover intention than our measure could perhaps be more strongly associated with actual turnover. For example, asking about firm plans to change within the next year or inquiring about moving or getting a new job within the past 3 months might be stronger indicators of actual turnover.
