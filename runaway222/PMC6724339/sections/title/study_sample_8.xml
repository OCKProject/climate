 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A questionnaire survey was conducted in the autumn of 2017 (14th of September–5th of November) in Finland. Information was obtained from Valvira’s (the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health) Terhikki central register. All the physicians born after 1944 who had completed their medical education outside of Finland and who had received a license to practice medicine in Finland (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1564) were included to the sample. Email addresses (provided by the Finnish Medical Association) or postal addresses (provided by the Population Register Centre) were obtained for 1012 physicians. Living abroad or not having a permanent address in Finland and non-disclosure for purposes such as direct advertising or for personal safety reasons were the most important reasons for not getting the postal addresses. The physicians whose mother tongue was one of the two official language in Finland (Finnish or Swedish; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 203) were excluded to rule out native Finns who had studied abroad. Consequently, the questionnaire was sent to 809 physicians.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used webropol questionnaire service and sent an email invitation with a link to the electronic survey for those whose email addresses we had. For others, a postal invitation to participate in the electronic survey was sent to their home addresses. Two reminders in 3 weeks interval were sent to those who had not responded. Additional postal paper version of the questionnaire (only in Finnish) was sent with the second reminder. Altogether 375 (46% of those who the questionnaire was sent to) physicians responded to the survey. The electronic questionnaire was available in Finnish, Swedish, Estonian, Russian and English languages; 153 of the respondents answered the electronic version in Finnish, two in Swedish, 64 in Estonian, 60 in Russian and 22 in English. Seventy-four responded by the postal questionnaire, which was only available in Finnish. We asked the country of birth in the questionnaire, thus we were able to identify those who were actually foreign-born. Of the respondents, we excluded two respondents who had studied abroad and whose mother tongue was other than Finnish or Swedish but who reported being born in Finland. Moreover, two respondents were excluded because they did not provide us with the information about their country of birth. Thus, the final study sample included 371 foreign-born physicians aged between 26 and 65 (mean age: 39.1; 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 9.09; 65% women).
