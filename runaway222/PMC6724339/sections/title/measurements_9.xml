 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the measures used in the present study have already been tested in our previous data gathering among Finnish foreign-born physicians in 2010/2011 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. The questionnaire can be found from the Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>.

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Turnover intentions</span> were measured with a question asking whether the respondent had planned changing employment. The response options were: 1) 
  <span class="italic">no</span>, 2) 
  <span class="italic">possibly</span>, 3) 
  <span class="italic">yes</span>. For the analyses the measure was coded as 0 = 
  <span class="italic">no</span> and 1 = 
  <span class="italic">yes</span> and 
  <span class="italic">possibly</span>. 
  <span class="italic">Intentions to move country</span> was measured with a question asking whether the respondent had plans to move to work in another country during the next 12 months. The response options and coding were the same as in the question for turnover intentions. Binary coding was chosen for these variables because the amount of “yes” answers was rather low especially for intention to leave the country (4,3%) and binary coding allowed us to conduct logistic regression analyses (with odds ratios and easy interpretation of the results).

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Discrimination</span> was measured with a mean of three items (α = 0.72) that have previously been used among foreign-born physicians in Finland [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>] to assess whether a person had experienced personal discrimination at work during the last 12 months coming from 1) superiors and management, 2) colleagues and fellow employees and 3) patients/clients. The items were rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (
  <span class="italic">hardly ever</span>) to 5 (
  <span class="italic">very often</span> or 
  <span class="italic">continuously</span>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Language problems</span> were measured with the mean of seven items (α = 0.96) that have previously been used among foreign-born physicians in Finland [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>] to ask how often the respondent experienced work-related communication challenges in using Finnish language in a) face-to-face communication with patients, b) face-to-face communication with co-workers, c) workplace meetings, d) keeping up with professional literature, e) recording data in patient information systems, f) electronic communication and g) communication over the phone. The items were rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (
  <span class="italic">hardly ever</span>) to 5 (
  <span class="italic">very often</span> or 
  <span class="italic">continuously</span>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Employment barriers</span> were measured with the mean of four items (α = 0.70) that asked whether employer attitudes, difficulties in finding information about job vacancies, insufficient relationships with people of Finnish origin and one’s uncertainty had prevented the respondent from getting a job she or he wanted in Finland during the past 2 years (1 = 
  <span class="italic">not at all</span>, 2 = 
  <span class="italic">to some extent</span> and 3 = 
  <span class="italic">a lot</span>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Satisfaction with living in Finland</span> was assessed by a asking how satisfied or dissatisfied the respondent was overall with his or her life in Finland. The response options ranged between 0 (
  <span class="italic">very dissatisfied</span>) and 10 (
  <span class="italic">very satisfied</span>). For the statistical analyses, the measure was coded as 
  <span class="italic">low</span> = 0–7 (26% of the respondents) and 
  <span class="italic">high</span> = 8–10 (74%) (this was done because the measure included only one item).
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Team climate</span> was measured with the mean of four items (α = 0.90) from the Team Climate Inventory (TCI) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>] which measures team participation, such as interaction frequency and information sharing. The items were rated on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (
  <span class="italic">fully disagree</span>) to 5 (
  <span class="italic">fully agree</span>), with higher scores indicating a better team climate.
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Job satisfaction</span> was measured with one item from Job Diagnostic Survey’s [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>] scale for overall satisfaction with the job (‘Generally speaking I am very satisfied with this job’). The item was rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (
  <span class="italic">fully disagree</span>) to 5 (
  <span class="italic">fully agree</span>). Because this measure included only one item this measure was coded as 
  <span class="italic">low</span> = 1–4 (54% of the respondents) and 
  <span class="italic">high</span> = 5 (46%) for the analyses.
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Patient-related stress</span> was measured by the mean of three items (α = 0.82) that asked participants how often the situation described in the statement had disturbed them, worried them or caused them stress during last half-year period using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (
  <span class="italic">hardly ever</span>) to 5 (
  <span class="italic">very often</span> or 
  <span class="italic">continuously</span>) with higher scores indicating higher stress. The items were: a) ‘Patients’ expectations frequently differ from those of health care personnel’, b) ‘Difficult patients who complain, blame and criticize’ and c) ‘Patients who are unwilling to co-operate and passive’. These items have been developed based on earlier studies carried out in the health care sector [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. The measure has been used previously among foreign-born physicians [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">The employment sector</span> was categorised into three groups: the municipal sector (e.g. primary care), the state sector (e.g. hospitals) and the private sector. 
  <span class="italic">The country of birth</span> was asked about in the questionnaire with an open-ended question and categorised as a) Estonia, b) the Russian Federation / former Soviet Union, c) EU/EEA countries other than Estonia and d) other countries not covered by a–c.
