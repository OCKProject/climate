 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Physician shortage is an increasing problem that threatens the functioning of the health care sector worldwide. One problem associated with the physician shortage is increased physician turnover. For example, one-fifth of English general practitioners (GPs) have been found to intend to quit direct patient care within 5 years [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. This is worrying, given that turnover intention has a direct association with actual turnover and is regarded as an important predictor of quitting [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. Physician turnover may lead to decreased productivity, poorer patient care and to an increased need to recruit and train new physicians [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. This can be costly and affect health outcomes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. It has been shown that work-related factors such as better collegial support and opportunities for professional development may help to recruit and retain physicians [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Whereas, low job satisfaction, work-related stress, physical violence or threats from patients, and dealing with uncooperative patients have all been associated with higher levels of physicians’ turnover intentions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Foreign-born physicians fill in the shortage of physicians in many developed countries, such as the US, the UK, Australia and Canada [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. In Finland, the number of foreign-born physicians has not traditionally been very high, but since the year 2000 the number has doubled, being 4 % of the physician population in 2000 and 8.4% in 2012 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. Finland joining the EU in 1995, a change in Finnish policy environment, and increasing physician shortage have been suggested as contributing to inflow increase since 2000 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Finland has alleviated the shortage of practitioners, especially general practitioners, with foreign-born physicians, but it has been suggested that Finland may have difficulties in attracting and retaining foreign-born physicians in the future, for example, due to difficult licensing processes and high job strain in primary care [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the dual labour market theory [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], migrant employees have a high risk of job instability and high turnover. Previous results show that foreign-born physicians are more likely to have turnover intentions compared to native physicians [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. Foreign-born physicians’ turnover may be very harmful for organizations, given that the costs of turnover may be even more severe because of the higher investments in training and support needed among foreign-born physicians compared to native physicians.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Health care organisations have to put effort into integrating foreign-born physicians into the work environment of the country in question and all this effort is lost if the physicians leave the country. Therefore, another aspect of interest that might be of importance is foreign-born physicians’ intention to leave the country. It has been suggested that physician migration is a ‘carousel’, where physicians move from one country to the next, trying to find further advantages or as a response to disappointments in the host country [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. In a study from Ireland, it was found that 23% of foreign physicians planned to return home and 47% planned to migrate onwards; low satisfaction with living in Ireland was associated with high migratory intentions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Low job satisfaction, long working hours and poor working conditions have also been mentioned as factors that are associated with the intent to leave the country [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For foreign-born physicians, also the success of integration into working life is likely an important factor when deciding whether to change job or to stay in the host country. Previous studies have shown that there are notable problems in such integration. Foreign-born physicians have been found to be susceptible to encountering insensitivity, discrimination and isolation in their workplace [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. Moreover, foreign-born physicians have also been found to encounter threats or violence from patients [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>] and harassment from colleagues [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. Also high work-related distress and the lack of professional support and consultation possibilities may burden foreign-born physicians more than native physicians [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. Foreign-born physicians may face many other barriers to their employment also, one of the most obvious ones being poor language skills regarding the host country’s language [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. The importance of foreign-born physicians’ language problems in burdening the whole work team has been highlighted in a recent Finnish study [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. Language problems have high relevance to the quality of health care given that it may lead to diagnostic errors and inappropriate treatment [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>] as well as result in other communication problems. Moreover, doubts about one’s professional competence norms and legislation may all challenge migrant physicians’ employment [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A concept that has previously been found important in culturally diverse working environments is that of 
  <span class="italic">team climate</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. A good team climate in a work unit might leave less space for discrimination and promote good cross-cultural communication, and therefore, it might help to decrease foreign-born physicians’ turnover intentions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, foreign-born physicians’ turnover and emigration may have many negative ramifications for health care organizations. Moreover, previous studies show that work-related factors such as job satisfaction have an effect on physicians’ turnover intentions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. In addition, migration-related variables, like discrimination, length of stay and language problems, have been found to be important aspects of foreign-born physicians’ integration to working life [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. However, evidence about factors associated with foreign-born physicians’ intentions to turnover and country change is still lacking. In light of these findings, the present study aimed to examine the turnover intentions and intentions to leave the country of foreign-born physicians in Finland. More specifically, we examined how gender, age, employment sector, country of birth, the number of years from getting a practicing license in Finland, discrimination, language problems, perceived employment barriers, satisfaction with living in Finland, team climate, job satisfaction and patient-related stress were associated with turnover intentions and intentions to leave the country. Gender, age and employment sector were chosen as adjustments variables because they have been found to have a big adjusting effect among physicians on relations between work characteristics and different outcomes in previous studies with Finnish physicians [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>].
