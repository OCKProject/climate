 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Critical transitions are an important feature in many systems, in which the state of a system changes abruptly and a return to the previous state becomes difficult or even impossible. Such transitions can be observed in medicine [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each of those systems it is important to predict an imminent critical transition in order to prevent it or adapt to it in time [
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref010">10</a>]. A prominent approach to this problem is to analyze time series. In this context, a time series is defined as a discrete-time series of data points in time order. Examples of such time-series are the average global temperature each year, the current value of a certain stock each day or brain activity each second. Such time series are then analyzed for statistical anomalies or similar markers that hint at a change on the micro-scale that is not yet visible on the macro-scale. Such markers are called early warning signals (EWSs) [
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref011">11</a>]. EWS analysis can be performed on measured data [
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref012">12</a>], data coming from equation-based simulations [
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref013">13</a>] and also data originating from agent-based models [
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref014">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unfortunately, the detection of such EWSs is not always straightforward. Sometimes the signals are hidden or obscured by topological effects [
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref015">15</a>] or the system shows a total lack of EWSs, despite featuring critical transitions [
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref016">16</a>]. This is called a false negative, since no signal can be detected, even though a critical transition is immanent. On the other hand, it is also possible to find EWSs in systems that will not show a critical transition. This is called a false positive and is especially problematic when used on statistical data in order to predict critical transitions in the future. In that case it is impossible to differentiate between a true and a false positive, since no data from future points in time are available to verify whether a critical transition follows the EWS or not. Various reasons can be responsible for the appearance of false positives: They can appear randomly, they can be caused by some microscopic system behavior that is not yet fully understood and sometimes the appearance of false positives is an inherent property of the system itself. Naturally, the last case is the most problematic one, because it means that such systems are unfit for traditional EWS analysis and one would need a different method to be able to predict critical transitions. In this paper we identify the classes of systems which are susceptible for such systematically false positives and find ways to overcome this challenge.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper is organized as follows: The section “Methods” gives a short introduction into the mathematical apparatus of EWS. Additionally, the investigated systems are introduced. Finally, possible solutions to the problem of systematic false positives are discussed. The section “Results” reports on the discovered EWS and showcases some of the performed EWS analyses in more detail. Also the effect of the proposed solutions is investigated. Furthermore, we test our findings by analyzing real world data of the global surface temperature change. In the “Discussion” section we comment on the relevance of the gained insights and how they can be used to improve state-of-the-art detection methods for critical transition, but also on the limitations of this study. Numeric details on the investigated systems can be found in Appendix A.</p>
