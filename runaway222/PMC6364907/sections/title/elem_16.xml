 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to test the insights we obtained from investigating abstract systems, we now perform an EWS analysis on real-world data. As an example time series we use the global surface temperature change. Statistical data was provided by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP) [
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref037">37</a>]. From looking at the raw data, we see that the temperature change has absolute fluctuations of roughly 0.25 Â°C. We also detect an increase in temperature change that is similar to a quadratic growth. Thus, the time series resembles the previously investigated system QG. Because of these similarities between the temperature change data and one of the investigated systems, we expect that also the temperature change data behave similar to the system QG, i.e. we suspect that an EWS analysis of the raw data will show an increase in autocorrelation as well as an increase in standard deviation (see 
  <a rid="pone.0211072.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0211072.t002">Table 2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results of the EWS analysis are presented in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211072.g007" href="#pone.0211072.g007">Fig 7</a>. As expected, we detect a rise in autocorrelation and standard deviation. However, we suspect that this rise should not be interpreted as an EWS, but rather as a general feature of a system resembling the abstract system QG. To check this hypothesis, we detrend the data using moving averages and repeat the EWS analysis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global surface temperature change shows exactly the same behavior as the abstract system QG: After detrending the increase in autocorrelation and standard deviation vanishes and we are unable to detect any EWS. The previously detected EWS was indeed a false positive, meaning that our insights from abstract, generic systems can be translated to real-world systems.</p>
