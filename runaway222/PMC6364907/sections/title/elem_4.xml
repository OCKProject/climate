 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to generate results that are not specific to individual systems, but rather universal properties of EWS analysis, we focus our investigation on generic systems. To cover a broad range of possible applications we simulate the most common forms of growth and decay. An overview of the investigated systems is given in in 
  <a rid="pone.0211072.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0211072.t001">Table 1</a>. Numerical details on how the time series were produced can be found in Appendix A. By this choice of example functions, many common systems can be described. Linear systems are, for example, often encountered in ecology and economics [
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref023">23</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref024">24</a>]. Economic growth and population growth can be described as an exponential growth, as long as we are far away from the maximal capacity [
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref025">25</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref026">26</a>] or with a logistic function when the effect of the maximal capacity becomes relevant [
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref027">27</a>]. Also the more exotic investigated functions, like the trigonometric ones, have scientific applications. The solar cycle [
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref028">28</a>] as well as many climate oscillations [
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref029">29</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211072.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211072.ref030">30</a>] are sine-like. Although not all systems of interest to EWS analysis can be described or approximated by the chosen systems or linear combinations thereof, we hope that essential features identified for these generic systems can also be translated to specific ones.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note, that by design none of the investigated systems are capable of having critical transitions. That way the distinction between false positives and correct positives becomes trivial, since all detected EWS must be false positives. This property makes the systems ideal for identifying systematically false positives.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All systems are simulated with statistical noise, so that they resemble real measurements or simulations more closely. This noise can be absolute (i.e. independent of the value 
  <span class="italic">x</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub>) or relative to 
  <span class="italic">x</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub>. We produce time series of 10000 time steps and calculate the previously defined properties relevant for EWS analysis in rolling windows of size 500. Then we search for significant EWSs: an increase in both 
  <span class="italic">Ïƒ</span> and 
  <span class="italic">AC</span>
  <span class="sup">(1)</span>, a change in 
  <span class="italic">S</span> or an increase in 
  <span class="italic">K</span>. The simulations were performed using Python. After initialization of each system their time development is calculated from the equations given in Appendix A. As a next step artificial noise is added. For absolute noise a Gaussian-distributed random number is added, while for relative noise each data point is multiplied by a Gaussian-distributed random number. Details on the random numbers are also given in Appendix A. The generated time series can be downloaded from
