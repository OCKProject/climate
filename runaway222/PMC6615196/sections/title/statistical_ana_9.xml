 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the behaviour of 556 pikas, from which 120 individuals were measured twice, was quantified. Univariate linear mixed models (LMM) were used to test for phenotypic differences among populations and to estimate the repeatability of two traits. All univariate LMMs analyses were conducted using the R package MCMCglmm [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. For each model, we included population, sex, season (breeding versus nonbreeding) and age (juvenile versus adult) as fixed effects in addition to the random effects of ID and test date. We uses an inverse-Gamma distribution as the prior for variance components, the set of parameters were nu = 1.002, and V = 2 [

We determined the effects of traits based on whether their 95% credible intervals (CIs) overlapped with zero. We estimated repeatability and their 95% CIs following the approach of Dingemanse et al. [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>], thus, we tested the phenotypic correlations in this study. Pearson’s correlation tests were used when the original variables fitted a normal distribution or when log or square root transformation resulted in normality (Shapiro–Wilk test). Otherwise, Spearman’s rank correlation test was used. All analyses were carried out using
