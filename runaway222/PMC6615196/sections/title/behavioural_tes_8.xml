 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted behavioural assays on recapture events on different days following the first capture when individuals were marked. After capturing, a field technician immediately transported the pikas to a processing location located ~ 30 m off the trapping grid. Animals were transported in mash bags, and ~ 1 min was needed to reach the processing location. At the processing location, the behaviour of the pika was immediately examined according to the following sequence:</p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(1) Bag test: The pika was transferred into a mesh bag (20 cm × 40 cm). We used the number of seconds the pika remained immobile during 1 min as an index of docility [

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(2) Open field test: Pikas were transferred from the mesh bag into an open field arena. The arena was a wood box (100 cm × 100 cm × 100 cm), painted white and with grid (10 cm × 10 cm) lines drawn on the floor. We recorded open field trails for 120 s using a digital video camera fixed on a tripod. The pikas were then removed from the arena, and their ID were recorded. Pikas were then released at their location of capture. After each trial, the arena was cleaned using 75% alcohol and air-dried prior to the subsequent trial. Using EthoVision XT 9.0 (Noldus Information Technology), we measured the distance covered by each pika (cm) as an index of activity [
