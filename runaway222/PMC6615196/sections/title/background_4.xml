 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species with wide ranges usually exhibit geographic variation in life history traits, such as growth and reproduction [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Geographic variation in life history traits is becoming an important avenue for research in ecology and evolutionary biology [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. Geographic variation in life history traits arises from intrinsic factors (i.e. genetic and/or genomic divergence amongst populations) or extrinsic factors (e.g. temperature, precipitation, food availability and predation) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. Selection operates in different directions and/or with differing strengths across the geographic range of species, resulting in distinct life history strategies contributing to local adaptation.
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Populations inhabiting altitudinal gradients experience distinct environmental conditions and show divergent traits in response to these conditions. With an increase in altitude, ambient temperature and growing season duration and biomass decrease, and plant phenology is delayed [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. Specific species with wide altitudinal ranges adopt altitude-specific life-history strategies, commonly showing slower life histories with increasing altitude [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. For example, dark-eyed Juncos (
  <span class="italic">Junco hyemalis</span>) bred at high elevations showed delayed development of structures necessary for reproduction, reduced duration of reproductive period and fewer broods than low-elevation conspecifics [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Moreover, amphibians and mammals at higher elevations exhibit shorter breeding seasons, longer larval periods and fewer litters per year with lower litter sizes compared with individuals at lower elevations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis posits that any trait (behavioural, physiological or morphological) that mediates trade-off between current and future fitness should coevolve with the life-history traits along the slow-fast life-history continuum [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. The narrow-sense version of the POLS hypothesis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>] predicts that a fast pace of life, which is characterized by a short lifespan, an early age of first reproduction and a fast growth rate, is associated with a more bold, active and aggressive personality type that explores the environment in a cursory manner [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Individuals inhabiting populations exposed to differing environmental conditions are assumed to show different pace-of-life types [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. For example, blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) living in habitats that are either resource rich or poor show divergence in their life histories, activity and docility following the predictions of the POLS hypothesis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. Ant (
  <span class="italic">Temnothorax longispinosus</span>) colonies from warmer areas are more exploratory and less aggressive than ants from colder areas [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. Although numerous studies have described altitude-associated variation in life histories [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>], no study has examined personality variation along an altitudinal gradient. A limited number of studies have also analysed personality divergence among populations living in different habitats [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we test the hypothesis that the mean level of personality change with altitude by comparing activity and docility of three plateau pika (
  <span class="italic">Ochotona curzoniae</span>) populations distributed along an altitudinal gradient [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Although the altitude difference between highest and lowest sites is about 700 m, annual and maximum monthly average temperature and vegetation conditions show distinct differences among sites (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Earlier research has shown that pika populations manifest slower life-histories at higher altitudes characterized by fewer litters per year with lower litter sizes and a shorter breeding season compared with populations at lower altitudes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. We predicted that high-altitude populations would be characterised by slower individuals, which are characterized by more thorough activity and lower docility, than high-altitude populations [
