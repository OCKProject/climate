  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plateau pika is a small, diurnal lagomorph that is widely distributed throughout the alpine meadows of the Tibetan Plateau. Populations can live between altitudes of 3,200 and 5,300 m [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. Pikas live communally forming territorial, mixed-sex groups that use a distinct burrow system with multiple entries [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Previous studies have shown population divergence in life history traits at different altitudes [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. For example, low-altitude populations (e.g. Guinan, 3,200 m) produce 3–5 litters per year with 4.5 ± 0.1 pups in each litter [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>], whereas those from high-altitude (e.g. Guoluo, 4,000 m) produce 1–2 litters per year with 3.2 ± 0.1 pups in each litter [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated three plateau pika populations at three different altitudes: Maqin (MQ), Zeku (ZK) and Guinan (GN), in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, Qinghai, China (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The distances between sites ranged from 180 km to 285 km, and the normal dispersal distance of plateau pika is about 40 m [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]; therefore, gene flow among the three populations is limited. At all sites, the climate is dry and cool, typical of a plateau continental climate [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. Precipitation occurs mostly from May to September, and heavy winter snowfalls are rare. Daily temperatures vary considerably (up to 25 °C). The climate is harsher at higher altitudes with decreasing annual temperatures, whereas annual precipitation increases. As a result, productivity and vegetation height decreases, and the growing season becomes shorter at higher altitudes (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vegetation at the three sites is typical of Tibetan alpine meadows. The dominant plant species include 
   <span class="italic">Kobresia humilis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Elymus nutans</span> Griseb. and 
   <span class="italic">Leontopodium alpinum</span>. To evaluate vegetation at each site, we quantified plant cover and height using the approach developed by Huenneke et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. At each site, 10 quadrats (50 cm × 50 cm) were randomly selected. We estimated plant biomass within each quadrat using non-destructive measurements of plant species cover and height and total vegetation cover by counting the portions of squares occupied by plants. Vegetation height was presented as the mean height of each species. With the increase in altitude, vegetation cover and height were significantly higher at GN than at GL and ZK (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At all sites, grass is grazed all year round by livestock (i.e. yak, sheep and horse). Other small herbivores, such as woolly hares (

   <span class="italic">Marmota himalayana</span>) and plateau zokors (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Animal marking</div>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study area at each site measured 1.0 ha (100 m × 100 m). The study period was divided into two stages: breeding (June) and nonbreeding season (August). We caught pikas using string nooses, which were anchored into the soil with chopsticks (i.e. a chopstick with a loop of string with a slipknot that tightens around the neck of the pika), set up at multiple entries to the burrow system. This method is widely used in live-trapping of both lizards and mammals and causes no significant negative effects on the behaviour of animals [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Over 2005 to 2018 of research at these sites, no pikas have been accidently injured nor killed by the string nooses [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Live traps were set at 07:00–09:00, constantly observed from 30 m away by a field technician, and retrieved at approximately 13:00. Trapped individuals were extracted from the nooses within approximately 30 s after capture. Pikas were weighed, and their sex and reproductive status (active or inactive) was examined by checking their reproductive organs. We then determined the approximate age of each individual based on their body mass, fur colour and toe hardness [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Individuals were divided into two age classes: adults (born during the previous year) and juveniles (born during the year of the study). Individuals were marked using hand-made aluminium ear tags stamped with a unique number code for permanent identification (ID). All individuals were released on the study grid where they were captured.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Behavioural tests</div>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted behavioural assays on recapture events on different days following the first capture when individuals were marked. After capturing, a field technician immediately transported the pikas to a processing location located ~ 30 m off the trapping grid. Animals were transported in mash bags, and ~ 1 min was needed to reach the processing location. At the processing location, the behaviour of the pika was immediately examined according to the following sequence:</p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(1) Bag test: The pika was transferred into a mesh bag (20 cm × 40 cm). We used the number of seconds the pika remained immobile during 1 min as an index of docility [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(2) Open field test: Pikas were transferred from the mesh bag into an open field arena. The arena was a wood box (100 cm × 100 cm × 100 cm), painted white and with grid (10 cm × 10 cm) lines drawn on the floor. We recorded open field trails for 120 s using a digital video camera fixed on a tripod. The pikas were then removed from the arena, and their ID were recorded. Pikas were then released at their location of capture. After each trial, the arena was cleaned using 75% alcohol and air-dried prior to the subsequent trial. Using EthoVision XT 9.0 (Noldus Information Technology), we measured the distance covered by each pika (cm) as an index of activity [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Individuals from MQ were tested in June (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 165) and August (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 205) 2013, individuals from GN were tested in June 2013 (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 17) and August 2014 (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 31), whereas those from ZK were tested in June (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 72) and August (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 66) 2014. The interval time between repeated tests range from 75 to 104 days in three populations.

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the behaviour of 556 pikas, from which 120 individuals were measured twice, was quantified. Univariate linear mixed models (LMM) were used to test for phenotypic differences among populations and to estimate the repeatability of two traits. All univariate LMMs analyses were conducted using the R package MCMCglmm [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. For each model, we included population, sex, season (breeding versus nonbreeding) and age (juvenile versus adult) as fixed effects in addition to the random effects of ID and test date. We uses an inverse-Gamma distribution as the prior for variance components, the set of parameters were nu = 1.002, and V = 2 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. Models were run for 6,500,000 iterations with a thinning interval of 5,000 and a burn-in of 1,500,000. We determined the effects of traits based on whether their 95% credible intervals (CIs) overlapped with zero. We estimated repeatability and their 95% CIs following the approach of Dingemanse et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. Studies have proven that within-individual correlations were negligible, and phenotypic correlations can represent among-individual correlations in plateau pika population [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>], thus, we tested the phenotypic correlations in this study. Pearson’s correlation tests were used when the original variables fitted a normal distribution or when log or square root transformation resulted in normality (Shapiro–Wilk test). Otherwise, Spearman’s rank correlation test was used. All analyses were carried out using
