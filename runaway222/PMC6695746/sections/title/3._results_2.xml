  <span class="italic">Description of the different series</span>—Between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016, 1739 emergency visits were recorded among 384 patients, of which 856 resulted in hospitalization, 811 in a hospital discharge, and 72 in another orientation. There were 2104 hospitalizations (with or without prior emergency visit) for VOC recorded over the study period. These hospitalizations involved 326 patients. The average length of the hospital stay was 4.4 days (+/−6.2).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The weekly series of weather parameters (precipitation, temperature, and humidity) highlighted the two seasons of the equatorial, humid climate of French Guiana. The dry season runs from July to December and is marked by low rainfall and low humidity for the region (sometimes approaching 50%) and high temperatures. The rainy season, from mid-December to June, is marked by heavy rainfall, high humidity and slightly lower temperatures. The rainy season is usually interrupted in March for 3 to 4 weeks by a brief return of the dry season. This phenomenon, locally known as the ‘short summer of March’, occurs when the intertropical convergence zone reaches its southern most position, where it parks for a few weeks before returning to the north.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The weekly series of influenza outbreaks clearly showed the occurrence of several infectious episodes during the period of interest. Data showed that except for the year 2008, influenza outbreaks occurred every year. The magnitude of the epidemics was highly variable across years. A major peak was observed in the year 2009. The years 2012 and 2014 also recorded important epidemics. The timing of the influenza outbreaks was also variable across years; although in most cases an intense activity is observed during the first months of the year, it was difficult to identify a clear seasonality.</p>

  <span class="italic">ARIMA modeling of VOC</span>—The weekly series of emergency visits for VOC (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02724-f001" href="#ijerph-16-02724-f001">Figure 1</a>) was modeled. There was an auto-correlation of residuals, which justified the use of an ARIMA model. Several models were tested. The retained model was an AR(2). The performances of the selected model were correct with parameters that were all significant below 5%. Residuals were uncorrelated and follow a normal distribution.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02724-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02724-f002">Figure 2</a>) were also modeled. Residuals were auto-correlated, thus an ARIMA model was used. After testing for different models, an AR(4) model was retained. The performances of the selected model were correct with parameters that were all significant below 5%. Residuals were uncorrelated and follow a normal distribution.

  <span class="italic">VOC and associated factors</span>—The correlations between each of the potential explanatory series and the VOC series were examined in bivariate analysis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Influenza (lag 0 and lag 1), cumulative rainfall (lag 1), maximum humidity (lag 0 and lag 1), minimum temperature (lag 1), maximum temperature (lag 0 and lag 1), and mean temperature (lag 0 and lag 1) were significantly associated with the series of emergency visits for VOC. The resulting bivariate models show uncorrelated residuals with a normal distribution. The explanatory series were thus included in the multivariate model of emergency visits for VOC. The bivariate analysis of the weekly series of hospitalizations for VOC identified flu (lag 1) and mean humidity (lag 0) as associated series, and were thusly selected for the multivariate model.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Final models</span>—The final multivariate model of emergency visits for VOC series (
  <a rid="ijerph-16-02724-t001" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02724-t001">Table 1</a>) included the autoregressive parameter (order 2), the mean temperature series (lag 0), and the maximum humidity series (lag 0) as explanatory series. In this model, the negative values of the estimators for the mean temperature series and for the maximum humidity series, indicated:

  <a rid="ijerph-16-02724-t002" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02724-t002">Table 2</a>) included the autoregressive parameters of order 1, 3 and 4 and the influenza series (lag 1). The value of the influenza variable estimator translates one new hospitalization case for VOC every 500 cases of influenza.
