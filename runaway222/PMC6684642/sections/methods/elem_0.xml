  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identify key existing studies relevant to the case-study location and then identify the background assumptions and methods for each study. Each study presents projections in different units of measurement, relative to different datums, start at different years, and do not always incorporate local rates of subsidence. For instance, Tebaldi 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
   </span> presents storm surge projections in meters above the mean high water datum, whereas Zervas
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
   </span> presents storm surge projections in meters above the mean higher high water datum. Following a detailed review of these studies, we modify the projections to the same baseline conditions for comparability. For comparability and consistency across all SLR projections, we modify the scenarios and projections relative to the local mean sea level, update the start year to 2000, present projections in feet, and incorporate local subsidence in all projections. For storm surge, projections are in feet above the local mean sea level for the current NTDE (1983–2001). The NTDE represents the period of time used to define the tidal datum (e.g., mean high water and local mean sea level)

   </span> only project the model to the year 2100 because the Greenland ice sheet, and glaciers and ice cap models do not account for what happens when the ice mass completely melts. In short, the models do not simulate the possibility of a net gain of ice. Hence, once the ice mass is at zero, there is no regrowth of ice. Running a simple diagnostic test, we test the reliability of our projections out to 2200 and find that only the ice mass from the glaciers completely melts in some high emissions scenarios with a lower initial ice mass (Supplementary Fig.

   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a> and Supplementary Fig.

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
   </span>. The observed water levels are relative to the MSL datum of the NTDE. The record we use is 88 years in length from 1928 to 2015. These observations contain the longer-term signal (SLR), which masks the effects of day-to-day weather, tides, and seasons. Following previous work (e.g.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2a</a>). To calculate the return period associated with the annual block maxima (Supplementary Fig.

   </span>, our model uses hourly tide gauge data from 1926 to 2016 and a Bayesian calibration approach to fit an ensemble of stationary GEV distributions for the storm surge projections at the Sewell’s Point tide gauge. To set up the GEV analysis, we first subtract the annual means from the tide gauge record followed by calculating the annual block maxima from the detrended record. Using the detrended record, we calculate a maximum likelihood estimate for the GEV distribution parameters using the extRemes R package

  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Accounting for the interactions between SLR and storm surge is a crucial step in the assessment of coastal flood vulnerability. Specifically, it is necessary to account for the uncertainties surrounding SLR (see, for example, the discussion in
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
   </span>). Similar to the approach in Ruckert 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
   </span>, we account for uncertainty in both SLR and storm surge by combining the distributions. Following this approach, we combine the Wong and Keller

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span>. Because the distributions differ in ensemble size, we draw an ensemble size of 10,000 simulations of storm surge (each simulation projecting out to the 1000-yr return period) from the full distribution to correspond to the SLR ensemble size. We then approximate the 100-yr storm surge following the steps outlined in Ruckert
