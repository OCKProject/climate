 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coastal communities rely on flood hazard projections to design risk management strategies. Studies evaluating future flood hazards often provide only a limited description of the deep uncertainties surrounding these projections and diverge in projections. Using Norfolk, VA, as an example, we show how the lack of information (i.e., extreme cases, non-stationarity, and ice sheet feedbacks) can lead to surprises. We highlight the importance of estimating the different components of SLR and accounting for AIS fast dynamics, especially when ice sheet contributions play a greater role in SLR at the end of this century and beyond

  </span>. Even though the considered studies that produce plausible scenarios provide a broad range of future conditions, they do not produce probability distributions. Without probabilistic distributions, we could not evaluate the combination of SLR and storm surge while accounting for interactions with uncertainties nor could we evaluate differences in the 500-yr return period between multiple studies. Although we evaluate flood hazard projections for Norfolk, our conclusions are transferable to many regions. Improving the representation of ice-sheet feedback processes, decision-relevant timescales, extreme events, non-stationarities, and known unknowns can improve risk assessments and decision-making.
