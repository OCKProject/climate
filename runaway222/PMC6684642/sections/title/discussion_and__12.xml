 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The choice of methods and assumptions used in a flood hazard study can impact the design of flood risk management strategies. These choices can limit the amount of information available to a vulnerable community interested in coastal preparedness planning. For instance, a community concerned about ice sheet feedback processes, individual components comprising SLR, long timescales, uncertainty, and the 500-yr storm surge event is limited in the considered sample of studies to the results in Kopp 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.

  </span> for storm surge projections (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). This lack of information reduces the range of choices in the decision-making process and hence could lead to poor outcomes. The potential consequences of having insufficient data are (1) cities are unprepared for extreme events (i.e., like the 1821 Norfolk-Long Island Hurricane and/or abrupt changes in ice-sheet dynamics; Figs 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>) or (2) cities over-invest in protection measures.

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyze and synthesize multiple future SLR scenarios and storm-surge characterizations generated from different approaches. Our findings help to understand and quantify the sources and effects of the deep uncertainty surrounding coastal flood hazard projections. Our results highlight some of the current limitations of coastal flood hazard characterizations when used to inform the design of strategies to manage flood risks. Coastal flood hazard projections diverge considerably across decision-relevant timescales based on the adopted methods and assumptions. Relying on a single flood hazard projection can hence be interpreted as making a deeply uncertain gamble. This deep uncertainty stems, for example, from the difficulties associated with calibrating the model parameters and the divergent expert assessments. The models need to resolve the complex responses of glaciers and ice sheets where understanding the physics is important, but often challenging. As a consequence, modeled results and expert elicitation results can be biased and/or overconfident. One approach to inform decisions in the face of these deep and dynamic uncertainties is to adopt decision-making approaches that allow for the adaptation of decisions over time to meet changing circumstances, respond to abrupt changes, promote continual learning, and revisit coastal flood hazard projections in the future when necessary knowledge about uncertain physics is, hopefully, better understood

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span>. One such approach is referred to as Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways. This approach searches for an adaptive plan that can deal with changing conditions and “supports the exploration of a variety of relevant uncertainties in a dynamic way, connects short-term targets and long-term goals, and identifies short-term actions while keeping options open for the future”
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span>. Consider, as an example, the flexible adaptation pathways approach taken by the city of New York in their climate action strategy, which allows the city plan to adapt over time

  </span>. Due to adopting this approach, the city was able to revisit plans and respond in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite our focus on coastal flood hazard assessment and coastal preparedness planning, we neglect the interaction between different hazard drivers beyond the interaction of uncertainties between SLR and storm surge. Specifically, we neglect to address the issue of compound flooding. Compound flooding refers to flooding caused by a combination of multiple drivers and/or hazards such as SLR, storm tides and waves, precipitation, or river discharge that lead to societal or environmental impacts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
  </span>. For example, in 2017, compound flooding occurred in Jacksonville, FL and the greater Houston area because of the combination of storm surge and high discharge of the St. John’s river during Hurricane Irma and the combination of extreme precipitation and long-lasting storm surge during Hurricane Harvey, respectively

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
  </span>. We chose to neglect compound flooding in our assessment to provide a transparent analysis on what causes SLR and storm surge projections to diverge and how this divergence impacts coastal planning. This implies that larger values and uncertainties cannot be excluded when considering other hazard drivers that interact with SLR. Due to the importance of this issue, it is necessary to consider and analyze compound flooding in coastal risk assessments, decision-making, and future research.
