   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. The design of such flood risk management strategies can hinge critically on flood hazard projections

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Decision makers face a potentially confusing array of flood hazard projections. These projections include scenarios without formal probabilistic statements (e.g.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>), single probability density functions (e.g.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>), and probabilistic scenarios (i.e., multiple probability density functions conditional on model assumptions) (e.g.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>). Furthermore, the projections differ in crucial assumptions, for example, about the potential non-stationarity of storm surges and/or about future potential abrupt changes in ice-sheet dynamics

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Here, we synthesize and analyze published flood hazard projections. We hope that this synthesis can help to improve the understanding of what drives the apparent diversity of coastal flood hazard projections and, in turn, can help to improve the design of flood risk management strategies.

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The synthesis and analysis of flood hazard projections is an area of active research with a rich body of excellent previous work. Relevant examples include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Further, decision makers assess community vulnerability, and design and implement flood risk management strategies on a local to regional scale. Hence, we focus on a case study for the Sewell’s Point tide gauge in Norfolk, Virginia, USA, to be relevant to local-scale preparedness planning and risk management. We choose the city of Norfolk as a case study because it is prone to impacts from sea-level rise (SLR), nuisance flooding from high tides, heavy rainfall, and as well as tropical and extra-tropical storms. Additionally, it is the location of an active U.S. Navy base (Naval Station Norfolk). Although we restrict this study to the city of Norfolk, we analyze differences in published flood hazard projections that can be localized to other coastal cities following our methodology. As a result, this study can provide useful insights to the broader community interested in local coastal protection.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We consider multiple future SLR scenarios and characterizations of storm surge generated from different approaches to represent a range of choices in the coastal assessment, planning, and decision-making process. We expand upon the current state-of-the-art by assessing the differences, the potential consequences of these differences, and addressing the results in a local coastal protection context. We compare eight studies of SLR

  </span>, and one storm surge analysis that is new to this work. We choose to compare these studies for three reasons: 1) they depict knowledge gained over a decade of research, 2) they integrate global SLR scenarios with regional factors, and 3) the values intend to support stakeholder groups and communities in regard to coastal preparedness planning and risk management. The overall goal of this work is to evaluate the current scientific knowledge to identify and highlight current limitations and community needs that can support real coastal preparedness planning and risk management processes.
