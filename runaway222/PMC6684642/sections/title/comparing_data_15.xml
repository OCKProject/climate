 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identify key existing studies relevant to the case-study location and then identify the background assumptions and methods for each study. Each study presents projections in different units of measurement, relative to different datums, start at different years, and do not always incorporate local rates of subsidence. For instance, Tebaldi

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> presents storm surge projections in meters above the mean higher high water datum. Following a detailed review of these studies, we modify the projections to the same baseline conditions for comparability. For comparability and consistency across all SLR projections, we modify the scenarios and projections relative to the local mean sea level, update the start year to 2000, present projections in feet, and incorporate local subsidence in all projections. For storm surge, projections are in feet above the local mean sea level for the current NTDE (1983â€“2001). The NTDE represents the period of time used to define the tidal datum (e.g., mean high water and local mean sea level)
