 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We characterize the differences in published SLR projections for the city of Norfolk, VA. The localized SLR projections become less certain and increasingly diverge as time goes on (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The divergence between projections becomes more apparent with those based on high emissions scenarios and those accounting for uncertainty (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c,f,i,l</a>). It is especially noticeable in the year 2100 when comparing projection modes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2l</a>). These differences can not only be traced back to the assumptions made, but they can also impact coastal preparedness planning.
