 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 21st century, local SLR projections differ depending on the assumptions with respect to ice sheet processes (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). Studies that incorporate ice sheet feedback processes project estimates of SLR that are greater than those that do not incorporate these processes. Compare, for example, the 95th percentile in 2100 of Wong and Keller

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span> no FD. Additionally, compare the 95th percentile in 2100 of Kopp 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span> to Kopp 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span> and also Sweet 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span> (2.5 m) to Sweet 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span> (2.0 m) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). In all three cases, the projections incorporating ice sheet feedback processes project higher SLR by the year 2100 with an increase of roughly 1.7 to 4.5 ft (comparing the 95th percentiles). Moreover, the divergence between studies with and without feedback processes grows over time with an increase in acceleration in the later half of the century. These projections indicate that ice sheets play a small role in the projected SLR contributions during the first half of the century and a larger role in the second half. This change occurs when anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (particularly high emissions scenarios) trigger ice-cliff and ice shelf feedback processes in the AIS. The results in DeConto and Pollard
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span> suggest that the role of ice sheets in SLR contributions will continue to grow in the centuries following 2100. Hence, it is important to account for individual components comprising SLR in addition to ice sheet feedback processes because components interact on different timescales.

    <p>Comparison of different assumptions between sea-level projections. Panel (a) compares 90% credible/confidence intervals of high scenario projections that differ with respect to ice sheet assumptions. Opaque polygons with a dashed border represent projections accounting for ice sheet feedbacks. The arrows highlight the divergence between projections from the same model that differ by ice sheet assumptions. Panel (b) compares the timescale of projections. The gray block symbolizes the potential design life of infrastructure built in 2020.</p>
