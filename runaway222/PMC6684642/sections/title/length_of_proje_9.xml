 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the evaluated studies, half focus on timescales of 110 years or less (excluding the fact that we extend the projections of Wong and Keller

  </span> to 2200) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). This lack of information can pose problems for the design of coastal adaptation strategies. For instance, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers typically designs projects to last for 20 to 100 years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Yet, infrastructure often extends past its original design life due to continued operation and maintenance

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Consider for example, a project designed in the year 2020 with a design life of 100 years. This project could extend well past the year 2120 and would require SLR information for at least 20 years past 2100 for decision making (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). Hence, providing information about SLR beyond 2100 has the potential to improve the robustness and resilience of infrastructure as well as long-term coastal adaptation strategies. However, it is important to be cautious about long-term projections if these projections are based on models with simplified ice dynamics.
