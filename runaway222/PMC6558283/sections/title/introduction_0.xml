 <p id="P2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reconstructing the history of atmospheric oxygen on Earth has been a longstanding, yet elusive, goal of the geosciences. Constraints from several observations now show that a major transition in atmospheric oxygen occurred in the past, the so called ‘Great Oxidation Event’ (GOE). The current paradigm places the GOE at 2.33 Ga (

  </a>), although recent evidence challenges this (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">Philippot 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>., 2018
  </a>). One of the most stringent constraints on the past abundance of atmospheric oxygen comes from the mass independent fractionation of sulphur isotopes (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">Farquhar 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>., 2000
  </a>), which limits pre-GOE atmospheric oxygen to &lt;10
  <span class="sup">-5</span> times present levels. However, all the geochemical, isotopic, and sedimentary proxies commonly used to reconstruct past atmospheric oxygen are incorporated into the geological record by processes occurring in the lower atmosphere.

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (2016)
  </a> identified that micrometeorites may sample the upper atmosphere, by reacting with the atmosphere during transient heating on entry. Sixty micrometeorites were recovered from the Pilbara region of Australia by 
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">Tomkins 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (2016)
  </a>, with their age estimated at 2.7 Ga. 
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">Tomkins 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2016)
  </a> examined the FeNi metal in the spherules, and determined that they were oxidised while molten, with much of the iron now contained in magnetite (Fe
  <sub>3</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub>) and wüstite (FeO). The authors argue that this level of oxidation requires modern earth levels of molecular oxygen in the upper atmosphere, 75–90 km above the surface of the Earth. This would be a remarkable result if verified, given the abundant evidence for anoxic conditions at Earth’s surface during this period. The authors explain this observation by appealing to a methane-rich atmosphere, in which an organic haze could have produced a temperature inversion within the mesopause (see 
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">Tomkins 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>., 2016
  </a> and citations therein).

 <p id="P4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We here suggest an alternative explanation: that low atmospheric pressure in the Archean led to higher concentrations of molecular oxygen in Earth’s upper atmosphere. Recent evidence from the measured radii of fossilised rain droplets, from the size of volcanic vesicles, and from nitrogen trapped in quartz, suggests that the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the Earth at 2.7 Ga was less than 0.5 bar (
  <span class="italic">e.g</span>., 
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">Som 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span> 2016
  </a>). We find that this low pressure can explain the oxidation of the micrometeoritic iron, with the Pilbara micrometeorites thus providing support for a low pressure atmosphere at 2.7 Ga.
