  <p>Two low pressure model atmospheres of the 3.5 Ga âˆ’ 2.7 Ga Earth. One model includes a surface mixing ratio of CO of 0.33 (dashed), and the other a surface mixing ratio of 10
   <span class="sup">-6</span> (solid). The surface pressure is 0.3 bar for both models. Mixing ratios are shown as a function of atmospheric height, 
   <span class="italic">h</span> (km; top two figures) and pressure (bar; bottom two figures).
