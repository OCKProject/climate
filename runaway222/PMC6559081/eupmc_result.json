    "Obesity rates are rising exponentially reaching global epidemic proportions and are associated with substantially increased morbidity and mortality. Less appreciated are the serious risks this poses on our environment from increased greenhouse gas emissions related to obesogenic behavior. In spite of a plethora of diets, the results are short term and nonsustainable, thereby leaving individuals battling with more weight than they lost. This is likely attributable to inherent flaws in the nature of weight loss diets or perhaps the approach of implementing them. These grim realities will be exposed to lead the way to uncover a novel \"behavior modification for weight loss\" strategy called Eat-ology. It exposes eating errors and imparts techniques to transform them into eating essentials, thereby enabling weight loss and its long-term maintenance. It is through such approaches that we can hope to win the fight against obesity and achieve not only a leaner global society but also a greener environment."
