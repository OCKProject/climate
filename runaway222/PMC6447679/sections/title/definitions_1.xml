 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before delving into the details of transitions from enzootic plague maintenance to epizootic eruptions, it seems essential to discuss and explicitly define the terms. If plague circulates within a host species at rates that vary along a continuum (
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>), binomial classification of those rates into epizootic and enzootic is artifactual. Nevertheless, at least two arguments support continued use of these terms. First, the terms and concepts have a long history and, at least at the both ends of the spectrum, convey a sense of real and observable phenomena. When one observes the nearly complete collapse of a PD colony in just a few weeks due to plague, the term epizootic seems intuitively apt. Second, and within the context of this paper, we might give more refined meaning to epizootic if we can associate it with runaway PFB.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Epizootic has been defined as “Pertaining to an epidemic in animals” and epidemic as “a disease affecting a high proportion of the population over a wide area” (
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>). There is no temporal component to this definition, and the vagueness of “high proportion” and “wide area” render such definitions inadequate for our purposes. Because the definitions might vary somewhat when considering different species and contexts, it is useful for authors to define these terms in each individual report. For example, Biggins et al. (
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>) described epizootics as resulting in the deaths of &gt;90% of a PD population and enzootic plague as affecting lesser proportions, but they did not provide temporal or spatial criteria. Ramakrishnan (
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>) used the 90% mortality cutoff but required the episode to occur within 3 months and over at least 10 ha of habitat. In both examples, “affecting” animals is narrowed to considering plague-caused deaths, which seems appropriate given the lethality of plague and the need for a metric that estimates demographic attributes of populations relevant to conservation. For this paper, we adopt the criteria of Ramakrishnan (
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>) to distinguish between epizootic and enzootic transmission, with further discussion below about the relationship to PFB cycles.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What if an outbreak takes several years to decimate the population of hosts (a phenomenon we have observed)? Under our definition of enzootic plague, populations can either decline or grow over long periods. What about deaths of just a few PDs that comprise a territorial harem polygynous family, or so-called “coterie” occupying a few hectares? At some point on the scale of individual organism to sub-population to population to range-wide distribution of a species we must pick a defining limit for clarity of communication. Clearly, death of an individual PD cannot define an epizootic, nor should we need extinction of a PD species to define it. Coining phrases like “mini-epizootic” or “small-scale epizootic” captures a sense of the mechanism working at small spatial scales but are semantically inarticulate oxymorons because epizootic and epidemic are defined as large scale phenomena.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The term enzootic may be used in a broad context that considers all forms of plague maintenance, not just the transmission of plague at sub-epizootic rates. It can include 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> residing in micro-organisms (
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>), soil (
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>), or fleas (
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>). Here, however, we limit our discussion to active enzootic plague transmission. If epizootic defines only one end of a broad spectrum, enzootic must encompass a truly large range of transmission rates and host mortality. The concept of plague maintenance by low rates of transmission dates back almost to the discovery of 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> by Yersin in 1894. Low (
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>) and Elton (
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>) used the term “smoldering” plague to describe what we might think of as the slow transmission end of the spectrum. That term has been more recently resurrected (
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>, 
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>), but it connotes a rather benign manifestation of the disease that does not seem to accurately depict the moderate rates of transmission and mortality that are common and can have substantial impacts on host populations (
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>, 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>, 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>, 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>).
