 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 22 June 2006, we conducted flea sampling in “active” burrows of a black-tailed PD (
  <span class="italic">Cynomys ludovicianus</span>) colony in Phillips County, Montana (Colony B-100) on which recreational shooting had occurred within the previous few days (judging from the condition of the PD carcasses found). Burrow activity was classified using the presence of fresh scat (
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">72</a>). Sampling consisted of inserting a plumber's snake tipped with a 15 × 15 cm flannel cloth into each active burrow opening as far as possible for about 30 s and removing the cloth for flea collection and counting (
  <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">66</a>). The flannel is a crude surrogate for a PD that is investigating the burrow. The insertion technique was done twice at each burrow with a delay between insertions to allow counting and removing fleas from the cloth. Total number of fleas was recorded for each burrow, along with the presence or absence of a dead PD within 1 m of the burrow opening. We graphically presented the data as prevalence (frequencies of burrows from which fleas were collected and not collected), but we used a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test on numbers of fleas collected from each burrow to evaluate the influence of presence or absence of a dead PD at or near the burrow.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zinc phosphide rodenticide was applied to a portion of a black-tailed PD colony (Cutbank) on the Buffalo Gap National Grassland in South Dakota as part of a “boundary control” effort on 12 December 2017. We sampled active burrows and recorded data as described above, except each burrow (of at least 0.5 m depth) was sampled three times (instead of twice). Sampling was conducted before (5 October) and after application of the rodenticide (13–14 December) on poisoned and non-poisoned portions of the colony. This before-after-control-impact design allowed assessment of treatment effect while controlling for the effect of time, a desirable feature when measuring flea abundance which can vary considerably from month to month (
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>, 
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>, 
  <a rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73">73</a>–
  <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">76</a>). We evaluated flea abundance using logistic regression models that had time (before or after) and treatment (poisoned or non-poisoned) as predictor variables. A significant (α = 0.05) treatment by time interaction would suggest a treatment-related disproportionate change in fleas over time. Because fleas were much more abundant on this South Dakota colony than on the Montana colony, we used a binomial response variable that considered 6 fleas as the cutoff point (≤6 fleas = 0, &gt; 6 fleas = 1) rather than simple presence or absence (prevalence, as used to graphically illustrate the Montana data).
