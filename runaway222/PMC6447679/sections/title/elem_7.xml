 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If our inserted flannel swabs were indeed reasonable surrogates for burrow investigations by PDs that explore newly unoccupied territories, they illustrate how flea loads could rapidly increase on PDs due to PFB triggering events (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). But do flannel swabs provide reasonable indices for flea-host encounters? Perhaps host deaths alter flea behaviors. “During and following an epizootic, fleas migrate to burrow entrances and can be captured in large numbers. When prairie dogs are alive and healthy, fleas tend to remain in the nest where they are not reachable” (
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>). Questions about detection probabilities (
  <a rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77">77</a>, 
  <a rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78">78</a>) within our simple field experiments raise additional uncertainties about measuring flea abundance in burrows. Nevertheless, increased collection of fleas after shooting and poisoning is consistent with the hypothesis that PFB cycles are sometimes triggered by episodic events causing high mortality in a host subpopulation. We might have underestimated the importance of this phenomenon in the poisoning experiment; subsequent observations suggest the zinc phosphide treatment was less effective than expected (causing about 75–80% mortality instead of &gt;90%), meaning the flocking of fleas (which was dramatic) may have been dampened.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ramifications of PFB Cycles for Plague Transmission</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intuitively, high host death rates will initiate an increase in flea densities beyond the threshold for epizootic plague (
   <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">65</a>). Rates of flea collection [e.g., (
   <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>, 
   <a rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77">77</a>)] and flea infection [e.g., (
   <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>, 
   <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>, 
   <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">79</a>)] are commonly higher from PD burrows after or during an epizootic than under non-epizootic. Some investigators emphasize the increase in flea abundance and infection as predictors or causes of epizootic plague [e.g., (
   <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>, 
   <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>, 
   <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">65</a>)] and others as responses to epizootics [e.g., (
   <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>, 
   <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">63</a>)]. Under the PFB hypothesis, burgeoning flea numbers and infections are both cause and consequence after a cycle begins (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to PD social structure and territoriality, flea-plague PFB cycles may occur in a patchy manner (i.e., multiple “explosions” of feedback at the coterie level and slower transmission of 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> between coteries). Group deaths within coteries seem likely because coterie members may share burrows as nesting environments (
   <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">51</a>) and probably share the same sub-population of fleas in their burrows (similar to great gerbils, 
   <span class="italic">Rhombomys opimus</span>, in Central Asia) (
   <a rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80">80</a>). After death of the primary coterie defenders, adjustment by members of adjacent coteries is likely (
   <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">51</a>) and exposure rates of neighbors would be enhanced (
   <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>). As epizootic activity increases and plague spreads among coteries, PFB cycles can become self-amplifying until nearly all hosts are parasitized by fleas and succumb to the disease.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our representation of change in flea:host ratio (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>) as hosts die may be oversimplified due to unequal susceptibility of individuals to flea parasitism and interactions among biotic and abiotic factors. For example, as the flea:host ratio increases during rapid plague transmission, the most susceptible individuals may take the initial brunt of the parasite shift and plague mortality. Adult male PDs could play an especially important role (
   <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>); they have much higher flea loads than adult females just after breeding season and often harbor the most fleas in summer and fall (
   <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>, 
   <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">81</a>, 
   <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">82</a>). Adult male PDs might be the primary initiators of the PRB cycle because of their higher flea loads and because they are the primary coterie defenders (
   <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">51</a>) and may be the first PDs to explore newly unoccupied territories and thus the first to accumulate newly questing, plague-positive fleas.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another potential PFB cycle that is intertwined with the flea-plague PFB is mediated by drought. It can be simplistically described as: poor forage (due to drought) leads to water balance and/or energetic limitations (
   <a rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83">83</a>) that lead to poor host body condition (
   <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">81</a>) that leads to increased flea loads (
   <a rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74">74</a>, 
   <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">81</a>, 
   <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">84</a>) that lead to even poorer host body condition (
   <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>), and so on. This cycle might promote increased circulation of plague due to higher flea loads and perhaps initiate a flea-plague PFB eruption (
   <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">85</a>). Under sub-optimal conditions for transmission, the developing epizootic may be self-limiting at the point where relatively flea-resistant individuals (e.g., PDs in good body condition) are remaining. Lending support to this hypothesis, Pauli et al. (
   <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>) found that PDs surviving an epizootic exhibited improved body condition compared to PDs before the epizootic. In many cases, however, a rapid change in flea:host ratio might overwhelm the entire population, resistant and susceptible alike.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recreational shooting of PDs might trigger PFB cycles by shifting fleas to the dwindling number of PDs and by affecting PD body condition. During a before-after-control-impact experiment involving shooting of PDs in Wyoming, surviving PDs on shot colonies increased vigilance 8-fold and reduced time spent foraging by 66% relative to PDs on control colonies protected from shooting (
   <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">86</a>), contributing to a 35% reduction in PD condition. Reductions in PD condition and hypothesized (
   <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">81</a>) increases in flea parasitism may trigger PFB. Moreover, the significant stresses of recreational shooting (
   <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">86</a>) may compromise the immune systems of some PDs, causing increases in flea parasitism (
   <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>) and mortality in PDs that fail to overwinter, thereby further concentrating fleas on PDs. Although recreational shooting could potentially trigger several types of deleterious PFB cycles, a short-term epizootic cycle (if it developed) would overpower other cycles.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interactions among a wide array of variables could influence the change in flea:host ratio of the proposed PFB cycles. Flea populations are influenced by many factors that are beyond the scope of detailed discussion here (
   <a rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74">74</a>, 
   <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">81</a>, 
   <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">84</a>, 
   <a rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87">87</a>–
   <a rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89">89</a>). Weather and climate at spatial and temporal scales from microsites to El Niño patterns are influential (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>) (
   <a rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90">90</a>–
   <a rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92">92</a>) and, as noted above, recent studies suggest precipitation lag effects and host body condition further increase the complexity. Recreational shooting, poisoning, and other sources of host mortality may interact with weather and season. For example, shooting or poisoning after optimal weather conditions for plague transmission may be more likely to trigger an epizootic than shooting or poisoning that follows moisture and temperature conditions that are less favorable for fleas or 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several factors might serve to counter the initiation of epizootic PFB cycles. First, the flea density threshold concept of Lorange et al. (
   <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">65</a>) is assumed to be critical, although the necessary levels of flea parasitism are unknown for wild, free-ranging hosts such as PDs. Second, intraspecific and interspecific competition among both fleas and hosts could provide negative feedback that impedes the initiation of the flea-plague PFB cycle (
   <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>, 
   <a rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" href="#B93">93</a>). These phenomena could become interactively complex in systems involving multiple hosts and multiple flea species, but in situations where a single host is primarily responsible for plague circulation, host territoriality could limit transmission to enzootic rates (
   <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>). Third, disease transmission rates in general are assumed to be at least somewhat dependent on host densities (
   <a rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94">94</a>). However, for PDs, it seems that flea densities are more important. An epizootic eruption of plague occurred in Utah PDs when densities (from adjusted visual counts) (
   <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">72</a>) were just 2.3 PDs ha
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (Biggins unpublished data). Flea parasitism was an important predictor of Utah PD annual survival during a 4-year study; epizootic plague was suspected in many cases, despite low PD densities (Eads and Biggins unpublished data). Thus, it is unsurprising that large rodent control campaigns have failed to eradicate plague in sylvatic systems and that tactic has been abandoned in Russia (
   <a rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95">95</a>). More localized control of peridomestic rodents, however, can reduce risk of plague exposure in humans (
   <a rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" href="#B96">96</a>). We emphasize highly plague-susceptible North American PDs in this treatise, but other species with proportions of populations that are immune to plague would be expected to exhibit much different population dynamics when challenged by plague.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In keeping with the idea that any significant cause of mortality might initiate a PFB cycle (increasing ectoparasite:host ratios), other vector-borne diseases (e.g., tularemia) should also be considered. Triggers might result in secondary interactions between diseases, transforming diseases that might characteristically have a moderate effect (which probably include some diseases native to North America, like tularemia) into triggers for the flea-plague PFB cycle. Conversely, we might consider that plague, operating within its own PFB cycle, might exacerbate the effect of native disease by altering the parasite:host ratio.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PFB Cycles, Balancing Negative Feedback, and Source-Sink Dynamics</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are examples of PFB that build and sustain ecological systems (
   <a rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97">97</a>, 
   <a rid="B98" ref-type="bibr" href="#B98">98</a>). Nevertheless, “Positive feedback mechanisms are usually associated with instability in a system” (
   <a rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" href="#B99">99</a>) and are often considered to be destabilizing and deleterious. Examples are the self-reinforcing nitrogen dynamics of invasive cheat grass (
   <span class="italic">Bromus tectorum</span>) in the western U.S (
   <a rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" href="#B100">100</a>), the human-triggered algal and microbial feedback loops that threaten coral reefs (
   <a rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" href="#B101">101</a>), and even the postulated runaway greenhouse involved in the massive Permian extinction (
   <a rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" href="#B102">102</a>). PFB can be facilitative or disruptive (
   <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>), depending in part on the status of a process over time, and on the scale of assessment. Taken alone, a PFB seems to be ultimately destructive, but working in concert with negative feedback and other complex interactions, it can contribute to overall stability (
   <a rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" href="#B103">103</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not all PFB cycles are destructive in PDs. One of the more interesting aspects of these tradeoff phenomena in PDs is the balancing of negative feedback and PFB cycles prior to invasion of plague. Over much longer time spans than those for the flea-plague PFB of epizootics, PFB has been discussed in PDs in the context of Allee effect (a positive correlation between population density and average individual fitness) resulting from increased effectiveness of predator warning communications and higher individual survival rates at higher population densities (
   <a rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" href="#B104">104</a>). PDs clip grasses and forbs seasonally to maintain unrestricted vision, and repeated clipping of shrubs results in declining shrub densities over periods of years to decades; increased PD densities facilitate this PFB loop (
   <a rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" href="#B105">105</a>). In addition to the increased survival rates accompanying this PFB, PDs might have higher birth rates at higher population densities (
   <a rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" href="#B106">106</a>). Historically, the slow process of PFB in shrub reduction and increasingly efficient anti-predator behaviors with PD population growth may have gradually come into balance with the negative feedback of coterie territoriality and limiting resources. However, the plague-flea PFB cycle is explosive, and runaway flea-plague PFB will curb other processes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plague epizootics may occur in multispecies communities of hosts because 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> is a generalist parasite. It might be a mistake to single out a particular host species as the driver of these phenomena, although outbreaks are characteristic in various species of ground squirrels (including PDs). Even within the 
   <span class="italic">Cynomys</span> genus, manifestations of plague epizootics appear to vary among species. White-tailed PDs (
   <span class="italic">C. leucurus</span>) and other species within the 
   <span class="italic">Leucocrossuromys</span> subgenus may no longer reach peak densities in preferred habitat (grass-dominated sites with few shrubs) because epizootics repeatedly decimate populations that reach reasonable densities (
   <a rid="B107" ref-type="bibr" href="#B107">107</a>). From a source-sink perspective, the source has become the poor, shrub-dominated, habitats that maintain enzootic plague, which may have been considered the sinks for these PDs historically. An indirect effect of this phenomenon is failure of white-tailed PDs to create optimum habitat by clipping shrubs and killing them. This is not a true source-sink reversal. A source (prime PD grassland patch) can become a sink because of plague, but the sink (in this case shrubby habitat) was probably not a true sink in the sense of PD mortality exceeding natality. Nevertheless, this reversal in the overall flow of dispersing animals again illustrates the potential for 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> to be a “transformer species” in the western U.S. (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Epizootics of Plague as an Adaptation of 
   <span class="italic">Yersinia pestis</span>?
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Epizootics have been identified as a manifestation that “amplifies” 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> [e.g., (
   <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>, 
   <a rid="B108" ref-type="bibr" href="#B108">108</a>)]. The term amplification might imply that epizootics are adaptive, for example by facilitating population growth and expansion of 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span>. Instead, these epizootic events might be considered as anomalies, triggered by factors that favor PFB cycles. The ecological results of PFB cycles are sometimes destabilizing and can be devastating (
   <a rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109">109</a>). The explosiveness of PFB epizootics might be a cost of the evolved life history of 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> rather than an adaptation; it seems maladaptive for an organism to destroy and sometimes eliminate essential habitat (herein, hosts and fleas).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perhaps plague epizootic events played little role in the evolution of 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span>, fleas, and mammalian hosts in Asia where 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> originated (
   <a rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110">110</a>) and these coevolutionary processes had their origins. Plague cycles in Asia are often measured as the prevalence of detected infections in hosts. In populations of great gerbils, plague prevalence is reportedly “always low” (
   <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>). In North America, host mortality is pervasive at enzootic and epizootic levels [e.g., (

   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>,

   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> may be subject to accidental juxtaposition of conditions favorable to a non-adaptive outcome for all players. Nevertheless, runaway PFB-driven outbreaks might have resulted in evolutionary consequences for 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span>. For example, periodically destroying its own habitat might have favored mechanisms for 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> survival under hostile conditions, such as ability to colonize protozoa or survive in soil, fleas, or elsewhere (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plague, PFB Cycles, Conservation, and One Health</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we emphasize the transition of plague activity from enzootic to epizootic explosions due to PFB. Our intent herein has been to focus primarily on the PFB loops that likely occur during an epizootic outbreak of plague, and to propose that those expanding cycles are a central element of epizootics as we narrowly define them (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). For an epizootic with PFB to occur, there must be adequate (although sometimes relatively low) densities of PDs distributed sufficiently uniformly to allow the rapid expansion of PFB to occur. There also needs to be adequate densities of fleas at the starting point.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The change in flea:host ratios during epizootics have been recognized and repeatedly mentioned for more than 50 years, and the recognition of plague as an enzootic phenomenon (smoldering), as well as exploding into epizootics, is also historic. We suggest these phenomena, coupled with the relatively inefficient transmission of 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> by fleas, as pivotal to understanding both the evolution of 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> and the ecological manifestations of plague. In PDs at least, the breakdown of territories during epizootics likely contributes substantially as a second reinforcing PFB loop. Our synthesis is a recasting of earlier discussions and observations into a theme that emphasizes sustained transmission and mortality caused by enzootic plague as a common starting point for epizootics, and centering on PFB as the amplifying centerpiece. PFB loops might be initiated by triggers; we speculated on anthropogenic triggers for the plague-flea epizootic loop and provided some supporting evidence.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This reevaluation seemed useful because the history surrounding plague has tended to dampen such thinking. Plague initially received most attention as a series of human epidemics, and public health investigators later recognized epizootic outbreaks of sylvatic plague as elevating the risk to human health (
   <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>). The focus on epizootics and epidemics motivated conversations (at least) about how such cycles could be adaptive and diverted attention from thinking about the more common conditions under which natural selection likely molded the life history attributes of 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If epizootics are not a necessary component of plague maintenance, and 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> evolved a lifestyle that requires high vector loads and high levels of bacteremia to persist (
   <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">65</a>), we might expect host mortalities to be chronically high even without epizootics, especially in ecosystems where plague is not native. Mammalian species that can persist with sustained high population losses (e.g., PDs) may serve as reservoirs for 
   <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span>, but plague spillover into associated bystander species, even during enzootic periods, might result in their extirpation or extinction (e.g., as exemplified by black-footed ferrets). There may be mammal communities where epizootics, as we define them, are rare or absent (e.g., due to consistently low flea parasitism or intense territoriality). Lack of noticeable epizootic outbreaks should not be equated with lack of ecological impact of plague.
