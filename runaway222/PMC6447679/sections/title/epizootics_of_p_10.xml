  <span class="italic">Yersinia pestis</span>?
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Epizootics have been identified as a manifestation that “amplifies” 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> [e.g., (
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>, 
  <a rid="B108" ref-type="bibr" href="#B108">108</a>)]. The term amplification might imply that epizootics are adaptive, for example by facilitating population growth and expansion of 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span>. Instead, these epizootic events might be considered as anomalies, triggered by factors that favor PFB cycles. The ecological results of PFB cycles are sometimes destabilizing and can be devastating (
  <a rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109">109</a>). The explosiveness of PFB epizootics might be a cost of the evolved life history of 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> rather than an adaptation; it seems maladaptive for an organism to destroy and sometimes eliminate essential habitat (herein, hosts and fleas).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perhaps plague epizootic events played little role in the evolution of 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span>, fleas, and mammalian hosts in Asia where 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> originated (
  <a rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110">110</a>) and these coevolutionary processes had their origins. Plague cycles in Asia are often measured as the prevalence of detected infections in hosts. In populations of great gerbils, plague prevalence is reportedly “always low” (
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>). In North America, host mortality is pervasive at enzootic and epizootic levels [e.g., (
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>, 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>, 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>)]. As an invader in North America, 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> may be subject to accidental juxtaposition of conditions favorable to a non-adaptive outcome for all players. Nevertheless, runaway PFB-driven outbreaks might have resulted in evolutionary consequences for 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span>. For example, periodically destroying its own habitat might have favored mechanisms for 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> survival under hostile conditions, such as ability to colonize protozoa or survive in soil, fleas, or elsewhere (
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>, 
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>, 
  <a rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" href="#B111">111</a>).
