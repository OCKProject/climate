 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fleas are a vital component of the PFB cycles discussed herein. An increase in flea parasitism accompanying epizootic plague was observed at least a half century ago when Shchekunova et al. (
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>) noted “The dying out of the original inhabitants of burrows was accompanied by a migration of fleas onto surviving rodents and onto new settlers. As a result the index of the abundance of fleas on 
  <span class="italic">O. mongolica</span> here in the beginning of summer amounted to 3.2 and in the autumn—to 8.5…” Pauli et al. (
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>) uses the term “swarming” of fleas onto hosts during epizootics. Tripp et al. (
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>) suggests “Concentration of infected fleas on surviving animals may account for the rapid spread of plague during epizootics.” Salkeld et al. (
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>) mentions that “transmission rates snowball” due to “increased abundance of fleas searching for meals” [see also (
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">45</a>)]. These descriptions seem to infer PFB cycles. The graphics and notes on feedbacks from Ray and Collinge (
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">46</a>), the graphic of Reijniers et al. (
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>), and the discussion on “vicious circles” of disease transmission by Beldomenico and Begon (
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>) articulate parts of the PFB cycles we emphasize herein.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Disruptive effects of plague on PD social systems may fortify the flocking of infectious fleas to PD hosts. The presence of kin within PD coteries encourages PDs to remain in coterie territories, affording them fitness benefits such as cooperative predator detection and allogrooming to remove ectoparasites (
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">49</a>). As plague transmission increases and kin disappear, PDs likely inspect vacated burrows (e.g., to entomb dead PDs) and risk acquiring infectious fleas (
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">50</a>). Moreover, as PD coteries become vacated, opportunities for cooperation are diminished or eliminated, and PDs can move among former territories (
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">49</a>, 
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">51</a>), allowing them to acquire and ferry infectious fleas (
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These two mutually reinforcing PFB loops were encapsulated in a general description by Gage (
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">52</a>):
 </p>
 <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>“The rate of plague transmission by fleas also could be influenced by increased contact rates between infectious vectors and susceptible host individuals, with increased contact resulting in a concomitant increase in secondary infections as the disease spreads from an initial focal infection… Transmission rates also have been suggested to increase during epizootics as a result of infectious fleas becoming more and more concentrated on the decreasing number of surviving hosts…”</p>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We summarize these PFB cycles during an epizootic in PDs (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>) as juxtaposed loops of increasing flea:host ratios (Cycle A) joining increasing host and flea contact due to altered PD social systems and behaviors (Cycle B). The interaction is critical; the 2 loops must be considered together. A triggering event might initiate the primary PFB loop involving altered flea:host ratios. In the short term, the population of plague bacteria rapidly increases, the host population declines, vector numbers remain high, and infections increase. This is soon followed by initiation of the secondary PFB loop as sufficient deaths within coteries cause territorial vacancies that enhance unimpeded PD movements. At that point, both feedback loops operate together to synergistically magnify the overall PFB cycle. As the two connected loops repeat themselves, and remaining PDs become more mobile, the hazard rate rapidly escalates for each remaining PD. Both loops feed into ever higher transmission rates and ultimately into plague-caused deaths that both loops have in common (hence heavier arrows for the central parts of both loops). Triggers are exemplified (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). A dramatic trigger may initiate an epizootic under less than optimal conditions, or the PFB cycle might spontaneously ignite without any trigger when host and flea densities are high and 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> is enzootically abundant in the focal host or associated species.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weather and habitat conditions doubtless influence hosts, fleas, and 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> (
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">53</a>, 
  <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">54</a>), which we simplistically represent with a single input block (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). Changes in temperature can influence flea reproduction and survival (
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>), replication rates of 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> (
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">56</a>), and proventricular blockage in fleas (
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">57</a>), thereby influencing transmission rates. Although trophic responses of hosts to weather are likely over longer terms (
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">46</a>), we consider only short-term changes; host populations respond more slowly than populations of fleas or 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span>. Barnes (
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>) captured the oversimplification risks of such conceptual models by saying “In this complex and shifting milieu, it is often difficult to determine if fleas or rodents are most important because their roles may change with time, space, and circumstance.” Regardless, an external trigger causing substantial mortality of a subpopulation of hosts, or otherwise optimal conditions for transmission, might initiate an explosive PFB-mediated plague epizootic.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The illustration of the two PFB cycles is representative of early to mid-stages. At some point, there are few PD movements because most PDs are dead, fleas perish from starvation (
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>), and populations of live 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> likely diminish as host carcasses deteriorate or are consumed by scavengers (
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>, 
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">59</a>). Little is known about demographics and plague-caused mortality of PD fleas (
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">60</a>, 
  <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">61</a>). However, the primary fleas that seem to be central to 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> transmission in PDs (
  <span class="italic">Oropsylla hirsuta and O. tuberculata cynomuris</span>) are able to transmit 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> before blocking occurs (EPT) (
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>, 
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>), are perhaps highly capable of blocked flea transmission (Hinnebusch, personal communication), and might clear some infections but become infected once again when feeding on an infectious host, the latter of which helps to perpetuate plague transmission until the density of hosts is insufficient to support fleas (
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>, 
  <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">62</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combined PFB loops (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>) are described in a temporal context but also have an implied spatial component. As with a metaphoric forest fire PFB cycle, this PFB of fleas and 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> cannot erupt for long in one place without running out of PD fuel. It must keep moving. However, unlike fire which moves primarily with the wind, it can move equally well in all directions. In fact, maximizing the area affected per unit of time would involve a feedback cycle that gets triggered in the middle of suitable space, where the movement can be envisioned as expanding circles of impact. This dynamic of 
  <span class="italic">Y. pestis</span> over time and space may reflect how it maintains itself in an enzootic state (
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potentially destructive nature of PFB is commonly illustrated by reference to nuclear weapons. The self-accelerating chain reaction of an atomic bomb releases enormous energy, but the system needs a trigger of conventional explosives (which themselves involve PFB) for activation. Similarly, but at a smaller scale, the bullet from a rifle is propelled down the bore by the self-amplifying explosion of gunpowder, also ignited by a chain of triggering actions. The first of these actions is the shooter physically pulling the rifle's trigger that slams its firing pin into a small, pressure sensitive primer; these actions are analogous to any sudden and localized reduction of PD hosts that increases the flea:host ratio. The primer explodes, triggering the larger PFB explosion in the gunpowder within the cartridge casing and unleashing the destructive power of a speeding bullet, which is analogous to the destructive power of an expanding PFB-powered plague epizootic. Ironically, the rifle and shooter exemplified above could serve as a trigger in our PFB example involving PDs, fleas, and plague.</p>
