 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Montana, we collected 5 fleas from 8 sampled burrows associated with shot PDs and we collected 8 fleas from 25 burrows without a carcass. Average penetration of the sampling apparatus was 2.70 m (range 1â€“4.5 m). We found 2 additional burrows that contained dead PDs that were visible below the surface. Those 2 burrows were not sampled but suggest there may have been dead PDs present deeper within burrows that were categorized as lacking a PD carcass. Burrow openings accompanied by a dead PD had significantly more fleas than openings without visible carcasses (Mann-Whiney 
  <span class="italic">U</span> = 52.500, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.013) and had higher flea prevalence (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2</a>). Of the 8 burrows with a carcass, 1 had 2 fleas and 1 had 3 fleas; no more than a single flea was collected from any burrow without a carcass.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before application of zinc phosphide on the South Dakota colony, no dead PDs were found in the non-poisoned or poisoned areas. In contrast, after application, no dead PDs were found in the non-poisoned area but 3 dead PDs and 1 dead PD were found in the poisoned area on 13 and 14 December, respectively. We collected 474 and 390 fleas from 50 swabbed burrows in the non-poisoned and poisoned areas, respectively, before the poisoning event, and we collected 363 and 852 fleas from 50 burrows in non-poisoned and poisoned areas, respectively, after the event. In the logistic regression model, the interaction of time and treatment was significant (Likelihood Ratio

  <span class="sup">2</span> = 4.486, 
  <span class="italic">df</span> = 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.034). There was little difference in proportions of burrows with &gt;6 fleas between the poisoned and non-poisoned portions of the colony pre-treatment, but there were nearly twice as many burrows with &gt;6 fleas on the poisoned portion than on the non-poisoned portion following application of the rodenticide (
