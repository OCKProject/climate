 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 1,937 shorebirds were fitted with a transmitter between 2014 and 2016 (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a> for details); 647 during the pre-breeding and 1,290 during the post-breeding season. Of these, we were able to calculate the total migration speed of 516 individuals and airspeed for 389 individuals that were detected at least twice &gt; 50 km apart within the same season. Among the remainder, 88 (&lt; 5%) individuals were not detected anywhere in the network indicating the tags may have malfunctioned, fallen off, or otherwise escaped detection; 804 were only ever detected at a single receiver station, usually near the tagging location; 362 individuals were detected at multiple towers but &lt; 50 km apart, which we considered local movements and did not include in further analyses; and 255 individuals were detected at greater distances in different seasons, but only at one station within each season, thus preventing use in analyses.
