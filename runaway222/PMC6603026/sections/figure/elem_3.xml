  <p>Timing of migration for the four species combined, as determined from individual departure dates from Delaware Bay (pre-breeding) and the southern James Bay region (post-breeding), separated by year. The white dots represent the relative frequency of individuals departing the sites and the lines and shaded areas represent estimated model means and 95% confidence intervals. The timing is highly synchronized during the pre-breeding season, but not during post-breeding.</p>
