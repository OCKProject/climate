  <p>Model estimates of (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) total migration speed per day, (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) minimum stopover duration and (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) airspeed of four species of Arctic-breeding shorebirds during pre- and post-breeding migration. Estimates are derived from linear mixed models (see text) and the box-and-whisker plots give median (horizontal line within box), interquartile range (box), range (bars) and the transparent dots show estimates for individual birds.
