  <p>Mean relative frequency of avian predators at three sites in North America (see text for details) and airspeeds of 4 shorebird species separated by age class, throughout the protracted post-breeding migration period. The airspeeds are higher prior to the wave of predators. The solid line represents the regression (linear model or GAM; see text) and the grey area indicates the 95% confidence intervals of the regression.</p>
