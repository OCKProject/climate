 <div class="caption">
  <p>Circular distributions of migratory flight bearings (in degrees) for the four shorebird species and three years combined, for pre- and post-breeding migrations. Each line shows the direction of tracked individuals and the length refers to the number of movements in a given direction (scale 0–15). Each line is a measurement of a migration segment, which may represent only a part of the detected migratory route and therefore includes some non-independent measurements across individuals. The inset shows (α) the mean track direction, (
   <span class="italic">r</span>) vector length, (sd) angular deviation and (
   <span class="italic">n</span>) sample size per season. The statistical significance refers to a Rayleigh test (***
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001).
