 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As predicted, migration speed (km day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) prior to the breeding season was more rapid than after the breeding season for all four species considered (GLMM, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). The final model for migration speed included season (
  <span class="italic">X</span>² = 17.4, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) and species (
  <span class="italic">X</span>² = 75.2, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), along with random effects of year and capture site. Northbound transit was almost twice as fast across species versus the southbound transit (116 km day
  <span class="sup">−1</span> during the pre-breeding season versus 62 km day
  <span class="sup">−1</span> post breeding). In accordance with predictions, based on our final model which included season, all species stopped for longer periods during post-breeding migration (GLMM, 
  <span class="italic">X</span>² = 73.0, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). The mean minimum stopover duration (i.e., sum of all stopover duration per season), for pre-breeding migrants was 14.7 ± 0.4 d (SE) across species, whereas for post-breeding individuals the mean stopover duration was 32.6 ± 1.3 d (SE).

    <p>Model estimates of (

     <span class="bold">c</span>) airspeed of four species of Arctic-breeding shorebirds during pre- and post-breeding migration. Estimates are derived from linear mixed models (see text) and the box-and-whisker plots give median (horizontal line within box), interquartile range (box), range (bars) and the transparent dots show estimates for individual birds.

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to these patterns, the airspeeds were ~10% higher during the post-breeding season for all species (GLMM, 
  <span class="italic">X</span>² = 6.1, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.01; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>), suggesting that birds had higher levels of energy expenditure during the southbound migration flights. These higher post-breeding airspeeds correspond to ~10% increase in instantaneous flight cost (W kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), based on power curve calculations (see Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a> for details).
