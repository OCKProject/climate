 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Every year, billions of animals migrate in search of improved foraging conditions, safety from predators, and enhanced reproductive opportunities
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Although seasonal migration is widespread among animals, it is especially well studied in birds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. During birds’ pre-breeding migration (i.e., the boreal spring for temperate and Neotropical migrants), it is generally assumed that individuals are more time constrained in reaching their goals than during post-breeding (boreal autumn) migration. This is because of: (i) competition among individuals where the timing of arrival provides advantages in acquiring the best breeding territories
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>, (ii) the importance of matching temporally narrow peaks in food abundance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, and/or (iii) for Arctic breeding birds, the need to breed early to maximize re-nesting opportunities given the compressed breeding season
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of these different time constraints, theory predicts that migratory birds should adopt a time-minimization strategy in the pre-breeding season
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Birds employing this strategy should devote as much energy as possible to fuel deposition and consequently avoid other time and energy consuming activities such as moult on their stopover site, leading to a faster migration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. During the post-breeding season however, when time constraints are less, migrants should shift towards an energy-minimizing strategy, i.e., to reduce their energy expenditure as much as possible
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>, and to recover their energy reserves after an energetically demanding breeding season. Birds following this strategy are predicted to stop more 
  <span class="italic">en route</span> to refuel
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span> and because they are less time constrained
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, they may be more inclined to wait for favorable migration conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many empirical studies have supported elements of these general predictions relating to pre-breeding versus post-breeding migration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. However, not all studies have detected seasonal differences in migration speed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>, and several studies have found patterns opposite to the above predictions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. These reverse patterns suggest that there may be some advantage for a slower migration in the pre-breeding season, such as to minimise energy expenditure prior to breeding, or it could result from atypical environmental conditions such as cold temperatures or high ice cover at breeding areas that slow down this pre-breeding migration. These environmental conditions are potentially unpredictable in space and time, possibly confounding general patterns. For example, the optimal speed to achieve time- or energy minimization depends on the rate of energy acquisition at current and future stopover sites, and the rate of migratory progress depends on the head- or tailwinds encountered
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Environmental variables can therefore have a strong influence on the rate of migratory progress
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>, and because these environmental factors can be difficult or impossible to predict
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>, birds’ migration strategies must also incorporate elements of risk avoidance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to these weather related risks, another important risk that could influence migration behaviour is the risk of predation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. High departure fuel loads and changes in organ size required by time-minimizing shorebirds impair take-off performance and manoeuverability, compromising their ability to escape from predators
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. Migratory shorebirds forage in dense flocks, and because of their dependence on intertidal mudflats to forage, they congregate in large numbers on only a few sites along their migratory route to refuel for migration north and south
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>, thereby attracting a variety of avian predators
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Raptors, especially peregrine falcon 
  <span class="italic">Falco peregrinus</span>, merlin 
  <span class="italic">Falco columbarius</span> and Cooper’s hawk 
  <span class="italic">Accipiter cooperii</span> are key predators of migrant shorebirds in the Atlantic flyway of North America
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. During the pre-breeding season, these raptor species migrate north over a protracted period and initiate migration before most shorebirds, as they travel to their breeding grounds in the vast tundra and boreal regions of North America; breeding areas which are at lower latitudes than for arctic-breeding shorebirds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. In contrast, after the breeding season, these raptors migrate during a narrower time window and concentrate in space and time as they head south, due to the inverted triangular shape of the continent
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. Therefore, migratory shorebirds face a greater risk from migratory raptors during the post-breeding season versus the pre-breeding season
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Most migrant shorebirds begin their southbound migration ahead of the wave of migrating raptors; thus, a slow post-breeding migration for shorebirds could increase the overlap with these avian predators
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Identifying seasonal differences in migratory decisions and performance is crucial for understanding the ecological and evolutionary constraints that shape migratory behaviour
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. To identify seasonal differences in the speed of migration, most studies have used overall migration speed (km day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) as the behavioral metric
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>; a metric which describes the northward or southward progress including stopover time 
  <span class="italic">en route</span>, and given the environmental conditions experienced. However, seasonal differences in these environmental conditions, specifically head- or tailwinds, can profoundly impact migration speed even without any change in birds’ behaviour; therefore, it is essential to incorporate other behavioural and environmental (wind) metrics in assessments of birds’ migration behaviour. For example airspeed, a bird’s flight speed relative to the surrounding air, might better indicate whether birds are more time constrained in the pre-breeding season versus the post-breeding season. Airspeed more directly reflects the birds’ flight behaviour and the energy costs incurred by that behaviour, after accounting for any seasonal differences in wind that could influence total migration duration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we test the hypothesis that on the North American continent, Arctic-breeding shorebirds (extreme long-distance migrants) display relatively more time-minimizing migration behaviour pre-breeding, and energy-minimizing behaviour post-breeding. Since there is evidence for age-specific differences in migration speed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>, we also explore potential age differences. We predict that migration speed and the airspeed of shorebirds is faster during the pre-breeding season compared to the post-breeding season. Because the rate of energy expenditure during migratory flights is higher than the refuelling rate, most of the migration period is spent at stopover sites
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>, suggesting that stopover duration is the main driver of migration speed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. Pre-breeding migrants are therefore expected to stop less often and for shorter periods 
  <span class="italic">en route</span>, and move more rapidly towards their breeding grounds. After the breeding season, because energy minimizers are inclined to wait for favorable migration conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, we predict that birds will be more wind selective, less goal oriented, and have a longer migration period. However, this protracted migration could expose birds to a “wave” of migrant predators
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. Therefore, we also explore the evidence for predation-minimizing behaviours
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. More specifically, we evaluate shorebird migration speed in relation to the timing and abundance of avian predators at key raptor migration sites. To evaluate these predictions, we used automated VHF telemetry on a continental scale
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span> and followed the seasonal migration of Arctic-breeding red knots 
  <span class="italic">Calidris canutus rufa</span>, sanderlings 
  <span class="italic">C. alba</span>, semipalmated sandpipers 
  <span class="italic">C. pusilla</span> and ruddy turnstones 
  <span class="italic">Arenaria interpres</span> over multiple years. The fine temporal resolution of these automated telemetry data allow us to explore the migration speed, airspeed and timing of departure in a way that was not previously possible on this temporal and geographic scale. The results provide new insights into the factors underlying migratory strategies for these extreme long-distance migrants.
