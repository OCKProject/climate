 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We processed the data as previously described
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>
  </span>. In summary, all tag, station, project, and user metadata are submitted by users, archived in the database, and linked and managed through the Motus research platform
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. The tag detection data collected at receiving stations are joined with the master tag and station metadata to produce a complete database of unique detections from each station. The radio signals captured by the receivers are cross-referenced against the tag recordings submitted to Motus during tag registration. Due to local interference and the high gain on the receivers, spurious signals (i.e., false positives) were recorded. From the raw detection data, detections that are outside of the deployment period for a specific tag were removed. We removed detection data where the standard deviation in signal strength was &gt; 0.1 and the run length &lt; 2 (number of continuous detections of a unique code by a receiver). Detections in this filtered database (containing tag-id, tower location, GPS time stamp, antenna number, and signal strength), were considered valid if there were three detections from a tag at multiples of the tag’s burst rate (±4 ms, with the allowed error in the burst rate increasing by 1.5 ms for each missed burst and allowing for up to 20 consecutive missed bursts). Although this filtering procedure might remove some valid detections, it ensured that the resulting data set contained only valid detections of the tagged birds.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Departure time (UTC) from each site was determined as the last of at least three consecutive detections prior to no further detections at a site. Arrival times (UTC) were determined as the first detection in a series of at least three consecutive detections at a receiver station within a different site.</p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ground speed (m s
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) was calculated as the orthodrome distance (m) between two different receiver stations, divided by the total time (s) between departure and arrival. As the objective was to determine migration speed, we excluded local movements (&lt; 50 km). The mean distance between all detections was 550 km and therefore the bias from the uncertainty of an individuals’ actual position (e.g., a 20 km detection distance), is likely not a large factor influencing the speed calculations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated the minimum stopover duration for each individual as the sum of all time differences (s) between the last and first detection per receiver station, including the time an individual remained at the capture site after capture. A stopover event was defined as a minimum duration of 30 min, and shorter durations were considered migratory movements

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Migration speed (km day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) was calculated as the sum of the orthodrome distance (km) between all receiver stations per season at which an individual was detected, divided by the total time an individual was detected, including the minimal stopover time.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When an individual had been detected between two receiving stations, we calculated the bearing in degrees using the package fossil
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>
  </span> in the program R
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>
  </span>. We only used the bearings describing departures from one key site per season; Delaware Bay for pre-breeding migration (39°4′N and 74°6′W) and the southern James Bay region for the post-breeding migration (51°4′N, 80°4′W). A majority of birds were detected at these sites, and they are of known importance for these species

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. Analysing bearings in this way minimizes the potential bias arising from site-dependent departure directions, and the fact that northbound migrants in spring are heading towards higher latitudes where there are fewer towers (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Based on these bearings, we calculated the mean vector length 
  <span class="italic">r</span> (which can vary from 0 to 1) as a measure of directional concentration, and the Watson 
  <span class="italic">U</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>-test was used to test whether the age classes differed from each other.
