  </span>, and selected three important raptor post-breeding migration count sites in North America; Hawk Cliff Hawkwatch site in Ontario, Canada (42°39′N, 81°10′W), Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania, USA (40°38′N, 75°59′W) and Cape May Point, New Jersey, USA (38°55′N, 74°57′W; see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Experienced volunteers enter counts of migrating raptors on a daily basis. We obtained daily observations from 2014–2016, for the period between early July and late December. Peregrine falcon, merlin and Cooper’s hawk were selected as relevant predators for the four shorebird species considered here. We corrected the counts for the daily observation duration, generating a daily mean predator rate (number hr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). Next, we used mean values of the three years and calculated the relative frequency per day.
