 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most individuals showed a high degree of wind selectivity in both seasons. Wind support on the observed departure date was higher than the wind support on the preceeding 10 days (GLM, 
  <span class="italic">X</span>² = 100.6, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001; see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a> for details). The relative wind support at the time of departure was greater for the post-breeding versus pre-breeding migration (GLM, 
  <span class="italic">X</span>² = 445.0, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001); birds experienced more supportive tailwinds during the post-breeding season. However this greater wind support does not account for the differences in birds’ airspeeds between seasons, as airspeed accounts for head- or tailwinds (i.e., represents the flight speed in still air). A wider range of flight directions were utilized post-breeding (as indicated by a lower vector length (
  <span class="italic">r</span>); Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), suggesting a less clear orientation towards a destination, which is consistent with an energy minimizing strategy. No difference in orientation between the age classes was observed (

    <p>Circular distributions of migratory flight bearings (in degrees) for the four shorebird species and three years combined, for pre- and post-breeding migrations. Each line shows the direction of tracked individuals and the length refers to the number of movements in a given direction (scale 0–15). Each line is a measurement of a migration segment, which may represent only a part of the detected migratory route and therefore includes some non-independent measurements across individuals. The inset shows (α) the mean track direction, (
