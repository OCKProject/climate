 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our result of a faster migratory progress prior to breeding is consistent with the basic predictions of optimal migration. The difference in migration speed between both seasons appeared to reflect differences in stopover duration. Our results indicate that the airspeed of shorebirds during the pre-breeding season is not at its upper limit, as the estimated pre-breeding airspeeds were below those post-breeding, and also below the theoretical maximum-range speed (

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). This is surprising given the wide acceptance that birds respond to the time constraints imposed by the breeding season by minimizing the duration of the pre-breeding migration. Our findings suggest that other considerations such as body condition upon departure
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span> or upon arrival at the breeding sites
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>, may influence a bird’s migratory decisions during the pre-breeding season to a greater degree than previously believed.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An increase in airspeed comes at a cost of increased flight power, which necessitates increased fueling. The optimal airspeed for maximizing total migration speed (or equivalently, minimizing the total time of migration) is 5–15% higher than the optimal airspeed for minimizing energy costs per unit distance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>, leading to an increase in total migration speed of only 0.2–2%
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. Therefore, increasing airspeed to increase the speed of migration might be disadvantageous during the pre-breeding season, when body condition offers other benefits upon arrival to the breeding grounds. Conversely, post-breeding and juvenile birds during the post-breeding season face a different suite of temporal and energetic constraints, and importantly, are faced with increased predation pressure due to potential co-occurrence with migrating raptors.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shorebirds are primarily income breeders (i.e., they acquire all the necessary resources on the breeding grounds)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>; however, body condition upon arrival to the breeding grounds can nevertheless play an important role in the survival and reproduction of Arctic-breeding shorebirds. Several studies have demonstrated that individuals arriving to the breeding grounds with greater body stores are able to withstand harsh early-season weather
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>, and high body condition during the pre-breeding period has been linked to higher quality eggs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span>. Red knots with greater energetic reserves during spring migration remained in the Arctic longer and were more likely to be detected after the breeding season, suggestive of successful breeding and greater survival, respectively
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. Maximizing airspeeds during the pre-breeding season could impose a significant cost of reduced body stores upon arrival but yield only a modest benefit in terms of reducing the total duration of the migration.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surprisingly, we found only minor age-related differences in migratory behaviour, such as timing of migration for red knots, sanderling and semipalmated sandpiper (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,d,e</a>; we did not have juvenile ruddy turnstone in the data). Our post-breeding migration data were collected at Arctic, subarctic and north-temperate latitudes close to the breeding sites (in some cases, departing from the breeding sites). Age-related differences in migration behaviour might occur later in the post-breeding season, farther south. Although some shorebirds are known to migrate in groups of variable age classes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>, others show more distinct waves of adults and juveniles
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. Nevertheless, inexperienced juveniles may benefit from social information for navigation and stopover site use during their first post-breeding migration.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predation risk is a factor affecting birds’ migratory behavior in a profound way
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. Although direct mortality from predation can be significant, non-lethal effects can illicit variable behavioural responses in a wide range of taxa
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>, including in shorebirds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. Among shorebirds, responses to increased predation danger include behavioural changes such as variable stopover duration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>, habitat use
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>, body mass changes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span> and even morphological changes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. Here we showed that post-breeding birds that migrated in advance of the “predator front”, had higher airspeeds. Later in the season, after the peak of predation risk had passed, airspeeds were lower and similar to those observed during pre-breeding. This observation is consistent with the mortality-minimizing hypothesis, which predicts that when the predation front is approaching, individuals should increase the fuel-loading rate to increase migration speed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wind is another factor with a crucial influence on the speed of migration; headwinds or tailwinds directly reduce or increase the speed of migration for a given bird’s airspeed. However, wind can also alter the decisions made by migrants. An individual that is maximising the migration speed should increase its airspeed in headwinds and decrease its airspeed with tailwinds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span>. As we have shown, the different shorebird species are highly wind selective and predominantly initiate migration on days with supportive tailwinds. However, our results show that birds migrate with higher tailwinds in the post-breeding season (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>), suggesting that they should lower their airspeed to maximise flight range. Therefore, the higher airspeeds in the post-breeding season are not the result of migrating into headwinds.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the post-breeding season, birds also exhibited a high flexibility in their departure direction to capture these tailwinds, as shown by the wider range of post-breeding departure bearings. Together, these results of high airspeed, longer stopover durations and flexible departure directions suggest the possibility that post-breeding migration is influenced by the constraints of predation risk, despite the fact that post-breeding migration speed is lower compared to the pre-breeding season. Increased predation risk post-breeding could potentially reduce fueling rates due to increased vigilance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span>, which could in turn lead to a lower departure mass from a stopover site. This low departure mass coupled with the high airspeed observed in this study could increase the required stopover duration(s) further south in the migration. Alternatively, the urge to depart from sites where predators were encountered is greater than the drive to fly in a specific direction. Competition, deteriorating weather
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span> and declining food availability might also drive shorebirds to move out of the area
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span> and temporarily speed up their pace, forcing them to stop more and/or longer subsequently 
  <span class="italic">en route</span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For most Arctic-breeding shorebirds, the post-breeding season also brings on moult; species show a great variability in timing of moult as they may moult prior to, during, or after southward migration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. Missing feathers will cause a reduction of wing area and/or wing span, and flight costs are altered during active moult. However, few species undertake active moult during migration (e.g., dunlin 
  <span class="italic">Calidris alpina</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span>), and the energetic effects of moult on flight performance are generally small
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
  </span>. Although variation in moult across the species and individuals studied here could increase the observed variation in airspeed, it cannot explain faster airspeeds in the post-breeding season.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our finding of a higher airspeed for migratory shorebirds during post-breeding has not previously been documented, likely in part because of the difficulties of measuring flight speeds for small-bodied migrant birds. Until recently, tracking technologies for small-bodied migrant birds have not offered both large-spatial coverage for tracking long-distance migrations and fine temporal resolution for understanding these subtle changes in behaviour. However, our automated telemetry array does not cover the full length of the flyway. Birds in our dataset might alter their behaviour after they leave our study areas. Possibly, northbound individuals initiate a final sprint to their breeding sites and counterbalance the mean differences in airspeed between both seasons over the entire trajectory
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span>. Likewise, potential differences in migratory behaviour such as protandry (males arriving to breeding areas before females), which is common in many bird species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
  </span>, cannot be excluded, as unfortunately, we did not have sufficient data concerning the sexes of the species involved. Although we tracked some individuals to the southern edge of the breeding grounds, most species migrated further north, where these intersexual differences may have been more pronounced. Nevertheless automated telemetry results such as these, with fine temporal resolution, offer fertile ground for explorations of the predictions of optimal migration theory. Location-specific counts of predators, and location-specific assessments of departure behaviour, might allow for a further refinement of the understanding of the role of predators in shaping the migration behaviour of long-distance migrant birds.
