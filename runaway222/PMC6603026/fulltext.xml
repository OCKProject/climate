Although breeding-related time constraints may be absent post-breeding, additional factors such as predation risk could lead to time constraints that were previously underestimated. By using an automated radio telemetry system, we compared pre- and post-breeding movements of long-distance migrant shorebirds on a continent-wide scale. From 2014 to 2016, we deployed radio transmitters on 1,937 individuals of 4 shorebird species at 13 sites distributed across North America. Following theoretical predictions, all species migrated faster during the pre-breeding season, compared to the post-breeding season. These differences in migration speed between seasons were attributable primarily to longer stopover durations in the post-breeding season. In contrast, and counter to our expectations, all species had higher airspeeds during the post-breeding season, even after accounting for seasonal differences in wind. Arriving at the breeding grounds in good body condition is beneficial for survival and reproductive success and this energetic constraint might explain why airspeeds are not maximised in the pre-breeding season. We show that the higher airspeeds in the post-breeding season precede a wave of avian predators, which could suggest that migrant shorebirds show predation-minimizing behaviour during the post-breeding season. Our results reaffirm the important role of time constraints during northward migration and suggest that both energy and predation-risk constrain migratory behaviour during the post-breeding season.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Macroecology</kwd><kwd>Macroecology</kwd><kwd>Animal migration</kwd><kwd>Animal migration</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004489</institution-id><institution>Mitacs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IT04216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duijns</surname><given-names>Sjoerd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Mitacs Accelerate Graduate Research Internship Program</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Every year, billions of animals migrate in search of improved foraging conditions, safety from predators, and enhanced reproductive opportunities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Although seasonal migration is widespread among animals, it is especially well studied in birds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. During birds&#x02019; pre-breeding migration (i.e., the boreal spring for temperate and Neotropical migrants), it is generally assumed that individuals are more time constrained in reaching their goals than during post-breeding (boreal autumn) migration. This is because of: (i) competition among individuals where the timing of arrival provides advantages in acquiring the best breeding territories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, (ii) the importance of matching temporally narrow peaks in food abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and/or (iii) for Arctic breeding birds, the need to breed early to maximize re-nesting opportunities given the compressed breeding season<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Because of these different time constraints, theory predicts that migratory birds should adopt a time-minimization strategy in the pre-breeding season<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Birds employing this strategy should devote as much energy as possible to fuel deposition and consequently avoid other time and energy consuming activities such as moult on their stopover site, leading to a faster migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. During the post-breeding season however, when time constraints are less, migrants should shift towards an energy-minimizing strategy, i.e., to reduce their energy expenditure as much as possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and to recover their energy reserves after an energetically demanding breeding season. Birds following this strategy are predicted to stop more <italic>en route</italic> to refuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and because they are less time constrained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, they may be more inclined to wait for favorable migration conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Many empirical studies have supported elements of these general predictions relating to pre-breeding versus post-breeding migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, not all studies have detected seasonal differences in migration speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and several studies have found patterns opposite to the above predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These reverse patterns suggest that there may be some advantage for a slower migration in the pre-breeding season, such as to minimise energy expenditure prior to breeding, or it could result from atypical environmental conditions such as cold temperatures or high ice cover at breeding areas that slow down this pre-breeding migration. These environmental conditions are potentially unpredictable in space and time, possibly confounding general patterns. For example, the optimal speed to achieve time- or energy minimization depends on the rate of energy acquisition at current and future stopover sites, and the rate of migratory progress depends on the head- or tailwinds encountered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Environmental variables can therefore have a strong influence on the rate of migratory progress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and because these environmental factors can be difficult or impossible to predict<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, birds&#x02019; migration strategies must also incorporate elements of risk avoidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In addition to these weather related risks, another important risk that could influence migration behaviour is the risk of predation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. High departure fuel loads and changes in organ size required by time-minimizing shorebirds impair take-off performance and manoeuverability, compromising their ability to escape from predators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Migratory shorebirds forage in dense flocks, and because of their dependence on intertidal mudflats to forage, they congregate in large numbers on only a few sites along their migratory route to refuel for migration north and south<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, thereby attracting a variety of avian predators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Raptors, especially peregrine falcon <italic>Falco peregrinus</italic>, merlin <italic>Falco columbarius</italic> and Cooper&#x02019;s hawk <italic>Accipiter cooperii</italic> are key predators of migrant shorebirds in the Atlantic flyway of North America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. During the pre-breeding season, these raptor species migrate north over a protracted period and initiate migration before most shorebirds, as they travel to their breeding grounds in the vast tundra and boreal regions of North America; breeding areas which are at lower latitudes than for arctic-breeding shorebirds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In contrast, after the breeding season, these raptors migrate during a narrower time window and concentrate in space and time as they head south, due to the inverted triangular shape of the continent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Therefore, migratory shorebirds face a greater risk from migratory raptors during the post-breeding season versus the pre-breeding season<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Most migrant shorebirds begin their southbound migration ahead of the wave of migrating raptors; thus, a slow post-breeding migration for shorebirds could increase the overlap with these avian predators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Identifying seasonal differences in migratory decisions and performance is crucial for understanding the ecological and evolutionary constraints that shape migratory behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. To identify seasonal differences in the speed of migration, most studies have used overall migration speed (km day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) as the behavioral metric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>; a metric which describes the northward or southward progress including stopover time <italic>en route</italic>, and given the environmental conditions experienced. However, seasonal differences in these environmental conditions, specifically head- or tailwinds, can profoundly impact migration speed even without any change in birds&#x02019; behaviour; therefore, it is essential to incorporate other behavioural and environmental (wind) metrics in assessments of birds&#x02019; migration behaviour. For example airspeed, a bird&#x02019;s flight speed relative to the surrounding air, might better indicate whether birds are more time constrained in the pre-breeding season versus the post-breeding season. Airspeed more directly reflects the birds&#x02019; flight behaviour and the energy costs incurred by that behaviour, after accounting for any seasonal differences in wind that could influence total migration duration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Here, we test the hypothesis that on the North American continent, Arctic-breeding shorebirds (extreme long-distance migrants) display relatively more time-minimizing migration behaviour pre-breeding, and energy-minimizing behaviour post-breeding. Since there is evidence for age-specific differences in migration speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, we also explore potential age differences. We predict that migration speed and the airspeed of shorebirds is faster during the pre-breeding season compared to the post-breeding season. Because the rate of energy expenditure during migratory flights is higher than the refuelling rate, most of the migration period is spent at stopover sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, suggesting that stopover duration is the main driver of migration speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Pre-breeding migrants are therefore expected to stop less often and for shorter periods <italic>en route</italic>, and move more rapidly towards their breeding grounds. After the breeding season, because energy minimizers are inclined to wait for favorable migration conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, we predict that birds will be more wind selective, less goal oriented, and have a longer migration period. However, this protracted migration could expose birds to a &#x0201c;wave&#x0201d; of migrant predators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Therefore, we also explore the evidence for predation-minimizing behaviours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. More specifically, we evaluate shorebird migration speed in relation to the timing and abundance of avian predators at key raptor migration sites. To evaluate these predictions, we used automated VHF telemetry on a continental scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and followed the seasonal migration of Arctic-breeding red knots <italic>Calidris canutus rufa</italic>, sanderlings <italic>C. alba</italic>, semipalmated sandpipers <italic>C. pusilla</italic> and ruddy turnstones <italic>Arenaria interpres</italic> over multiple years. The fine temporal resolution of these automated telemetry data allow us to explore the migration speed, airspeed and timing of departure in a way that was not previously possible on this temporal and geographic scale. The results provide new insights into the factors underlying migratory strategies for these extreme long-distance migrants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par9">A total of 1,937 shorebirds were fitted with a transmitter between 2014 and 2016 (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for details); 647 during the pre-breeding and 1,290 during the post-breeding season.

The difference in migration speed between both seasons appeared to reflect differences in stopover duration. Our results indicate that the airspeed of shorebirds during the pre-breeding season is not at its upper limit, as the estimated pre-breeding airspeeds were below those post-breeding, and also below the theoretical maximum-range speed (<italic>V</italic><sub>mr</sub>; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). This is surprising given the wide acceptance that birds respond to the time constraints imposed by the breeding season by minimizing the duration of the pre-breeding migration. Our findings suggest that other considerations such as body condition upon departure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> or upon arrival at the breeding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, may influence a bird&#x02019;s migratory decisions during the pre-breeding season to a greater degree than previously believed.</p><p id="Par16">An increase in airspeed comes at a cost of increased flight power, which necessitates increased fueling. The optimal airspeed for maximizing total migration speed (or equivalently, minimizing the total time of migration) is 5&#x02013;15% higher than the optimal airspeed for minimizing energy costs per unit distance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, leading to an increase in total migration speed of only 0.2&#x02013;2%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Therefore, increasing airspeed to increase the speed of migration might be disadvantageous during the pre-breeding season, when body condition offers other benefits upon arrival to the breeding grounds. Conversely, post-breeding and juvenile birds during the post-breeding season face a different suite of temporal and energetic constraints, and importantly, are faced with increased predation pressure due to potential co-occurrence with migrating raptors.</p><p id="Par17">Shorebirds are primarily income breeders (i.e., they acquire all the necessary resources on the breeding grounds)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>; however, body condition upon arrival to the breeding grounds can nevertheless play an important role in the survival and reproduction of Arctic-breeding shorebirds. Several studies have demonstrated that individuals arriving to the breeding grounds with greater body stores are able to withstand harsh early-season weather<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, and high body condition during the pre-breeding period has been linked to higher quality eggs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Red knots with greater energetic reserves during spring migration remained in the Arctic longer and were more likely to be detected after the breeding season, suggestive of successful breeding and greater survival, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Maximizing airspeeds during the pre-breeding season could impose a significant cost of reduced body stores upon arrival but yield only a modest benefit in terms of reducing the total duration of the migration.</p><p id="Par18">Surprisingly, we found only minor age-related differences in migratory behaviour, such as timing of migration for red knots, sanderling and semipalmated sandpiper (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b,d,e</xref>; we did not have juvenile ruddy turnstone in the data). Our post-breeding migration data were collected at Arctic, subarctic and north-temperate latitudes close to the breeding sites (in some cases, departing from the breeding sites). Age-related differences in migration behaviour might occur later in the post-breeding season, farther south. Although some shorebirds are known to migrate in groups of variable age classes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, others show more distinct waves of adults and juveniles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, inexperienced juveniles may benefit from social information for navigation and stopover site use during their first post-breeding migration.</p><p id="Par19">Predation risk is a factor affecting birds&#x02019; migratory behavior in a profound way<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Although direct mortality from predation can be significant, non-lethal effects can illicit variable behavioural responses in a wide range of taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, including in shorebirds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Among shorebirds, responses to increased predation danger include behavioural changes such as variable stopover duration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, habitat use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, body mass changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> and even morphological changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Here we showed that post-breeding birds that migrated in advance of the &#x0201c;predator front&#x0201d;, had higher airspeeds. Later in the season, after the peak of predation risk had passed, airspeeds were lower and similar to those observed during pre-breeding. This observation is consistent with the mortality-minimizing hypothesis, which predicts that when the predation front is approaching, individuals should increase the fuel-loading rate to increase migration speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">Wind is another factor with a crucial influence on the speed of migration; headwinds or tailwinds directly reduce or increase the speed of migration for a given bird&#x02019;s airspeed. However, wind can also alter the decisions made by migrants. An individual that is maximising the migration speed should increase its airspeed in headwinds and decrease its airspeed with tailwinds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. As we have shown, the different shorebird species are highly wind selective and predominantly initiate migration on days with supportive tailwinds. However, our results show that birds migrate with higher tailwinds in the post-breeding season (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), suggesting that they should lower their airspeed to maximise flight range. Therefore, the higher airspeeds in the post-breeding season are not the result of migrating into headwinds.</p><p id="Par21">During the post-breeding season, birds also exhibited a high flexibility in their departure direction to capture these tailwinds, as shown by the wider range of post-breeding departure bearings. Together, these results of high airspeed, longer stopover durations and flexible departure directions suggest the possibility that post-breeding migration is influenced by the constraints of predation risk, despite the fact that post-breeding migration speed is lower compared to the pre-breeding season. Increased predation risk post-breeding could potentially reduce fueling rates due to increased vigilance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, which could in turn lead to a lower departure mass from a stopover site. This low departure mass coupled with the high airspeed observed in this study could increase the required stopover duration(s) further south in the migration. Alternatively, the urge to depart from sites where predators were encountered is greater than the drive to fly in a specific direction. Competition, deteriorating weather<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> and declining food availability might also drive shorebirds to move out of the area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> and temporarily speed up their pace, forcing them to stop more and/or longer subsequently <italic>en route</italic>.</p><p id="Par22">For most Arctic-breeding shorebirds, the post-breeding season also brings on moult; species show a great variability in timing of moult as they may moult prior to, during, or after southward migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Missing feathers will cause a reduction of wing area and/or wing span, and flight costs are altered during active moult. However, few species undertake active moult during migration (e.g., dunlin <italic>Calidris alpina</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>), and the energetic effects of moult on flight performance are generally small<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. Although variation in moult across the species and individuals studied here could increase the observed variation in airspeed, it cannot explain faster airspeeds in the post-breeding season.</p><p id="Par23">Our finding of a higher airspeed for migratory shorebirds during post-breeding has not previously been documented, likely in part because of the difficulties of measuring flight speeds for small-bodied migrant birds. Until recently, tracking technologies for small-bodied migrant birds have not offered both large-spatial coverage for tracking long-distance migrations and fine temporal resolution for understanding these subtle changes in behaviour. However, our automated telemetry array does not cover the full length of the flyway. Birds in our dataset might alter their behaviour after they leave our study areas. Possibly, northbound individuals initiate a final sprint to their breeding sites and counterbalance the mean differences in airspeed between both seasons over the entire trajectory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Likewise, potential differences in migratory behaviour such as protandry (males arriving to breeding areas before females), which is common in many bird species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>, cannot be excluded, as unfortunately, we did not have sufficient data concerning the sexes of the species involved. Although we tracked some individuals to the southern edge of the breeding grounds, most species migrated further north, where these intersexual differences may have been more pronounced. Nevertheless automated telemetry results such as these, with fine temporal resolution, offer fertile ground for explorations of the predictions of optimal migration theory. Location-specific counts of predators, and location-specific assessments of departure behaviour, might allow for a further refinement of the understanding of the role of predators in shaping the migration behaviour of long-distance migrant birds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par24">As part of several ongoing studies of shorebirds in North America, red knots, sanderlings, semipalmated sandpipers and ruddy turnstones were captured between 2014 and 2016 and measured using standard protocols at 13 locations distributed widely across the Atlantic flyway from Texas, United States, to Nunavut, Canada (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for details).

We only used the bearings describing departures from one key site per season; Delaware Bay for pre-breeding migration (39&#x000b0;4&#x02032;N and 74&#x000b0;6&#x02032;W) and the southern James Bay region for the post-breeding migration (51&#x000b0;4&#x02032;N, 80&#x000b0;4&#x02032;W). A majority of birds were detected at these sites, and they are of known importance for these species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Analysing bearings in this way minimizes the potential bias arising from site-dependent departure directions, and the fact that northbound migrants in spring are heading towards higher latitudes where there are fewer towers (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Based on these bearings, we calculated the mean vector length <italic>r</italic> (which can vary from 0 to 1) as a measure of directional concentration, and the Watson <italic>U</italic><sup>2</sup>-test was used to test whether the age classes differed from each other.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Wind data</title><p id="Par32">We used the wind data of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The flow-assistance experienced by each individual was calculated using the R-Package RNCEP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Since we recorded when and where an individual is present and the destination (i.e., different receiver station) is known, we used the latitudes and longitudes of the receiver stations as the start- and end-point for each trajectory, with the corresponding departure times. Using this information, we downloaded the &#x02013;u (west-east) and &#x02013;v (south-north) wind components, which were combined in a single wind vector incorporating the strength and the direction of the wind, from which we obtained a tailwind component. The calculations were based on wind components for the following pressure levels: &#x02018;surface level&#x02019;, 925, 850 and 700 hPa, corresponding to between 0 and 3000&#x02009;m altitude. The RNCEP tailwind model was set to calculate the heading and tailwind component at the most optimal pressure level upon departure, and this pressure level was reassessed every 3&#x02009;hr, and the heading and tailwind component recalculated by the model. In this way, we obtained an estimate of the wind assistance experienced by birds every 3&#x02009;hr, assuming that they travelled at the most profitable pressure level.</p><p id="Par33">Airspeed (m s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was calculated by subtraction of the wind vector (wind assistance) from the track vector (ground speed, see above) to estimate individual airspeed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. Some track segments (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;3% of total sample) had airspeeds &#x0003e;&#x000a0;25&#x02009;m&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which were the result of occasional false detections of tags (e.g., near simultaneous apparent detections of a bird at towers hundreds of kilometers apart). These false detection patterns were identified by examining plots of detections for each bird by latitude and time and longitude and time, and values associated with unrealistic movement patterns were removed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. Airspeeds below a threshold of &#x0003c;&#x000a0;5&#x02009;m&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were considered as possible undetected stopovers or detours through areas with no tower coverage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>, and were excluded from airspeed analyses. Our power curve calculations (see below) indicate that the power required to fly below these speeds increases exponentially making these speeds unlikely. In order to identify the costs associated with airspeeds, we calculated the power curves for the four species using the program Flight 1.24, which is available (free) from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://books.elsevier.com/companions/9780123742995">http://books.elsevier.com/companions/9780123742995</ext-link> (see Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> for details).</p><p id="Par34">In order to evaluate the hypothesis that long-distance migratory shorebirds would be more wind selective in the post-breeding season, we calculated wind support for each individual at the actual departure time and location, and calculated the wind support for the same departure time for the period up to 10 days earlier.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Predator density data</title><p id="Par35">We accessed the citizen science data of the Hawk Migration Association of North America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>, and selected three important raptor post-breeding migration count sites in North America; Hawk Cliff Hawkwatch site in Ontario, Canada (42&#x000b0;39&#x02032;N, 81&#x000b0;10&#x02032;W), Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania, USA (40&#x000b0;38&#x02032;N, 75&#x000b0;59&#x02032;W) and Cape May Point, New Jersey, USA (38&#x000b0;55&#x02032;N, 74&#x000b0;57&#x02032;W; see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Experienced volunteers enter counts of migrating raptors on a daily basis. We obtained daily observations from 2014&#x02013;2016, for the period between early July and late December. Peregrine falcon, merlin and Cooper&#x02019;s hawk were selected as relevant predators for the four shorebird species considered here. We corrected the counts for the daily observation duration, generating a daily mean predator rate (number hr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Next, we used mean values of the three years and calculated the relative frequency per day.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par36">Differences in migration speed (km day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) between seasons were examined using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. The model included migration speed (km day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) as the predicted variable with year and capture site as random factors. We started with a full model including season, average tailwind along all segments, age, species and all possible interactions, and then simplified the model using a backwards elimination process based on a log-likelihood ratio test (LRT) with <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 as the selection criterion (&#x0201c;drop1&#x0201d; in R) until reaching the minimal adequate model. Unexpectedly, age and tailwind were not included in the final model.</p><p id="Par37">To determine differences in airspeed between seasons, airspeed was calculated only for the period when individuals were flying (i.e., stopover time was not included). Because some individuals were detected along several segments of the journey, they reoccur in the analysis. Therefore, we used a GLMM with airspeed as the predicted variable, and year, capture site and bird-id as random factors. The predictor variables were season, species, age, days after capture and all possible interactions and we simplified the model based on a log-likelihood ratio test (LRT). The final model included season and species. In order to identify whether airspeeds differed prior to and after the predator front, we selected two periods in the post-breeding season based on a visual inspection of the predator front (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>); early (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;29 July &#x00026; &#x0003c;&#x000a0;1 Sept) and late (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;31 Aug). We used a GLMM with airspeed as the predicted variable, and year, capture site and bird-id as random factors. The predictor variables were season, species, age and all possible interactions and simplified the model based on a LRT. The final model included season, species and the interaction term. In order to visualize these patterns, we used generalized additive models (GAM) to describe patterns of predator abundance and airspeed during the post-breeding season and used separate models for each species. The response variable for these models was either relative predator frequency or airspeed. For both models we used day of year as an explanatory variable. The models were fitted using the &#x02018;mgcv&#x02019; package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup> in R ver. 3.4.1, and compared with linear models (LM) based on the Akaike information criterion, and the final model was considered to be substantially better when its value was at least two AIC units lower than the next best model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par38">Minimum stopover duration was analysed in the following way: the full model included minimum stopover duration (d) as the response variable with year and capture site as random factors, and season, average tailwind, age, species and all possible interactions as covariates. We then simplified the model based on a LRT until we reached a minimal adequate model.</p><p id="Par39">We calculated the relative proportion of birds departing daily from Delaware Bay during the pre-breeding season and from the southern James Bay region in the post-breeding season to assess the total time of the migration as a measure of time constraints.
