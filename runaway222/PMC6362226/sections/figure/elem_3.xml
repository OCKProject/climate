  <p>Daily patterns of variability over the region of sea ice loss (21°–79.5°E × 75°–79.5°N): (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) upward longwave radiation (

   <span class="italic">blue dotted</span>), net longwave radiation (
   <span class="italic">blue solid</span>) with its mean value (

   <span class="italic">red dashed</span>), latent heat flux (
   <span class="italic">red dotted</span>), and turbulent heat flux (
   <span class="italic">red solid</span>) with its mean value (
   <span class="italic">red straight line</span>), (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) 2 m air temperature (
   <span class="italic">red</span>), 850 hPa air temperature × 2 (
   <span class="italic">black</span>), and upward longwave radiation (

   <span class="bold">c</span>) same as (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) except for the regressed downward longwave radiation (
   <span class="italic">blue</span>). The straight lines in (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) and (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) represent the winter mean value of anomalous 2 m air temperature. Correlation of upward and downward longwave radiation with 2 m air temperature is respectively 0.88 and 0.91, whereas with 850 hPa air temperature is 0.66 and 0.85. Winter days are counted from December 1.
