 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our trait-based study will focus upon climate and, in particular, oleaster, or wild olive, growing along a climatic gradient in Mediterranean Morocco. Both species and region are of climatic relevance and interest. Climate change is predicted to increase the geographical range of the olive [

  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref051">51</a>] and under severe threat from climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref052">52</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref053">53</a>]. Specifically, variation in trait expression will be explored between and within nineteen populations of oleaster from climatically-contrasted habitats. The traits to be measured fall into two groups. The first group comprises ‘functional traits’, attributes that identify the ‘worldwide leaf economics spectrum’ and plant size. These traits are essentially those routinely measured in ‘functional’ studies. The second group includes ‘mechanistic’ traits linked to climate by physiological studies but not currently used in most ‘functional trait’ studies. Of necessity, we will concentrate attention on ‘mechanistic’ traits that may be measured rapidly. We shall assess both individually and in combination, which traits pattern more exactly with climatic variables, (a) ‘functional’ or (b) ‘ecophysiological’ traits. In this context, we suggest that field responses to climate has two components (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219908.g001" href="#pone.0219908.g001">Fig 1</a>). First, ‘functional’ strategies relating to the ‘leaf economics spectrum’ may be expected to optimize resource acquisition and growth during less climatically-severe periods. Secondly, ‘mechanistic’ strategies involving ‘ecophysiological traits’ linked to climate by physiological studies will confer tolerance of climatic extremes. Since oleaster is both slow-growing and long-lived tree, survival of climatic extremes will be key. Accordingly, our specific hypothesis is that, for oleaster, ‘ecophysiological traits’ little-used in trait-based plant ecology will pattern with climatic variables more effectively than commonly-used ‘functional traits’. More generally, we suspect that ‘functional’ trait-based plant ecology will have little impact on climate change research until it routinely includes a ‘mechanistic’ dimension to its trait measurements and analyses.
