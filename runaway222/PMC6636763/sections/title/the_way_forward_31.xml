 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results, and most of the relationships included in our literature review, point to ‘mechanistic’ traits being diagnostically superior to ‘functional’ ones in climate studies. Nevertheless, we believe it counterproductive to focus entirely on this ‘mechanistic’ superiority. To re-iterate arguments from the Introduction, ‘mechanistic’ studies are time-consuming with small datasets produced and species chosen primarily for ecological relevance. Without a level of co-ordination not currently in place between related ‘mechanistic’ investigations, precision of measurement will be offset by few shared species and no integration of findings (i.e. little generality). Trait based ecology, and ‘functional’ traits, can potentially provide this missing generality by producing large ecologically-balanced datasets. However, as in this study, results may require mechanistic clarification. Importantly, as currently implemented, trait-based ecology is methodologically flawed. Specialization routinely occurs at the cellular/biochemical level but may additionally be identified at a higher organizational scale by measuring organs or whole plants. So far, few suitable methodologies are available for the large-scale measurement of traits that can only be identified at the lowest, most fundamental cellular/biochemical level. As a result, the size of plants and their parts, plus SLA and LDMC, which can be measured using whole leaves, stand imprecisely at the centre of meta-analyses in trait-based ecology [

  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref137" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref137">137</a>]) remain outside the scope of these meta-analyses. Moreover, this study only partly redresses this ‘climatic imbalance’. Many addition simply-measured ‘mechanistic’ traits will be required to routinely add a comprehensive climatic dimension to trait-based studies.

  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref048">48</a>] identified ‘functional’ traits as dealing with ecological strategies relating to multi-environmental factors and studied implicitly over long timescales. This is true but, equally, it is the product of methodological constraints rather than an ideological choice. Both the ‘mechanistic’ and ‘functional’ trait approaches have strengths, and weaknesses, but similar goals. In our search to understand and quantify impacts of changing climate on global vegetation composition and ecosystem function, the challenge will be to combine the strengths of both approaches–and to use both types of traits. ‘Mechanistic’ and ‘functional’ traits both contribute to our proposed plant-climate model (
