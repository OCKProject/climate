 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After checking frequency distributions for normality and variance heterogeneity, it was necessary to log-transform trait values prior to analysis. Subsequently, one-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD 
  <span class="italic">post hoc</span> tests, Pearson correlations and principal component analyses (PCA) were undertaken for inter-population comparisons of trait values and of coefficient of variation (CV) estimates using the open source statistical environment R 3.3.3 [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intraspecific variation of the 5700 replicates for each leaf trait was explored across three levels of spatial and organizational scales: 1) ‘regional’, between different sites; 2) ‘population’, between different trees at same site, and 3) ‘individual’, between leaves on the same tree (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219908.g003" href="#pone.0219908.g003">Fig 3</a>). Here, the coefficient of variation (CV), calculated by the formula CV (%) = standard deviation
  <sub>trait</sub>/mean
  <sub>trait</sub> x 100 [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref111" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref111">111</a>], evaluates the amplitude of trait variability [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref112" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref112">112</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref113" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref113">113</a>]. This is particularly true where there is a proportionality between the mean and standard deviation of the distribution [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref114" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref114">114</a>]. The ‘varcomp’ function in the ‘ape’ package extracted these variance components [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref115" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref115">115</a>] and to quantify the extent and importance of variance across regional, population and individual scales, a general linear mixed model was fitted using the restricted maximum likelihood (RMEL) method, a nested ANOVA with random effects [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref022">22</a>]. Subsequently, the Canberra metric (CM) calculated as: CM = (CV
  <sub>max</sub>−CV
  <sub>min</sub>)/(CV
  <sub>max</sub> + CV
  <sub>min</sub>) tested for significant differences between the two coefficients of variation [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref116" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref116">116</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref118" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref118">118</a>]. When the value of CM is higher than 0.1, differences are considered significant.
