 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a long tradition of studying characteristics of the plant phenotype (traits) that determine how plants respond to environmental factors [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref002">2</a>]. The measurement of functional (adaptive) traits along environmental gradients has led to the identification of recurrent syndromes of co-occurring plant functional traits or ‘plant functional types’ particularly in relation to resource capture and allocation. These ‘plant functional types’, are a consequence of trade-offs, where traits that facilitate the exploitation of one environment simultaneously reduce fitness in another and, for many, their functional significance is underpinned by ecological theory. In this context, arguably the most fundamental and over-arching set of ecological rules relating plant performance to the environment is provided by CSR strategy theory [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref004">4</a>]. CSR strategy theory defines two groups of environmental factors that vitally impact upon plant performance. The first, stress (S), includes factors that restrict plant production, particularly mineral nutrients. Other stress factors include suboptimal temperatures and a shortage of light or water. The second group, disturbance (R), results in the destruction of already-produced plant biomass, promoting ruderal growth. Disturbance may result both from the impacts of land use and from extreme climatic events. Where, stress and disturbance are both low, the distribution of species is determined by a third factor, between-plant competition (C). Nevertheless, to date, the use of functional traits has concentrated upon just two areas within strategy theory. The first is the ‘worldwide leaf economics spectrum’, a major factor within stress sensu Grime [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref003">3</a>]. This separates species of fertile habitats from those of unproductive ones [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref006">6</a>]. It is defined both within the classical definition of relative growth rate by Evans [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref007">7</a>] and by a fundamental trade-off in leaves between the rapid acquisition of nutrients and the conservation of resources within well-protected tissues [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref008">8</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref011">11</a>]. The second much-studied topic within strategy theory is plant size. The expression of size is a complex function of the qualitative and temporal opportunities for growth controlled by environmental factors and by interactions with other plants (i.e. combinations of competition, disturbance and stress; Grime [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref001">1</a>]). As a consequence of this choice of traits, global meta-analysis within mainstream trait-based plant ecology [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref013">13</a>] simply identify the ‘worldwide leaf economics spectrum’ and plant size as the two key axes of specialization. Nevertheless, studies of this type, often called ‘trait-based plant ecology’, have been advanced as a key discipline for understanding and advising upon global processes of ecosystem change [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref006">6</a>]. A great strength of trait-based plant ecology is that the attributes routinely targeted can be both of ecological significance and easily measured. Numerous species, or even whole floras can be easily categorized with respect to many contrasted ecological dimensions. Moreover, the approach has already been used to compile large and varied trait databases [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref014">14</a>]. Encouragingly for the future, many additional traits are available for study [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref002">2</a>] and their use may further broaden the scope and utility of trait-based plant ecology.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intraspecific variation in trait expression–small changes with large impacts?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To date trait-based plant ecology has primarily focused upon interspecific comparisons [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref005">5</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref015">15</a>]. In contrast, intraspecific traits, while often equally ecologically significant, have remained comparatively neglected [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref016">16</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref019">19</a>]. This is unfortunate. As in interspecific comparisons, intraspecific traits frequently pattern instructively along environmental gradients [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref020">20</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref021">21</a>]. Moreover, intraspecific differences may equal or even exceed those from interspecific studies [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref022">22</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref023">23</a>]. They are also potentially relevant to climate studies (e.g. tolerance of water stress [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref024">24</a>]) as well as, to more general investigations of species coexistence and distribution [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref025">25</a>]. These similarities with studies of interspecific traits do not, however, by themselves make a strong case for more intraspecific investigations. However, additionally, and importantly, not all species have the same ecological impact. Amongst, those of greatest ecological significance are canopy dominants, sometimes called ‘ecosystem engineers’ [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref026">26</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref027">27</a>]. These species monopolize primary resources and, as a result, have a major impact on the ecological functioning of the whole community [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref026">26</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref027">27</a>]. In order to accommodate these and similar species, we, like Fajardo and Piper [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studying climate–a methodological dilemma</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite its long-appreciated importance [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref032">32</a>], our capacity to predict the potential impacts of climate change upon the world’s flora remains constrained by problems of ecological complexity [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref033">33</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref035">35</a>]. Moreover, within the context of climate studies the 'functional trait’ approach described above has so far failed to identify and quantify mechanisms of climatic restriction. The most highly-cited paper [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref036">36</a>] simply asks the important but preliminary question ‘Which is the better predictor of plant traits, temperature or precipitation?’ More recently, global correlations between traits and climatic variables have also been used to predict possible impacts of climate change on biomass yield [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref037">37</a>]. In contrast, an alternative overtly ecophysiological approach has greatly increased our understanding of the impacts of climate on plant performance and survival. Through experimentation, syndromes of ‘mechanistic’ traits conferring tolerance of defined climatic factors have been identified with their function directly interpreted in terms of physics and chemistry. For example, thermal response time of the leaf to changes in surface energy fluxes has been recognized as a major component of physiological tolerance to drought [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref038">38</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref039">39</a>]. Thermal response time is critical to leaf carbon economics and is defined by leaf traits such as dry matter mass, water mass, specific heat capacity, surface area, width, shape and stomatal density [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref039">39</a>]. Similarly, the characteristics of the plant’s hydraulic system additionally regulate response to climate [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref040">40</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref041">41</a>]. Here, key traits include leaf water potential at turgor-loss point, plant hydraulic conductance or xylem vulnerability [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref042">42</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref044">44</a>] and, more generally, root architecture [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref045">45</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref046">46</a>]. Furthermore, encouragingly, Brodribb [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref047">47</a>] outlines how simple ‘mechanistic’ traits identified in ecophysiological studies define hydraulic physiology and may be used to explain and predict climatic restriction due to drought.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contrast between the relatively climatically ineffectual ‘functional’ traits and the more ecophysiologically insightful ‘mechanistic’ traits has catalysed a debate as to how best to advance our understanding of plant-climate interactions [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref047">47</a>]. Provocatively, Brodribb writes: ‘By ‘mechanistic’ traits, I mean traits whose function can be clearly physiologically defined, as opposed to the more abstract ‘functional’ traits, such as leaf mass per area (LMA, also known as specific leaf area (SLA)), that have been used to great effect in explaining plant economics over the last 15 years [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref005">5</a>]’. Brodribb’s subdivision has been re-enforced by Volaire [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref048">48</a>]. Volaire separates ‘mechanistic’ traits as physiological strategies relating to one dominant environmental factor and studied explicitly over short timescales from ‘functional’ traits with ecological strategies relating to multi- environmental factors and studied implicitly over long timescales. However, this debate ignores a key point. ‘Mechanistic’ studies are time-consuming and most include few species. They provide precision in measurement but the general significance of each mechanism at a global scale is more difficult to study because inevitably datasets are small. In contrast, as outlined above, the ‘functional trait’ approach can quickly generate large datasets for whole floras with each species defined in many contrasted ecological dimensions. As in other comparative approaches the ‘functional trait’ approach has a strong potential for generality. ‘The collection and comparison of standardized information …… follows closely the philosophies prevailing in the physical sciences. Perhaps the most obvious of these is the role played by the Periodic Table of the Elements in classifying, analysing, and even predicting, the structure and properties of chemical elements and compounds’ [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref049">49</a>]. Why has the ‘functional trait’ approach had so little impact on understanding the role of climate on plant distribution? The failure appears to stem from the consistent use of a restricted and ‘climatically inappropriate’ set of traits. Traits linked to ‘mechanistic’ climate-related studies are conspicuously absent from ‘functional’ analyses both in studies describing general global patterns of specialization [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref012">12</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref013">13</a>] and in those with a more climatic focus [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref036">36</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref037">37</a>]. A plethora of potentially important climate-related traits still require further investigation. With interdisciplinary collaboration, the ‘functional trait’ approach has the potential to add important elements of generality and utility to the current pioneering ‘mechanistic’ studies …. provided, of course, that suitable, easily- and rapidly-measurable traits can be borrowed from the existing raft of ‘mechanistic’ studies.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our trait-based study will focus upon climate and, in particular, oleaster, or wild olive, growing along a climatic gradient in Mediterranean Morocco. Both species and region are of climatic relevance and interest. Climate change is predicted to increase the geographical range of the olive [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref050">50</a>]. Equally, the Mediterranean region is both a biodiversity hotspot [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref051">51</a>] and under severe threat from climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref052">52</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0219908.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref053">53</a>]. Specifically, variation in trait expression will be explored between and within nineteen populations of oleaster from climatically-contrasted habitats. The traits to be measured fall into two groups. The first group comprises ‘functional traits’, attributes that identify the ‘worldwide leaf economics spectrum’ and plant size. These traits are essentially those routinely measured in ‘functional’ studies. The second group includes ‘mechanistic’ traits linked to climate by physiological studies but not currently used in most ‘functional trait’ studies. Of necessity, we will concentrate attention on ‘mechanistic’ traits that may be measured rapidly. We shall assess both individually and in combination, which traits pattern more exactly with climatic variables, (a) ‘functional’ or (b) ‘ecophysiological’ traits. In this context, we suggest that field responses to climate has two components (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219908.g001" href="#pone.0219908.g001">Fig 1</a>). First, ‘functional’ strategies relating to the ‘leaf economics spectrum’ may be expected to optimize resource acquisition and growth during less climatically-severe periods. Secondly, ‘mechanistic’ strategies involving ‘ecophysiological traits’ linked to climate by physiological studies will confer tolerance of climatic extremes. Since oleaster is both slow-growing and long-lived tree, survival of climatic extremes will be key. Accordingly, our specific hypothesis is that, for oleaster, ‘ecophysiological traits’ little-used in trait-based plant ecology will pattern with climatic variables more effectively than commonly-used ‘functional traits’. More generally, we suspect that ‘functional’ trait-based plant ecology will have little impact on climate change research until it routinely includes a ‘mechanistic’ dimension to its trait measurements and analyses.
