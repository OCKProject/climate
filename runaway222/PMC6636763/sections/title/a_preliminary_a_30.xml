 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oleaster is a thermophilic species with limited resistance to both cold and extreme aridity [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref055">55</a>]. Moreover, aridity is generally regarded as the key climatic factor determining species composition in Mediterranean vegetation. The ‘climatic’ PCA axis 3 was correlated positively with MAT, MAP, MTCM and AI and negatively with altitude (
  <a rid="pone.0219908.t010" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0219908.t010">Table 10A</a>). Thus, high values of PCA axis 3 equated to high mean annual temperature, high minimum temperature of the coldest month, high mean annual precipitation, high aridity and low altitude. In terms of the traits that define PCA axis 3 (
  <a rid="pone.0219908.t009" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0219908.t009">Table 9</a>), these climatic extremes were associated with low stomatal density (DS
  <span class="sup">–</span>) low leaf water content (SLWC
  <span class="sup">–</span>), small leaves (LL
  <span class="sup">–</span>) and high leaf construction costs (SLA
  <span class="sup">+</span>). The trends for DS were similar to those recorded elsewhere in relation to climate [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref129" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref129">129</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref130" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref130">130</a>]. Similarly, elongate leaves with a potentially thinner boundary layer [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref099" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref099">99</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref131" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref131">131</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref132" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref132">132</a>] tended to be associated with harsher climates. PCA axis 3 may identify a water-use/succulence dimension. Moreover, site 13, excluded for its extremely high values for LT, LWC and SLWC (
  <a rid="pone.0219908.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0219908.t003">Table 3</a>), may perhaps represent an extremely ‘succulent’ outlying population.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Succulence is an ecologically important functional mechanism defined as the ‘storage of utilizable water in living tissues in one or several plant parts in such a way as to allow the plant to be temporarily independent from external water supply but to retain at least some physiological activity’ [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref133" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref133">133</a>]. However, structural and physiological relationships involving succulence are complex [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref133" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref133">133</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref136" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref136">136</a>]. As a result, whether PCA axis 3 identifies ‘succulence’, and provides a temporary drought avoidance mechanism, still requires experimental verification. Nevertheless, whatever the exact functional origins of climate-related PCA axis 3, its recognition was, importantly, only made possible through the inclusion of several traits not customarily included in trait-based ecological studies.
