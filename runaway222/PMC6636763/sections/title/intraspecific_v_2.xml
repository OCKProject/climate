 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To date trait-based plant ecology has primarily focused upon interspecific comparisons [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref015">15</a>]. In contrast, intraspecific traits, while often equally ecologically significant, have remained comparatively neglected [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref016">16</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref019">19</a>]. This is unfortunate. As in interspecific comparisons, intraspecific traits frequently pattern instructively along environmental gradients [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref020">20</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref021">21</a>]. Moreover, intraspecific differences may equal or even exceed those from interspecific studies [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref022">22</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref023">23</a>]. They are also potentially relevant to climate studies (e.g. tolerance of water stress [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref024">24</a>]) as well as, to more general investigations of species coexistence and distribution [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref025">25</a>]. These similarities with studies of interspecific traits do not, however, by themselves make a strong case for more intraspecific investigations. However, additionally, and importantly, not all species have the same ecological impact. Amongst, those of greatest ecological significance are canopy dominants, sometimes called ‘ecosystem engineers’ [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref026">26</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref027">27</a>]. These species monopolize primary resources and, as a result, have a major impact on the ecological functioning of the whole community [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref026">26</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref027">27</a>]. In order to accommodate these and similar species, we, like Fajardo and Piper [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref021">21</a>], Bolnick et al. [

  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref028">28</a>], Laforest-Lapointe et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref029">29</a>], Moran et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref030">30</a>], Shipley et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0219908.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0219908.ref031">31</a>], believe that change is needed. An intraspecific dimension should be routinely factored into global models.
