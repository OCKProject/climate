      <p>The concept of feedback is key in assessing whether a perturbation to a system is
         amplified or damped by mechanisms internal to the system. In polar regions, climate
         dynamics are controlled by both radiative and non-radiative interactions between the
         atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, ice sheets and land surfaces. Precisely quantifying polar
         feedbacks is required for a process-oriented evaluation of climate models, a clear
         understanding of the processes responsible for polar climate changes, and a reduction
         in uncertainty associated with model projections. This quantification can be performed
         using a simple and consistent approach that is valid for a wide range of feedbacks,
         offering the opportunity for more systematic feedback analyses and a better understanding
         of polar climate changes.
