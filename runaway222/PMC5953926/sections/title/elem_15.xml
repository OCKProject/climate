 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The review above illustrates that many definitions and evaluation methods have been proposed for the various radiative and non-radiative feedbacks. Nevertheless, all the feedbacks can be described and quantified using a simple and consistent framework, based on the definition of a feedback factor 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For radiative feedbacks, the feedback factor 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> is the ratio of a particular feedback parameter to minus the Planck feedback parameter. An analogous expression can be written for any other feedback. When only one feedback is operating (see the methods for the case of multiple feedbacks), the feedback factor 
  <span class="italic">γ</span> can be quantified as the ratio between the additional changes specifically due to the feedback and the response of the full system including all the feedbacks (Total response). This additional change (Total response − Reference response) is itself computed as the difference between the response of the full system and the one of a reference system in which the feedback under consideration does not operate (Reference response):

 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The methodology requires explicitly identifying (1) a perturbation or a class of perturbations, (2) a response variable involved in the feedback loop, (3) the full system with all processes operating and its response to the perturbation, and (4) the reference system with the process of interest not operating and the reference system response to the perturbation. While the framework is general, a clear definition of this system is required, as the value of the feedback factor depends on the way the reference system is chosen
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Let’s examine radiative feedbacks as one example (see the methods): (1) the perturbation is the radiative forcing 
  <span class="italic">F</span>, (2) the response variable is 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">s</span>
  </sub>, (3) the full system includes one or more radiative feedbacks plus the Planck response referenced to 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">s</span>
  </sub>, and (4) the reference system is the Planck response only.
 </p>
 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As it is based on the same principles, analysis of non-radiative processes using this feedback factor retains the main advantages of the radiative feedback framework. First, each feedback can be associated with a well-defined conceptual model describing the mechanisms and interactions involved. This is essential in order to allow each feedback to be firmly rooted in a process-based analysis that is straightforward to apply and understand. Secondly, it is possible to evaluate the magnitude of the feedbacks using a dimensionless factor, ideally both in models and observations. This is required to assess the contributions of the different feedbacks to the total response and to compare the role of each feedback in various Earth System models to determine which is responsible for their distinctive sensitivities.</p>
 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As in the example below, the feedback factor can in some cases be evaluated using observations or model outputs only, but it may also require specific additional calculations. This is illustrated using a simple model in Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> for the ice growth-ice thickness feedback. In this case, potential compensations can occur between feedbacks and the interpretation of the estimates that are obtained must then take into those synergies

It is shown here for a Weddell Sea location typically covered by ice in winter (near 30°W, 65°S). The strength of the pycnocline is thus evaluated in summer but it must be measured below the layer close to the surface that is warmed above freezing point temperature if sea ice completely melts, as the heat in this layer is removed quickly in fall when the temperature drops and is not involved in the ice production-ocean entrainment feedback

  <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In practice, it is usually not possible to completely quantify all the dependencies of a non-linear, spatially variable feedback factor. This is why it has been suggested to select a prescribed perturbation representative of the condition of interest, similarly to the classical analysis of radiative forcing in terms of doublings of atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). For the ice production-ocean entrainment feedback, we propose to evaluate 
   <span class="italic">γ</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">θ</span>
   </sub> by considering the response to a standardized perturbation corresponding to an increase in sea ice thickness of 10 cm (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The number of observed profiles being much higher in summer, the feedback parameter is evaluated from data collected during this season. It is clear that the corresponding values of the feedback factors are not universally valid but they provide a standard benchmark for comparisons and analyses.
