      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the magnitude of some radiative feedbacks is modulated by processes that may appear
         hidden in their overall evaluation, focused analyses have been proposed to reveal
         elements specifically related to sea ice and ocean. For instance, the surface albedo
         feedback is more efficient for thin than for thick sea ice as a similar change in
         thickness induced by a given perturbation will lead to a larger increase in the open
         water area and thus a larger change in albedo. This has led to the definition of the
         open water formation efficiency as the percent open water formation per cm of ice
         melt over the melt season
         <span><a>47</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some other feedbacks are not directly related to radiative processes. For example,
         basal sea ice growth rate is largely driven by heat conduction, which varies as the
         inverse of sea ice thickness: thin ice grows much faster than thick ice
         <span><a>48</a></span>. At the same time, sea ice melt rate is nearly independent of ice thickness. This
         leads to the negative ice growth-thickness feedback. When a positive radiative perturbation
         is applied to the sea ice surface energy balance leading to an initial ice thinning,
         ice formation in winter is enhanced so that the ice adjusts its thickness to match
         the new growth rates to the new melting rates
         <span><a>49</a></span>, resulting in a new equilibrium for the sea ice thickness. As the thermal insulation
         power of snow is even more efficient than that of sea ice, its influence on the ice
         growth-thickness feedback is important, but not fully quantified due to the complex
         relationship between snow depth and sea-ice thickness
         <span><a>30</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of the large heat fluxes at the ocean–ice interface in the Southern Ocean,
         feedback analyses there have often focused on the interactions between ocean and sea
         ice. In the ice-covered parts of the Southern Ocean, the stability of the upper water
         column is controlled by salinity, with the ocean temperature and salinity increasing
         with depth below the surface mixed layer (the ocean layer that has a nearly homogeneous
         density). In winter, when brine is released by sea ice formation, surface mixed layer
         density increases, inducing a mixed layer deepening and the entrainment of relatively
         warm water into the surface oceanic layer. This warm water reduces ice formation and
         can even melt ice, which partly compensates for the initial ice formation, leading
         to a negative ice production–entrainment feedback
         <span><a>50</a>, 
            <a>51</a></span></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ice production–entrainment feedback is acting at the seasonal scale but the magnitude
         of the ice–ocean flux can also be modulated at inter-annual to decadal timescales,
         leading to the positive ice production heat-storage feedback
         <span><a>52</a>, 
            <a>53</a></span>. If ice production is very large during a particular year, the mixed layer will be
         deeper and the salt released by ice formation will be distributed over a larger depth
         range. In summer, the mixing is weaker and the freshwater input due to ice melting
         will be spread over a shallower layer, leading to a net downward vertical salt transport.
         This can restrain the vertical exchanges in the water column the subsequent winter,
         leading to less heat transfer to the surface and more heat storage at depth. Finally,
         the weaker heat flux at the ice–ocean interface would favor additional ice formation,
         leading to a positive feedback amplifying the initial perturbation. The heat storage
         at depth can also be reinforced by a net freshwater input at the surface (due for
         instance to a net transport of sea ice to the region) that further stabilizes the
         water column.
