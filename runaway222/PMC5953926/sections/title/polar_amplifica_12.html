      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, climate feedbacks are less stabilizing (i.e., feedback parameters are less
         negative or more positive) in polar regions than in the tropics. This explains the
         larger temperature changes experienced in polar regions in response to a perturbation
         (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>), a phenomenon referred to as polar amplification
         <span><a>19</a>, 
            <a>20</a>, 
            <a>23</a>, 
            <a>97</a></span>. For the climate changes projected for the 21st century, polar amplification is much
         stronger in the Arctic than in the Antarctic. In the Arctic, the large amplification
         mostly results from (1) a relatively large and positive lapse rate feedback, due to
         a different vertical distribution of the temperature change compared to the tropics;
         (2) a relatively weak negative Planck response, due to smaller blackbody emissions
         per unit warming at lower temperatures (Stefan–Boltzmann law); and (3) a large positive
         surface albedo feedback, due to the loss of high albedo snow and ice-covered surfaces,
         as well as a contribution from atmospheric heat transport (Fig. 
         <a>3a</a>). In the Antarctic, both the weak Planck response and the positive surface albedo
         feedback induce polar amplification. Warming is damped relative to the Arctic due
         to a less positive lapse rate feedback, more negative cloud feedback, and strong ocean
         heat uptake in the Southern Ocean under transient warming (Fig. 
         <a>3b</a>).

                  Project (CMIP5). The feedbacks shown are the lapse rate (LR), surface albedo (A),
                  water vapor (WV), cloud (C), and latitudinal variation in the Planck response (P’,

                  <sub>2</sub> forcing (CO
                  <sub>2</sub>), atmospheric heat transport convergence (ΔAHT) and ocean heat uptake (ΔOHU) (see
                  method section). The feedbacks are expressed as warming contributions to the total
                  temperature change

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that if feedbacks are defined using global mean rather than local surface temperature
         change, the Planck feedback appears strongly negative in the Arctic because the local
         temperature change exceeds the local mean. Additionally, the polar amplification has
         a large seasonal cycle, displaying over the Arctic a minimum in summer and a maximum
         in fall/winter. In summer, the influence of the large positive surface albedo feedback
         is compensated by a strong oceanic heat uptake and negative cloud feedbacks while
         in fall/winter the heat released by the ocean, the contribution of lapse rate feedback
         and cloud feedbacks induce a large warming
