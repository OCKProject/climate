      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This Perspective underlines the critical role of feedbacks in the dynamics of polar
         climate and the need to quantify them precisely. Feedback quantification provides
         a powerful tool to understand the interactions between the components of the system,
         to analyze model biases and to determine the origin of the differences within a set
         of model predictions. We have focused on some physical processes affecting the atmosphere,
         sea ice, ice sheets, land surfaces and ocean in polar regions. Yet, the discussion
         can be extended to feedbacks including biogeochemical processes.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantification of feedback strength is not simple as many polar feedbacks are strongly
         non-linear. Indeed, feedback magnitude depends on the location, the season and is
         a function of the climate state. We have provided here values in specific conditions
         for some of the feedbacks investigated. However, one single number or a range, as
         could be included in a table for instance, is not sufficient to fully characterize
         a feedback and its variations.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the quantitative estimation of feedbacks follows well-established methodologies
         for radiative feedbacks, this is not the case for many other feedbacks. Nevertheless,
         the traditional radiative feedback analysis can be extended to define a feedback factor
         that can be used as a standard measure of most polar feedbacks. This feedback factor
         is estimated as the relative contribution of the feedback to the total change of the
         system in response to a perturbation. It has several advantages: (1) it is compatible
         with the radiative feedback framework which has proven useful over the past three
         decades, (2) it is based on a clear physical interpretation of key physical processes,
         (3) the framework is simple to articulate, and (4) an unambiguous quantification can
         be obtained allowing an objective evaluation of the processes that control the response
         to a perturbation.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using a feedback factor provides the clear theoretical advantages of being consistent
         with the feedback theory, general and easy to interpret. Nevertheless, based on data
         availability or on the specific goal of a study, other parameters will continue to
         be used to diagnose the magnitude of some feedbacks. This may ofÂ course be perfectly
         justified. However, the limitations and merit of such an approach compared to a more
         general view need to be discussed and taken into account when interpreting the results.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even though the feedbacks discussed here are well-known, some are often only used
         to provide a qualitative interpretation or a narrative framework to explain the changes
         occurring in polar regions. In particular, the quantitative evaluation of non-radiative
         feedbacks in models is rare, with only few and, in some cases, no publications on
         this topic for some feedbacks. This Perspective motivates the use of more systematic
         approaches to analyze past and upcoming model results. In particular, the framework
         presented here allows tracing the origin of model diversity back to physical considerations.
         Identifying the feedbacks that are critical for correctly simulating the mean state
         and variability of polar climate will ultimately promote the development of targeted
         observational campaigns, by means of which models will be evaluated. Such campaigns
         already exist or are underway: the Year of Polar Prediction (YOPP) or the Multidisciplinary
         drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) are two examples. In
         summary, advancing evaluation of feedbacks will require dedicated model experiments
         and careful analyses, complemented with the collection of dedicated observations that
         can constrain model feedbacks. Some of those elements are clearly challenging, but
         this will be strongly beneficial for our understanding of polar climate dynamics and
         of the future changes expected at high latitudes.
