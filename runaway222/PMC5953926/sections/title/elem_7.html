         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The feedback parameters provide classical measures of the magnitude of the radiative
            feedbacks (Box 
            <a>1</a>). They are defined as the change in radiative fluxes due to the impact of a change
            in surface temperature upon the variable of interest (e.g., surface albedo, water
            vapor amount, cloud cover also referred to as climate variable) and are quantified
            in W m
            <span>−2</span> K
            <span>−1</span>. The net climate feedback parameter 
            <span>λ,</span> which is equal to the sum of all the parameters for the individual feedbacks, can
            be estimated by measuring all the terms of the equation describing the global mean
            radiative balance (Eq. (
            <a>1</a>) in Box 
            <a>1</a>) or by regressing the change in radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere (TOA)
            against the global mean surface temperature change
            <span><a>82</a></span>. It is somewhat more complex to evaluate specific feedback parameters 
            <span>λ</span><sub><span>i</span></sub>, as this requires isolating the impact of each feedback variable on the Earth’s energy
            balance
            <span><a>31</a>, 
               <a>33</a>, 
               <a>83</a>–
               <a>87</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since TOA fluxes determine the total energy budget of the Earth’s climate system,
            they are a natural reference point for computing climate feedbacks at a global scale.
            They are also closely connected to surface temperature change in the Tropics, where
            deep convection leads to a vertically well-mixed atmosphere. In the Arctic, where
            deep vertical mixing is suppressed by strong static stability in the troposphere,
            computing feedback parameters based on surface fluxes can lead to important additional
            insights
            <span><a>19</a>, 
               <a>23</a>, 
               <a>55</a>, 
               <a>74</a></span>. For example, a change in clouds that raises atmospheric emissivity in the Arctic
            inversion layer can lead to increases in both upwelling and downwelling longwave radiation,
            and thus lead to energy loss and a negative cloud feedback at TOA but energy gain
            and a positive cloud feedback at the surface
            <span><a>19</a>, 
               <a>88</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual feedback parameters defined at the surface or TOA can be diagnosed using
            several different methods, including partial radiative perturbations
            <span><a>31</a></span>, the less computationally expensive approximate partial radiative perturbations
            <span><a>83</a></span>, and the even more idealized radiative kernel technique
            <span><a>85</a>, 
               <a>86</a></span>. Using this now widely used method, changes in TOA radiative fluxes due to a uniform,
            idealized perturbation in the feedback variable are first computed using a radiative
            transfer model to obtain the so-called kernel. The kernel thus only depends on the
            radiative transfer algorithm and the mean state of the system. 
            <span>λ</span><sub><span>i</span></sub> can then be derived by multiplying the kernel by the response of the feedback variable
            to changes in global mean surface temperature.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In parallel to feedback parameters, other expressions can sometimes be easier to interpret
            or be more convenient. One option is to diagnose the temperature change that can be
            attributed to each feedback explicitly, known as a warming contribution (see the methods).
            It is also instructive to compare the temperature changes due to a particular feedback
            to changes of a reference system in which the feedbacks of interest are inactive.
            In the radiative feedback framework, the reference system is traditionally chosen
            as the Planck response. The feedback factor 
            <span>γ</span><sub><span>i</span></sub> is then defined as the ratio of each feedback parameter to (minus) the Planck feedback
            
            <span>λ</span><sub><span>0</span></sub>: 
            <span>γ</span><sub><span>i</span></sub> = 
            <span>λ</span><sub><span>i</span></sub>/−
            <span>λ</span><sub>0</sub>. An advantage of this approach is that the feedback factor 
            <span>γ</span><sub><span>i</span></sub> is dimensionless because it is expressed relative to the reference system. It can
            then be used to compare the impact of very different processes, bearing in mind that
            its specific value depends on the reference system chosen
            <span><a>12</a></span>(for more details see the methods).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the approaches focused on the top of the atmosphere or the surface,
            it is possible to analyze the origin of three-dimensional temperature changes such
            as in the climate feedback response analysis method
            <span><a>89</a></span> (CFRAM). It has also been proposed to decompose the feedbacks in ways that differ
            <span><a>55</a>, 
               <a>90</a></span> from the traditional one described in Box 
            <a>1</a>. Each methodology is adapted to a special purpose but also has its own limitations.
            For instance, a three-dimensional analysis can highlight the processes that are at
            the origin of the changes at various level in the atmosphere, but it may require model
            outputs that are not routinely saved by climate modeling centers. Finally, applying
            different methods leads to different definitions of feedbacks and ultimately differing
            quantitative assessment of feedback strengths.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations of the linear approach</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The standard radiative feedback framework assumes that the response of the system
            can be expressed as a linear function of the surface temperature. It is a very useful
            approximation but some processes cannot be expressed in terms of functions of single
            variables and the radiative feedback framework has to be adjusted to capture changes
            in the system not directly related to surface temperature
            <span><a>91</a>, 
               <a>92</a></span>. Moreover, assuming linearity in feedbacks fails in many cases, as can be expected
            for a system as complex as the Earth’s climate. For example, the magnitude of the
            climate feedback parameter 
            <span>λ</span> generally decreases with time in climate models after a rise in atmospheric CO
            <sub>2</sub> concentration, corresponding to increasing climate sensitivity as equilibrium is
            approached
            <span><a>32</a>, 
               <a>76</a>, 
               <a>92</a></span>. 
            <span>λ</span> may also depend on the magnitude of the perturbation
            <span><a>87</a>, 
               <a>93</a>–
               <a>95</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The non-linearity of the feedbacks can be described in different ways. A simple definition
            will be used here: the feedback is non-linear if the feedback factor 
            <span>γ</span> is not constant. Non-linearities can be caused by several processes. The strength
            of the feedback can be a function of the state of the system. This state dependence
            can often be expressed as a time dependence when the state changes with time. Furthermore,
            the different processes controlling the response to a perturbation may have different
            time scales. Their relative contribution to local and global scale feedbacks may thus
            evolve leading to spatially or temporally non-constant feedback factors
            <span><a>76</a>, 
               <a>92</a>, 
               <a>96</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In polar regions, the presence of different phases of water implies that many feedback
            parameters display a particularly strong dependence on the state of the system near
            the freezing point and are thus highly non-linear. For instance, phase changes play
            an important role in polar clouds leading to non-linearities in the cloud feedback
            <span><a>32</a>, 
               <a>34</a>, 
               <a>39</a>, 
               <a>40</a></span>. Furthermore, feedbacks related to the cryosphere generally depend on the surface
            area covered by snow or ice. As temperatures rise, this area decreases and the feedback
            strength is reduced. This is illustrated
            <span><a>87</a></span> in Fig. 
            <a>2</a> for the surface albedo feedback in response to three consecutive doublings of CO
            <sub>2</sub> in the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3). At many latitudes, the value
            of the feedback factor is smaller for the third doubling (8 × CO
            <sub>2</sub>–4 × CO
            <sub>2</sub>) than it is for the first (2 × CO
            <sub>2</sub>–CNTL). Between 50°S and 60°S the feedback approaches zero for the third doubling,
            since the Southern Ocean is already ice-free at these latitudes in the 4xCO
            <sub>2</sub> climate, and no further melting can occur. On the other hand, the value of the feedback
            factor increases at northern high latitudes (75°N–90°N), as the sea ice edge retreats
            within the central Arctic at high warming.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The traditional radiative feedback framework has been extended to additional processes
            that influence the energy balance of the Earth, offering an effective way to evaluate
            and compare the strength of the different feedbacks
            <span><a>55</a>, 
               <a>76</a>, 
               <a>89</a></span>. This approach has also been successful for some biogeochemical and biogeophysical
            feedbacks
            <span><a>66</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the evaluation of key non-radiative polar feedbacks is generally inconsistent
            among the different feedbacks and even among different studies of the same feedback.
            For the ice growth–thickness feedback, in analogy with the radiative feedback framework,
            the thickness sensitivity parameter is defined as the ratio of the sea ice thickness
            change to the perturbative forcing
            <span><a>49</a></span>, but this definition has not been widely used so far. The effectiveness of the ice
            production-entrainment feedback can be measured
            <span><a>50</a>, 
               <a>51</a></span> as the ratio between the melting immediately caused by the entrainment of warmer
            water in the surface layer to the initial ice growth. The ice production-ocean heat
            storage feedback has been estimated by the ratio between the heat losses associated
            with sea-ice volume changes to the heat storage below the surface level
            <span><a>52</a>, 
               <a>53</a></span>. Both quantities can be evaluated directly from observations or model results. (Supplementary
            Note 
            <a>1</a>). Those definitions appear justified taken alone but the diversity of definitions
            and methods to quantify those feedbacks complicates their systematic evaluation and
            the comparison of the role of the different processes in observed changes. A common
            framework would thus be very helpful.
