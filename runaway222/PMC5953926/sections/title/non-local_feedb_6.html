      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While this Perspective focuses on feedbacks that act through physical processes in
         polar regions (Table 
         <a>1</a>, Fig. 
         <a>1</a>), we should mention that many other feedback processes exist, some of which involve
         biological processes and biogeochemical cycles
         <span><a>65</a>–
            <a>68</a></span>. One example is the bio-optical feedback, which occurs when climate warming and sea
         ice retreat in the Arctic Ocean lead to intense phytoplankton blooms
         <span><a>69</a></span>. These blooms trap the penetrating solar heat flux at the ocean surface, which increases
         sea surface temperature. As a result, sea ice concentration decreases, which leads
         to enhanced absorption of solar energy into the ocean and further warming of the Arctic
         <span><a>70</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The response to a perturbation also implies a redistribution of the energy between
         different latitudes. First, the warming of the tropics under greenhouse gas forcing
         leads to enhanced poleward energy transport by the atmospheric circulation to higher
         latitudes, contributing to warming there
         <span><a>71</a>–
            <a>75</a></span>. This indicates a coupling between radiative feedbacks and atmospheric heat transport
         <span><a>74</a>, 
            <a>76</a>, 
            <a>77</a></span>. Moreover, radiative feedbacks at low latitudes may influence polar warming through
         their effect on poleward energy transport, while changes in polar regions may affect
         dynamics in the lower latitudes
         <span><a>78</a></span>. This is an area of ongoing research, and it is not yet clear if the response of
         the system has a direct impact on the original perturbation itself such that a closed
         feedback loop can be identified.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, the ocean heat transport has been found to strongly shape polar climate change,
         with increased poleward heat transport into the Arctic
         <span><a>79</a>–
            <a>81</a></span> and decreased poleward heat transport into the Southern Ocean
         <span><a>4</a>, 
            <a>79</a></span> under global warming. Here too, it is unclear whether these changes can be represented
         in terms of a closed feedback loop (e.g., sea ice thinning enhancing ocean heat transport
         into the Arctic
         <span><a>81</a></span>) or should be classified as important drivers of polar climate change that cannot
         be expressed within a feedback framework.
