      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One justification of the development of the radiative feedback framework is to determine
         the processes that can explain the range of model projections for a specific scenario
         of future changes in radiative forcing. As expected, the models displaying the largest
         surface temperature changes are the ones for which the radiative feedbacks have the
         largest (most positive) values. The same approach can be applied to the non-radiative
         feedbacks investigated here as they are related to the magnitude of the response to
         any type of perturbation.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although it is better if a model is able to reproduce the observations with a bias
         that is as small as possible, it is not clear for many variables, such as the global
         mean temperature, that the response to a perturbation is a function of this bias
         <span><a>104</a></span>. In other words, there is no a priori reason to believe that a model which reproduces
         the present global mean temperature well will provide more reasonable projections
         of future climate than a model that has larger biases. Indeed, a model may have a
         global mean temperature close to observations due to compensations between many factors
         that may not necessarily balance in a projected climate
         <span><a>105</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The situation is distinctive for polar regions, where the feedbacks are strongly non-linear
         and thus state dependent. This provides an instructive way to interpret the range
         of model responses as a function of the value of some variables for present-day conditions
         <span><a>106</a>, 
            <a>107</a></span>. Furthermore, it has been argued that a model displaying a more realistic mean state
         in polar regions will also have a better representation of key processes and thus
         will provide a more likely estimate of future climate changes than a model with larger
         biases. This has then been used to justify the selection of models based on their
         mean state
         <span><a>108</a>, 
            <a>109</a></span>. This idea appears useful in principle but is hard to generalize and is subject to
         criticism. In particular, it is not always clear to determine how to evaluate models,
         which variable should be used to select models, and if the currently available model
         sample is adequate to apply a meaningful selection. This has led to strong debate
         in the community about the justification of this approach, which may artificially
         reduce the uncertainty range by discarding model results that are as likely as the
         others
         <span><a>110</a></span>. We propose to use feedback quantification more extensively to evaluate model behavior,
         and foresee that this can contribute to more robust estimates of the likelihood of
         projections.
