 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One justification of the development of the radiative feedback framework is to determine the processes that can explain the range of model projections for a specific scenario of future changes in radiative forcing. As expected, the models displaying the largest surface temperature changes are the ones for which the radiative feedbacks have the largest (most positive) values. The same approach can be applied to the non-radiative feedbacks investigated here as they are related to the magnitude of the response to any type of perturbation.</p>
 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although it is better if a model is able to reproduce the observations with a bias that is as small as possible, it is not clear for many variables, such as the global mean temperature, that the response to a perturbation is a function of this bias

  </span>. In other words, there is no a priori reason to believe that a model which reproduces the present global mean temperature well will provide more reasonable projections of future climate than a model that has larger biases. Indeed, a model may have a global mean temperature close to observations due to compensations between many factors that may not necessarily balance in a projected climate

 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The situation is distinctive for polar regions, where the feedbacks are strongly non-linear and thus state dependent. This provides an instructive way to interpret the range of model responses as a function of the value of some variables for present-day conditions

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">107</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, it has been argued that a model displaying a more realistic mean state in polar regions will also have a better representation of key processes and thus will provide a more likely estimate of future climate changes than a model with larger biases. This has then been used to justify the selection of models based on their mean state

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" href="#CR109">109</a>
  </span>. This idea appears useful in principle but is hard to generalize and is subject to criticism. In particular, it is not always clear to determine how to evaluate models, which variable should be used to select models, and if the currently available model sample is adequate to apply a meaningful selection. This has led to strong debate in the community about the justification of this approach, which may artificially reduce the uncertainty range by discarding model results that are as likely as the others
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" href="#CR110">110</a>
  </span>. We propose to use feedback quantification more extensively to evaluate model behavior, and foresee that this can contribute to more robust estimates of the likelihood of projections.
