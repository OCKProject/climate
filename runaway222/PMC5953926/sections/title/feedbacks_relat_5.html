      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At low and mid-latitudes, a drying of the soils in response to an initial temperature
         rise can amplify the warming as the evapotranspiration that normally cools the surface
         is reduced
         <span><a>54</a></span>. This positive soil moisture–temperature feedback is less active at high latitudes
         but, despite the low temperatures, evapotranspiration strongly contributes to moderate
         the summer warming over land
         <span><a>55</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ice sheets, glaciers and snow cover over land provide key components to the surface
         albedo feedback
         <span><a>25</a>–
            <a>28</a></span>. They also give rise to a number of specific feedback mechanisms. Three important
         ones are discussed here. Compared to the feedbacks mainly involving the atmosphere
         and sea ice, ice sheets generally, but not exclusively, play a role on longer time
         scales. In the positive surface mass balance–elevation feedback, increased air temperature
         leads to ice melting, which lowers the surface elevation of the ice sheet, exposing
         the ice to warmer air temperatures and thus further melting
         <span><a>56</a>, 
            <a>57</a></span>. This positive feedback is mostly relevant for the Greenland ice sheet where surface
         melting is substantial, while currently the Antarctic ice sheet hardly experiences
         it due to very low surface temperature.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The marine ice sheet instability has the potential to destabilize large ice sheet
         regions
         <span><a>58</a>–
            <a>60</a></span>. The stability of a marine ice sheet such as the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is determined
         by the position of the grounding line, i.e., the boundary between the grounded ice
         sheet and the floating ice shelf. If it is located on a bedrock sloping downward toward
         the interior of the ice sheet, an initial retreat of the grounding line, for instance
         due to basal ice melting, leads to an increase in ice discharge, which results in
         a further retreat of the grounding line inland until a new stable position is reached.
         Rapid changes in ice sheets may also be linked to the acceleration of the ice transport
         due to basal lubrication caused by meltwater penetration at the bed or to breakup
         of the ice shelves because of a weakening of the ice due to surface melting
         <span><a>61</a>, 
            <a>62</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another feedback mainly acting in the Southern Ocean is related to the interactions
         between floating ice shelves, sea ice and the surrounding ocean. A subsurface Southern
         Ocean warming leads to increased basal ice shelf melting, and the upper ocean layers
         get fresher due to the resulting cold freshwater input. This results in lower heat
         flux from the ocean interior to the surface, sea ice expansion and reduced ocean surface
         warming, providing a negative ice shelf melting sea ice feedback

            <a>64</a></span>.
