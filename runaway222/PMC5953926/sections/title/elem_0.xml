 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate of polar regions is highly sensitive to changes in climate forcing, but also displays large internal variability. Over recent decades, northern polar regions have warmed more than twice the global average with sea-ice decreasing trends for all months of the year, especially in late summer

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed changes in polar regions result from numerous interactions involving the atmosphere, land surfaces, ocean and sea ice. Due to the complexity of the underlying processes, we do not fully understand them. Advancing scientific understanding in polar regions is particularly challenging due to a short and incomplete observational record

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> offers a standard method to analyze such complex dynamics (Box 
  <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">1</a>). The first step is to define a simple reference system and to estimate the response of this reference system to a perturbation. In a second step, the internal dynamics processes are represented as feedbacks that are triggered by the initial response and amplify (positive feedback) or dampen (negative feedback) it.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In climate dynamics, the classical radiative feedback framework links global surface temperature changes to perturbations of Earth’s top-of-atmosphere energy budget

For instance, the magnitude of radiative feedbacks can be directly related to equilibrium climate sensitivity, commonly defined as the equilibrium global mean temperature change in response to a doubling of the CO

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As well as radiative feedbacks, other types of feedbacks affect polar regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). While analyses of radiative feedbacks in polar regions have provided clear insights into processes controlling high latitude climate change, there is much less agreement on the relative importance of non-radiative feedbacks and on the way to quantify them.

    <p>A schematic of some important radiative and non-radiative feedbacks in polar regions involving the atmosphere, the ocean, sea ice and ice sheets. TOA refers to the top of the atmosphere. Solar radiation (in yellow) and Infrared Radiation (in red) represent the shortwave (solar) and longwave (infrared) radiation exchanges. A red plus sign means that the feedback is positive, a negative blue sign corresponds to a negative feedback. Both signs are present for cloud feedbacks as both positive and negative feedbacks are occurring simultaneously and the net effect is not known. The gray line on the right represents a simplified temperature profile in polar regions for the atmosphere and the ocean, the dashed line corresponding to a strong surface inversion. Oceanic and atmospheric heat transport are mentioned but without signs as the processes involved are not restricted to polar regions and it is not clear if they could be formally expressed using a closed feedback loop</p>

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we provide an overview of key radiative and non-radiative feedbacks in polar regions, how they are currently evaluated and discuss why they are important for our understanding of polar climate change. We also propose an inclusive methodology that can be applied to quantify the influence of all those feedbacks, and eventually stimulate more systematic analyses in observational and model ensembles. Estimating the magnitude of feedbacks is essential for improving our understanding of the dynamics of polar climate and to identify the relative contribution of various processes to observed high-latitude changes. In addition, it is a powerful tool to identify the origin of model biases and to reduce the uncertainty in the response to anthropogenic forcing which is directly linked to feedbacks.</p>

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The radiative feedback framework is based on the analysis of changes to the energy balance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) caused by a perturbation. An initial perturbation to TOA radiation, 
   <span class="italic">F</span> (in W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>), is termed the ‘radiative forcing’ and is due, for instance, to a change in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO
   <sub>2</sub>) or in solar irradiance. Consider as an example the response to a positive radiative forcing resulting from an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. This will initially lead to a decrease in outgoing longwave radiation, resulting in a TOA radiative imbalance and accumulation of energy within the climate system
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" href="#CR117">117</a>
   </span>. This in turn will trigger changes in the climate, in particular a temperature increase that leads to larger emissions of infrared radiation by the Earth. Ultimately, those larger emissions will compensate for the additional energy input due to the forcing. After some time, the climate system will come into a new equilibrium characterized by higher temperatures than before the perturbation was applied.
