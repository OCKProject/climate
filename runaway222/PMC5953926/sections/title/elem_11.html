      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis and quantification of feedbacks have many potential applications. This
         is illustrated in this section by explaining how this can be used to understand the
         higher temperature changes expected in the Arctic compared to other regions, to perform
         a process-oriented evaluation of model behavior, and to reduce the uncertainty in
         projections.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, climate feedbacks are less stabilizing (i.e., feedback parameters are less
            negative or more positive) in polar regions than in the tropics. This explains the
            larger temperature changes experienced in polar regions in response to a perturbation
            (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>), a phenomenon referred to as polar amplification
            <span><a>19</a>, 
               <a>20</a>, 
               <a>23</a>, 
               <a>97</a></span>. For the climate changes projected for the 21st century, polar amplification is much
            stronger in the Arctic than in the Antarctic. In the Arctic, the large amplification
            mostly results from (1) a relatively large and positive lapse rate feedback, due to
            a different vertical distribution of the temperature change compared to the tropics;
            (2) a relatively weak negative Planck response, due to smaller blackbody emissions
            per unit warming at lower temperatures (Stefan–Boltzmann law); and (3) a large positive
            surface albedo feedback, due to the loss of high albedo snow and ice-covered surfaces,
            as well as a contribution from atmospheric heat transport (Fig. 
            <a>3a</a>). In the Antarctic, both the weak Planck response and the positive surface albedo
            feedback induce polar amplification. Warming is damped relative to the Arctic due
            to a less positive lapse rate feedback, more negative cloud feedback, and strong ocean
            heat uptake in the Southern Ocean under transient warming (Fig. 
            <a>3b</a>).

                     <span>λ</span><sub>0</sub>); the additional energetic contributions shown are the CO
                     <sub>2</sub> forcing (CO
                     <sub>2</sub>), atmospheric heat transport convergence (ΔAHT) and ocean heat uptake (ΔOHU) (see
                     method section). The feedbacks are expressed as warming contributions to the total
                     temperature change

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that if feedbacks are defined using global mean rather than local surface temperature
            change, the Planck feedback appears strongly negative in the Arctic because the local
            temperature change exceeds the local mean. Additionally, the polar amplification has
            a large seasonal cycle, displaying over the Arctic a minimum in summer and a maximum
            in fall/winter. In summer, the influence of the large positive surface albedo feedback
            is compensated by a strong oceanic heat uptake and negative cloud feedbacks while
            in fall/winter the heat released by the ocean, the contribution of lapse rate feedback
            and cloud feedbacks induce a large warming

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In polar regions, many studies have identified model strengths and weaknesses in reproducing
            observations

            that must be represented in order to consider a model realistic enough for mechanistic
            studies and projections. More generally, simple comparisons between model results
            and observations do not allow estimating the origin of model biases or their impact.
            Process-based model evaluation offers the possibility of exploring the causes of discrepancies
            more deeply, identifying the links between various variables and ultimately suggesting
            model improvements

         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate this point, we compare the ice production–entrainment feedback in three
            existing simulations for all the sectors of the Southern Ocean with estimates derived
            from observations and a reanalysis (Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). A clear link is found between the value of the feedback factor and the amplitude
            of the seasonal cycle of ice volume: since the ice production–entrainment feedback
            is negative, it tends to damp the seasonal cycle; i.e., a stronger feedback corresponds
            to a weaker seasonal cycle. The spread across simulations and Antarctic sea ice regions
            in Fig. 
            <a>4</a> stresses the large sensitivity of the feedback to the ocean properties. As many climate
            models suffer from large biases in their representation of the vertical structure
            of the Southern Ocean, they are unlikely to predict this feedback accurately. For
            instance, the overestimation of the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of sea ice volume
            in the model CCSM4 is likely related to a too weak negative feedback and improvements
            in the representation of ocean properties, in particular of temperature and salinity
            below the surface layer, would reduce this bias.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One justification of the development of the radiative feedback framework is to determine
            the processes that can explain the range of model projections for a specific scenario
            of future changes in radiative forcing. As expected, the models displaying the largest
            surface temperature changes are the ones for which the radiative feedbacks have the
            largest (most positive) values. The same approach can be applied to the non-radiative
            feedbacks investigated here as they are related to the magnitude of the response to
            any type of perturbation.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although it is better if a model is able to reproduce the observations with a bias
            that is as small as possible, it is not clear for many variables, such as the global
            mean temperature, that the response to a perturbation is a function of this bias
            <span><a>104</a></span>. In other words, there is no a priori reason to believe that a model which reproduces
            the present global mean temperature well will provide more reasonable projections
            of future climate than a model that has larger biases. Indeed, a model may have a
            global mean temperature close to observations due to compensations between many factors
            that may not necessarily balance in a projected climate
            <span><a>105</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The situation is distinctive for polar regions, where the feedbacks are strongly non-linear
            and thus state dependent. This provides an instructive way to interpret the range
            of model responses as a function of the value of some variables for present-day conditions
            <span><a>106</a>, 
               <a>107</a></span>. Furthermore, it has been argued that a model displaying a more realistic mean state
            in polar regions will also have a better representation of key processes and thus
            will provide a more likely estimate of future climate changes than a model with larger
            biases. This has then been used to justify the selection of models based on their
            mean state
            <span><a>108</a>, 
               <a>109</a></span>. This idea appears useful in principle but is hard to generalize and is subject to
            criticism. In particular, it is not always clear to determine how to evaluate models,
            which variable should be used to select models, and if the currently available model
            sample is adequate to apply a meaningful selection. This has led to strong debate
            in the community about the justification of this approach, which may artificially
            reduce the uncertainty range by discarding model results that are as likely as the
            others
            <span><a>110</a></span>. We propose to use feedback quantification more extensively to evaluate model behavior,
            and foresee that this can contribute to more robust estimates of the likelihood of
            projections.
