      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temperature feedback represents the changes in infrared (longwave) radiative fluxes
         due to changes in surface and tropospheric temperatures (Table 
         <a>1</a>). It can be decomposed into a Planck feedback due to radiation changes caused by
         vertically uniform warming of the surface and troposphere and a lapse rate feedback
         due to vertically non-uniform warming
         <span><a>17</a></span>. The negative Planck feedback is the climate system’s basic response to forcing that
         drives the system to a new equilibrium temperature. Due to the dependence of blackbody
         radiation on temperature, the Planck feedback, or in other words the increase in outgoing
         longwave radiation per unit of local warming, is less negative in polar regions than
         at lower latitudes
         <span><a>18</a></span>. While the lapse rate feedback is negative in the tropics, it is often positive in
         polar regions because stable stratification, especially in non-summer months, suppresses
         vertical mixing and warming remains largely confined to a thin near-surface layer

         can increase humidity in the lower atmosphere and increase low-level clouds. During
         polar night, increasing low cloud increases downwelling longwave radiation, leading
         to further sea ice loss and thus to a positive feedback. Observational evidence shows
         that this cloud-sea ice feedback operates in non-summer months in both the Arctic

            <a>39</a></span> and the Antarctic
         <span><a>41</a></span>. The cloud optical depth feedback operates both at mid- and high- latitudes. Cloud
         liquid particles are smaller than cloud ice particles, and are therefore more efficient
         at reflecting solar radiation back to space. As the climate warms, the total amount
         of cloud water in mixed phase clouds increases, which increases the amount of reflected
         solar radiation (i.e., increase the planetary albedo), acting as a negative feedback
         <span><a>32</a></span>. At the same time, the fraction of cloud water that is liquid also increases, enhancing
         the effect of this cloud optical depth feedback (Supplementary Fig.
