      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The feedback parameters provide classical measures of the magnitude of the radiative
         feedbacks (Box 
         <a>1</a>). They are defined as the change in radiative fluxes due to the impact of a change
         in surface temperature upon the variable of interest (e.g., surface albedo, water
         vapor amount, cloud cover also referred to as climate variable) and are quantified
         in W m
         <span>−2</span> K
         <span>−1</span>. The net climate feedback parameter 
         <span>λ,</span> which is equal to the sum of all the parameters for the individual feedbacks, can
         be estimated by measuring all the terms of the equation describing the global mean
         radiative balance (Eq. (
         <a>1</a>) in Box 
         <a>1</a>) or by regressing the change in radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere (TOA)
         against the global mean surface temperature change
         <span><a>82</a></span>. It is somewhat more complex to evaluate specific feedback parameters 
         <span>λ</span><sub><span>i</span></sub>, as this requires isolating the impact of each feedback variable on the Earth’s energy
         balance
         <span><a>31</a>, 
            <a>33</a>, 
            <a>83</a>–
            <a>87</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since TOA fluxes determine the total energy budget of the Earth’s climate system,
         they are a natural reference point for computing climate feedbacks at a global scale.
         They are also closely connected to surface temperature change in the Tropics, where
         deep convection leads to a vertically well-mixed atmosphere. In the Arctic, where
         deep vertical mixing is suppressed by strong static stability in the troposphere,
         computing feedback parameters based on surface fluxes can lead to important additional
         insights
         <span><a>19</a>, 
            <a>23</a>, 
            <a>55</a>, 
            <a>74</a></span>. For example, a change in clouds that raises atmospheric emissivity in the Arctic
         inversion layer can lead to increases in both upwelling and downwelling longwave radiation,
         and thus lead to energy loss and a negative cloud feedback at TOA but energy gain
         and a positive cloud feedback at the surface
         <span><a>19</a>, 
            <a>88</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual feedback parameters defined at the surface or TOA can be diagnosed using
         several different methods, including partial radiative perturbations
         <span><a>31</a></span>, the less computationally expensive approximate partial radiative perturbations
         <span><a>83</a></span>, and the even more idealized radiative kernel technique
         <span><a>85</a>, 
            <a>86</a></span>. Using this now widely used method, changes in TOA radiative fluxes due to a uniform,
         idealized perturbation in the feedback variable are first computed using a radiative
         transfer model to obtain the so-called kernel. The kernel thus only depends on the
         radiative transfer algorithm and the mean state of the system. 
         <span>λ</span><sub><span>i</span></sub> can then be derived by multiplying the kernel by the response of the feedback variable
         to changes in global mean surface temperature.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In parallel to feedback parameters, other expressions can sometimes be easier to interpret
         or be more convenient. One option is to diagnose the temperature change that can be
         attributed to each feedback explicitly, known as a warming contribution (see the methods).
         It is also instructive to compare the temperature changes due to a particular feedback
         to changes of a reference system in which the feedbacks of interest are inactive.
         In the radiative feedback framework, the reference system is traditionally chosen
         as the Planck response. The feedback factor 
         <span>γ</span><sub><span>i</span></sub> is then defined as the ratio of each feedback parameter to (minus) the Planck feedback
         
         <span>λ</span><sub><span>0</span></sub>: 
         <span>γ</span><sub><span>i</span></sub> = 
         <span>λ</span><sub><span>i</span></sub>/−
         <span>λ</span><sub>0</sub>. An advantage of this approach is that the feedback factor 
         <span>γ</span><sub><span>i</span></sub> is dimensionless because it is expressed relative to the reference system. It can
         then be used to compare the impact of very different processes, bearing in mind that
         its specific value depends on the reference system chosen
         <span><a>12</a></span>(for more details see the methods).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the approaches focused on the top of the atmosphere or the surface,
         it is possible to analyze the origin of three-dimensional temperature changes such
         as in the climate feedback response analysis method
         <span><a>89</a></span> (CFRAM). It has also been proposed to decompose the feedbacks in ways that differ
         <span><a>55</a>, 
            <a>90</a></span> from the traditional one described in Box 
         <a>1</a>. Each methodology is adapted to a special purpose but also has its own limitations.
         For instance, a three-dimensional analysis can highlight the processes that are at
         the origin of the changes at various level in the atmosphere, but it may require model
         outputs that are not routinely saved by climate modeling centers. Finally, applying
         different methods leads to different definitions of feedbacks and ultimately differing
         quantitative assessment of feedback strengths.
