         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temperature feedback represents the changes in infrared (longwave) radiative fluxes
            due to changes in surface and tropospheric temperatures (Table 
            <a>1</a>). It can be decomposed into a Planck feedback due to radiation changes caused by
            vertically uniform warming of the surface and troposphere and a lapse rate feedback
            due to vertically non-uniform warming
            <span><a>17</a></span>. The negative Planck feedback is the climate system’s basic response to forcing that
            drives the system to a new equilibrium temperature. Due to the dependence of blackbody
            radiation on temperature, the Planck feedback, or in other words the increase in outgoing
            longwave radiation per unit of local warming, is less negative in polar regions than
            at lower latitudes
            <span><a>18</a></span>. While the lapse rate feedback is negative in the tropics, it is often positive in
            polar regions because stable stratification, especially in non-summer months, suppresses
            vertical mixing and warming remains largely confined to a thin near-surface layer

            can increase humidity in the lower atmosphere and increase low-level clouds. During
            polar night, increasing low cloud increases downwelling longwave radiation, leading
            to further sea ice loss and thus to a positive feedback. Observational evidence shows
            that this cloud-sea ice feedback operates in non-summer months in both the Arctic

               <a>39</a></span> and the Antarctic
            <span><a>41</a></span>. The cloud optical depth feedback operates both at mid- and high- latitudes. Cloud
            liquid particles are smaller than cloud ice particles, and are therefore more efficient
            at reflecting solar radiation back to space. As the climate warms, the total amount
            of cloud water in mixed phase clouds increases, which increases the amount of reflected

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the magnitude of some radiative feedbacks is modulated by processes that may appear
            hidden in their overall evaluation, focused analyses have been proposed to reveal
            elements specifically related to sea ice and ocean. For instance, the surface albedo
            feedback is more efficient for thin than for thick sea ice as a similar change in
            thickness induced by a given perturbation will lead to a larger increase in the open
            water area and thus a larger change in albedo. This has led to the definition of the
            open water formation efficiency as the percent open water formation per cm of ice
            melt over the melt season
            <span><a>47</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some other feedbacks are not directly related to radiative processes. For example,
            basal sea ice growth rate is largely driven by heat conduction, which varies as the
            inverse of sea ice thickness: thin ice grows much faster than thick ice
            <span><a>48</a></span>. At the same time, sea ice melt rate is nearly independent of ice thickness. This
            leads to the negative ice growth-thickness feedback. When a positive radiative perturbation
            is applied to the sea ice surface energy balance leading to an initial ice thinning,
            ice formation in winter is enhanced so that the ice adjusts its thickness to match
            the new growth rates to the new melting rates
            <span><a>49</a></span>, resulting in a new equilibrium for the sea ice thickness. As the thermal insulation
            power of snow is even more efficient than that of sea ice, its influence on the ice
            growth-thickness feedback is important, but not fully quantified due to the complex
            relationship between snow depth and sea-ice thickness
            <span><a>30</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of the large heat fluxes at the ocean–ice interface in the Southern Ocean,
            feedback analyses there have often focused on the interactions between ocean and sea
            ice. In the ice-covered parts of the Southern Ocean, the stability of the upper water
            column is controlled by salinity, with the ocean temperature and salinity increasing
            with depth below the surface mixed layer (the ocean layer that has a nearly homogeneous
            density). In winter, when brine is released by sea ice formation, surface mixed layer
            density increases, inducing a mixed layer deepening and the entrainment of relatively
            warm water into the surface oceanic layer. This warm water reduces ice formation and
            can even melt ice, which partly compensates for the initial ice formation, leading
            to a negative ice production–entrainment feedback
            <span><a>50</a>, 
               <a>51</a></span></p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ice production–entrainment feedback is acting at the seasonal scale but the magnitude
            of the ice–ocean flux can also be modulated at inter-annual to decadal timescales,
            leading to the positive ice production heat-storage feedback
            <span><a>52</a>, 
               <a>53</a></span>. If ice production is very large during a particular year, the mixed layer will be
            deeper and the salt released by ice formation will be distributed over a larger depth
            range. In summer, the mixing is weaker and the freshwater input due to ice melting
            will be spread over a shallower layer, leading to a net downward vertical salt transport.
            This can restrain the vertical exchanges in the water column the subsequent winter,
            leading to less heat transfer to the surface and more heat storage at depth. Finally,
            the weaker heat flux at the ice–ocean interface would favor additional ice formation,
            leading to a positive feedback amplifying the initial perturbation. The heat storage
            at depth can also be reinforced by a net freshwater input at the surface (due for
            instance to a net transport of sea ice to the region) that further stabilizes the
            water column.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At low and mid-latitudes, a drying of the soils in response to an initial temperature
            rise can amplify the warming as the evapotranspiration that normally cools the surface
            is reduced
            <span><a>54</a></span>. This positive soil moisture–temperature feedback is less active at high latitudes
            but, despite the low temperatures, evapotranspiration strongly contributes to moderate
            the summer warming over land

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ice sheets, glaciers and snow cover over land provide key components to the surface
            albedo feedback
            <span><a>25</a>–
               <a>28</a></span>. They also give rise to a number of specific feedback mechanisms. Three important
            ones are discussed here. Compared to the feedbacks mainly involving the atmosphere
            and sea ice, ice sheets generally, but not exclusively, play a role on longer time
            scales. In the positive surface mass balance–elevation feedback, increased air temperature
            leads to ice melting, which lowers the surface elevation of the ice sheet, exposing
            the ice to warmer air temperatures and thus further melting
            <span><a>56</a>, 
               <a>57</a></span>. This positive feedback is mostly relevant for the Greenland ice sheet where surface
            melting is substantial, while currently the Antarctic ice sheet hardly experiences
            it due to very low surface temperature.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The marine ice sheet instability has the potential to destabilize large ice sheet
            regions
            <span><a>58</a>–
               <a>60</a></span>. The stability of a marine ice sheet such as the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is determined
            by the position of the grounding line, i.e., the boundary between the grounded ice
            sheet and the floating ice shelf. If it is located on a bedrock sloping downward toward
            the interior of the ice sheet, an initial retreat of the grounding line, for instance
            due to basal ice melting, leads to an increase in ice discharge, which results in
            a further retreat of the grounding line inland until a new stable position is reached.
            Rapid changes in ice sheets may also be linked to the acceleration of the ice transport
            due to basal lubrication caused by meltwater penetration at the bed or to breakup
            of the ice shelves because of a weakening of the ice due to surface melting
            <span><a>61</a>,

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another feedback mainly acting in the Southern Ocean is related to the interactions
            between floating ice shelves, sea ice and the surrounding ocean. A subsurface Southern
            Ocean warming leads to increased basal ice shelf melting, and the upper ocean layers
            get fresher due to the resulting cold freshwater input. This results in lower heat
            flux from the ocean interior to the surface, sea ice expansion and reduced ocean surface
            warming, providing a negative ice shelf melting sea ice feedback

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While this Perspective focuses on feedbacks that act through physical processes in
            polar regions (Table 
            <a>1</a>, Fig. 
            <a>1</a>), we should mention that many other feedback processes exist, some of which involve
            biological processes and biogeochemical cycles
            <span><a>65</a>–
               <a>68</a></span>. One example is the bio-optical feedback, which occurs when climate warming and sea
            ice retreat in the Arctic Ocean lead to intense phytoplankton blooms
            <span><a>69</a></span>. These blooms trap the penetrating solar heat flux at the ocean surface, which increases
            sea surface temperature. As a result, sea ice concentration decreases, which leads
            to enhanced absorption of solar energy into the ocean and further warming of the Arctic
            <span><a>70</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The response to a perturbation also implies a redistribution of the energy between
            different latitudes. First, the warming of the tropics under greenhouse gas forcing
            leads to enhanced poleward energy transport by the atmospheric circulation to higher
            latitudes, contributing to warming there
            <span><a>71</a>–
               <a>75</a></span>. This indicates a coupling between radiative feedbacks and atmospheric heat transport
            <span><a>74</a>, 
               <a>76</a>, 
               <a>77</a></span>. Moreover, radiative feedbacks at low latitudes may influence polar warming through
            their effect on poleward energy transport, while changes in polar regions may affect
            dynamics in the lower latitudes
            <span><a>78</a></span>. This is an area of ongoing research, and it is not yet clear if the response of
            the system has a direct impact on the original perturbation itself such that a closed
            feedback loop can be identified.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, the ocean heat transport has been found to strongly shape polar climate change,
            with increased poleward heat transport into the Arctic
            <span><a>79</a>–
               <a>81</a></span> and decreased poleward heat transport into the Southern Ocean
            <span><a>4</a>, 
               <a>79</a></span> under global warming. Here too, it is unclear whether these changes can be represented
            in terms of a closed feedback loop (e.g., sea ice thinning enhancing ocean heat transport
            into the Arctic
            <span><a>81</a></span>) or should be classified as important drivers of polar climate change that cannot
            be expressed within a feedback framework.
