 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While this Perspective focuses on feedbacks that act through physical processes in polar regions (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), we should mention that many other feedback processes exist, some of which involve biological processes and biogeochemical cycles

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
  </span>. One example is the bio-optical feedback, which occurs when climate warming and sea ice retreat in the Arctic Ocean lead to intense phytoplankton blooms
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>
  </span>. These blooms trap the penetrating solar heat flux at the ocean surface, which increases sea surface temperature. As a result, sea ice concentration decreases, which leads to enhanced absorption of solar energy into the ocean and further warming of the Arctic

  </span>.

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The response to a perturbation also implies a redistribution of the energy between different latitudes. First, the warming of the tropics under greenhouse gas forcing leads to enhanced poleward energy transport by the atmospheric circulation to higher latitudes, contributing to warming there
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">75</a>
  </span>. This indicates a coupling between radiative feedbacks and atmospheric heat transport
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>
  </span>. Moreover, radiative feedbacks at low latitudes may influence polar warming through their effect on poleward energy transport, while changes in polar regions may affect dynamics in the lower latitudes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>
  </span>. This is an area of ongoing research, and it is not yet clear if the response of the system has a direct impact on the original perturbation itself such that a closed feedback loop can be identified.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, the ocean heat transport has been found to strongly shape polar climate change, with increased poleward heat transport into the Arctic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>
  </span> and decreased poleward heat transport into the Southern Ocean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>
  </span> under global warming. Here too, it is unclear whether these changes can be represented in terms of a closed feedback loop (e.g., sea ice thinning enhancing ocean heat transport into the Arctic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>
  </span>) or should be classified as important drivers of polar climate change that cannot be expressed within a feedback framework.
