 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, climate feedbacks are less stabilizing (i.e., feedback parameters are less negative or more positive) in polar regions than in the tropics. This explains the larger temperature changes experienced in polar regions in response to a perturbation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), a phenomenon referred to as polar amplification

  </span>. For the climate changes projected for the 21st century, polar amplification is much stronger in the Arctic than in the Antarctic. In the Arctic, the large amplification mostly results from (1) a relatively large and positive lapse rate feedback, due to a different vertical distribution of the temperature change compared to the tropics; (2) a relatively weak negative Planck response, due to smaller blackbody emissions per unit warming at lower temperatures (Stefan–Boltzmann law); and (3) a large positive surface albedo feedback, due to the loss of high albedo snow and ice-covered surfaces, as well as a contribution from atmospheric heat transport (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). In the Antarctic, both the weak Planck response and the positive surface albedo feedback induce polar amplification. Warming is damped relative to the Arctic due to a less positive lapse rate feedback, more negative cloud feedback, and strong ocean heat uptake in the Southern Ocean under transient warming (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>).

 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that if feedbacks are defined using global mean rather than local surface temperature change, the Planck feedback appears strongly negative in the Arctic because the local temperature change exceeds the local mean. Additionally, the polar amplification has a large seasonal cycle, displaying over the Arctic a minimum in summer and a maximum in fall/winter. In summer, the influence of the large positive surface albedo feedback is compensated by a strong oceanic heat uptake and negative cloud feedbacks while in fall/winter the heat released by the ocean, the contribution of lapse rate feedback and cloud feedbacks induce a large warming
