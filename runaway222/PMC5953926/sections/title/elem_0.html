      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate of polar regions is highly sensitive to changes in climate forcing, but
         also displays large internal variability. Over recent decades, northern polar regions
         have warmed more than twice the global average with sea-ice decreasing trends for
         all months of the year, especially in late summer
         <span><a>1</a>–
            <a>3</a></span>. In contrast, the southern polar regions have warmed less rapidly with some regions
         experiencing cooling and sea ice advance and others experiencing warming and sea ice
         loss
         <span><a>4</a>–
            <a>6</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed changes in polar regions result from numerous interactions involving the
         atmosphere, land surfaces, ocean and sea ice. Due to the complexity of the underlying
         processes, we do not fully understand them. Advancing scientific understanding in
         polar regions is particularly challenging due to a short and incomplete observational
         record
         <span><a>5</a>, 
            <a>6</a></span>, large internal climate variability
         <span><a>6</a>–
            <a>9</a></span> and the large biases of climate models in these regions

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The feedback framework
         <span><a>11</a>, 
            <a>12</a></span> offers a standard method to analyze such complex dynamics (Box 
         <a>1</a>). The first step is to define a simple reference system and to estimate the response
         of this reference system to a perturbation. In a second step, the internal dynamics
         processes are represented as feedbacks that are triggered by the initial response
         and amplify (positive feedback) or dampen (negative feedback) it.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In climate dynamics, the classical radiative feedback framework links global surface
         temperature changes to perturbations of Earth’s top-of-atmosphere energy budget
         <span><a>12</a>–
            <a>16</a></span> and serves as a critical tool for quantifying climate response to greenhouse gas
         forcing. For instance, the magnitude of radiative feedbacks can be directly related
         to equilibrium climate sensitivity, commonly defined as the equilibrium global mean
         temperature change in response to a doubling of the CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere
         <span><a>12</a>–
            <a>16</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As well as radiative feedbacks, other types of feedbacks affect polar regions (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). While analyses of radiative feedbacks in polar regions have provided clear insights
         into processes controlling high latitude climate change, there is much less agreement
         on the relative importance of non-radiative feedbacks and on the way to quantify them.

               <p>A schematic of some important radiative and non-radiative feedbacks in polar regions
                  involving the atmosphere, the ocean, sea ice and ice sheets. TOA refers to the top
                  of the atmosphere. Solar radiation (in yellow) and Infrared Radiation (in red) represent
                  the shortwave (solar) and longwave (infrared) radiation exchanges. A red plus sign
                  means that the feedback is positive, a negative blue sign corresponds to a negative
                  feedback. Both signs are present for cloud feedbacks as both positive and negative
                  feedbacks are occurring simultaneously and the net effect is not known. The gray line
                  on the right represents a simplified temperature profile in polar regions for the
                  atmosphere and the ocean, the dashed line corresponding to a strong surface inversion.
                  Oceanic and atmospheric heat transport are mentioned but without signs as the processes
                  involved are not restricted to polar regions and it is not clear if they could be
                  formally expressed using a closed feedback loop

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we provide an overview of key radiative and non-radiative feedbacks in polar
         regions, how they are currently evaluated and discuss why they are important for our
         understanding of polar climate change. We also propose an inclusive methodology that
         can be applied to quantify the influence of all those feedbacks, and eventually stimulate
         more systematic analyses in observational and model ensembles. Estimating the magnitude
         of feedbacks is essential for improving our understanding of the dynamics of polar
         climate and to identify the relative contribution of various processes to observed
         high-latitude changes. In addition, it is a powerful tool to identify the origin of
         model biases and to reduce the uncertainty in the response to anthropogenic forcing
         which is directly linked to feedbacks.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The radiative feedback framework is based on the analysis of changes to the energy
            balance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) caused by a perturbation. An initial perturbation
            to TOA radiation, 
            <span>F</span> (in W m
            <span>−2</span>), is termed the ‘radiative forcing’ and is due, for instance, to a change in the
            atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO
            <sub>2</sub>) or in solar irradiance. Consider as an example the response to a positive radiative
            forcing resulting from an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. This will initially
            lead to a decrease in outgoing longwave radiation, resulting in a TOA radiative imbalance
            and accumulation of energy within the climate system
            <span><a>117</a></span>. This in turn will trigger changes in the climate, in particular a temperature increase
            that leads to larger emissions of infrared radiation by the Earth. Ultimately, those
            larger emissions will compensate for the additional energy input due to the forcing.
            After some time, the climate system will come into a new equilibrium characterized
            by higher temperatures than before the perturbation was applied.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When studying the energy budget of the whole Earth, it is convenient to assume that
            the modification of the radiative fluxes emitted by the Earth is proportional to changes
            in global mean surface temperature 
            <span>T</span><sub>s</sub> (in K). The imbalance of the energy budget at the TOA averaged over the whole Earth

            <span>λ</span> is negative for a stable climate and a larger absolute value corresponds to a less

            At equilibrium, when by definition the heat budget is balanced at the TOA (i.e., Δ

            in response to a doubling of the CO

            <span>F</span> of roughly 3.7 W m
            <span>−2</span>, is thus equal to −3.7/
