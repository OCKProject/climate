  <p>Evolution of the ice production-entrainment feedback factor as a function of ice production. For each value of ice production, the entrainment is computed from the January–February 1990–2005 mean temperature and salinity profiles

It is shown here for a Weddell Sea location typically covered by ice in winter (near 30°W, 65°S). The strength of the pycnocline is thus evaluated in summer but it must be measured below the layer close to the surface that is warmed above freezing point temperature if sea ice completely melts, as the heat in this layer is removed quickly in fall when the temperature drops and is not involved in the ice production-ocean entrainment feedback
