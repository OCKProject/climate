         <p>Evolution of the ice production-entrainment feedback factor as a function of ice production.
            For each value of ice production, the entrainment is computed from the January–February
            1990–2005 mean temperature and salinity profiles
            <span><a>115</a></span> assuming a mixed layer deepening restoring the static stability of the water column
            after the brine release. It is shown here for a Weddell Sea location typically covered
            by ice in winter (near 30°W, 65°S). The strength of the pycnocline is thus evaluated
            in summer but it must be measured below the layer close to the surface that is warmed
            above freezing point temperature if sea ice completely melts, as the heat in this
            layer is removed quickly in fall when the temperature drops and is not involved in
            the ice production-ocean entrainment feedback
