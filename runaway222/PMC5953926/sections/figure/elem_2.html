            <sub>2</sub> quadrupling in climate models involved in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
            Project (CMIP5). The feedbacks shown are the lapse rate (LR), surface albedo (A),
            water vapor (WV), cloud (C), and latitudinal variation in the Planck response (P’,
            local difference from its global-mean value 
            <span>λ</span><sub>0</sub>); the additional energetic contributions shown are the CO
            <sub>2</sub> forcing (CO
            <sub>2</sub>), atmospheric heat transport convergence (ΔAHT) and ocean heat uptake (ΔOHU) (see
            method section). The feedbacks are expressed as warming contributions to the total
            temperature change
