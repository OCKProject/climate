 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To use an EBP code, a therapist documents their practice in two places within routine notes. Documentation occurs first in Treatment Plans and then in the Progress Note for individual sessions. The two levels of documentation are expected to establish that the provider is aware of the essential or most active clinical elements of a treatment family while also being allowed to use a broader list of common elements in any individual treatment session. The Guides require that the provider indicate the treatment family or proprietary EBP program and the intention to use at least one essential element in the proposed course of treatment. After indicating intent to use an essential element in the treatment plan, the provider is free to use any allowable elements in the individual treatment sessions.</p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential and allowable elements differ from each other by (1) how often they are included in empirically supported treatments and (2) as how unique they are across treatment families. The development team identified these components by first examining the 2005 and 2009 core component reviews conducted by Chorpita et al. and Chorpita and Daleidan to identify all components present in 50% of programs found to be effective under each treatment family [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. This comprised the first working list of allowable elements that could be used in progress note documentation. We then took components present in 80–100% of effective programs as our first pool of essential elements. From this pool, we removed elements that were present in all or most treatment families (e.g., psychoeducation), retaining elements that defined the treatment family in unique clinical approach (e.g., exposure). The resulting lists were reviewed internally and externally by two PhD level psychologists and two Master’s level therapists trained in evidence-based models of child and adolescent psychotherapy. To support user-friendly language, we cross-walked the components pulled from the Chorpita and Daleiden papers with the common elements used in a widely disseminated common element-based training in Washington State [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. The final guidelines provide specific wording for documenting use in treatment plans and progress notes. This wording reflects the crosswalk from an EBP, the associated treatment family, and the clinical elements used in the specific session.

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The practical directives provided in the Reporting Guides reflect the policy mandate to count the state’s investment in EBPs while also reciprocally influencing the implementation ecology. In adopting a definition of EBP that reflected the need to count practices, the Guides have subsequently shifted site level practices that are influencing the inner and intervention levels as described below.</p>
