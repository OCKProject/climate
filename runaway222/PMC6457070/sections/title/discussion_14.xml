 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As advocates attempt to make EBP synonymous with “value” in system-level monitoring, there is a significant need to identify and validate low-burden, high yield indicators of provider quality and effectiveness. In Washington State, we began with a systems-level perspective, working from the assumption that few if any additional resources would be available to monitor the use of EBP using external experts. As the state was already requesting that EBP be reported through session-level codes, and billing codes are already subject to potential auditing for quality, our organization focused on defining the requirements for EBP reporting and the standards for EBP documentation in routine treatment plans and progress notes. This requires minimal upfront training on how to document practice. All other reporting functions are integrated into existing, routine procedures. Integrating this reporting into routine documentation, if reporting is found to be valid, presents some significant advantages. First, EBP use is reported per session and provides a granular source of information about actual practices being used in session. Using this method, it is possible to calculate the number of sessions that used either proprietary EBPs or clinical practices within a treatment family for individual therapists, between therapists, between agencies and for the healthcare system overall. Second, the instructions for reporting EBP orients therapists to the common elements of practice and is expected to operate as a quasi-clinical guide for reducing drift away from the most active clinical elements of treatment. Third, the integration into routine auditing and reporting is expected to help move the concept of EBP away from its status as a specialty service and become an expected part of routine quality service provision. This is a systems-level shift that requires coordination at the systems level between auditing, billing, contracting and EBP liaisons. It also requires flexibility in defining and monitoring EBP that is achieved through a focus on clinical elements as the primary focus of service monitoring.</p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The monitoring of fidelity to EBP practice in large healthcare systems is a large challenge that is frustrating attempts to achieve a system-level shift towards routine EBP use [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. The fidelity gold standard of external observation and review is widely understood to be feasible only in systems in which EBPs are viewed as specialty, “add on,” programs within the wider system of care [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. Costs and time make this approach impractical for large scale use. While lower cost alternatives are being tested in research trials through self-report tools, [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>] and simulated sessions via behavioral rehearsal, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>] these approaches still require additional time of therapists and/or expert consultation costs and will face similar funding and implementation challenges if proposed for system-level use. The direct measurement of client outcomes, i.e., measurement-based care, is another proposed strategy for monitoring value in children’s mental health [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. This approach offers value in directly measuring the theoretical benefit of EBP via client improvement but will also need substantive infrastructure and culture shifts to implement [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Another emerging approach to monitoring value that hold promise for large scale quality monitoring is automated fidelity review through natural language processing software developed to recognize behavioral codes in psychotherapy sessions. While initial results are promising for recognizing behavioral codes, the technology is still being validated, will likely require some level of final expert review (albeit more limited), and is currently only available for nonspecific therapeutic factors (e.g., empathy, listening). This may provide a promising model of automated quality review for the future as a complement or substitute for documented or externally reviewed practice.

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As noted in two articles on the Distillation and Matching Model, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>] the emergence of specific protocols (e.g., Coping Cat) as the optimal unit of research analysis for evidence-based mental health advancement rather than treatment families (e.g., Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety) is a historical artifact, resulting from the field’s interest in demonstrating the benefits of specific therapeutic approaches against the claims that “therapy” as a broad approach was ineffective [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]. Subsequent studies focused on tightly controlled protocols to ensure fidelity and generate confidence in findings [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>]. As these protocols began to be implemented in real world settings, the focus on fidelity to the manualized structure remained a safeguard against drift into “usual care.” However, a number of researchers have noted the problems with limiting the definition of EBP to these proprietary programs. Tested programs are often limited to a specific presenting symptom (e.g., anxiety) which means that clinicians must be trained and supervised on multiple manuals if attempting to use EBP with all clients. Further, many clients present with complex symptoms, and clinicians must be facile with knowing and using multiple EBPs in order to develop good case plans [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. Finally, the concept of EBP itself presents an implementation barrier for some sites that could likely be otherwise engaged by component-based approaches that allow for local adaptation and ownership [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. Using the clinical treatment families and common elements framework, the Reporting Guides establishes specific criteria for eligible training, consultation, and documentation (treatment plan, progress notes) for programs that fall within these groups.

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the approach to monitoring EBP practice through therapist attestation and billing codes presents a number of questions about whether this type of reporting guidance increases accurate reporting compared to an external certification approach. Most significantly, there is insufficient guidance from the research literature regarding the minimally necessary consultation or supervisory supports for “good enough” practice, as most research studies are focused on comparative benefit between conditions and not whether care meets an acceptable level of quality. The literature is clear that ongoing expert consultation will significantly increase the quality of care, but as healthcare systems and states determine how to allocate scarce resources, it is also critical to know how much infrastructure will be needed for achieving quality care on a large scale. As the literature evolves, states will be in a better position to determine whether training and consultation requirements should vary by the complexity of the intervention, possibly defined as interventions developed for complex or more intense treatment needs. Building the infrastructure for communicating and translating new findings from the intervention and implementation literature, illustrated here by the Reporting Guides as one example, will accelerate the translation effort from research to policy and to practice.</p>
