 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concept of clinical treatment families is central to the organization and documentation requirements in the Reporting Guides. The concept of treatment families is promoted by influential scientific groups attempting to develop frameworks to support more rapid synthesis and translation of psychosocial intervention science [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. A treatment family encompasses programs that share a theory of change and practice elements. It is a method of synthesizing intervention science to unpack the black box of single intervention studies. Using treatment families can help create a shared language amongst agencies and providers and clarify how specific practice elements are being used to address specific clinical needs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>].

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chorpita et al. were the first to attempt a large scale disaggregation of the clinical components of child and youth psychotherapy across multiple evidence-based programs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Updated in 2009, the 
  <span class="italic">Distillation and Matching Model</span>, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>] was designed to provide a detailed description of common clinical strategies as they occurred in families of treatments identified by the intended area of clinical need (e.g., anxiety, externalizing behavior). In their formulation, a practice element is a discrete clinical technique (e.g., relaxation, time out) as part of a larger intervention. Practice elements were coded directly from over 200 controlled trials in which the tested program was superior to the control. Definitions of elements were informed by practice experts and showed an acceptable inter-rater reliability (k = .76) [

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A related effort is being led by the Society for Behavioral Medicine Interest Group (SIG) and the Theories and Techniques of Behavior Change SIG [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. This effort is developing an 
  <span class="italic">ontology¸</span> or common language, for behavioral change across health sciences. Modeled off the Human Genome project (i.e., the Gene Ontology), the effort aims to develop a taxonomy of controlled vocabulary related to behavior change principles and outcomes to facilitate the sharing of knowledge across studies. This is intended to result in hierarchical structures of classes in which, for example, the class of “Goals and planning” might include multiple behavioral indicators such as “Goal setting behavior,” which itself is made up of lower level components such as “setting a goal in an appropriate time frame.” Coding intervention studies and results using a common ontology could result in more rapidly synthesized results for developing new interventions and policy approaches to support implementation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to providing conceptual clarity, a common elements framework may also support better clinical practice. As 
  <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> adaptation of programs is the norm following training and consultation, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>] an orientation to the theory of change and empirical support for discrete elements in protocols may prevent fidelity drift. For example, a study of therapist practices after receiving significant training and supervisory support for a clinical trial found that therapists were infrequently using the most effective components of CBT for anxiety (exposure) and depression [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. This common elements approach is also advocated in the Institute of Medicine, Committee on Developing Evidence-Based Standards for Psychosocial Interventions for Mental Disorders [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. In this monograph, the committee recommends using a common language approach to clearly communicate about the components of programs in order to reduce confusion about what practices are effective and in what contexts they are effective [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of select EBP practice elements appears to overcome frequently cited concerns about EBPs being too rigid and failing to meet the complex needs of families in the real world [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. Providers may be more amenable to adoption of EBPs if these treatments are broken down into specific practice elements in order to provide more flexibility, gain the ability to retain clinical judgment and maintain an individualized approach when treating patients.
