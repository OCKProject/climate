 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nearly 40% of children will experience a psychiatric disorder before age 18 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>] and medical costs for children’s mental health are one of the top five most expensive healthcare services in the US [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. The extent of population mental health need and expense is a significant public health issue; however data on the use of effective mental health treatment and outcomes is nearly nonexistent. The limited available data suggests that tested psychosocial treatments, e.g., evidence-based practices (EBP), are sparse and may be decreasing [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>] despite considerable efforts in multiple states to invest and promote these services [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. Among multiple barriers to utilization is the difficulty of paying for the training, consultation and fidelity monitoring packages involved in implementation. While some states have had significant success in funding specialized services, no public mental health system has succeeded in establishing EBP as an expected approach of routine clinical care statewide. Achieving this will require innovative approaches in treatment development, organizational strategies and policy climates supportive of learning approaches to performance monitoring and funding [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The barriers involved in instituting evidence-based practices across large service systems are complex and well-documented. These include low political will, concerns about cultural responsiveness, funding challenges, lack of emphasis in graduate training, high workforce turnover in public mental health, and limited organizational capacity to adopt innovations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. In their paper describing New York State’s approach to scaling up EBPs, Hoagwood et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>] describes the costs of implementing EBPs to fidelity as “enormous” and recommends that state level efforts also support policy and organizational strategies as a complement to direct training and consultation initiatives [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Current implementation science frameworks tend to describe the policy context, or ecology, as a dimension that can support or impose research-based products, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>] recognizing the powerful role policy plays in creating a funding and regulatory environment that can spur the adoption of EBPs. This may include setting mandates, providing incentives, and directly funding education, training and consultation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. In this paper we use a case study approach to describe how a legislative agenda created a series of cascading effects on multiple levels of the implementation ecology. We argue that a key catalyst for turning legislative intent into meaningful impact was the creation of a system to track EBP delivery statewide. We discuss the potential of this approach for performance monitoring and allocating enhanced payments for value-based care.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implementation frameworks</div>
  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In their 2008 paper, 
   <span class="italic">Towards a policy ecology of implementation of evidence</span>-
   <span class="italic">based practices in public mental health settings</span>, Ragahavan, Bright and Shadoin note that focusing on mandating EBP use or narrowly focusing on individual change within organizations is unlikely to result to broad and sustainable EBP uptake (pg. 26) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. To encourage a focus on the systems governing innovation, their proposed framework suggests four levels of intervention at the policy level: Provider organization, Regulatory or purchaser agency, Political and Social. The authors outline strategies that can be taken at each level to promote EBP which include, among others, flexible and enhanced reimbursement, prior authorization, mental health parity and anti-stigma campaigns. A particularly useful contribution of this framework is the recognition that policy level implementation strategies are likely to be highly idiosyncratic. As implementation moves towards the outer level, the number of factors that must be incorporated into a successful strategy quickly expands. This complexity is highlighted, for example, in Powell et al’s 2016 paper describing the City of Philadelphia’s multi-pronged effort to influence the outer context of implementation [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. This effort involved a number of strategies at every level of policymaking each of which was also tailored to the practice, funding and political realities of the local context. Given this complexity, it is unsurprising that efforts to study and influence implementation from the policy level are less well represented in the implementation literature.
  </p>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More comprehensive implementation frameworks are helpful in guiding and understanding the impact of these policy level strategies. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), for example, is a well-known model that provides a useful taxonomy outlining the levels of implementation, including policy, that influence uptake and sustainability of new practices. The framework was proposed in 2009 as an updated synthesis of healthcare implementation and innovation diffusion models and comprises five major domains: the intervention, the inner and outer setting, the individuals involved and the process of implementation. These levels echo previous work characterizing the importance of the context of implementation, characteristics of the intervention and the process of implementation for managing organizational change [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. For our purposes, the CFIR was a helpful framework for organizing the hypothesized effects of the Washington State strategy on multiple layers of the implementation ecology as will be described in more detail below.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence-based policymaking</div>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another area that provides context for the effort in Washington State is the literature on use of research in policy. As described in an influential text on evidence-based policymaking, researchers who attempt to bridge the research to policy gap as intermediaries “see policymakers as their primary clients. In addition to producing knowledge, they also see their role as translating extant research and analysis in ways that enhance their utility for those doing public policy” [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Similarly, a report by the National Research Council, Committee on the Use of Social Science Knowledge in Public Policy, [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>] noted the evolution of evidence-based policymaking over the last 40 years, which has shifted from providing education, technical assistance and list-making to active engagement in shaping the decision-making climate.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is important because it highlights the need for adaptability and a greater emphasis on what Damschroder et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>] described as the core elements vs. adaptable periphery of studied interventions at all levels (intervention, implementation and policy). As the scholarship on research and policy notes, research is only one source of information amongst many other competing demands, including constituent or leadership priorities, capacity to reform, the cost–benefit of change and political will [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. To maintain focus and political will for the use of research in policymaking, brokers of this process need to actively synthesize and interpret research findings so core features are preserved in adaptations. Developing policy strategy to support the end goal of a client receiving a service that can be reasonably defined as “evidence-based” will necessarily involve conversations about how evidence-based is defined [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>] as well as what monitoring infrastructure is needed to feasibly track use [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The field of implementation science recognizes the importance of the policy environment in supporting or deterring system change efforts to promote the use of evidence-based practices. While policy is highlighted in multi-layered implementation frameworks, such as the CFIR, little is known about how policy can directly influence other elements of the implementation ecology. We believe our efforts in Washington State can provide an illustrative example of how policy, organizational and intervention level effects influence each other reciprocally in this ecosystem.</p>
