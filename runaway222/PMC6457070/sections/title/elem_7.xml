 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Reporting Guides for Evidence-Based Practice for Children’s Mental Health emerged in response to the passage of HB2536 in Washington State in 2012 and now in statute as Chapter 43.20C RCW. The bill directed the three child-serving departments (mental health, juvenile justice, child welfare) to “substantially” increase investments in evidence-based practice and required each state department to submit an annual report on its investment for the subsequent 5 years. The first EBP list developed for reporting was taken from the Washington State Inventory of Evidence-based, Research-based and Promising Practices (WSIPP) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>] also developed as part of the 2012 legislation. Reporting codes were assigned to each of the programs listed on the inventory and agencies were directed to use the assigned codes to report the use of EBPs per session. At this stage of implementation, the state provided no other reporting guidance for required training, consultation or documentation.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ambiguity about the reporting requirements discouraged providers from using the codes, resulting in very low reported rates and distrust in the accuracy of data (Endler, personal communication). To address this concern, the state requested that the University of Washington-based Evidence Based Practice Institute develop quality guidelines for reporting and tracking use. The state and EBPI were faced with how to track EBPs under three conditions: (1) infrequent real world use of EBP manuals to fidelity; (2) no resources for the expert review of therapist competence on a large scale; and (3) needing to track use through a billing code tied to a unique session. Further, to address previous concerns about ambiguity, the guidelines needed to be very concrete about what constituted sufficient EBP practice. The developed method for tracking use addressed these constraints by, respectively, (1) using a treatment family and common elements ontology to justify the use of discrete clinical elements in session as reportable EBP; (2) accepting approved training and case note documentation as good enough proxies for competence; and (3) providing specific language for documentation to overcome provider concerns about the accuracy of self-report. We elaborate on the literature supporting these approaches below.</p>
 <sec id="Sec5" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Training and documenting practice as proxies for assessing use</div>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Without an external method of determining the clinician’s actual use of skills, we determined that exposure to an interactive active training would provide the first safeguard for ensuring competency. Requiring training was fairly straightforward as it is the most common method for teaching new concepts and clinical skills [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. While reading a manual or participating in a self-guided online training substantially lowers the barrier to entry for learning new materials, the effectiveness of these methods in supporting the competent use of new skills has little or mixed support in the available literature. For example, a systematic review of the effectiveness of the dissemination of printed clinical guidelines on practice did not substantively improve patient outcomes [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Having the opportunity to practice skills and receive feedback appears to increase the likelihood of skills transfer. This is supported by the general literature in medical training, with high quality simulation approaches showing the best effects in supporting clinician skills and patient outcomes [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, a complication of requiring training, and also opening the allowable training to non-proprietary, common elements-based models, is that the field lacks empirically-informed standards for length, format and post-training support. The length and format of trainings vary widely among purveyor-led EBPs. Training time among programs range from 40 h to a few days, [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>], or may be purveyed entirely through self-guided media platforms [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. The same complication applies to the length of consultation available to therapists following training, with some models requiring indefinite consultation and some not requiring or offering any. While waiting for more empirical guidance in this area [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>], we opted for not specifying any specific length of training time. Instead, the guides indicate the need for interactivity and some objective assessment of skill. Consultation requirements are left to the discretion of the training entity or proprietary program.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clinical treatment families and common elements</div>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concept of clinical treatment families is central to the organization and documentation requirements in the Reporting Guides. The concept of treatment families is promoted by influential scientific groups attempting to develop frameworks to support more rapid synthesis and translation of psychosocial intervention science [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. A treatment family encompasses programs that share a theory of change and practice elements. It is a method of synthesizing intervention science to unpack the black box of single intervention studies. Using treatment families can help create a shared language amongst agencies and providers and clarify how specific practice elements are being used to address specific clinical needs [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chorpita et al. were the first to attempt a large scale disaggregation of the clinical components of child and youth psychotherapy across multiple evidence-based programs [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Updated in 2009, the 
   <span class="italic">Distillation and Matching Model</span>, [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>] was designed to provide a detailed description of common clinical strategies as they occurred in families of treatments identified by the intended area of clinical need (e.g., anxiety, externalizing behavior). In their formulation, a practice element is a discrete clinical technique (e.g., relaxation, time out) as part of a larger intervention. Practice elements were coded directly from over 200 controlled trials in which the tested program was superior to the control. Definitions of elements were informed by practice experts and showed an acceptable inter-rater reliability (k = .76) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A related effort is being led by the Society for Behavioral Medicine Interest Group (SIG) and the Theories and Techniques of Behavior Change SIG [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. This effort is developing an 
   <span class="italic">ontology¸</span> or common language, for behavioral change across health sciences. Modeled off the Human Genome project (i.e., the Gene Ontology), the effort aims to develop a taxonomy of controlled vocabulary related to behavior change principles and outcomes to facilitate the sharing of knowledge across studies. This is intended to result in hierarchical structures of classes in which, for example, the class of “Goals and planning” might include multiple behavioral indicators such as “Goal setting behavior,” which itself is made up of lower level components such as “setting a goal in an appropriate time frame.” Coding intervention studies and results using a common ontology could result in more rapidly synthesized results for developing new interventions and policy approaches to support implementation [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to providing conceptual clarity, a common elements framework may also support better clinical practice. As 
   <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> adaptation of programs is the norm following training and consultation, [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>] an orientation to the theory of change and empirical support for discrete elements in protocols may prevent fidelity drift. For example, a study of therapist practices after receiving significant training and supervisory support for a clinical trial found that therapists were infrequently using the most effective components of CBT for anxiety (exposure) and depression [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. This common elements approach is also advocated in the Institute of Medicine, Committee on Developing Evidence-Based Standards for Psychosocial Interventions for Mental Disorders [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. In this monograph, the committee recommends using a common language approach to clearly communicate about the components of programs in order to reduce confusion about what practices are effective and in what contexts they are effective [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of select EBP practice elements appears to overcome frequently cited concerns about EBPs being too rigid and failing to meet the complex needs of families in the real world [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. Providers may be more amenable to adoption of EBPs if these treatments are broken down into specific practice elements in order to provide more flexibility, gain the ability to retain clinical judgment and maintain an individualized approach when treating patients.

 <sec id="Sec7" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Guidance for documentation and self-report</div>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To use an EBP code, a therapist documents their practice in two places within routine notes. Documentation occurs first in Treatment Plans and then in the Progress Note for individual sessions. The two levels of documentation are expected to establish that the provider is aware of the essential or most active clinical elements of a treatment family while also being allowed to use a broader list of common elements in any individual treatment session. The Guides require that the provider indicate the treatment family or proprietary EBP program and the intention to use at least one essential element in the proposed course of treatment. After indicating intent to use an essential element in the treatment plan, the provider is free to use any allowable elements in the individual treatment sessions.</p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Essential and allowable elements differ from each other by (1) how often they are included in empirically supported treatments and (2) as how unique they are across treatment families. The development team identified these components by first examining the 2005 and 2009 core component reviews conducted by Chorpita et al. and Chorpita and Daleidan to identify all components present in 50% of programs found to be effective under each treatment family [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. This comprised the first working list of allowable elements that could be used in progress note documentation. We then took components present in 80–100% of effective programs as our first pool of essential elements. From this pool, we removed elements that were present in all or most treatment families (e.g., psychoeducation), retaining elements that defined the treatment family in unique clinical approach (e.g., exposure). The resulting lists were reviewed internally and externally by two PhD level psychologists and two Master’s level therapists trained in evidence-based models of child and adolescent psychotherapy. To support user-friendly language, we cross-walked the components pulled from the Chorpita and Daleiden papers with the common elements used in a widely disseminated common element-based training in Washington State [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. The final guidelines provide specific wording for documenting use in treatment plans and progress notes. This wording reflects the crosswalk from an EBP, the associated treatment family, and the clinical elements used in the specific session.
  </p>
  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The practical directives provided in the Reporting Guides reflect the policy mandate to count the state’s investment in EBPs while also reciprocally influencing the implementation ecology. In adopting a definition of EBP that reflected the need to count practices, the Guides have subsequently shifted site level practices that are influencing the inner and intervention levels as described below.</p>

 <sec id="Sec8" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intersection with multiple layers of the implementation ecology</div>
  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Washington State developed a statewide system to track EBP service delivery in support of a legislative mandate to increase use. To overcome the challenges inherent in tracking EBP at this scale, guidance for reporting made use of a treatment family, common elements framework and designated approved training entities. These decisions had reciprocal effects on the implementation climate beyond the simple intent of increasing use. Using the CFIR and Policy Ecology frameworks, we outline the observed and potential impacts of this strategy in Washington State.</p>

 <sec id="Sec9" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Outer layer</div>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All of the strategies in the policy ecology framework are in the outer layer of the CFIR. These include flexible reimbursement, regulations, contracting, data collection, and legislation (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). While the policy ecology framework does not suggest how the various activities at the policy level may be related to lower levels of the implementation ecology, the experience in Washington State suggests a series of cascading effects. Legislation requiring annual reporting of EBP use created an environment that supported EBP without specifying penalties. This signaled the state’s interest in EBP while avoiding some of the risks noted in the literature around imposed use [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. As a result, the executive branch had to develop a system to track EBPs but were not given enough funding to track use using expert review and validation. In addition, the legislative mandate to use the state inventory deferred questions about how to define EBP to in-state intermediaries (UW/EBPI and Washington State Institute of Public Policy). This allowed the intermediaries to construct solutions to address the unique circumstance of Washington State. This, in turn, allowed the intermediaries to consult with expert clinician research and trainers when devising a state tracking system that would be responsive both to policy, research and practice. Consequently, we observed a reciprocal effect between a policy and practice such that the need to devise a method of tracking EBP (data collection) influenced the subsequent definition of EBP (legislative intent).

  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CFIR inner layer describes organizational characteristics that affect implementation and organizational learning. Of the five elements in this layer, the statewide system of EBP tracking is expected to have an effect on at least two other elements: (1) Increased networks and communications, and (2) culture. Networks and communications relates to an organization’s connectedness with external sources of information and possibly innovation. In receiving the Guides, every agency and individual provider with a Medicaid contract is being exposed to the most effective programs and effective clinical elements across programs. For providers not already connected to universities or following clearinghouses, the Guides may be their sole source of exposure to evidence-based practices. The Guides are also expected to shift internal culture by providing specific language to use when documenting practices in treatment plans and notes. While efforts are underway to systematically study these changes, there is anecdotal evidence that the guides are beginning to shift supervision practices. Supervisors are reporting that they are using the Guides to shape clinical supervision practices, and in at least one medium sized community mental health agency, clinician treatment plans and notes are approved only if they conform to the Guides’ specifications (Funk, personal communication).</p>
