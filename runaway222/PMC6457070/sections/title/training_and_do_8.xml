 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Without an external method of determining the clinician’s actual use of skills, we determined that exposure to an interactive active training would provide the first safeguard for ensuring competency. Requiring training was fairly straightforward as it is the most common method for teaching new concepts and clinical skills [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. While reading a manual or participating in a self-guided online training substantially lowers the barrier to entry for learning new materials, the effectiveness of these methods in supporting the competent use of new skills has little or mixed support in the available literature. For example, a systematic review of the effectiveness of the dissemination of printed clinical guidelines on practice did not substantively improve patient outcomes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Having the opportunity to practice skills and receive feedback appears to increase the likelihood of skills transfer. This is supported by the general literature in medical training, with high quality simulation approaches showing the best effects in supporting clinician skills and patient outcomes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>].

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, a complication of requiring training, and also opening the allowable training to non-proprietary, common elements-based models, is that the field lacks empirically-informed standards for length, format and post-training support. The length and format of trainings vary widely among purveyor-led EBPs. Training time among programs range from 40 h to a few days, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>], or may be purveyed entirely through self-guided media platforms [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. The same complication applies to the length of consultation available to therapists following training, with some models requiring indefinite consultation and some not requiring or offering any. While waiting for more empirical guidance in this area [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>], we opted for not specifying any specific length of training time. Instead, the guides indicate the need for interactivity and some objective assessment of skill. Consultation requirements are left to the discretion of the training entity or proprietary program.
