 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another area that provides context for the effort in Washington State is the literature on use of research in policy. As described in an influential text on evidence-based policymaking, researchers who attempt to bridge the research to policy gap as intermediaries “see policymakers as their primary clients. In addition to producing knowledge, they also see their role as translating extant research and analysis in ways that enhance their utility for those doing public policy” [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Similarly, a report by the National Research Council, Committee on the Use of Social Science Knowledge in Public Policy, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>] noted the evolution of evidence-based policymaking over the last 40 years, which has shifted from providing education, technical assistance and list-making to active engagement in shaping the decision-making climate.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is important because it highlights the need for adaptability and a greater emphasis on what Damschroder et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>] described as the core elements vs. adaptable periphery of studied interventions at all levels (intervention, implementation and policy). As the scholarship on research and policy notes, research is only one source of information amongst many other competing demands, including constituent or leadership priorities, capacity to reform, the cost–benefit of change and political will [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. To maintain focus and political will for the use of research in policymaking, brokers of this process need to actively synthesize and interpret research findings so core features are preserved in adaptations. Developing policy strategy to support the end goal of a client receiving a service that can be reasonably defined as “evidence-based” will necessarily involve conversations about how evidence-based is defined [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>] as well as what monitoring infrastructure is needed to feasibly track use [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The field of implementation science recognizes the importance of the policy environment in supporting or deterring system change efforts to promote the use of evidence-based practices. While policy is highlighted in multi-layered implementation frameworks, such as the CFIR, little is known about how policy can directly influence other elements of the implementation ecology. We believe our efforts in Washington State can provide an illustrative example of how policy, organizational and intervention level effects influence each other reciprocally in this ecosystem.</p>
