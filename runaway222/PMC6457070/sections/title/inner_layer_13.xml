 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CFIR inner layer describes organizational characteristics that affect implementation and organizational learning. Of the five elements in this layer, the statewide system of EBP tracking is expected to have an effect on at least two other elements: (1) Increased networks and communications, and (2) culture. Networks and communications relates to an organization’s connectedness with external sources of information and possibly innovation. In receiving the Guides, every agency and individual provider with a Medicaid contract is being exposed to the most effective programs and effective clinical elements across programs. For providers not already connected to universities or following clearinghouses, the Guides may be their sole source of exposure to evidence-based practices. The Guides are also expected to shift internal culture by providing specific language to use when documenting practices in treatment plans and notes. While efforts are underway to systematically study these changes, there is anecdotal evidence that the guides are beginning to shift supervision practices. Supervisors are reporting that they are using the Guides to shape clinical supervision practices, and in at least one medium sized community mental health agency, clinician treatment plans and notes are approved only if they conform to the Guides’ specifications (Funk, personal communication).</p>
