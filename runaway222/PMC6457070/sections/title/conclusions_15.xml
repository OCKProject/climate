 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feasible methods for the widespread and direct monitoring of clinical care are a high priority for state and large payer systems grappling with how to measure value and support effective healthcare services. Psychotherapy services present a challenge for routine performance monitoring as the practices used in session are not easily captured in administrative data, and deferring assessments of quality to external consultants can be costly and removes the system from being able to make direct assessments of value. Our effort to develop a set of Reporting Guidelines for reporting EBP in routine clinical care attempts to solve some of the challenges related to providers’ willingness to attest to their practice. Some of the hoped for secondary benefits include building a common language about effective practice among actors in policy, research and treatment communities and opening the field for high quality training on common elements while continuing to support proprietary approaches. Current efforts are underway to systematically gather data on the feasibility and acceptability of the Reporting Guides and to plan for validation and implementation studies to understand how therapists’ and agencies’ clinical and documentation practices align with the assumptions in the guidelines. We plan to use this information to improve the Reporting Guides as well as inform the field about whether this approach can encourage the more rapid translation of science into practice and improve treatment outcomes for youth.</p>
