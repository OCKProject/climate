 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Washington State developed a statewide system to track EBP service delivery in support of a legislative mandate to increase use. To overcome the challenges inherent in tracking EBP at this scale, guidance for reporting made use of a treatment family, common elements framework and designated approved training entities. These decisions had reciprocal effects on the implementation climate beyond the simple intent of increasing use. Using the CFIR and Policy Ecology frameworks, we outline the observed and potential impacts of this strategy in Washington State.</p>
