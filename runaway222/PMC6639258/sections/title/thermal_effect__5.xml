 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reduction of soil thermal diffusivity by the presence of organic matter (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) leads to a stronger dampening of the seasonal-cycle amplitude along the soil depth, and thus cools the deeper soils during summer, thins the active layer thickness (ALT), and reduces microbial respiration of SOC during the thawing season. To investigate the magnitude of this SOM effect on soil temperature and SOC accumulation, we conducted two simulations of the ORCHIDEE-MICT
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span> land surface model, with (hereafter yesSOM) and without (hereafter noSOM) the impacts of SOM on soil thermo- and hydrodynamics. The SOM insulation effect in the model was implemented via SOM-dependent soil physical parameters including thermal conductivity, heat capacity, porosity and available water capacity, with detailed descriptions in ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. The inclusion of SOM effect allows the model to reproduce the relationship between SOC density and 
  <span class="italic">D</span>, and to lower 
  <span class="italic">D</span> values which are more consistent with observations than the results of noSOM (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). Peak summer-time monthly mean soil temperature decreases by about 4 °C on average at 0.8 and 1.6 m depths for the sites in permafrost region in yesSOM compared to noSOM (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>). Consequently, ALT decreases by 0.6 m averagely across the region due to the presence of SOM (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a, b</a>), and the permafrost area (ALT &lt; 3 m) increases from 10.4 in noSOM to 13.8 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in yesSOM, closer to the empirical estimate of 15.3 million km

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. The accumulation of SOC depends on both carbon input rate controlled by vegetation productivity, and carbon decomposition rate regulated by many abiotic (e.g., temperature, moisture, oxygen) and biotic factors
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. Modelled gross and net primary productivity (GPP and NPP) is generally higher in yesSOM (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12</a>), since a higher water holding capacity due to the existence of SOM
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span> can alleviate plant water stress during growing season. The relative increase of total primary productivities for the permafrost region is 8% (9.5 vs. 8.8 Pg C per year for GPP; 5.3 vs. 4.9 Pg C per year for NPP); thus, the 39% increase of SOC in yesSOM is mainly driven by the cooler summer-time soil temperature that slows down soil respiration in the model (Supplementary Discussion).
