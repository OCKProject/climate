 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thermal diffusivity (
  <span class="italic">D</span>) is a key feature in the soil thermal regime. Its parameterization in land surface models may fundamentally impact their broad-scale patterns of soil temperature and permafrost distribution. Yet, this process has been given little attention. To test this, we analyzed the outputs of the historical experiment from a set of Earth System Models (ESMs) that participated in the fifth phase of the Climate Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. As the simulated climate differs among the models, the total area of grid cells with mean annual air temperature (MAAT) less than 0 °C (A
  <sub>MAAT&lt;0</sub>) ranges from 22 to 32 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, with a standard deviation of 2.7 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). As expected, simulated near-surface permafrost area (A
  <sub>p</sub>, defined as modelled active layer thickness less than 3 m (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>), see Methods) is significantly correlated with 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>MAAT&lt;0</sub>, with a slope slightly larger than 1, which might be related to the continuity of permafrost (namely, in models with a warm bias, permafrost area is underestimated more strongly, as they miss the sub-grid discontinuous permafrost in the southern grid cells). However, the difference in MAAT among the models can only partly explain the much wider variation in 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>p</sub> across the models, with a standard variation of 7.5 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). The ratio between the two areas (
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>p</sub>/
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>MAAT&lt;0</sub>) is determined by both air-soil interface energy exchanges affected by vegetation and snow covers, and sub-surface heat transfer in the soil column affected by soil thermal properties. Here it appears to be the latter that dominates 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>p</sub>/
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>MAAT&lt;0</sub> in the CMIP5 models, since 69% of the variation in 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>p</sub>/
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>MAAT&lt;0</sub> can be explained simply by differences in simulated 
  <span class="italic">D</span> between models (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). Note that the 
  <span class="italic">D</span> values for each model are diagnosed from their outputted monthly soil temperatures after excluding the pixels where non-conductive processes are not negligible (the same treatment as the observations, see Methods).

  <sub>MAAT&lt;0</sub> among the CMIP5 models (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7b</a>). This is probably because of the following: (1) the insulation of snow occurs during winter, thus its effect on the maximum thaw depth is much smaller compared to the summer-time insulation by SOM, although the winter soil warming can be carried over to summer in regions with thick snow cover
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>; and (2) the CMIP5 models did not represent snow thermodynamics well (among these models, only CCSM4, MIROC and NorESM families used an explicit multilayer snow scheme
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>).

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, in Fig.

  <sub>MAAT&lt;0</sub> against 
  <span class="italic">D</span> from the CMIP5 models, implying that the models generally have a reasonable structure for the soil thermal regime (most of the models adopt multilayer finite difference heat conduction
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>

  <sub>p</sub>/
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <sub>MAAT&lt;0</sub> related to their biases of 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. This means that improving the parameterization of soil thermal properties should be a priority in order to capture permafrost distribution in these models. Note that most of the land models of CMIP5 ESMs did not consider the impact of SOM on soil physical properties
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>; nonetheless, modelled 
  <span class="italic">D</span> differs greatly among the models (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>), possibly due to varied parameters for soil properties, different soil texture maps, and effects of different hydrological regimes.
