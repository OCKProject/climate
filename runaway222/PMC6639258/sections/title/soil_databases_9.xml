 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to identify the dominant influential factors on 
  <span class="italic">D</span>, and considering that the soil temperature data sets do not report collocated measurements of soil properties at the Russian meteorological stations in the RHST dataset or the boreholes in the IPY dataset, we seek to extract soil information for these sites from the spatially explicit global/regional soil databases. To our knowledge, there are four such soil databases that are recent and/or widely used: HWSD
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span>; WISE30sec
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> (hereafter WISE); SoilGrids250m
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
  </span> (hereafter SoilGrids); and NCSCD
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Among them, WISE is developed based on HWSD, but includes updates on the mapping unit composition, adopts a consistent taxotransfer procedure, and provides information down to 2 m
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. We therefore used WISE instead of HWSD in this study. The SoilGrids product, unlike the other three databases that rely on soil classification maps to derive spatially explicit information, predicts soil properties using statistical methods from a list of covariates (climate, vegetation, topography, lithological units, etc), and thus can generate high-resolution maps (250 m) dependent on the resolution of input covariates
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
  </span>. However, in a pre-processing, we found that SoilGrids gives a much higher SOC stock (in kg C m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>) than other databases in most grid cells in the northern hemisphere, and gives a global total SOC storage of 2757 Pg C for 0–1 m and 4570 Pg C for 0–2 m (calculated using their 250 m resolution map). This total SOC storage is almost twice the estimate by the majority of previous studies (see a short review in ref
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>.). Therefore, we did not use SoilGrids in this study.
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared to WISE, NCSCD provides SOC stock down to 3 m, and is based on more soil samples in permafrost region than WISE
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. However, NCSCD is a regional database for the northern permafrost zones only, and does not provide other properties like soil texture and bulk density. We therefore used both databases for SOC and used WISE for other soil properties. At their highest resolution (0.012° for NCSCD and 30 arc second for WISE), we took the grid cells whose center is nearest to the coordinates of each observation site. The two databases provide different depth intervals (4 intervals down to 3 m in NCSCD, and 7 intervals down to 2 m in WISE), and we integrated their original layers into the same four depth intervals as 
  <span class="italic">D</span> values mentioned above (0–0.4, 0.4–0.8, 0.8–2, and 2–3 m), using depth-weighted averages. WISE does not provide information below 2 m, so its variables for the 4
  <span class="sup">th</span> depth interval are non-valid value in all the regression analyses.

 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the large-scale soil databases to indicate local-scale observations introduces uncertainties. To reduce this uncertainty, we compared the SOC density for the available site-depths from the two databases (Supplementary Fig.

To explore the potential multivariate relationships, we conducted a stepwise regression analysis using SOC density (from WISE and NCSCD respectively) and all the other soil properties as predictive variables. In the case of SOC from NCSCD, none of the other variables are significant in the stepwise regression to explain 
  <span class="italic">D</span> variations, namely, the addition of other properties does not increase the explanatory power compared to the log

  <span class="sup">2</span> only marginally increases from 0.35 to 0.37, and the slope of SOC
  <sub>WISE</sub> in the stepwise regression equation (−0.010) is only slightly different from that in the single-variable regression (−0.012).
