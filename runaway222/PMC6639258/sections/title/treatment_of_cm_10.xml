 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used all CMIP5 ESMs that provide access to their historical simulation (r1i1p1) on the website 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://esgf-node.ipsl.upmc.fr/search/cmip5-ipsl/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://esgf-node.ipsl.upmc.fr/search/cmip5-ipsl/</span> (accessed in July 2017) and that provide surface air temperature and vertically-resolved soil temperatures (in total 27 models). To calculate active layer thickness (ALT) of each grid cell, we firstly calculated the maximum monthly soil temperature (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>s,max</sub>) for each soil level, then took the deepest depth where 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>s,max</sub> was at or above 0 °C. If the depth of 0 °C was between two soil levels, a linear interpolation was used to locate the depth. Permafrost is defined to be present in a grid cell if ALT is less than 3 m or the deepest model soil level, following ref
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>. which gives an approximation of near-surface permafrost.

 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the simulated thermal diffusivity, the same procedure as the calculation of 
  <span class="italic">D</span> for the sites was carried out using the outputted monthly soil temperatures by each model for all land grid cells and soil layers. Specifically, the same SSE threshold of 0.34 was adopted to exclude the pixel-depth-years whose monthly soil temperature oscillations do not conform to sine-waves. Since the CMIP5 models have different (or a lack of) parameterizations for the soil freezing process
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>, their SSE values differ (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">17</a>). In general, the models that do not consider the latent heat associated with water phase change (CMCC, IPSL, and MPI families) produce sine wave-shaped monthly soil temperatures and thus have smaller SSE values (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">17</a>). Applying the SSE threshold before calculating 
  <span class="italic">D</span> values for each model could reduce the confounding effect of their different parameterizations for the freezing-induces latent heat.

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CMIP5 models have different vertical soil layers (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">18</a>), and here we only calculated the 
  <span class="italic">D</span> values for the upper 3 m, and integrated them into the same four depth intervals as the observations. Then, to compare with the observation-derived 
  <span class="italic">D</span> values at the RHST and IPY sites, the same locations (nearest grid cell center to the site coordinates) were selected for each model, thus deriving the results shown in Fig.

Note that this calculation did not account for the compaction/densification-induced increase in snow thermal conductivity that weakens its insulating effect during the late snow season, as demonstrated by the observed smaller temperature gradient (soil temperature at 20 cm depth minus air temperature) under a certain snow depth during the late snow season than that during the early season under the same snow depth
