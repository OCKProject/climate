 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study results revealed that the Persian version of HCCQ has appropriate levels of validity, simplicity, reliability and feasibility to assess the Iranian health-care system’s supportiveness for patients with type 2 diabetes.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since widely scattered Persian-speaking populations are living in different countries of West Asia, including Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan, cross-cultural validation of the HCCQ-P could be a promising recommendation for researchers across the country to assess its applicability in a wider geographical area and to compare the countries’ profiles. Application of the translated scale could also provide valid information about the mechanisms underlying the improvement of type 2 diabetes care and other chronic care in the West Asia region.</p>
