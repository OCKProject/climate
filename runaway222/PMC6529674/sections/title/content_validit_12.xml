 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantitative and qualitative content validity appraisals were performed to ensure the integrity of the HCCQ-P. In the qualitative phase, the questionnaire was checked by an expert group in terms of wording, item allocation, grammar and scaling. The CVI and CVR were calculated based on the expertsâ€™ opinions in terms of relevance, clarity and simplicity of the items in the translated scale. The CVI values for all the items were equal to or above 0.8 and the CVR value for the total scale was 0.91.</p>
