 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Health-care systems play a key role in responding to the growing problem of patients with type 2 diabetes and management of their complications.
  <a rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0001">1</a> Supporting and reinforcing patients’ role, especially in self-care, could lead to better disease-specific clinical outcomes, such as low Hb
  <sub>A1c</sub> levels.
  <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">2</a> Thus, a productive relationship between patients and health-care providers (HCPs) is an indispensable component of effective care provision in type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Type 2 diabetes is one of the most prominent and growing chronic health conditions worldwide, with 415 million patients
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">5</a>,
  <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">6</a> and 5 million deaths in 2015 globally.
  <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">6</a> Research evidence suggests that effective self-care, ie, adherence to medication regimen, changes in lifestyle such as managing weight, increasing physical activity and maintaining a healthy diet, can lead to better blood glucose control.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Self-determination theory, developed by Deci and Ryan,
  <a rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0010">10</a>,
  <a rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0011">11</a> was used in this study as a framework to study motivation and the ways in which people attempt to boost their energy and mobilize their efforts to perform activities of daily life. This theory could also be applicable in research on a wide range of disease-related behaviors, including preventive or therapeutic practices that healthy people or patients might adopt for a better health outcome. This theory tries to explain how the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic factors could sustain individuals’ passions and their efforts to reach personal aspirations. A special focus of the theory is on sociocultural factors that could facilitate or undermine the individuals’ sense of autonomy, competence and relatedness, which were argued to be fundamental in maintaining motivation and performance.
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">5</a>,
  <a rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0008">8</a>,
  <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">12</a> Perceived support for autonomy, self-care competence and psychological relatedness based on the theory are crucial for optimal functioning of a patient in accordance with the prescribed medications or behavioral pattern.

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A patient-centered and conducive health-care climate could provide the required support for the universally agreed needs of the patients; therefore, having an in-depth knowledge and understanding of its cyclical nature could offer a timely opportunity for a constructive and far-reaching look at the established organizational behavior to promote best practice performance in health-care settings.

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Various studies on the impact of the health-care climate have shown that by affecting autonomy and independent motivation, selection of a healthy lifestyle and gaining a sense of self-care competency could be improved in patients with type 2 diabetes.
  <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">7</a>–

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ) was developed by Williams et al
  <a rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0017">17</a> and measures the perceived needs of patients and extent of HCPs' support with regard to independence and success in motivating patients to accept greater responsibility for their own health.

  <a rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0020">20</a>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scale has also been applied to measure the influence of a protective care environment on various health topics, including smoking cessation
  <a rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0021">21</a> and identification of perceived barriers to reduce sodium intake in patients with chronic kidney disease,
  <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">22</a> as well as a feasibility study of physiotherapist training to present the theory-based self-management of osteoarthritis and lower back pain,
  <a rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0023">23</a> in addition to other subject areas, such as mental disabilities,

  <a rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0026">26</a>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other related scales have been developed based on the HCCQ, such as the Virtual Health Inventory Questionnaire,
  <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">18</a> Important Other Climate Questionnaire for cigarette smoking
  <a rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0030">30</a> and diet,
  <a rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0030">30</a> and a modified HCCQ for breast cancer patients.
  <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">31</a> The HCCQ has been validated for use in other languages, such as German,
  <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">19</a> French
  <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">14</a> and Dutch.

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies indicated that Iranian patients with diabetes generally do not receive the required quality of services. A part of this perceived deficiency may be associated with the health-care provision facilities and the overall perceived performance environment in the health-care centers.
  <a rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0032">32</a>,
  <a rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0033">33</a>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since this scale has not been validated for use in Persian-speaking populations, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ-P) for use in future studies. Patients' perceived needs and HCPs’ support are universal phenomena in health-care provision, and cross-cultural validation of the HCCQ could help researchers and HCPs to work with a standard tool for the purposes of data collection and patient assessment.</p>
