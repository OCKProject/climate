 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study results showed an excellent KMO factor structure, which indicates sufficient sample size for factor analysis. The estimated index was similar to the findings obtained in the psychometric evaluation of the German version of the HCCQ.

  <a rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0024">24</a> In the German version of the scale, however, two major factors were found: a factor with 14 items and a factor with only one item (item 13), which had a negative load
