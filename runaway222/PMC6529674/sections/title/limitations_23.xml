 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite an acceptable representation of the validity and reliability measures, the study findings should be interpreted with caution. The studied sample’s imbalanced gender ratio and distinct sociodemographic characteristics of the participants have the potential to cause bias in the study findings. The participants’ previous experiences in dealing with the health-care system, their trust in the health-care system, baseline mental status and overall life satisfaction are other factors that might be considered in the interpretation of the results.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a brief tool, the HCCQ focuses on the overall supportiveness of the health-care delivery setting rather than the details and several dimensions of the appropriateness of the provided care. Further studies are required to verify these preliminary results by recruiting samples from various parts of the country, which has a very diverse socioeconomic, geographic and development profile.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed small ceiling effect in this study is a common limitation in research on patient satisfaction, since study respondents are generally reluctant to criticize their HCPs, for several reasons.
  <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">19</a> However, sociocultural differences may exist based on literacy level, previous experiences, insurance coverage and social norms, which should be considered in the interpretation of the findings.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Long-term stability of the patients’ views should also be assessed in future studies because of the influences that contextual factors (eg, economic turbulence) may have on the patients’ prospects.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Convergent and divergent validities of the translated HCCQ were not studied in this research since a reliable scale was not identified by the authors to measure the health-care system supportiveness. Therefore, further assessment of the HCCQ-P’s construct validity using a comparable tool is recommended.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study findings cannot be generalized beyond outpatient care settings since the sample was drawn only from the outpatient diabetes clinic. Additional studies are required if application of the HCCQ-P is to be considered on authentic and complex inpatient diabetes cases, as recommended in other relevant studies.

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the above limitations, strengths of this study are the applied explicit cultural adaptation in the translation process and the high participation rate, which suggests a low risk of selection bias that would otherwise have had the potential to affect the findings.</p>
