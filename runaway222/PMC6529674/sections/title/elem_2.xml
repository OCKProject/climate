  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main objective of the present study was to translate the HCCQ and conduct psychometric validation of the HCCQ-P to assess its potential applicability in the study of health-care climate support for patients in Iran and other Persian-speaking countries. Therefore, content validity and reliability scores were estimated, and structural validity verification procedures based on the results of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the recommended sample size for accurate and precise factor analysis,
   <a rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0034">34</a> 177 patients with type 2 diabetes registered in the diabetes clinic of the Shahid Madani Hospital in the city of Khoy, north-west Iran, were recruited out of 1,600 active patients' files with a random sampling method. The inclusion criteria were type 2 diabetes, over 30 years of age and being a native resident of the city; and the exclusion criteria were type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes, having mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia or congenital mental retardation, or having a severe limiting disability such as quadriplegia or limiting cardiovascular disease.

    <a rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0037">37</a> were performed to prepare a preliminary draft of the scale in Persian. In the first stage, the original instrument (Table S1) was translated into Persian by two professional translators; and in the next stage, the Persian version (Figure S1) was translated into English by two other professional translators who were familiar with the main study topic. In the third stage, the back-translated English version of the HCCQ was compared with the original version in terms of content, and idiomatic and semantic affinity. Minor corrections were made as a consequence and the final draft was approved by the researchers. The face and content validity of the translated version was checked by a group of experts consisting 15 academic staff of the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, who had work experience in the field of type 2 diabetes. Clarity of the wording, placement of the items and scoring were checked by the experts at this stage, and their feedback was followed to make corrections. Content validity ratio (CVR) and content validity index (CVI) scores were calculated to determine the suitability of items on the translated questionnaire. A CVI of 0.80 or higher
    <a rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0038">38</a> for individual items and a CVR above 0.49 were deemed as acceptable cut-off points.
    <a rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0039">39</a> The translated questionnaire was also pilot tested on 20 patients regarding understandability of the questions and response items.

   <a rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0040">40</a> Complete information was provided to the study participants at the beginning of the recruitment stage and written consent was obtained from the patients. Participants were also reassured that their information would be kept confidential and that they could withdraw from the study at any time without being questioned.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual participants’ total scores, their means and standard deviations were calculated after applying a reverse-coding mechanism for item 13, as recommended by the scale’s developer, owing to the negative wording of the question in that item.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Pearson’s coefficient of skewness and Fisher’s measure of kurtosis were used to assess the asymmetry of the study data at the next stage. The range of skewness coefficient was deemed to be between −1 and +1, and Fisher’s measure of kurtosis was considered to be between −1.96 and +1.96.

   </a> The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was calculated to appraise the scale’s internal consistency, and values greater than or equal to 0.7 were considered to be acceptable.
   <a rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0034">34</a> The test–retest procedure was used and the ICC was calculated by asking 20 patients with type 2 diabetes to fill in the study questionnaire after 20 days. ICC values below 0.4, between 0.41 and 0.6, and above 0.8 were considered as weak, moderate, and good and excellent indicators of the participants’ performance in the two measurements, respectively.
   <a rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0034">34</a> To facilitate the decision-making process, values above 0.7 were considered acceptable.

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The correlation between the scale items’ scores and the total scale score was examined and found to be in the range of 0.82–0.91, representing a high consistency between items.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To perform psychometric verification of the translated questionnaire, half of the collected data, selected at random, was used for EFA and the rest for CFA. The Keyser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) indicator was used to verify the adequacy of the sample size and Bartlett’s test of sphericity was devised to confirm the correlation between items and suitability of performing factor analysis. During the exploratory factor analysis, principal axis factoring and direct oblimin rotation were applied; eigenvalues greater than 1 were used to determine the number of factor solutions, and factor loadings greater than 0.3 were considered to assign questions to factors. The required modifications were also performed to improve the model fit in the CFA. All statistical analyses in this study were implemented with SPSS 20, STATA 15 and AMOS 20 software.</p>
