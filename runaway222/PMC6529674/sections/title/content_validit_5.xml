In the first stage, the original instrument (Table S1) was translated into Persian by two professional translators; and in the next stage, the Persian version (Figure S1) was translated into English by two other professional translators who were familiar with the main study topic. In the third stage, the back-translated English version of the HCCQ was compared with the original version in terms of content, and idiomatic and semantic affinity. Minor corrections were made as a consequence and the final draft was approved by the researchers. The face and content validity of the translated version was checked by a group of experts consisting 15 academic staff of the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, who had work experience in the field of type 2 diabetes. Clarity of the wording, placement of the items and scoring were checked by the experts at this stage, and their feedback was followed to make corrections. Content validity ratio (CVR) and content validity index (CVI) scores were calculated to determine the suitability of items on the translated questionnaire. A CVI of 0.80 or higher
