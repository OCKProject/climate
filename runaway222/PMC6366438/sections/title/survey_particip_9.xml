 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In August 2013, out of the 136 graduates of the 2005â€“2012 FLC cohorts, 131 had a valid email address and were invited to participate via an email solicitation, which included 19 (14.5%) who were no longer at UCSF. Two reminder emails spaced 2-weeks apart encouraged non-respondents. By close of data collection in October 2013, 72 respondents (55% response rate) began or completed the survey. Respondents included 12 (17%) who were not at UCSF.</p>
