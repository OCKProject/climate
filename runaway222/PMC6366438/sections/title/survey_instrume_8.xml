 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The survey was developed by a team of UCSF faculty, graduates from the FLC, and Coro employees familiar with the FLC and other Coro LDPs. The final version was vetted and approved by the UCSF CCFL. We used a mixed-methods design incorporating quantitative and qualitative items: 13 demographic items (e.g., age, gender, academic rank, school, program, etc.); 18 Likert scale and multiple-choice questions that asked perceived impacts of program participation on various dimensions related to program goals (confidence building, enhanced attitudes towards one’s role, networking and interactions, campus climate, faculty recruitment or retention); and 16 open-ended questions designed to capture respondents’ perspectives in their own voices for the above-mentioned dimensions and to solicit any additional experience with the FLC. The survey is included in
