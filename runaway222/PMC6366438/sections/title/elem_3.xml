  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2001–02, the UCSF Chancellor commissioned a survey on the climate at UCSF for faculty, particularly women faculty. A total of 1,057 faculty responded (60% participation rate). The survey findings revealed that women faculty indicated significantly more dissatisfaction than men faculty with numerous areas including job demands, income, and leadership opportunities [
   <a rid="CIT0013" href="#CIT0013">13</a>]. In 2003, a Task Force convened to review the survey results and made 10 recommendations, one of which included development of leadership skills and opportunities, especially for women faculty [
   <a rid="CIT0014" href="#CIT0014">14</a>]. This led to the formation of the Chancellor’s Council on Faculty Life (CCFL), chaired by the Vice Provost of Academic Affairs. In 2004–05, the UCSF Office of Academic Affairs issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a leadership training provider. Two organizations responded to the RFP: Coro Northern California and one internal group. CCFL made the decision to engage with Coro who might bring a different perspective on leadership development from their predominant work which was outside of academic institutions. Coro Northern California (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://coronorcal.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://coronorcal.org</span>), a nonpartisan nonprofit organization, has offered leadership training program since 1947. Coro centers across the United States have graduated more than 11,000 leaders from their various programs. Coro Northern California has worked with more than 700 faculty and administrators affiliated with the University of California campuses since 2006 in various LDPs. Additionally, 1,600 high-school students and young professionals have graduated from Coro programs. The UCSF collaboration with Coro started in 2005.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Training philosophy</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The UCSF-Coro FLC is a program administered within UCSF by Coro. Coro experiential training model was developed in the 1940s. The training model shares similar concepts of Kolb’s experiential learning model [
   <a rid="CIT0015" href="#CIT0015">15</a>], which was refined from Dewey’s educational principles emphasizing concepts such as experience, experiment, observation and reflection, and purposeful learning [
   <a rid="CIT0016" href="#CIT0016">16</a>]. Coro’s design of curriculum and learning activities encourages participants to accept new tools introduced in the training, apply the tools, and to then adapt the tools, as needed, based on one’s experiences and relevancy after a process of reflection. Coro uses an array of tools to focus on developing six core leadership competencies: 1) self-awareness, 2) critical thinking, 3) effective communication, 4) inclusion, 5) collaboration, and 6) empowered professionalism (confidence to represent oneself consistently in many different environments), rather than following a specific leadership model.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The FLC aims to facilitate networking among its participants within the AHC through a cohort-based model of training. Coro trainers conduct FLC training within the AHC, with the goal of catalyzing individual and collective change to benefit both the participants and the broader UCSF community. The training centers on self-reflection, critical evaluation, and basic leadership skills (e.g., how to run a meeting, how to take and give feedback, public speaking, etc.). FLC includes meetings with selected UCSF leaders. Through preparing and conducting group-based in-depth interviews with various UCSF leaders, participants learn to apply Coro tools to critically analyze group processes and learning outcomes.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implementation of UCSF-Coro FLC</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">FLC is inclusive of UCSF’s four schools of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy. UCSF departments select faculty members for FLC who they believe will provide leadership for their colleagues, the departments, and the medical center community. Nominations are solicited through the Office of the UCSF Vice Provost of Academic Affairs. Local-level leaders, such as department chairs, division chiefs or campus site specific hospital administration chiefs of staff, are encouraged to nominate faculty members whom they believe would provide leadership for their colleagues, the departments, and the medical center community. All faculty appointed at 50% or greater paid effort and who have been in a UCSF faculty position for more than 4 years are encouraged to apply. A statement of support from the applicant’s department chair is required, and the applicant must attest that the chair supports the time commitment required to fully participant in the program.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selection amongst the applicant pool is determined by a selection committee, which is composed of campus administrators and past FLC participants. Applicants are rated upon: personal initiative; ability to work well in diverse groups; desire to contribute to the campus community; intellectual curiosity; and evidence of leadership potential or experience from the applicants’ curriculum vitae, personal statement and chair’s letter of support. When selecting applicants for admission to the program, the committee made a conscious effort to address issues of equity and inclusion (e.g., by gender, URM status, school, and department).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cohorts of up to 16 faculty members are given release time from their clinical/research/administrative responsibilities to complete a 10-session (75 program hours across approximately 20 weeks) leadership program. The release time is not based on salary scale, but is protected time to attend all FLC-related activities. Participants’ release time is negotiated at the local department or division level. An example of the 10-session program training contents is provided in

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">UCSF-Coro is an ongoing program. Since FLC inception in 2005, there has been 10 cohorts (through 2017) of FLC graduates. In 2013, we conducted an online survey of the graduates from the 2005–2012 FLC cohorts to assess the longitudinal impact of program participation. The evaluation FLC was limited to the first 7 cohorts of FLC graduates enrolled between 2005 and 2012 and was assessed in two primary aspects: (1) leadership attainment within UCSF among 2005–2012 FLC graduates and (2) FLC graduates’ perceived impacts of FLC using an online survey conducted in 2013.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Survey instrument</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The survey was developed by a team of UCSF faculty, graduates from the FLC, and Coro employees familiar with the FLC and other Coro LDPs. The final version was vetted and approved by the UCSF CCFL. We used a mixed-methods design incorporating quantitative and qualitative items: 13 demographic items (e.g., age, gender, academic rank, school, program, etc.); 18 Likert scale and multiple-choice questions that asked perceived impacts of program participation on various dimensions related to program goals (confidence building, enhanced attitudes towards one’s role, networking and interactions, campus climate, faculty recruitment or retention); and 16 open-ended questions designed to capture respondents’ perspectives in their own voices for the above-mentioned dimensions and to solicit any additional experience with the FLC. The survey is included in 
   <a rid="app0002" href="#app0002">Appendix 2</a>. Survey procedures were approved by UCSF’s institutional review board.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In August 2013, out of the 136 graduates of the 2005–2012 FLC cohorts, 131 had a valid email address and were invited to participate via an email solicitation, which included 19 (14.5%) who were no longer at UCSF. Two reminder emails spaced 2-weeks apart encouraged non-respondents. By close of data collection in October 2013, 72 respondents (55% response rate) began or completed the survey. Respondents included 12 (17%) who were not at UCSF.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leadership attainment outcome</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We defined leadership attainment as FLC graduates who attained a leadership position at UCSF, defined as Dean (including Vice and Associate Dean positions), Department Chair, and Director of Organized Research Unit. This outcome definition has been used to obtain funding allocation within the institution to support the continued provision of leadership development and training.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 (IBM Corporation, New York) for quantitative data analysis, we computed means, standard deviations, and percentages. The 4-point Likert scale items were dichotomized to ‘strong disagree/disagree’ versus ‘strongly agree/agree’ due to bimodal distributions observed of the items. For open-ended qualitative items, we used Atlas.ti 8.0 (ATLAS.ti GmbH, Germany) to organize and code the data. Author team members independently reviewed the qualitative responses, developed initial codes, and formulated candidate themes. Through iterative group reviews and discussions, we refined and generated a final set of themes and subthemes. We integrated quantitative findings with emergent qualitative themes. For leadership attainment, frequency counts and percentages were computed for the entire sample of 2005–2012, and by the following graduate categories of focus: women faculty, URM, and women URM faculty. URM was defined as ethnicities and racial groups considered to be URMs in health sciences, which included African American/Black, Filipino or Hmong or Vietnamese Asians, Hispanic/Latino, Native American/Alaskan Native, or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, or two or more races with one or more from the URM categories [
