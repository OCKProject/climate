 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For 12 years, the UCSF-Coro FLC successfully has reached a diverse faculty audience and created a faculty leadership network. The observational outcome is encouraging, especially among URM and among woman URM faculty with one-third to nearly half of these faculty graduates attaining leadership positions at UCSF. At least by self-report of FLC graduates, positive impacts from FLC appear longitudinally sustained as many as 8 years post-completion. The positive impacts spanned across multiple levels, such as personal growth, enhancement in leadership attitudes, increased interpersonal leadership skills and collaborations, increased understanding of their home institute, and perceived commitment of faculty development from the institution. Our 12-year reflection from the UCSF-Coro FLC, an internal faculty LDP in an AHC utilizing cohort-based experiential learning supports the feasibility for developing faculty leadership from ‘within.’ This approach has yielded sustainable objective and self-reported positive outcomes at individual, interpersonal, and organization levels. Future research might include assessment of the impact of the FLC on faculty retention, advancement, assumptions of leadership roles, and climate perceptions.</p>
