  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the inception of UCSF-Coro FLC in 2005 through 2012, the program conducted training with 7 cohorts (
   <a rid="T0001" href="#T0001">Table 1</a>). A total of 136 graduates included 65.4% women and 13.2% URM (defined as ethnicities considered to be URMs in health sciences). Among URM graduates, 61.1% were women. The program provided training to faculty at all ranks. FLC completion rate is 97.8%. FLC graduates included faculty from 33 departments, including a majority from the school of Medicine (79.4%), and the remaining were from schools of Dentistry (10.3%), Nursing (5.9%), and Pharmacy (4.4%). As the size of each school has varied slightly over time, the distribution by school of the FLC graduates were comparable to the median proportions of the faculty across the schools during the same period of time: Medicine (81.6%), Dentistry (7.4%), Nursing (5.6%), and Pharmacy (4.0%).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As of 2017, 9.6% (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 13) of the graduates attained leadership position at UCSF, defined as Dean (including Vice and Associate Dean positions), Department Chair, and Director of Organized Research Unit. The proportions of FLC graduates attaining leadership position varied greatly by schools: Medicine (5 of 108; 4.6%), Dentistry (4 of 14; 28.6%), Nursing (2 of 8; 25%), and Pharmacy (2 of 6; 33.3%). Among the 13 FLC graduate leaders, 11 were women faculty and 6 were URM faculty (including 5 women and 1 man). 
   <a rid="F0001" href="#F0001">Figure 1</a> depicts the percentages of leadership attainments by selected FLC graduate groups including the entire sample, women, URM and woman URM faculty. In comparison to the 2017 UCSF faculty body, which included 50% women and 8% URM, the data provide evidence of FLC’s effectiveness in recruiting both women and URM faculty, and also in supporting women faculty in attaining leadership within our AHC.

When starting the FLC, the mean years a participant had been a UCSF faculty member was 10.8 years (SD = 6.8; range 1–27 years).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The FLC, as perceived by the program participants 12 months to 8 years after program completion, has generated positive and sustaining impacts at multiple levels. Based on thematic analyses, the levels of impacts were categorized to (1) individual, (2) interpersonal, and (3) organizational levels.</p>
  <sec id="S0003-S2004-S3001" class="sec">
   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Theme 1: individual level impacts</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At an individual level, the program fostered development of leadership skills in conflict resolution, team management, and giving and receiving feedback. Since completion of the FLC, a majority indicated noticeable changes in leadership skills (98.6%), and attitudes or behaviors related to leadership (91.7%). Specifically, the most commonly endorsed individual changes include a positive effect on ability to lead or manage through challenging times (93.1%), increased confidence in handling leadership roles or responsibilities (80.6%), and increased effectiveness in leadership roles (77.8%). Post completion of the FLC, while only 29% indicated volunteering more for committee service, 62.5% reported seeking out new leadership opportunities, and 61.1% were appointed to one or more committees as an outgrowth of the program. More women than men agreed their program participation encouraged them to expand their leadership roles in professional or volunteer organizations outside of UCSF (72.7% vs. 47.8%; χ

    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.04).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Qualitative responses supported impacts of participation in the FLC on personal growth, particularly in increasing self-awareness, confidence, and aspiration. For example, in response to how participating in the FLC has changed one’s self-awareness, one participant stated, ‘It made me much more aware as an effective leader using my strengths and learning to optimize my weaknesses.’ Another participant indicated, ‘… [it] made me more confident as a leader and yet more willing to listen to others and give credit to them for their ideas.’</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Graduates described how the program led to new collaborations. Most (90%) reported increased interpersonal leadership skills and 85% indicated their participation helped build a network of faculty leaders transcending internal departmental boundaries. Two-thirds (67%) said their participation gave them better understanding of group dynamics. Post FLC completion, 69% and 50% said they continued to interact with participants from their or other cohorts, respectively.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The qualitative data from respondents described the FLC as a means to provide support, connectedness, empowerment, and formal mentorship, particularly for women and minority faculty. One graduate indicated, ‘Collaboration between participants is the real “gem” behind the program. I realized how diverse UCSF really is….’ Some graduates described experiencing increased collaboration across and increased cohesion within departments or units. One graduate commented, ‘…helping me be a better leader within my unit, and helping my unit by serving as a bridge to other people across UCSF.’ Another graduate commented, ‘I feel more engaged with the university as a whole, and more interested in collaborating with others outside of my department.’</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most respondents (91.7%) agreed that the sponsorship of the FLC demonstrated the University’s commitment to foster faculty development. A majority (91.7%) said the program had increased their understanding of UCSF as an organization; 79.2% credited the FLC to an increased ability to navigate UCSF as an organization. A majority (76.4%) said they developed an improved attitude towards their role and/or job at the university. Two-thirds (66.2%) perceived a positive impact on recruiting or retaining faculty or agreed that participating in FLC increased their commitment to UCSF. More Full Professors agreed to the statement that the program improved the climate for UCSF than Associate or Assistant Professors (78.8% vs. 45.0%; χ
    <span class="sup">2</span>(1) = 7.8, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.005). One graduate commented, ‘It is an important symbol to me, personally, of the university’s interest in “growing its own” and, in particular, of this public institution’s continued interest in trying to assure that its leaders look like the public the university serves.’
