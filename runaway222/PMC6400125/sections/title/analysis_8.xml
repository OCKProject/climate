 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. These transcripts served as a basis for the thematic content analysis, which aimed to report the critical elements in the responses and allowed a comparison and categorization of the various perspectives.
  <a rid="b8-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8-jmdh-12-173">8</a> We used the Atlas.ti computer software to construct coding schemes that were used to identify the (sub)themes.
  <a rid="b9-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9-jmdh-12-173">9</a> An inductive analysis process, with open codes, was used since currently little is known about the implementation climate at the Caribbean.
  <a rid="b10-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10-jmdh-12-173">10</a> The participants were able to review the preliminary findings of the analysis and had the opportunity to provide feedback on the data. They were able to verify whether the findings that they were shown truly emerged from the data. By going through this process, we expected that their feedback would contribute to the credibility of our research.
  <a rid="b10-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10-jmdh-12-173">10</a> All quotes were translated from Dutch into English and were used to support the identified themes from the analysis.
  <a rid="b11-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11-jmdh-12-173">11</a> The themes, explaining the current implementation climate included: 1) the attitude of staff toward policy changes; 2) vision of the organization; 3) collaboration; 4) transparency and communication; 5) personal development; and 6) resources.
