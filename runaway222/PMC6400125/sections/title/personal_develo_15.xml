 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of the experiences of the participants showed that another factor influencing the implementation climate in SEHOS was the (opportunity for) personal development. Participants mentioned that there was insufficient appreciation by their managers and a limitation in career possibilities as something that influenced their motivation. Another factor that became apparent was the lack of education and training possibilities. Participants expressed the desire to develop themselves but felt that they did not get the opportunities to attend courses or training sessions to gain more insight.</p>
 <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>The career possibilities in this hospital are quite limited. Especially in the care department. So, at one point, one gets the feeling to have reached the ceiling for further professional growth. [P6]</p>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants expressed the need for the hospital to pay more attention to their personal development. They perceived that training opportunities to acquire essential skills and knowledge needed to help them to stay up to date with current developments in the profession were insufficient. They argued that these limitations contributed to the perceived sense of high workload in their duties, not being able to meet set targets, and not having the capacity to implement health care improvement projects. Consequently, working on new policies was not considered to be a priority given these current circumstances.</p>
 <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>We need the right people doing the right job. If you do not have those people, then you cannot meet the set targets. [P1]</p>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the participants highlighted the need for more investment in material resources and setting realistic targets, our analysis revealed that there was also a lot of improvisation and the use of creative ways to deal with the lack of resources.</p>
