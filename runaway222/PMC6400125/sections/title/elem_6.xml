 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We designed a health care improvement project that was made up of two parts: 1) workforce leadership development through the implementation of a clinical leadership training program; and 2) health care quality improvement through the development of a decubitus ulcer care pathway. We selected a mixed team of health professionals to participate in this project all of whom were actively involved in the process of the chosen care pathway. The findings from previous research we conducted determined our choice for an interprofessional team.
  <a rid="b7-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7-jmdh-12-173">7</a> In that study, we identified that interprofessional teams that focused on the development of individual and collective leadership skills of its members helped foster capabilities needed to achieve sustainable health care systems and support the practical introduction of care pathways.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A participatory tool was used to assess the local factors and barriers that influenced the implementation climate for clinical care pathways as well as the effect of the intervention on quality improvement (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jmdh-12-173" href="#f1-jmdh-12-173">Figure 1</a>). The study focussed on the implementation climate in general and not specific for the ulcer care pathway, this way it could also serve as a basis for future projects. The interviews were conducted after the first leadership training but before the development of the care pathway by the interprofessional team.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The general focus of the evaluation in this project was diverse and included identifying the participants’ perceived level of leadership competency, their perceived appreciation of the training/workshop, a baseline measurement of the current implementation climate in hospital organization, as well as investigating the impact of the health improvement project over time. We chose to use a qualitative research approach for our investigation, because it would help us obtain the in-depth information we needed to understand what defined the hospital’s implementation climate prior to the development of the care pathway, as well as the circumstances under which the improvement initiative could be implemented.
  <a rid="b8-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8-jmdh-12-173">8</a> Therefore, the focus of the evaluation in this paper is the understanding of the implementation climate prior to the development and implementation of the care pathway.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Settings and participants</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fieldwork was conducted in May 2017 at SEHOS, Curaçao. To attain the study objectives, participants with different backgrounds/professions were included, with the aim of obtaining various perspectives on the current implementation climate in the hospital. A purposive sampling method was used to assure a variety in profession. We selected the respondents from the test group (n=25), who were trained to become health care leaders within the hospital. 
   <a rid="t1-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="table" href="#t1-jmdh-12-173">Table 1</a> contains the demographic characteristics of the participants. A total of ten participants participated in the study and the group consisted of nurses, doctors, management, and paramedics as shown in 
   <a rid="t1-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="table" href="#t1-jmdh-12-173">Table 1</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In-depth semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with the use of a preconstructed topic guide that explored the respondents’ personal views of the current implementation climate as well as of the organizational structure itself. The topic guide was based on existing literature and included questions on the following topics: 1) respondents’ role within change processes in the hospital; 2) the organizational climate and culture (which included the vision of the organization); and 3) leadership in the hospital.
   <a rid="b6-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6-jmdh-12-173">6</a> Due to the semi-structured nature of the topic guide, participants were encouraged to elaborate on their answers and additional questions were asked to clarify on certain topics. The interviews were held separately and lasted an average of 25 minutes (ranging from 7 to 35 minutes), nine interviews lasted between 20 and 35 minutes, and only one interview was shorter than expected due to the need to attend to an emergency by the participant (see 
   <a rid="t2-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="table" href="#t2-jmdh-12-173">Table 2</a>). A separate group meeting was organized for the participants to reflect and discuss the preliminary findings, which served as a member check of the results and if they recognized and agreed with the preliminary data outcome. During this meeting no new themes were identified, and the participants agreed with the presented analysis.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. These transcripts served as a basis for the thematic content analysis, which aimed to report the critical elements in the responses and allowed a comparison and categorization of the various perspectives.
   <a rid="b8-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8-jmdh-12-173">8</a> We used the Atlas.ti computer software to construct coding schemes that were used to identify the (sub)themes.
   <a rid="b9-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9-jmdh-12-173">9</a> An inductive analysis process, with open codes, was used since currently little is known about the implementation climate at the Caribbean.
   <a rid="b10-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10-jmdh-12-173">10</a> The participants were able to review the preliminary findings of the analysis and had the opportunity to provide feedback on the data. They were able to verify whether the findings that they were shown truly emerged from the data. By going through this process, we expected that their feedback would contribute to the credibility of our research.
   <a rid="b10-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10-jmdh-12-173">10</a> All quotes were translated from Dutch into English and were used to support the identified themes from the analysis.
   <a rid="b11-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11-jmdh-12-173">11</a> The themes, explaining the current implementation climate included: 1) the attitude of staff toward policy changes; 2) vision of the organization; 3) collaboration; 4) transparency and communication; 5) personal development; and 6) resources.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All participants participated voluntarily and were informed about the objectives of the study by JB and AJD. Before the interviews were conducted, the participants were asked to read and sign a consent form. To ensure their confidentiality, the transcription of the interviews and data analysis were performed anonymously. Ethical approval was given by the SEHOS medical ethical board on March 1, 2017.</p>
