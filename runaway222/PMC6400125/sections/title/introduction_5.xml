 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A care pathway is “a complex intervention made up of mutual decision-making and organization of care processes for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period”.
  <a rid="b1-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1-jmdh-12-173">1</a> The aim of a care pathway, which often involves a series of stages, is to enhance the quality of care, through risk-adjusted patient outcomes, patient safety, and satisfaction with the optimal use of health care resources.
  <a rid="b1-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1-jmdh-12-173">1</a> Proponents of care pathways argue that they can facilitate the translation of established guidelines into local management protocols and if adjusted to local health care needs, can potentially aid the implementation of guidelines in resource-limited environments.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many countries, care pathways are increasingly seen as valuable tools for health care improvement, though most of the evidence supporting this has emerged from experiences within Europe and North America. While the reports from what we know demonstrate that local sociopolitical, cultural, and economic factors need to be considered when implementing care pathways, research investigating the effects of care pathways in resource-limited environments is sparse. Especially, on how to effectively implement care pathways within different contexts of health care systems and the conditions needed to engage professionals in the process.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Curaçao is a Dutch Caribbean island with a small population of 150,563 inhabitants.
  <a rid="b3-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3-jmdh-12-173">3</a> The St. Elisabeth Hospital (SEHOS) is the sole general hospital of Curaçao, and it provides services in all major clinical specialties. However, local politics, socioeconomic uncertainties, and rising costs of health care have resulted in a health care system that has over the years shifted its priority to focus more on containing costs and less in investing on process improvement and innovation.
  <a rid="b4-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4-jmdh-12-173">4</a> With the knowledge of this in mind, there was a perceived sense of urgency to turn things around and change the current health system to a value-based health care system.
  <a rid="b5-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5-jmdh-12-173">5</a> As a result, the health care improvement strategy that we chose focused on: 1) investing in workforce leadership development; and 2) defining, designing, and implementing innovative, health improvement interventions that will best serve the local situation. An implementation climate is an “absorptive capacity for change, shared receptivity of involved individuals to an intervention, and the extent to which use of that intervention will be rewarded, supported, and expected within their organization”.
  <a rid="b6-jmdh-12-173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6-jmdh-12-173">6</a> Current models of implementation climate describe the process as a system of interacting factors that reliably determine the organizational readiness for change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In light of the perceived sense of urgency for change in the health care system, a number of measures were initiated at both the national ie, construction of a new hospital, as well as at the local levels to transform the health system in Curaçao ie, strategies to improve the organizational process and structure. Therefore, the focus of this study was to investigate those factors that defined the implementation climate within SEHOS in Curaçao. We chose a care pathway as our preferred strategic approach because we believed it would benefit the health improvement initiative within our context.</p>
