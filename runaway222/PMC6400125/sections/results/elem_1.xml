 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the analysis of the current factors influencing the implementation climate showed that participants felt the need toward introducing procedures and guidelines that meet the current state of the art of evidence-based medicine. They felt that current procedures did not align with the latest developments in their specific fields. We asked the participants what they expected from this project, in which health care workers would be trained in health leadership competencies and participate in designing a care pathway. Different expectations were described, all of them addressing the factors that influence the current implementation climate. Some of their expectations included that the project should contribute to defining a clear vision and serve as a blueprint for future policies. They expected that the project would serve as a foundation for good collaboration across all levels, and a good way to involve all stakeholders. Another expectation that was perceived positively was that the project would benefit the personal development of the participants. As an outcome, participants expressed the hope that the project would result in a specific protocol that would standardize care and overall health care improvement, as one of the respondents mentioned.</p>
 <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>I think that once the care pathway is completed and implemented, with the necessary policies and guidelines in place, and together with the multidisciplinary approach, it will undoubtedly contribute to the quality of health care delivery in the hospital. [P5]</p>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When it came to the implementation of procedures, the respondents showed a high sense of urgency, expressing that this had to be in place before completion of the construction of the new hospital. Participants mentioned they often sought for guidelines outside their hospital to use and even recruited the help of colleagues from abroad to keep their knowledge up to date. The participants highlighted many factors that influenced the implementation climate. These included the attitude of staff toward policy changes, the vision of the organization, collaboration, transparency and communication, personal development, and resources as factors that influenced the implementation climate. These factors also had several potential consequences and effects.</p>
 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attitude of staff to policy changes</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants mentioned they sometimes noticed reluctance toward policy changes among staff on the working floor. Several reasons were found to be underlying of this reluctance. First of all, participants mentioned that negative experiences from the past shaped the current opinions of staff members toward policy changes. Second, experiences showed fear toward policy changes. Staff members feared that the new policy or regulation would give them more work in their daily routine or that the change would be negative on a personal level. Finally, participants mentioned that staff members often were stuck in their current daily routine and therefore simply not interested in new policy changes.</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>They are done with the changes. Nobody wants to. Not whether they want to. They are simply tired, they don’t believe it anymore, because several projects have been launched, but no progress has been made. Uh yeah, they simply don’t see why they should do it. [P5]</p>
   <p>So, I think there are people who are afraid of changes. Maybe for their own sake or so, probably they think it will harm them or result in them having to change their work on the department for example, resulting in too much work, or too much administration or the feeling that somebody is watching them perform their duties. This of course it is not a bad thing. [P2]</p>
   <p>Sometimes you see a disenchanted attitude among the professionals. You try to implement something, and you get a response like: yeah it has been like this for years and this is just the way we do it and we are in Curacao, so we are not going to change that. So, the mentality of the staff is often an issue. That is coherent with the fact that they are understaffed though. [P9]</p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The participants highlighted that hospital staff needs to feel involved in the policy forming process to create a positive attitude toward policy changes, which of course requires a supportive working environment.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vision of the organization</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concerning the current vision of the organization, the participants expressed the following three opinions. First, they were unaware of the current vision of the hospital. Participants had no idea of what the long-term plans were as well as what the hospital expected of them. They experienced that a lack of transparency was responsible for the unawareness. Second, they mentioned that the current investments and policy changes revealed a lack of a long-term vision to support these investments. Last, participants mentioned that the vision of the board did not always align with their vision.</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>We do not have a long-term vision of the board of directors. It is just band-aid solutions. [P9]</p>
   <p>The organization is open-minded towards changes; however, they do not know what they would like to change. For example, one could be open-minded, but if one does not know what it is that needs to change and how to achieve this, then in such a case, it is not a change, but just spinning around in circles. [P6]</p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis showed that several underlying factors caused this negative view on the current long-term vision. A lack of communication and transparency from the hospital administrators was one of the reasons, which will be elaborated later. Next to that, a lack of medical knowledge and know-how among the management staff were viewed upon as a cause of the negative perception of the current vision. Participants mentioned that hospital administrators and senior management staff were often positioned too far from the routine of clinical practice, resulting in them not understanding the current issues in the frontline of care. Furthermore, they observed that some “team leads” in the department lacked the professional capacities to formulate a well-structured policy because they did not have the proper management training. Nevertheless, the participants emphasized that it was important to involve staff in the creation of a long-term vision and to communicate this transparently to all staff members.</p>

 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Collaboration</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The presence of effective collaboration was a significant factor influencing the current implementation climate. The participants perceived it as suboptimal on several levels: both horizontal, between the different wards, as vertical level, between the managers and the staff on the ground floor. They also viewed the collaboration between the different disciplines as suboptimal. Participants described difficulties in collaborating with other disciplines and mentioned that procedures and guidelines were often not synchronized among the different departments in the hospital, which resulted in a fragmented system.</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>Currently a protocol is made that needs the input of the relevant medical specialists. It’s like, I have addressed a few specialists a couple of times. And there is none to zero response. Yes, that’s, that is quite difficult. You just want someone, even just for a brief moment, but to actively get involved, but if people don’t do that. Yeah in that case, that makes it very difficult. [P4]</p>
   <p>Well people, yeah, people around here are quite emotional. And well one person doesn’t, that one person doesn’t want to join if another is present. So you see this in all layers. Even among the doctors and nurses, the head nurse. There are conflicts. And everybody seems to forget that they work in the name of a foundation. You know what I mean? […]. So it is not your sole responsibility. You have to collaborate. And if you are not capable to collaborate you just have to find something else. And that is not always easy around here […]. Well if there is an issue. In other words, most people don’t look beyond the “person” to address issue, and at a particular point in time it becomes a personal conflict. [P3]</p>
   <p>No, they [policies] don’t match and this also impedes your policy at the ward. So, we must work together to make sure they are coherent, like a flowchart. [P1]</p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The participants also mentioned examples of good collaboration, where they perceived support from other departments and disciplines. These networks were used to find ways to implement evidence-based medicine and to adjust and synchronize activities among the different disciplines and departments. They perceived great collaborations that involved all stakeholders as essential to achieve the implementation of successful changes or to find solutions for current issues. Participants expressed a desire to have more multidisciplinary meetings to gain new perspectives from different disciplines and feel involved in all aspects of patient care.</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>A better collaboration during multidisciplinary meetings is needed, with different disciplines. One needs to get one’s discipline involved in the meetings. Because often, yeah, often they forget us. Moreover, I think it is essential, that I am present (at the meetings), remember, I want to participate. [P8]</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transparency and communication</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the central themes that came across from the analysis was a need for more transparency and communication. Participants were unsatisfied with the current transparency, and the current way innovations and policies were implemented. They felt they were not involved in the current decision-making process or did not get sufficient response to their initiatives to improve health care.</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>I do notice, that there is a select group of people higher up in the organization, who are behind closed doors, preparing some things, and then they tell us: changes are coming up, and the things will be thoroughly thought through and analyzed. However, I have not witnessed this yet, despite hearing about it for years. [P6]</p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lack of transparency also caused a feeling that some procedures were unnecessarily bureaucratic. For instance, the health care professionals had written their guidelines to improve the health care on a specific topic. However, those protocols had first to be officially approved, which did not happen or resulted in delays for the implementation.</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>We are supposed to have protocols and guidelines. Meanwhile, some are stuck in the regulatory department, with the people who are supposed to approve the protocols before they are implemented […]. The protocols are just stuck there for no known the reasons. So, yeah, we are still waiting. In the meantime, one has to continue treating the patients. [P2]</p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lack of transparency and communication led to unclarity about the current policies as well as losing credibility. Heads of departments even mentioned they did not inform their staff about new changes, because they were afraid that if the new policies were changing over and over, they would lose their credibility among their staff members.</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>There is no clarity, which leads to uncertainty among the staff (over time). As a supervisor, one wants to know what to communicate to one’s department, which can sometimes turn out to be frustrating. At one point, because of regular postponement, I decided to stop communicating with my staff about the date of supply of some needed materials and equipment, until they were finally delivered simply because of the risk of losing my credibility. [P10]</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Personal development</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of the experiences of the participants showed that another factor influencing the implementation climate in SEHOS was the (opportunity for) personal development. Participants mentioned that there was insufficient appreciation by their managers and a limitation in career possibilities as something that influenced their motivation. Another factor that became apparent was the lack of education and training possibilities. Participants expressed the desire to develop themselves but felt that they did not get the opportunities to attend courses or training sessions to gain more insight.</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>The career possibilities in this hospital are quite limited. Especially in the care department. So, at one point, one gets the feeling to have reached the ceiling for further professional growth. [P6]</p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants expressed the need for the hospital to pay more attention to their personal development. They perceived that training opportunities to acquire essential skills and knowledge needed to help them to stay up to date with current developments in the profession were insufficient. They argued that these limitations contributed to the perceived sense of high workload in their duties, not being able to meet set targets, and not having the capacity to implement health care improvement projects. Consequently, working on new policies was not considered to be a priority given these current circumstances.</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>We need the right people doing the right job. If you do not have those people, then you cannot meet the set targets. [P1]</p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the participants highlighted the need for more investment in material resources and setting realistic targets, our analysis revealed that there was also a lot of improvisation and the use of creative ways to deal with the lack of resources.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resources</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Health care workers expressed resources as one of the barriers that prevented working on new policies and implementing innovations that could potentially improve the health care delivery in the hospital. The comments of the participants showed that human resources (staffing, both in numbers and competencies and skills), physical structures (infrastructure), and education were the significant determinants of resource shortage. Participants mentioned that often they were understaffed, as well as not always fully equipped or trained for the given tasks.</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>I need another internist with a specialty in infectious diseases. Unfortunately, there is a fixed quota to the number of internal medicine specialists that are allowed to work on the island. We have already exceeded that number which is another limitation so to say. In essence, we need an additional person, but because of all of the different rules hiring another specialist is quite tricky. [P4]</p>
   <p>It is no longer doable. Patients have become more complicated. We have many surgeries a day, except on Friday and lately, we have had many temporary workers. Because they are primarily involved in the basic care, they cannot give the support (specialized care) we need in the surgery department, and that is not responsible care. [P1]</p>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The respondents mentioned physical means, ie, material as another challenge in the current health care system on the island. The lack of funding expressed itself in a shortage of medicines, tools, and a lack of digital equipment. However, experiences of the participants showed that it was not always the lack of physical means, but also the improper allocation of the means that could result in a shortage.</p>
  <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <p>Yes, patients should receive reliable care, but if you don’t have the means to provide the services sufficiently […] and if the staff needs to take courses and there is limited funding to attend these courses, then the process runs into jeopardy. Despite the fact that funds are limited, we still do a lot by being creative. For example, recycling materials and redesigning it for other purposes. [P3]</p>
   <p>There are not enough decubitus matrasses. Meanwhile it is just a cheap investment. I heard that they just cost a hundred and fifty gulden (equivalent to 84 USD). That is apparently ten times cheaper than the treatment for a chronic decubitus wound. [P9]</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potential consequences/effects</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the previously mentioned factors had several consequences. Participants mentioned they had the idea that current policies were shortsighted. They felt that a lack of a long-term vision and a shortage in current resources were responsible for this, resulting in ad hoc solutions for current issues rather than finding a long-term solution. Experiences also showed that there was much unclarity due to the lack of transparency, which also led to the hospital administrators losing credibility among the staff members. Next to that, the participants also experienced some consequences themselves. Account of their experiences showed that they sometimes lost motivation and felt hopeless when it came to working on new policies that could aid in the health quality improvement. Other personal consequences included the feeling of suspicion toward all new policy implementations and not feeling connected to other departments: having an “us vs them” feeling. However, the reflected challenges also cause creativity among health care workers to find new ways in which they could still improve the current health care delivery.
