 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A variety of concerns were brought up during the interviews. A performance dashboard might increase physician stress levels, dehumanize the patient experience, and potentially negatively affect the quality and safety of care: “
  <span class="italic">Yeah, if I’m seeing four patients an hour and I need to have a dispo [disposition decision] on each of them within an hour and a half or two hours or whatever the ED group tells you is the right metric then probably I’m cutting a lot of corners not having substance of conversations with the patient, not providing great patient care.</span>” (Interview 7). Additional concerns were related to physicians’ responsibility to teach the many residents in the ED, which could be negatively affected. “
  <span class="italic">A lot of times we give the residents a lot of leeway to think things through. And part of that is that we haven’t had to move on a very like super-fast time process. [ …</span>] 
  <span class="italic">if you’re having time in the ED as something you’re thinking about more than necessarily clinical accuracy, it’s ... it is gonna change the way we practice with supervision.”</span> (Interview 4).

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data accuracy was a concern as well, given that electronic medical record (EMR) data might not always be accurate. 
  <span class="italic">“All of your metrics are only as good as the people putting them in, and that’s always gonna be, you know, um, an issue with accuracy [ …</span>]. 
  <span class="italic">”</span> (Interview 1). Interviewees also expressed the need to correct for the acuity of patients seen and the shift. 
  <span class="italic">“Oh, if you work more night shifts you’re gonna see more of them [more challenging cases]. Probably have to control for shift in some way.”</span> (Interview 4). Additionally, concerns were expressed regarding gaming of the system and problems with attribution of patients to the right physician, especially in a teaching hospital with many residents. 
  <span class="italic">“When they’re finally put in to a room, they very well may see a different resident and attending at that point. So, there may be three different [physicians involved]. And that’s not even counting change of shift.</span>” (Interview 8).
