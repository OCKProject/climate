 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of eight semi-structured interviews were performed to guide the initial design of the performance feedback dashboard between May and August 2017 (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Table S1). Half of the interviewees were male, their median time since starting residency was 12 years (range 9–45), and their median length of employment in the current ED was 8 years (range 2–31). Two of the interviewees had primarily leadership roles, three primarily clinical responsibilities, and three primarily academic responsibilities. Two were employed by the LA County Department of Health and six by USC. The median duration of the interviews was 57 min (range 35–77). Thematic saturation was achieved after seven interviews; no new themes emerged in the eighth interview.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dashboard content – metrics</div>
  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerous metrics were discussed in the interviews, including the number of patients, their discharge disposition, and a variety of length of stay, utilization, and outcomes measures (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Table S2). Overall, the time between the moment a physician first sees the patient until the moment a disposition decision is made (i.e. decision to admit a patient to the hospital or discharge from the ED), was perceived to be the most relevant LOS metric. “
   <span class="italic">Provider to decision time. Yeah, I think that’s an important metric, I think that there’s probably some wiggle room in there. In general, I think that’s an important part of our job is to have a disposition decision within whatever time frame we deem to be appropriate</span>.” (Interview 7).
  </p>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, test utilization, including CT scans, MR scans, and labs, was thought to be of interest, especially if compared to peer utilization. 
   <span class="italic">“I think the number of yes [sic], I order 500 CT-scans in a year, and somebody else orders three, would be interesting. It would be interesting to know the false positives and the false [negatives].”</span> (Interview 5). Interviewees also expressed an interest to know the outcomes of their decisions, or what happened to patients after they left the ED: “
   <span class="italic">Bounce backs, maybe? Stuff that’s, like, more subjective, like, you know, your decisions on the patient. [ …</span>] 
   <span class="italic">you admit someone to the floor and they die. Should they have gone to the ICU? Or you discharge them and they die. [ …</span>] 
   <span class="italic">That’d be nice to know.</span>” (Interview 2).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dashboard content – comparisons</div>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewees expressed the importance of comparing their data to others and of including historic trends. “
   <span class="italic">So ideally [the data] would be where you are, where you were the previous month, or the previous time last year. And then where the department is.</span>” (Interview 8). Ideally data would have to be aggregated on a weekly or monthly basis, as a day would not provide useful information because shifts vary day to day, while a year would be too long to remember. “
   <span class="italic">[ …</span>] 
   <span class="italic">if you wait too long then it doesn’t make any sense to you because you’re like, ‘That happened in September of last year. I don’t care. I don’t know what happened then.’ If you do it every day, then they’re kind of like, ‘Well, how am I supposed to know what I’m supposed to change?’</span>” (Interview 2). Interviewees wanted to receive their data compared to their peers in a blinded fashion. Some expressed discomfort with others seeing their data: “
   <span class="italic">I’m personally um, scared you know, scared to be compared with others.</span>” (Interview 3). Others didn’t think it would be necessary to share the data openly to achieve change: “
   <span class="italic">We serve as our sort of biggest critics already and that for us to see it is enough to be like a blow to an ego where you can say, ‘Oh wow, I’m that slow compared to my colleagues?’</span> ” (Interview 7).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dashboard functionality</div>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three key themes emerged in the discussions about desired functionality of the performance feedback dashboard. First, participants emphasized the need for the dashboard to be easily accessible to increase the likelihood that people would actually use the dashboard. “
   <span class="italic">If it’s like one more thing to do, I might not do it. It would have, it would have to be something that was like every time you logged in it popped up or something, or I would not look at it. Yeah. I’m not gonna go seek out that information.”</span> (Interview 4). On the other hand, physicians did want to be able to drill down the data further to know what happened during specific shifts or with specific patients. “
   <span class="italic">Ideally for people that have unscheduled returns, I would like to see why ... I would like their name, their medical record number so I could look them up and also then what happened to them on the return visit.”</span> (Interview 8). Lastly, interviewees expressed that they would like to see a certain level of customization to define metrics of interest for them: “a 
   <span class="italic">good dashboard should give you the ability to, um, customize it, customize the view and the parameters that you look at for your, for your position at that time. Um, and you should be able to change that on the fly.</span>” (Interview 1).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Barriers and unintended consequences</div>
  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A variety of concerns were brought up during the interviews. A performance dashboard might increase physician stress levels, dehumanize the patient experience, and potentially negatively affect the quality and safety of care: “
   <span class="italic">Yeah, if I’m seeing four patients an hour and I need to have a dispo [disposition decision] on each of them within an hour and a half or two hours or whatever the ED group tells you is the right metric then probably I’m cutting a lot of corners not having substance of conversations with the patient, not providing great patient care.</span>” (Interview 7). Additional concerns were related to physicians’ responsibility to teach the many residents in the ED, which could be negatively affected. “
   <span class="italic">A lot of times we give the residents a lot of leeway to think things through. And part of that is that we haven’t had to move on a very like super-fast time process. [ …</span>] 
   <span class="italic">if you’re having time in the ED as something you’re thinking about more than necessarily clinical accuracy, it’s ... it is gonna change the way we practice with supervision.”</span> (Interview 4).
  </p>
  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data accuracy was a concern as well, given that electronic medical record (EMR) data might not always be accurate. 
   <span class="italic">“All of your metrics are only as good as the people putting them in, and that’s always gonna be, you know, um, an issue with accuracy [ …</span>]. 
   <span class="italic">”</span> (Interview 1). Interviewees also expressed the need to correct for the acuity of patients seen and the shift. 
   <span class="italic">“Oh, if you work more night shifts you’re gonna see more of them [more challenging cases]. Probably have to control for shift in some way.”</span> (Interview 4). Additionally, concerns were expressed regarding gaming of the system and problems with attribution of patients to the right physician, especially in a teaching hospital with many residents. 
   <span class="italic">“When they’re finally put in to a room, they very well may see a different resident and attending at that point. So, there may be three different [physicians involved]. And that’s not even counting change of shift.</span>” (Interview 8).
