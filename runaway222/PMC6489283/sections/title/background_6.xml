 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emergency Departments (EDs) often face problems related to overcrowding and long waiting times [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>] which leads to reduced quality and efficiency, as patients may decompensate or leave before being seen [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Long length of stay (LOS) in the ED is associated with higher seven-day mortality rates, more unnecessary hospital admissions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>], and less patient-centered care [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. Many factors likely contribute to long LOS, including patient volume and acuity, ED space and staffing [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>], and the number of diagnostic tests (e.g. lab and imaging tests) ordered [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. While many of these LOS factors are influenced by circumstances out of physicians’ control, the number of diagnostic tests ordered is directly influenced by the behavior of ED physicians. This is especially important as the number of lab and imaging tests ordered varies substantially across physicians and overutilization is a common quality concern [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>], which delays the care delivery process and can cause harm to patients [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A variety of implementation strategies are used to change physicians’ practice patterns, ranging from educational methods to financial incentives and regulations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Audit and feedback, the process of showing physicians performance feedback dashboards that compare their performance to their peers’, is a strategy that generally achieves small to moderate behavioral changes in healthcare settings [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Audit and feedback interventions work better when feedback is more intensive, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>] the reported outcomes are actionable [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>], and there is trust in the accuracy of the data [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. Additionally, the perceived importance of the goal is important in achieving behavior change [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. However, many questions remain about the most effective ways to deliver an audit and feedback intervention [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The involvement of end-users in the design of the intervention is likely to improve its effectiveness, though this has yet to be formally evaluated in the ED setting [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Involvement of end-users mitigates the risk of creating an ineffective system that does not adequately meet users’ needs. This concept has long been understood in the field of human-centered design. Human-centered design is an approach that systematically incorporates end-user feedback throughout the design process [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. This process helps to ensure that the design is functional, supports the end-user’s goals, and fits the organizational context [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Additionally, it ensures ease-of-use and usefulness of the technology, thereby engendering more positive attitudes towards the technology [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The implementation setting in which an audit and feedback intervention takes place also affects the desired behavior changes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Organizational culture is thought to be a motivational force that shapes practitioners’ behaviors, attitudes, and thought-processes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. The underlying social networks, in turn, have been shown to impact culture and beliefs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. Social networks also influence human behavior, as illustrated by evidence in the use of contraception [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>] or attitudes towards smoking [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. The social network within the workplace has been shown to influence physician behavior as well [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Additionally, the social network is integral to innovation diffusion, which demonstrates the role of interpersonal connections in the adoption of new technology [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we describe the development and exploratory evaluation of a performance feedback dashboard in the ED setting with the goal to reduce LOS. We employ a human-centered design approach to identify the most suitable measures to include on the dashboard and to ensure essential design requirements are met. We hypothesize that the systematic involvement of end-users in the design process will lead to a more appropriate intervention design and superior usability. This would improve physicians’ likelihood of using the performance feedback dashboard and increase their motivation to change practice patterns. Additionally, we hypothesize that both adoption and motivation are affected by the underlying culture and social network of the department.</p>
