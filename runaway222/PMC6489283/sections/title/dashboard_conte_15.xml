 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerous metrics were discussed in the interviews, including the number of patients, their discharge disposition, and a variety of length of stay, utilization, and outcomes measures (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Table S2). Overall, the time between the moment a physician first sees the patient until the moment a disposition decision is made (i.e. decision to admit a patient to the hospital or discharge from the ED), was perceived to be the most relevant LOS metric. “
  <span class="italic">Provider to decision time. Yeah, I think that’s an important metric, I think that there’s probably some wiggle room in there. In general, I think that’s an important part of our job is to have a disposition decision within whatever time frame we deem to be appropriate</span>.” (Interview 7).

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, test utilization, including CT scans, MR scans, and labs, was thought to be of interest, especially if compared to peer utilization. 
  <span class="italic">“I think the number of yes [sic], I order 500 CT-scans in a year, and somebody else orders three, would be interesting. It would be interesting to know the false positives and the false [negatives].”</span> (Interview 5). Interviewees also expressed an interest to know the outcomes of their decisions, or what happened to patients after they left the ED: “
  <span class="italic">Bounce backs, maybe? Stuff that’s, like, more subjective, like, you know, your decisions on the patient. [ …</span>] 
  <span class="italic">you admit someone to the floor and they die. Should they have gone to the ICU? Or you discharge them and they die. [ …</span>] 
  <span class="italic">That’d be nice to know.</span>” (Interview 2).
