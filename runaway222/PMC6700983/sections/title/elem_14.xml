   <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most FPs believed that they had sufficient competence in psychiatry, especially regarding depression, to make adequate clinical judgements without the MINI. However, they perceived that the MINI could offer extra help with complicated patients, which usually were referred to therapists (Q1, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). Some FPs expressed that their diagnostic knowledge and skills were insufficient due to too little training or experience. These FPs referred patients more broadly, including those with less complicated situations.
   </p>
   <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The patients often expressed that FPs had insufficient competence in psychiatry. Some of them anticipated that psychiatry was not a part of the FPs’ education. Therefore, according to them, psychiatry was not the business of the FP but for therapists with their education in psychology. Referral was thus seen as natural from the patients’ perspectives (Q2, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).
   </p>
   <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, FPs’ communication of the purpose of the MINI was described as a skill that could influence the patients’ motivation to be referred. Both patients and therapists provided examples where lacking or unclear information from the FP had made the patient feel unsafe or disinterested in the referral (Q3, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>) For patients, the consultation style could be problematic. The FP took over the agenda and did not give the patients the opportunity to talk as they had wanted to (Q4, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). Other patients felt that the FPs concentrated on somatic problems instead of trying to find out what was really distressing them. In addition, at PHCC1, the competence of the FP influenced the feedback of the MINI results from the therapist to the FP. The therapist felt that a discussion was especially important for inexperienced FPs.

   <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The priorities of the management of the two PHCCs differed and influenced the process. At PHCC1, the manager encouraged the study and the referral process. She/he was interested in the results and in whether these results would suggest a decision to change routines. The therapist was given time for the assessment, which resulted in easy access to the therapist. At PHCC2, the management at that time introduced a new patient record system, which was given high priority. The FPs got less time to assess complicated psychological symptomatology, which contributed to increased referrals.</p>

     </p>
    </div>
   </p>
   <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feedback discussions of the MINI results were hampered by a lack of supportive routines as expressed by FPs and therapists. At PHCC1, the FPs had no time allocated for feedback discussions, which annoyed them. At PHCC2, no policies were in place concerning communication between FPs and therapists. Thus, discussions were few and ad hoc. For both PHCCs, communication tended to take place in the lunch room or during short breaks between patients, which was seen as not acceptable (Q5, Q6, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).

    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). This was even more problematic when psychological symptoms were not the reasons given for a visit. As expressed by an FP:
    <div class="disp-quote">
     <p id="Par44">
      <span class="italic">‘I often experience that patients test us. They visit for something else, like acne, but you feel that they are not focused on the problem. They want to see if they can trust you and then, at the end of the consultation, they bring up that they have felt moody for a long time’</span> (FP 1, PHCC2).
     </p>
    </div>
   </p>
   <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The patients experienced that short consultations led to frustrated FPs who already had the next patient in mind and thus did not listen to them thoroughly (Q8, Table

   <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The FPs perceived that some patients were not keen on being referred for a MINI assessment (Q10, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>) Some patients did not believe that they had a mental problem, others with longstanding problems did not want an extra visit to the PHCC. Such patients were not referred to the therapist at PHCC1, as the FPs did not want to persuade patients.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Process facilitator or change agent available</div>
   <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At PHCC1, the therapist spontaneously assumed the responsibility of acting as a facilitator. Initially, the FPs forgot to refer patients, and the therapist sent reminders. The FPs appreciated this and increased their referrals. The therapist also took every opportunity to share the MINI results with the FP orally, as recommended in the guidance for the study (Q11, Q12, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).

   <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to all respondent groups, the diagnostic process saved the FPs’ time and effort (Q13, Q14, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>) The FPs compared the process with referrals for somatic problems, e.g. spirometry, that specialised asthma nurses performed. FPs at PHCC1 expressed that psychiatric problems should be handled in the same way and appreciated the diagnostic process.
   </p>
   <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another advantage was that the therapists could offer the patients a more comforting atmosphere and more time for reflection and building confidence than what was possible during an FP consultation, according to the respondent groups at PHCC1. As a result, the patient could provide more well-grounded information, which the FPs at PHCC1 saw as a benefit (Q15, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).

   <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All respondent groups agreed that an inter-professional diagnostic process could provide benefits to the patient (Q16, Q17, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). The patients expressed that a major benefit was that the assessment was made from both a medical and a psychological perspective (Q18, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).
   </p>
   <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At PHCC1, such cooperation was established to a varying degree. The therapist presented the results, and often the FP and the therapist discussed how to proceed with the patient. This included treatment options as well as whether the patient needed referral to psychiatry. However, some FPs preferred to ponder the results and did not involve the therapist in the treatment choice.</p>
   <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At PHCC2, minimal collaboration took place between FPs and therapists, except for when a therapist judged that a patient needed referral to psychiatry. In these cases, the therapist prepared the referral documents. Often, the therapist said that the FP just signed them without further discussion. However, the therapists and the FPs noted that feedback on decisions could be valuable, e.g. in the form of a short meeting. According to them, patients could feel confused by the perceived different messages from the FP and the therapist. Some patients confirmed this as well.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="FPar8" class="sec">
   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beliefs about professional roles</div>
   <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beliefs about professional roles affected the motivation for referral and feedback discussions. At PHCC1, the inter-professional process did not interfere with existing roles. The FP maintained the patient responsibility, including decisions to refer patients for CBT. A discussion on results and actions to be taken was seen as rewarding among both FPs and therapist.</p>
   <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The therapist perceived increased competence with the new task. Furthermore, becoming more familiar with the MINI, the therapist took her own initiatives, using the MINI for non-assessed patients where the referral form seemed vague and then communicating the results to the FP.</p>
   <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At PHCC2, neither the FPs nor the therapists appreciated the concept of referral for MINI assessment only, albeit for different reasons. The FPs trusted their own assessment skills and felt that they would miss important non-verbal information required for their own diagnostic work if a therapist made the assessment (Q19, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). For the therapists, the diagnostic process was seen as part of creating an alliance and a treatment plan with the patient and thus as an important part of their work. Assisting FPs in their diagnoses was not seen as part of their duties, and furthermore, they did not trust the FPs’ ability to interpret the results from the MINI (Q20, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).

They had positive experiences with their first patients and increased their referrals, widening to patients who were outside the scope of this study, e.g. patients with suspected eating disorders (Q21, Q22, Table 
    <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). However, others lost interest in the referral when some patients declined the offered assessment.
