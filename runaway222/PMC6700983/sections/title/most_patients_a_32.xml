 <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many patients were satisfied with meeting FPs first and then being referred to therapists for assessment (Q25, Q26, Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). If they were dissatisfied, it most often was related to mistrust, of either the FPs or the therapists, rather than to the referral procedure. Some patients, though, found the FP visits to be unnecessary. They perceived that they already knew their problems and wanted psychological treatment immediately. They saw the FP visits as a formality without any clear benefit. Others wanted to shorten the time to treatment and suggested that the FP could conduct the MINI during the visit rather than referring the patient to a therapist.
