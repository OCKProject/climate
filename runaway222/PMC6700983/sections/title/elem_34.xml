 <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that referral to a therapist for MINI assessment with feedback to the FP can be feasible in primary care. This would be an approach closer to the established standards for the diagnosis of mental disorders [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. We also found that referrals to therapists for MINI assessments were influenced by the FPs’ knowledge in psychiatry and their beliefs that the process saved time and improved patient care. Furthermore, the priorities of the management and established habits influenced whether FPs referred patients to therapists. The second part of the inter-professional diagnostic process, i.e. a feedback discussion of the MINI results between the FPs and therapists, was influenced by existing routines, the division of tasks and views on professional roles.
 </p>
 <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The idea was to build on the routines used for somatic diseases, where FPs refer to other professionals for more comprehensive examinations but retains the patient responsibility including final diagnosis and decision on treatment. To our knowledge, referral to a therapist was not studied earlier in primary care settings. However, two other studies found that referral to a nurse for assessment with structured interviews was well accepted among FPs in primary care [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. However, these studies focused on time saving only and did not include feedback discussions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The adoption of the diagnostic process could be hampered by beliefs from FPs and therapists on responsibilities and professional roles, which was illustrated in the present study.</p>
 <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At PHCC2, the FPs did not consider the reasons for referral to assessment only convincing enough. The FPs perceived that non-verbal information was lost if the assessment with the MINI was made by someone else, and that they trusted their own competence. The therapists stressed that diagnosis was part of the treatment and that they doubted that FPs could interpret the results. However, due to lack of time the FPs handed over the diagnosis of complicated patients to the therapists with the underlying assumption that the therapists would also initiate psychotherapy if appropriate. This task division would be more in line with models such as Collaborative Care (Gunn 2006 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]) or IAPT (Clarke 2011 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]).
 </p>
 <p id="Par67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the diagnostic processes were partly different at the PHCCs, the identified barriers to and enablers of the process were mostly similar. The COM-B analysis revealed that 11 main factors influenced the diagnostic process. First, the short consultation times the FPs had with patients and their beliefs that referrals relieved their workloads were driving forces for the FPs to refer patients to the therapists. This is in contrast to a prior study [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>] where FPs and nurses expressed that opportunities for learning from each other and exchanging ideas, rather than decreased workloads, enabled their inter-professional work. In our study, the time might have been a crucial factor because FPs in primary care have high demands with regards to meeting many patients per day to meet the reimbursement targets.
 </p>
 <p id="Par68" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The FPs’ knowledge and skills in psychiatry were identified as another determinant of practice and mainly operated as an enabler. FPs with less experience saw referrals as positive opportunities for a broad range of patients. However, most FPs perceived themselves as having good capabilities in the diagnosis of especially depression, in line with the current literature [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. For them, referral was chosen for patients with more complex problems, which was reported in another study [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. Easy access and working relationships with a therapist were essential for the FPs, which has also been seen in other studies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par69" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second part of the process was the feedback discussion of the MINI results, which required collaboration between the FPs and the therapists. The patients expressed that teamwork between the professionals was essential for the diagnosis of mental problems. However, at the outset, no teamwork occurred, as the FPs and therapists worked independently from each other. The success of the feedback part turned out to depend on professional expectations regarding work content. At PHCC1, feedback discussions acted as enablers, as they were seen as rewarding for both FPs and therapists. Prior to the study, the duties of the therapist had been restricted to treatments after referral from a FP. The diagnostic process meant a new competence-increasing task for the therapist. However, the roles were maintained, which the therapist accepted. At PHCC2, the therapists expected to have full responsibility for diagnosis and treatment, and they had strong objections against a process where the FPs made the final diagnoses. A feedback on the diagnosis and treatment was not seen as necessary. The FPs accepted this, although they had wished for better communication. This behaviour was seen in another study, where the implementation of inter-professional work was impeded by a mutual wish to ‘stay apart’ [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Studies have mostly shown that perceptions about professional roles and identities are common barriers to inter-professional work [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par70" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another barrier was that routines for supporting a feedback discussion were not in place. This was illustrated by the difficulties with accomplishing the feedback at PHCC1. Although the management assigned time for the therapist, no time was allocated for the FPs for the feedback discussions. This finding is in accordance with the results from several other studies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Finally, an enabler of the whole process was the availability of a process facilitator or change agent. At PHCC1, the therapist spontaneously took the role. The therapist was seen as central to the success of the referral process by sending reminders and ensuring that the FPs had detailed feedback. The importance of a facilitator or change agent has been shown in many studies, as summarized in [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par71" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The identified barriers and enablers are similar to those found for Collaborative Care in two systematic reviews [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. They found that buy-in was an important determinant for implementation. Lack of time, competing priorities, uncomfortable with setting a diagnosis and treat mental problems decreased buy-in. Perceptions that Collaborative Care gave benefits for the patient increased buy-in. Face-to face meetings were critical for collaboration between professions, according to the reviews. However, the meetings increased work load which was seen as a problem.
 </p>
 <p id="Par72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important issue that is often overlooked is the patient perspective [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. We found that patients were very satisfied with the referral. However, our findings did not suggest that positive patient attitudes motivated the FPs to refer. On the contrary, the experiences of meeting some unwilling patients were arguments for not referring. Whether patients’ perspectives influence the implementation of new work methods has been studied very little [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. In our study, patients had many thoughts about professional roles and about who should be responsible for the diagnoses, which can be useful information. Although referrals for MINIs were appreciated, some patients preferred that FPs conduct the MINIs. Others wanted to meet with a therapist directly.

  <p id="Par73" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the process included a modification of professional roles, the study contributes to the literature on environmental restructuring, where the evidence is currently limited [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par74" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A strength of this study is that it took the perspectives of patients as well as FPs and therapists into account. This provided a finer-grained view of factors that can impact the inter-professional process, rather than simply listening to the FPs only. Another strength is that the analysis was based on an established behaviour model, COM-B. As the model is increasingly used (see e.g. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>]) it will facilitate future comparison with other studies that have used the model.
  </p>
  <p id="Par75" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study had several limitations. The main limitation relates to the selection of PHCCs. Participation required that the managers be willing to invest in time for the assessment and for data collection. This resulted in the inclusion of only two PHCCs, where one had several positive buy-in factors influencing the process whereas the second had not. Thus, the study only indicates that given positive prerequisites for buy-in the intended process may work. A second issue relates to the completeness of the data collection. All FPs were invited to the focus groups, but only around half of them participated. Most of these FPs had referred patients. Thus, it is possible that more barriers against the use of referrals existed than those we captured.</p>
  <p id="Par76" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, it was not possible to gather information about the number of patients that fulfilled eligibility criteria but were not referred or the reasons behind not referring, which had been interesting.</p>
