 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two types of data were collected. All 110 patients were asked to rate their satisfaction with the referral with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0–100) as last part of a questionnaire. Experiences and perceptions about the referral were gathered from semi-structured interviews with 22 patients and the therapists and focus groups with the FPs. The interviews and focus groups were supported with topic guides (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) and were audio-recorded. The interviewees were informed that the study was of interest to the Stockholm County Council healthcare administration. None of the interviewees was known to the interviewer beforehand.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AP interviewed the patients individually, and they chose the dates and locations. The interviews were conducted between 2 weeks and 2 months after the MINI assessment. They lasted approximately 30 min, and the patients were offered vouchers for cinema tickets (value of 12 euros each).</p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AP interviewed the three therapists at their workplaces after the pilot study. All FPs were invited to focus group discussions [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], two at PHCC1 and one at PHCC2. AP and IK moderated the discussions, ensuring that all participants were involved. The interviews and the focus groups lasted for around 45 min. The only compensation was a light meal in connection with the meeting. A preliminary analysis of the barriers to and enablers of the diagnostic process was presented at a meeting with FPs and with the therapist at PHCC1 in Autumn 2016. The participants found the results to be in accordance with their experiences.
