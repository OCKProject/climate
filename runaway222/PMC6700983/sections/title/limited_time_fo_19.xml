 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All respondent groups perceived that the FPs’ consultation times were insufficient for dealing with undetermined psychological symptoms (Q7, Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). This was even more problematic when psychological symptoms were not the reasons given for a visit. As expressed by an FP:
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par44">
    <span class="italic">‘I often experience that patients test us. They visit for something else, like acne, but you feel that they are not focused on the problem. They want to see if they can trust you and then, at the end of the consultation, they bring up that they have felt moody for a long time’</span> (FP 1, PHCC2).
   </p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The patients experienced that short consultations led to frustrated FPs who already had the next patient in mind and thus did not listen to them thoroughly (Q8, Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).
