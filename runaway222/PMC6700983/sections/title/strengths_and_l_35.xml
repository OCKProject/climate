 <p id="Par73" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the process included a modification of professional roles, the study contributes to the literature on environmental restructuring, where the evidence is currently limited [

 <p id="Par74" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A strength of this study is that it took the perspectives of patients as well as FPs and therapists into account. This provided a finer-grained view of factors that can impact the inter-professional process, rather than simply listening to the FPs only. Another strength is that the analysis was based on an established behaviour model, COM-B. As the model is increasingly used (see e.g. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>â€“
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>]) it will facilitate future comparison with other studies that have used the model.

 <p id="Par75" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study had several limitations. The main limitation relates to the selection of PHCCs. Participation required that the managers be willing to invest in time for the assessment and for data collection. This resulted in the inclusion of only two PHCCs, where one had several positive buy-in factors influencing the process whereas the second had not. Thus, the study only indicates that given positive prerequisites for buy-in the intended process may work. A second issue relates to the completeness of the data collection. All FPs were invited to the focus groups, but only around half of them participated. Most of these FPs had referred patients. Thus, it is possible that more barriers against the use of referrals existed than those we captured.</p>
 <p id="Par76" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, it was not possible to gather information about the number of patients that fulfilled eligibility criteria but were not referred or the reasons behind not referring, which had been interesting.</p>
