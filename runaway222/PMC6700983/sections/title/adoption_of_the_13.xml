 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At PHCC1, nine out of the 15 FPs referred patients (average of seven patients, range one to 17 per FP) according to the study plan. After feedback of the results, the FPs made their diagnosis and initiated treatment. At PHCC2, a third diagnostic process had developed (See Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>, column 3). The FPs had discontinued their previous use of the MINI.. Patients with complex problems were referred to the therapists for more comprehensive examinations including the MINI. The therapists then, made the final diagnosis and initiated psychological treatment. There was no further involvement from the FPs, except when the therapist judged that referral to psychiatry was warranted (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>, column 3).
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According the answers to the question “How satisfied are you of being interviewed by a therapist as part of clarifying your problems?” the patients appreciated the referrals to therapists. The median satisfaction was 92 (ICR 75, 100; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 102 patients, no differences between PHCCs).
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many patients had previous experiences from visiting health care facilities for psychiatric problems. In the interviews, they compared the visits and perceived that the diagnostic process including referral to a therapist was more thorough.</p>
