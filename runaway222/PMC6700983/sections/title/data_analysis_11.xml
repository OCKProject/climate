 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The VAS scores for satisfaction with the referral were estimated with a ruler and the medians and interquartile range (IQR) were calculated. Ten patients from PHCC2 did not rate the referral.</p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interviews were transcribed verbatim. Analyses of the interviews and focus groups were based on qualitative content analysis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>â€“
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. AP coded the transcripts, and SM verified the codes. SM and AP independently defined subcategories and categories, and they were agreed upon by consensus.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two analyses were performed. The first served to explore the experiences of the diagnostic process, with the process steps serving as main categories. The second was aimed at identifying factors that influenced whether the FP referred. The COM-B components were used as main categories. For both analyses, an inductive content analysis was performed for each main category. Finally, categories across the participant groups were created. The whole process was continuously carried out forwards and backwards, considering other possibilities, and involved all authors.</p>
