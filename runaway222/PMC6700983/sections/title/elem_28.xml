  <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some FPs at PHCC1, as told by the FPs and the therapist, changed their habits. They had positive experiences with their first patients and increased their referrals, widening to patients who were outside the scope of this study, e.g. patients with suspected eating disorders (Q21, Q22, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). However, others lost interest in the referral when some patients declined the offered assessment.

  <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The urge to continue working according to established routines was a strong factor against referral, according to the FPs (Q23, Q24, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). It did not matter that they were aware that referrals were useful.
  </p>
  <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The FPs also expressed that, for patients who already had been diagnosed elsewhere, it was easier to accept the diagnoses and initiate treatment, even though these diagnoses might not be the correct ones.</p>
