  <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The FPs perceived that some patients were not keen on being referred for a MINI assessment (Q10, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>) Some patients did not believe that they had a mental problem, others with longstanding problems did not want an extra visit to the PHCC. Such patients were not referred to the therapist at PHCC1, as the FPs did not want to persuade patients.

  <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At PHCC1, the therapist spontaneously assumed the responsibility of acting as a facilitator. Initially, the FPs forgot to refer patients, and the therapist sent reminders. The FPs appreciated this and increased their referrals. The therapist also took every opportunity to share the MINI results with the FP orally, as recommended in the guidance for the study (Q11, Q12, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).
