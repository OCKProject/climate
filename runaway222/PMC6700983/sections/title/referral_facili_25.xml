 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to all respondent groups, the diagnostic process saved the FPsâ€™ time and effort (Q13, Q14, Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>) The FPs compared the process with referrals for somatic problems, e.g. spirometry, that specialised asthma nurses performed. FPs at PHCC1 expressed that psychiatric problems should be handled in the same way and appreciated the diagnostic process.

 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another advantage was that the therapists could offer the patients a more comforting atmosphere and more time for reflection and building confidence than what was possible during an FP consultation, according to the respondent groups at PHCC1. As a result, the patient could provide more well-grounded information, which the FPs at PHCC1 saw as a benefit (Q15, Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).
