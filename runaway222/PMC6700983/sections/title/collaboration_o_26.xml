 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All respondent groups agreed that an inter-professional diagnostic process could provide benefits to the patient (Q16, Q17, Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). The patients expressed that a major benefit was that the assessment was made from both a medical and a psychological perspective (Q18, Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At PHCC1, such cooperation was established to a varying degree. The therapist presented the results, and often the FP and the therapist discussed how to proceed with the patient. This included treatment options as well as whether the patient needed referral to psychiatry. However, some FPs preferred to ponder the results and did not involve the therapist in the treatment choice.</p>
 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At PHCC2, minimal collaboration took place between FPs and therapists, except for when a therapist judged that a patient needed referral to psychiatry. In these cases, the therapist prepared the referral documents. Often, the therapist said that the FP just signed them without further discussion. However, the therapists and the FPs noted that feedback on decisions could be valuable, e.g. in the form of a short meeting. According to them, patients could feel confused by the perceived different messages from the FP and the therapist. Some patients confirmed this as well.</p>
