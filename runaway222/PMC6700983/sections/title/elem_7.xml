  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2013 the Stockholm County Council healthcare administration decided to support the implementation of the MINI in primary care. A naturalistic pilot study that investigated the feasibility of the MINI and of a referral to a therapist for the assessment was undertaken. It should serve as guidance for the implementation in accordance with the Medical Research Council guidelines [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. The study was carried out in three primary health care centers (PHCC) in Stockholm County between February 2014 and March 2015. Findings pertaining to perceptions about the MINI itself and its use have been reported elsewhere [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. Here we report the results that are related to the diagnostic process.
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Sweden, primary care receives funding from the county councils, which either manage PHCCs on their own or assign them to private healthcare providers. The PHCCs employ a range of professions, e.g. FPs, either certified or under specialist training, district nurses, physiotherapists and, increasingly, psychosocial teams with psychologists and social medical workers. PHCCs are the first level of care for psychiatry. Patients are assessed by an FP. If patients are considered to have a mental problem requiring treatment, the FP either initiates drug treatment or refers them to psychosocial teams or to a psychiatrist.</p>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]). Patients who needed immediate treatment or had cognitive or language problems were excluded. In total, 110 patients were referred to a therapist and consented to participate in the full pilot study, including a question about the satisfaction with the referral. Of these, 40 signed up tentatively for a research interview. Nine women were not contacted in order to maximize variation. Finally, 22 patients consented and participated in the interviews (Table

  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Use of the MINI as well as referral to a therapist for MINI assessment was voluntary for the FPs. The diagnostic process in the study plan comprised three steps, listed in Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>, column 1. The first step was a decision to use the MINI. The second step was a decision to refer to a therapist for the MINI, instead of the FP doing it. The third step was feedback of the results from the therapist, to be used as part of the diagnosis made by the FP. For the feedback, a face-to face communication was recommended. In the present article we are focusing on steps two and three.

  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PHCC1 chose to follow the diagnostic process. A medical social worker, certified in psychotherapy, was designated for the referral. The local management decided that 3 h weekly in the therapist’s schedule were assigned for the MINI assessments. At PHCC2, the FPs were used to conduct the MINI assessment themselves. However, two psychologists had been recruited, and the FPs got an opportunity to refer to them. No extra time for MINI assessments was assigned for the FPs or the therapists.</p>
  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to the study, PHCC1 had an introductory training session that aimed to increase awareness that a correct diagnosis is vital for adequate treatment of mental disorders. This training was not needed at PHCC2. Both PHCCs had a session on the evidence for the MINI to increase the motivation to use it. At the same occasion the study plan and steps two and three was presented and discussed.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data collection</div>
  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two types of data were collected. All 110 patients were asked to rate their satisfaction with the referral with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0–100) as last part of a questionnaire. Experiences and perceptions about the referral were gathered from semi-structured interviews with 22 patients and the therapists and focus groups with the FPs. The interviews and focus groups were supported with topic guides (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) and were audio-recorded. The interviewees were informed that the study was of interest to the Stockholm County Council healthcare administration. None of the interviewees was known to the interviewer beforehand.
  </p>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AP interviewed the patients individually, and they chose the dates and locations. The interviews were conducted between 2 weeks and 2 months after the MINI assessment. They lasted approximately 30 min, and the patients were offered vouchers for cinema tickets (value of 12 euros each).</p>
  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AP interviewed the three therapists at their workplaces after the pilot study. All FPs were invited to focus group discussions [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], two at PHCC1 and one at PHCC2. AP and IK moderated the discussions, ensuring that all participants were involved. The interviews and the focus groups lasted for around 45 min. The only compensation was a light meal in connection with the meeting. A preliminary analysis of the barriers to and enablers of the diagnostic process was presented at a meeting with FPs and with the therapist at PHCC1 in Autumn 2016. The participants found the results to be in accordance with their experiences.

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The VAS scores for satisfaction with the referral were estimated with a ruler and the medians and interquartile range (IQR) were calculated. Ten patients from PHCC2 did not rate the referral.</p>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interviews were transcribed verbatim. Analyses of the interviews and focus groups were based on qualitative content analysis [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. AP coded the transcripts, and SM verified the codes. SM and AP independently defined subcategories and categories, and they were agreed upon by consensus.
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two analyses were performed. The first served to explore the experiences of the diagnostic process, with the process steps serving as main categories. The second was aimed at identifying factors that influenced whether the FP referred. The COM-B components were used as main categories. For both analyses, an inductive content analysis was performed for each main category. Finally, categories across the participant groups were created. The whole process was continuously carried out forwards and backwards, considering other possibilities, and involved all authors.</p>
