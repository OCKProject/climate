  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The priorities of the management of the two PHCCs differed and influenced the process. At PHCC1, the manager encouraged the study and the referral process. She/he was interested in the results and in whether these results would suggest a decision to change routines. The therapist was given time for the assessment, which resulted in easy access to the therapist. At PHCC2, the management at that time introduced a new patient record system, which was given high priority. The FPs got less time to assess complicated psychological symptomatology, which contributed to increased referrals.</p>

     <span class="italic">‘Initially, I wanted to conduct the MINI myself and make my own judgements. Now, I have less time and closer to the therapists, so I feel that we could at least share the burden’</span> (FP 3, PHCC2).

  <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feedback discussions of the MINI results were hampered by a lack of supportive routines as expressed by FPs and therapists. At PHCC1, the FPs had no time allocated for feedback discussions, which annoyed them. At PHCC2, no policies were in place concerning communication between FPs and therapists. Thus, discussions were few and ad hoc. For both PHCCs, communication tended to take place in the lunch room or during short breaks between patients, which was seen as not acceptable (Q5, Q6, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).

  <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All respondent groups perceived that the FPs’ consultation times were insufficient for dealing with undetermined psychological symptoms (Q7, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). This was even more problematic when psychological symptoms were not the reasons given for a visit. As expressed by an FP:
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par44">
     <span class="italic">‘I often experience that patients test us. They visit for something else, like acne, but you feel that they are not focused on the problem. They want to see if they can trust you and then, at the end of the consultation, they bring up that they have felt moody for a long time’</span> (FP 1, PHCC2).
    </p>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The patients experienced that short consultations led to frustrated FPs who already had the next patient in mind and thus did not listen to them thoroughly (Q8, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).

  <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Short waiting times for a visit with a therapist supported referral at both PHCCs (Q9, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). The FPs emphasised that short waiting times were essential for avoiding the delay of treatment.
