  <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to all respondent groups, the diagnostic process saved the FPs’ time and effort (Q13, Q14, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>) The FPs compared the process with referrals for somatic problems, e.g. spirometry, that specialised asthma nurses performed. FPs at PHCC1 expressed that psychiatric problems should be handled in the same way and appreciated the diagnostic process.
  </p>
  <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another advantage was that the therapists could offer the patients a more comforting atmosphere and more time for reflection and building confidence than what was possible during an FP consultation, according to the respondent groups at PHCC1. As a result, the patient could provide more well-grounded information, which the FPs at PHCC1 saw as a benefit (Q15, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Collaboration on diagnosis can improve patient management</div>
  <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All respondent groups agreed that an inter-professional diagnostic process could provide benefits to the patient (Q16, Q17, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). The patients expressed that a major benefit was that the assessment was made from both a medical and a psychological perspective (Q18, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At PHCC1, such cooperation was established to a varying degree. The therapist presented the results, and often the FP and the therapist discussed how to proceed with the patient. This included treatment options as well as whether the patient needed referral to psychiatry. However, some FPs preferred to ponder the results and did not involve the therapist in the treatment choice.</p>
  <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At PHCC2, minimal collaboration took place between FPs and therapists, except for when a therapist judged that a patient needed referral to psychiatry. In these cases, the therapist prepared the referral documents. Often, the therapist said that the FP just signed them without further discussion. However, the therapists and the FPs noted that feedback on decisions could be valuable, e.g. in the form of a short meeting. According to them, patients could feel confused by the perceived different messages from the FP and the therapist. Some patients confirmed this as well.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beliefs about professional roles</div>
  <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beliefs about professional roles affected the motivation for referral and feedback discussions. At PHCC1, the inter-professional process did not interfere with existing roles. The FP maintained the patient responsibility, including decisions to refer patients for CBT. A discussion on results and actions to be taken was seen as rewarding among both FPs and therapist.</p>
  <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The therapist perceived increased competence with the new task. Furthermore, becoming more familiar with the MINI, the therapist took her own initiatives, using the MINI for non-assessed patients where the referral form seemed vague and then communicating the results to the FP.</p>
  <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At PHCC2, neither the FPs nor the therapists appreciated the concept of referral for MINI assessment only, albeit for different reasons. The FPs trusted their own assessment skills and felt that they would miss important non-verbal information required for their own diagnostic work if a therapist made the assessment (Q19, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). For the therapists, the diagnostic process was seen as part of creating an alliance and a treatment plan with the patient and thus as an important part of their work. Assisting FPs in their diagnoses was not seen as part of their duties, and furthermore, they did not trust the FPs’ ability to interpret the results from the MINI (Q20, Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).
