 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Psychiatric problems, such as depression, anxiety and stress-related disorders, are common in the population [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>], and most care seekers with these problems are managed in primary care [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]
  <span class="italic">.</span> One out of four patients in primary care are reported to suffer from depression or anxiety [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. However, it has been questioned whether primary care has sufficient prerequisites for the management of mental problems [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. Issues related to structural limitations and professionals’ competence in mental health have been raised. This article deals with a central aspect of the management of psychiatric problems, the diagnostic process. A formal diagnosis setting is important, as the recording of a diagnosis is associated with a higher chance of adequate treatment [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One corner stone of the diagnostic process is the dialogue between the family physician (FP) and the patient. Here, the patients are encouraged to tell their stories in their own words [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. A diagnosis is established based on the symptoms as well as their duration and severity. However, several studies showed that FPs fail to establish correct diagnoses for half of the patients with depression or anxiety disorders [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Therefore, a structured interview as a part of the consultation has been proposed as a way of improving diagnostics in primary care [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Structured interviews comprise modules for psychiatric disorders, with questions that capture criteria from the two classification systems, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) has high diagnostic accuracy for depressive [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>] and anxiety disorders [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. Thus, the MINI might have the potential to improve the diagnostic procedure in primary care for patients with psychiatric problems.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, indications exist that the MINI seldom is used among FPs in primary care. A questionnaire survey to a large random sample of Swedish FPs found that less than 3 % of the respondents used the MINI [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. The time required for assessment, usually 20–25 min, was one main obstacle [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. As the use and acceptance of the MINI in primary care is sparsely studied [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>], it is unclear what other barriers there are for the use of the MINI. From studies investigating the use of similar tools, such as short patient questionnaires for depression, other barriers can be identified. Researchers found that FPs were reluctant to use the questionnaire and that the FPs preferred to rely on their clinical experience [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. The FPs perceived that the use of standardized instruments did not fit their professional role and that their consultations were disturbed when questionnaires were introduced.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With these barriers in mind, an alternative could be that the FPs refer patients for assessment with the MINI by other care professionals and thereafter integrate the results in their diagnosis and treatment decisions. Therapists, who are trained to use psychological instruments, might be an option for such a task shift. The aim of the present article therefore was to explore whether such an inter-professional diagnostic process would be feasible for FPs, patients and therapists in primary care, and to identify barriers to and enablers of the process by using the COM-B model [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. COM-B takes both individual and organizational factors into account, and it has a clear behaviour perspective [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. According to the framework, the behaviour (B) depends on three components: physical and psychological capabilities (C), physical and social opportunities (O), and reflective and automated motivation (M). The components can exert a direct or indirect effect on the behaviour, and the components may interact with one another.
