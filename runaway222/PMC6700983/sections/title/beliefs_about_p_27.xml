 <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beliefs about professional roles affected the motivation for referral and feedback discussions. At PHCC1, the inter-professional process did not interfere with existing roles. The FP maintained the patient responsibility, including decisions to refer patients for CBT. A discussion on results and actions to be taken was seen as rewarding among both FPs and therapist.</p>
 <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The therapist perceived increased competence with the new task. Furthermore, becoming more familiar with the MINI, the therapist took her own initiatives, using the MINI for non-assessed patients where the referral form seemed vague and then communicating the results to the FP.</p>
 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At PHCC2, neither the FPs nor the therapists appreciated the concept of referral for MINI assessment only, albeit for different reasons. The FPs trusted their own assessment skills and felt that they would miss important non-verbal information required for their own diagnostic work if a therapist made the assessment (Q19, Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). For the therapists, the diagnostic process was seen as part of creating an alliance and a treatment plan with the patient and thus as an important part of their work. Assisting FPs in their diagnoses was not seen as part of their duties, and furthermore, they did not trust the FPsâ€™ ability to interpret the results from the MINI (Q20, Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).
