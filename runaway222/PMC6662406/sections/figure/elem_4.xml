  <p>Change in predicted 
   <span class="italic">Callitropsis nootkatensis</span> regeneration densities on the plot network as driven by the top four most significant uncorrelated variables in the final model. There is a clear relationship between forest health, seed source, and regeneration, with higher densities seen in areas of lower 
   <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> mortality, higher live 
   <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> (presumably seed source), and higher overall basal area. Higher densities are also found in wetter landscapes, with a higher contributing area
