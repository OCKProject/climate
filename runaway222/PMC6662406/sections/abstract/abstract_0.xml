 <p>Climate change is altering the conditions for tree recruitment, growth, and survival, and impacting forest community composition. Across southeast Alaska, USA, and British Columbia, Canada, 
  <span class="italic">Callitropsis nootkatensis</span> (Alaska yellow‐cedar) is experiencing extensive climate change‐induced canopy mortality due to fine‐root death during soil freezing events following warmer winters and the loss of insulating snowpack. Here, we examine the effects of ongoing, climate‐driven canopy mortality on forest community composition and identify potential shifts in stand trajectories due to the loss of a single canopy species. We sampled canopy and regenerating forest communities across the extent of 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> decline in southeast Alaska to quantify the effects of climate, community, and stand‐level drivers on 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> canopy mortality and regeneration as well as postdecline regenerating community composition. Across the plot network,
  <span class="italic"> C. nootkatensis</span> exhibited significantly higher mortality than co‐occurring conifers across all size classes and locations. Regenerating community composition was highly variable but closely related to the severity of 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> mortality. 
  <span class="italic">Callitropsis nootkatensis</span> canopy mortality was correlated with winter temperatures and precipitation as well as local soil drainage, with regenerating community composition and 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> regeneration abundances best explained by available seed source. In areas of high 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> mortality, 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> regeneration was low and replaced by 
  <span class="italic">Tsuga</span>. Our study suggests that climate‐induced forest mortality is driving alternate successional pathways in forests where 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> was once a major component. These pathways are likely to lead to long‐term shifts in forest community composition and stand dynamics. Our analysis fills a critical knowledge gap on forest ecosystem response and rearrangement following the climate‐driven decline of a single species, providing new insight into stand dynamics in a changing climate. As tree species across the globe are increasingly stressed by climate change‐induced alteration of suitable habitat, identifying the autecological factors contributing to successful regeneration, or lack thereof, will provide key insight into forest resilience and persistence on the landscape.
