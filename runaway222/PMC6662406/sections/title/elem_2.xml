   <span class="italic">Callitropsis nootkatensis</span> is distributed across ~20° of latitude from northern California into Prince William Sound, Alaska (DellaSala et al., 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0026">2011</a>). Half of the species’ range occurs in the perhumid region of the NPCTR (10° of the 20° latitudinal distribution), where this study occurs, which is characterized by mild, consistently humid conditions and high annual precipitation (3,182 mm average, 621–9,332 range; extracted from ClimateWNA, Wang, Hamann, Spittlehouse, &amp; Carroll, 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0068">2016</a>). Across the NPCTR, 
   <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> co‐occurs with 
   <span class="italic">Picea sitchensis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Pinus contorta ssp. contorta</span> Douglas Ex. Louden (shore pine), 
   <span class="italic">Thuja plicata</span> Donn ex D. Don (western redcedar), 
   <span class="italic">Tsuga heterophylla,</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Tsuga mertensiana</span> (Bong.) Carriere. 
   <span class="italic">Sphagnum</span> spp. are common in areas of poor drainage and low forest productivity, decreasing in abundance with increasing slope and increasing depth to groundwater (Bisbing, Cooper, D'Amore, &amp; Marshall, 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0010">2016</a>; Neiland, 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0050">1971</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Callitropsis nootkatensis</span> is locally distributed across the NPCTR's hydrologic gradient from emergent wetlands to upland forests, which corresponds to a gradient of low to high forest productivity (Hennon et al., 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0036">2012</a>, 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0039">2016</a>). This gradient drives the distribution, abundance, and biomass of the region's dominant tree species (Bisbing et al., 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0010">2016</a>), with low‐lying saturated peatlands limiting the success of most species but providing low‐competition environments for stress‐tolerant species, such as 
   <span class="italic">P. contorta</span> (Bisbing et al., 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0010">2016</a>) and 
   <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> (Caouette et al., 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0021">2015</a>; Hennon, Hansen, et al., 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0037">1990</a>). Background mortality rates in healthy 
   <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> forests average &lt;25% (Hennon, Hansen, et al., 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0037">1990</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Callitropsis nootkatensis</span> regeneration occurs via seed but also through vegetative reproduction. Vegetative layering is particularly common on lower‐productivity peatlands with poor drainage and/or high snow cover; lower limbs will produce adventitious roots when depressed by accumulating 
   <span class="italic">Sphagnum</span> and snow (Hennon et al., 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0039">2016</a>). Individuals recruited through vegetative layering often persist on these lower‐productivity peatlands despite mature tree mortality.

   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0052">2014</a>) and ongoing research by the authors in the perhumid NPCTR subregion of southeast Alaska (Figure 
   <a rid="ece35383-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0001">1</a>). This plot network represents all compatible studies in the region, with compatible defined as those including both regeneration and canopy community data, precise locations, comparable methodologies, and comparable scales. Due to aggregating across sources and studies, each with their own goals, plots were not randomly distributed across the region. However, the data products were compatible and collectively allowed for analysis of regeneration response to the canopy decline severity gradient.

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To extend inference across 
   <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span>' distribution in southeast Alaska, we leveraged 17 additional nested, fixed‐radius plots on Kupreanof and Prince of Wales Islands (installed 2015–2016, Figure 
   <a rid="ece35383-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0001">1</a>). Mature and small trees (&gt;10 cm DBH) were sampled over a 400‐m
   <span class="sup">2</span> plot. Treelets, saplings, and advanced regeneration (&gt;10 cm but &lt;1.37m in height) were sampled in a nested 100‐m
   <span class="sup">2</span> plot. Germinants and seedlings (&lt;10 cm height) were tallied by species in four one‐m

   <span class="sup">2</span> plot (16 m
   <span class="sup">2</span> total area sampled). Hereafter, the term regeneration refers to the combined germinant and seedling classes, including all recently emerged germinants (i.e., cotyledons still visible) to seedlings less than 10cm in height and, presumably, &lt;2 years of age.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Across all plots, species, DBH, tree status (live/dead), live crown condition, and snag class were sampled for all trees. Snags were identified to species, if possible, and

   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0041">1990</a>). Unidentifiable snags were classified as unknown species. Additionally, regeneration was identified to the genus for 
   <span class="italic">Tsuga</span> germinants (
   <span class="italic">heterophylla</span> and 
   <span class="italic">mertensiana</span>) but to the species for all other species and size classes. Disturbed areas (e.g., windthrow, landslides) were eliminated from plot selection to avoid the confounding influence of disturbance on community composition.

Data were obtained for three date ranges to capture drivers of ongoing decline and regeneration—the last few decades (30‐year normal, 1981–2010), the five‐year period prior to and including sampling year (five‐year average, range 2007–2016), and the year of sampling (annual, range: 2011–2016). Annual data were used to evaluate the influence of current year conditions on the regenerating community, while data from the five‐year period were used to quantify the influence of multiyear climate on canopy mortality, potential seed availability and viability, and regenerating community composition. A five‐year window was selected for two reasons: (a)

In Kruskal–Wallis and MANOVA tests, proportional mortality was categorized into the following mortality severity classes: low = 1%–25%, moderate = 25.1%–69.9%, high = 70%–99%, and all = 100%.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, we compared drivers of 
   <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> canopy mortality versus regeneration. Two random forests analyses were run—one to model the proportion of dead 
   <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> in the canopy and another the abundance of 
   <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> regeneration. Both were based on potential drivers related to climate, disturbance exposure, topography, drainage, and competition (Table 
   <a rid="ece35383-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece35383-tbl-0001">1</a>). Random forests, an extension of regression tree analysis (Breiman, 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0013">2001</a>), are well suited for complex, nonlinear interactions between variables and generally perform better than other methods in predictive accuracy (Prasad, Iverson, &amp; Liaw, 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0057">2006</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We took a two‐step process similar to importance‐based variable selection procedures (Evans &amp; Cushman, 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0031">2009</a>). First, an initial forest was grown using all potential variables, and variable importance was calculated, based on the decrease in accuracy on the out‐of‐bag sample (independent data points not used in building the tree used for testing) when each variable is permuted compared to the original tree. This is averaged across all trees in the forest. Variables were then assessed for cross correlation with each other. The top ten important uncorrelated variables (&lt;0.65) were retained. This was necessary as, while random forests are not generally subject to overfitting due to correlated variables, correlation between variables often means several highly correlated variables may all be simultaneously considered of high importance. While this may not be an impediment to modeling accuracy (Fox et al., 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0032">2017</a>), it interferes with our ability to interpret the random forest outputs versus our hypotheses. Instead, the top uncorrelated variables were used to create a second, final model. Our model was then investigated for the marginal influence of the most important variables on proportion dead and regeneration density by running the final model while varying the single variable of interest and plotting projected values (sometimes called a partial plot). We used the 
   <span class="italic">randomForest</span> package for analyses.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine regenerating community types and identify potential shifts in community composition, we analyzed conifer regeneration abundances across all sampling locations using a cluster analysis with the Bray–Curtis distance measure and Ward's hierarchical agglomerative method in the 
   <span class="italic">vegan</span> package. Community types were determined with an indicator species analysis within the 
   <span class="italic">indicspecies</span> package; the appropriate number of community types was classified by maximizing the number of statistically significant indicator species in each group (Dufrêne &amp; Legendre, 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0029">1997</a>). We assessed differences in community composition and cluster types with Kruskal–Wallis tests for nonparametric, ranked data, including location, time since mortality, and proportional mortality severity class as potential predictors.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then used a suite of nonparametric, multivariate analyses to compare patterns in and identify drivers of regenerating community composition. First, we performed nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordinations on regeneration abundances based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarity with the 
   <span class="italic">vegan</span> package (Oksanen et al., 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0053">2007</a>). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling avoids the assumption of linear or unimodal responses so is well suited to non‐normal plant community data (McCune, Grace, &amp; Urban, 
   <a rid="ece35383-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0048">2002</a>). We employed permutational vector fitting (999 permutations) on biologically significant yet minimally correlated variables (&lt;0.65, detailed above, Table 
   <a rid="ece35383-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece35383-tbl-0001">1</a>) using a multiple linear regression technique with the 
   <span class="italic">envfit</span> function to assess relationships between NMS ordinations of community structure and this reduced set of climate, community, and stand‐level variables. Variables identified as significant using 
   <span class="italic">envfit</span> were then evaluated with a generalized additive model to test for linear fit, and variables representing nonlinear relationships were removed from the final model.
