 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To control for the possibility of general forest declines, which would affect all species and obscure 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span>‐specific mortality, we used simple linear regressions to assess the correlation between the proportion of dead 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> (log‐transformed) as compared to that of the other dominant co‐occurring tree species, and Kruskal–Wallis tests for nonparametric, ranked data to assess variation in proportional mortality among species, locations, and size classes (as defined above). There were no significant concurrent declines in any co‐occurring species (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05), so we focused subsequent mortality analyses on 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> alone. We also used a Kruskal–Wallis analysis to test for significant differences in live tree abundances among species and locations. We then tested for significant differences in canopy and regenerating community composition among locations and as related to 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> mortality with multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) tests using Bray–Curtis distances in the 
  <span class="italic">vegan</span> package. The proportion of dead 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> in the canopy (dead 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> out of total 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span>) was also compared to regeneration density using a negative log‐transformed linear regression. In Kruskal–Wallis and MANOVA tests, proportional mortality was categorized into the following mortality severity classes: low = 1%–25%, moderate = 25.1%–69.9%, high = 70%–99%, and all = 100%.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, we compared drivers of 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> canopy mortality versus regeneration. Two random forests analyses were run—one to model the proportion of dead 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> in the canopy and another the abundance of 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> regeneration. Both were based on potential drivers related to climate, disturbance exposure, topography, drainage, and competition (Table 
  <a rid="ece35383-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece35383-tbl-0001">1</a>). Random forests, an extension of regression tree analysis (Breiman, 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0013">2001</a>), are well suited for complex, nonlinear interactions between variables and generally perform better than other methods in predictive accuracy (Prasad, Iverson, &amp; Liaw, 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0057">2006</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We took a two‐step process similar to importance‐based variable selection procedures (Evans &amp; Cushman, 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0031">2009</a>). First, an initial forest was grown using all potential variables, and variable importance was calculated, based on the decrease in accuracy on the out‐of‐bag sample (independent data points not used in building the tree used for testing) when each variable is permuted compared to the original tree. This is averaged across all trees in the forest. Variables were then assessed for cross correlation with each other. The top ten important uncorrelated variables (&lt;0.65) were retained. This was necessary as, while random forests are not generally subject to overfitting due to correlated variables, correlation between variables often means several highly correlated variables may all be simultaneously considered of high importance. While this may not be an impediment to modeling accuracy (Fox et al., 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0032">2017</a>), it interferes with our ability to interpret the random forest outputs versus our hypotheses. Instead, the top uncorrelated variables were used to create a second, final model. Our model was then investigated for the marginal influence of the most important variables on proportion dead and regeneration density by running the final model while varying the single variable of interest and plotting projected values (sometimes called a partial plot). We used the 
  <span class="italic">randomForest</span> package for analyses.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine regenerating community types and identify potential shifts in community composition, we analyzed conifer regeneration abundances across all sampling locations using a cluster analysis with the Bray–Curtis distance measure and Ward's hierarchical agglomerative method in the 
  <span class="italic">vegan</span> package. Community types were determined with an indicator species analysis within the 
  <span class="italic">indicspecies</span> package; the appropriate number of community types was classified by maximizing the number of statistically significant indicator species in each group (Dufrêne &amp; Legendre, 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0029">1997</a>). We assessed differences in community composition and cluster types with Kruskal–Wallis tests for nonparametric, ranked data, including location, time since mortality, and proportional mortality severity class as potential predictors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then used a suite of nonparametric, multivariate analyses to compare patterns in and identify drivers of regenerating community composition. First, we performed nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordinations on regeneration abundances based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarity with the 
  <span class="italic">vegan</span> package (Oksanen et al., 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0053">2007</a>). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling avoids the assumption of linear or unimodal responses so is well suited to non‐normal plant community data (McCune, Grace, &amp; Urban, 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0048">2002</a>). We employed permutational vector fitting (999 permutations) on biologically significant yet minimally correlated variables (&lt;0.65, detailed above, Table 
  <a rid="ece35383-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece35383-tbl-0001">1</a>) using a multiple linear regression technique with the 
  <span class="italic">envfit</span> function to assess relationships between NMS ordinations of community structure and this reduced set of climate, community, and stand‐level variables. Variables identified as significant using 
  <span class="italic">envfit</span> were then evaluated with a generalized additive model to test for linear fit, and variables representing nonlinear relationships were removed from the final model.
