  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> mortality was correlated with cool winter temperatures and lower winter precipitation as well as two metrics of soil drainage—moderate 
  <span class="italic">Sphagnum</span> percentage and higher slopes (mean squared residuals = 0.06, variance explained = 0.40; Figure 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0004">4</a>). As a result, the highest proportional mortality on the plot network was found in cooler, relatively drier regions and on higher productivity upland forests.

  <span class="italic">Callitropsis nootkatensis</span> regeneration abundances were strongly correlated with stand condition and canopy composition (variance explained = 0.45; mean squared residuals = 2.02). The top four variables in the model were basal area of dead and live 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis,</span> total live stand basal area (all species), and contributing area (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0005">5</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Callitropsis nootkatensis</span> basal area was the most important variable in explaining regeneration abundance, with higher regeneration in areas with a greater proportion of live 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> in the canopy and a lower proportion of dead 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0005">5</a>). This was corroborated by the direct comparison between canopy mortality and regeneration; regeneration (log‐transformed) was negatively correlated with increasing mortality (
