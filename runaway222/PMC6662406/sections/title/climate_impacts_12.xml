 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the NPCTR, climate change‐induced canopy mortality is restricted to a single species, 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis,</span> allowing for a focused examination of the effects of climate, seed source, and local conditions on regenerating community response and subsequent stand dynamics. Mature tree mortality across the study area corresponded with a reduction in 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> regeneration (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0006">6</a>) and a shift to surviving canopy species, predominantly 
  <span class="italic">Tsuga</span> (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0003">3</a>), a widespread species known to dominate the regenerating community following disturbance (Alaback and Tappeiner II (
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0003">1991</a>); Deal &amp; Farr, 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0023">1994</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Callitropsis nootkatensis</span> regeneration constituted less than 20% of the regenerating community in decline areas (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0003">3</a>) and appears to be limited by a lack of available seed and vegetative source, although drainage conditions, as determined by slope, and maximum winter temperatures also contribute to structuring regenerating community composition (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0007">7</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local hydrologic regime and associated ecosystem productivity are key factors in both species’ distributions (Bisbing et al., 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0010">2016</a>) and in the extent of 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> decline (D'Amore &amp; Hennon, 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0022">2006</a>). Mortality across this plot network was most extensive on wetter, lower‐productivity peatlands; however, proportional mortality was greatest in productive upland forests. The apparent lack of congruity between these results and previous research, which reports higher mortality on lower slopes (D'Amore &amp; Hennon, 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0022">2006</a>), is explained by our use of proportional mortality rather than total. Although mortality is most extreme on saturated peatlands, it is likely that surviving individuals will allow for ongoing perpetuation of the species on lower‐productivity peatlands.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nonetheless, the loss of 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> from both the canopy and the regenerating community across the extent of decline in southeast Alaska indicates that canopy trees and regeneration are in sync in their responses to climate change. Cold, low‐snow winters have led to widespread mortality over our study area (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0004">4</a>) and across the species’ range (Buma et al., 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0017">2017</a>), and local drainage conditions (i.e., slope, hydrologic regime) amplify or mitigate response of the canopy (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0004">4</a>) and regenerating community (Figures 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0005">5</a> and 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0007">7</a>). While this study cannot conclusively determine the mechanism for the lack of regeneration, the close correspondence between the canopy and regenerating communities is striking. These plot‐level findings are consistent with recent modeling work on drivers of canopy mortality that identified winter temperatures and slope as conditions leading to decline at broad scales (Buma et al., 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0017">2017</a>). Mortality is predicted to be ongoing in areas above the winter snow threshold, and up to 50% of current suitable habitat is expected to experience climate conditions favorable to decline (Buma et al., 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0017">2017</a>). Continued mortality of this conifer is likely to lead to more widespread shifts in community composition (Oakes et al., 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0052">2014</a>; data presented here). The close relationship between seed source and composition of the regenerating community suggests that no compensation in the form of increased recruitment will make up for the loss of the 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> canopy.
