 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Response and stability in regenerating community composition</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four regenerating community types were identified in the cluster and indicator species analysis. Community types were largely determined by extent of 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> decline, with communities assigned to mixed‐conifer (Mixed), 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> (CANO), 
  <span class="italic">Tsuga‐P. sitchensis</span> (Tsuga‐PISI), or 
  <span class="italic">P.contorta</span> (PICO) clusters (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0007">7</a>). The Mixed type was highly variable in location, climate, and drainage condition (no significant indicator species scores (ISS), 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05; Figure 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0007">7</a>). The CANO type occurred in low slope, lower‐productivity plots in areas of low 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> mortality (ISS = 70, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01). The Tsuga‐PISI type was found on steeper slope, higher productivity plots and consisted of 
  <span class="italic">Tsuga</span> (ISS = 81, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) and 
  <span class="italic">P. sitchensis</span> (ISS = 72, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05) in areas of moderate to complete 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> mortality. The PICO type was assigned to low slope, lower‐productivity peatlands with high bryophyte coverage (ISS = 60, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). Plots of similar condition generally clustered into the same community types; plots with high to complete 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> mortality were regenerating to Tsuga‐PISI or PICO, with 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> regeneration dominating in low mortality, lower‐productivity peatlands. Location (Kruskal–Wallis chi‐squared = 19.07, 
  <span class="italic">df</span> = 3, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), severity of 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> mortality (Kruskal–Wallis chi‐squared = 19.94, 
  <span class="italic">df</span> = 3, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), and time since mortality (Kruskal–Wallis chi‐squared = 15.78, 
  <span class="italic">df</span> = 3, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) were significant predictors of regenerating community types, indicating that climate and both the timing and the extent of decline are primary determinants of community composition stability.

Variables and associated vector arrows indicate the direction and magnitude of effects of the canopy community, local stand conditions, and local annual and five‐year climate on regenerating community composition. Arrow length is proportional to the magnitude of correlation. Variables identified as both significant (

  <span class="italic">R</span>

  <span class="italic">Tsuga</span> species dominating well‐drained upland forests (Figure
