 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The consequences of rapid climate change on forest resilience remain uncertain and are likely to be highly variable, based on a particular forest's ecological memory (i.e., information legacies of ecological adaptations to disturbance; Johnstone et al., 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0043">2016</a>). For forests to be resilient and resist transitions to alternate states, there must be synchrony between both information legacies (i.e., genetic adaptations to disturbance, like sprouting in avalanche‐prone ecosystems) and material legacies (i.e., the physical legacies, such as seedbanks, that are present after a disturbance event; Johnstone et al., 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0043">2016</a>). Historically, 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis’</span> shallow root system and early response to spring warming were beneficial, allowing for early, rapid growth each growing season (Hennon et al., 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0039">2016</a>); however, this once advantageous legacy is now a deleterious adaptation. Mortality in mature trees limits the potential for biological inertia (Young et al., 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0072">2019</a>) due to a lack of available seed. Instead, advanced regeneration via vegetative reproduction remains a successful strategy even in areas of severe decline (unpublished data/personal observation). This may help the species maintain a presence on the landscape during periods of mature tree mortality until periods more favorable for sexual reproduction, similar to the “orphaned cohort” example of 
  <span class="italic">Fraxinus</span> in response to 
  <span class="italic">Agrilus planipennis</span> invasion (Klooster et al., 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0045">2014</a>). The immediate loss of seed‐producing trees and seedlings (Figures 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0002">2</a> and 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0003">3</a>), as well as competition from faster growing species, means these forests are lacking the biological inertia needed for resilience and are likely to transition to 
  <span class="italic">T. heterophylla</span>‐dominated forests even if 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> maintains some temporary or disjunct presence on the landscape. For species or forest types undergoing similar climate‐induced mortality events, ecologists will need to determine which legacies contribute to ecosystem resilience, or if novel climate or disturbance will remove these legacies that were historically critical.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecosystem resilience may also vary as a function of regional climate fluctuations over space and time, known as transitional climate mortality (Buma, 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0015">2018</a>), where mortality is highest within a particular range of climatic conditions but decreases above or below this range. Currently, the mid‐range of the 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis’</span> distribution is experiencing mortality, but, if emissions scenarios continue toward worst‐case trajectories, it is possible that the mortality “donut‐hole” will be relatively short‐lived (Buma, 
  <a rid="ece35383-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35383-bib-0015">2018</a>). Short, intense climate fluctuations may therefore be less deleterious to ecosystem resilience if there are deep enough ecological legacies to sustain species over time.
