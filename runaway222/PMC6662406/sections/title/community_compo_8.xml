  <span class="italic">Callitropsis nootkatensis</span> mortality did occur across all tree size classes (mature, small, and treelet; Figure

  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> mortality ranged from 0 (in healthy stands) to 75 years (Table 
  <a rid="ece35383-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece35383-tbl-0002">A1</a>). Mortality was not documented in sapling and seedling size classes, likely due to the short‐lived nature of this fine material. The proportion of dead 
  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> averaged 74% (median = 75%, range = 4%–100%) across the extent of decline, while background mortality in healthy stands north of the decline averaged 16% (median = 12%, range = 0.01%–43%). Mortality of common co‐occurring conifers was significantly lower than that of

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species abundances were significantly different within both the canopy and regenerating communities. Live tree abundances varied by species (Kruskal–Wallis chi‐squared = 43.17,

  <span class="italic">df</span> = 4,

  <span class="italic">C. nootkatensis</span> continued to dominate the canopy in Glacier Bay National Park (mean dead = 8%), an area currently north of the region of decline, but was a minor component (&gt;50% dead across all plots, mean = 75%) at the southern end of decline on Prince of Wales Island (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35383-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35383-fig-0003">3</a>a). Canopy community composition (Figure
