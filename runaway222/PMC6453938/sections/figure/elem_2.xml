  <p>Reindeer population fluctuations under five different rain-on-snow (ROS) scenarios. Scenarios correspond to different distributions of observed values (1962–2014), with increased frequency of extreme ROS winters. Upper panels: One randomly selected ROS simulation for each of the five scenarios, which (from the left to the right) span from a very low to very high frequency of extreme ROS winters (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). Mid panels: The stochastic simulation of the population dynamics for each scenario shown in the upper panels, based on age-structured density-dependent models of vital rates. Lower panels: Stochastic simulations of the population dynamics for ten randomly chosen simulations per scenario
