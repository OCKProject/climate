  <p>Schematic summary of the different analytical steps. Boxes with rounded corners show the analytical steps used in this paper. Square boxes contain data or estimates that are fed into the models in steps 1â€“4.

    <span class="italic">i</span>,

   <span class="italic">t</span>, 
   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">t</span>
   </sub> is the population size at time 
   <span class="italic">t</span>, either age-structured before the hunting season (
   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>prehunt,
    <span class="italic">i</span>,

   </sub>) or right after the end of the hunting season (
   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>posthunt,
    <span class="italic">t</span>
   </sub>), and ROS is a measure of rain-on-snow, as defined in the Methods. Note that in this figure, we use the term density in place of population size when considering density effects of population size on population growth (i.e., density dependence). This is to aid the reader in following how 
   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">t</span>
   </sub> was used in different steps of our analysis (as a cause of density dependence, or as a response variable), and does not indicate a change in the way 
   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">t</span>
   </sub> was estimated
