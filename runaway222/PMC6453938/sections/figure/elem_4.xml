  <p>Expected population growth rate as function of rain-on-snow (ROS), density, and age structure. The relationship is shown for combinations of two contrasting initial population densities (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 1200 and 1700) and two initial age structures (proportion of prime-aged [3–8-year olds] = 28 and 51%), illustrating why extreme climate events do not always lead to a large population decline. Horizontal dashed line denotes population growth rate = 0
