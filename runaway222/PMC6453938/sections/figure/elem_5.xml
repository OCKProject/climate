  <p>The time elapsed between two extreme rain-on-snow (ROS) winters influences reindeer population stability. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Population size (
   <span class="italic">N</span>) time-series from deterministic simulations with rather high initial density 
   <span class="italic">N</span> (1700) and low initial proportion of prime-aged (28%). The time elapsed from the first extreme ROS winter (red line) to the second one (blue line) increases from left to right. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Expected population growth rate for the second extreme ROS winter, plotted against the time elapsed since the first one. Circles show the mean and error bars the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles from 9090 population models (i.e. based on 9090 posterior samples). Red dashed line shows the expected growth rate in the first extreme ROS winter
