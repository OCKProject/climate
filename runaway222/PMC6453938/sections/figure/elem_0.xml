  <p>Density-dependent effects of rain-on-snow (ROS) and icing shape reindeer population fluctuations. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Occasionally, icing causes die-offs. This calf died from starvation in the 2001/2002 winter, which was characterized by high reindeer density and high ROS amounts.
