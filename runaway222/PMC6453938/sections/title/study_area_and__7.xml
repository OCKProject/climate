 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study population of wild Svalbard reindeer is located in the Reindalen, Semmeldalen, and Colesdalen valley system in central Spitsbergen (78°N, 15°E), Svalbard, Norway. The area is characterized by U-shaped coastal valleys with High Arctic tundra vegetation of low stature, dominated by mosses, graminoids, dwarf shrubs, and forbs. Because of semi-isolation by the sea, steep mountains, and glaciers, as well as a stationary behaviour, there is very little exchange of animals with other nearby reindeer populations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. The reindeer occur alone or in small groups and are not subject to significant levels of predation (polar bear attacks are very rare
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>), inter-specific competition, or insect harassment. Each fall, there is a very low level of harvest
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>, and some reindeer have been culled for scientific purpose
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. Both hunted and culled animals are reported and their age is determined

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ROS has previously been reported as the main climatic driver of vital rates and population growth in Svalbard reindeer
