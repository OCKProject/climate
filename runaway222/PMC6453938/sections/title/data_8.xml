 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reindeer data used in this study originate from a mark-recapture study, which protocol applies with and is approved by the Norwegian Animal Research Authorities and the Governor of Svalbard. The reindeer are captured as calves (and recaptured in later years) in a net between two snow mobiles during April each year, and a post-breeding resighting survey is performed in early August

The six age classes considered are 0 (calves), 1, 2, 3–8, 9–11, and ≥12 year olds, corresponding to age classes 1–6 in Supplementary Figs.

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>. The model combines individual mark-recapture data with population counts within a Bayesian state-space modelling framework, accounting for observation error and demographic stochasticity. The small and controlled level of harvest and scientific culling was also accounted for. Detailed modelling and data methodology are described in ref.

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained daily historical weather data for Longyearbyen airport, ca 25 km from our study population, from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (freely available at

Based on daily mean temperatures and precipitation during 1962–2014, we first calculated annual winter rain amount by summing the amount of precipitation recorded at temperatures ≥1 °C during November–April

We considered the onset of winter as the first day in autumn when the running mean was &lt;0 °C and then stayed &lt;0 °C for a minimum of 10 consecutive days. Likewise, end of winter was estimated as the first day (after the winter period November–April) when the running mean was &gt;0 °C and then stayed &gt;0 °C for a minimum of 10 consecutive days.
