 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, based on these preliminary findings, we explored the underlying demographic mechanisms by modelling annual age-specific survival and fecundity rates, obtained for 9090 posterior samples from the IPM

  </span>, vital rates of young and old age classes were the most variable and the most strongly influenced by ROS events (Supplementary Table

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) and weather conditions, we reconstructed fluctuations in vital rates and population sizes. Predicted population growth rates (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>) were strongly correlated with observed growth rates (Pearson’s correlation 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.89), suggesting high predictive power of the population model (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>).
