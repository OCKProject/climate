 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate how climate–demography interactions can lead to such differences in long-term population dynamics and persistence under contrasting ROS scenarios, we ran deterministic population simulations where we increased the time elapsed between two extreme ROS winters (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). We modelled the extreme ROS winter as the maximum ROS amount ever recorded at the local weather station (i.e. 1996, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). Provided a rather high initial density characterized by a low proportion of prime-aged animals (i.e. 3–8-year olds) in year 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 0 (i.e. representative of the population state before a known population crash in 1996), an extreme ROS winter leads to a dramatic decline in population size in year 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 1 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>). In particular, many calves and old animals die (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) and very few new calves are born (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>) in crash years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>, also resulting in a marked increase in the proportion of prime-aged animals (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). With no subsequent ROS winter (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>, leftmost panel), the low density (i.e. relaxation of density dependence) and new age structure allow the population to recover towards an asymptotic population size (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>) and stable age structure (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>, leftmost panel). If a second ROS winter occurs immediately after the first one (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>, second leftmost panel), the model predicts no additional decrease in population size before recovery commences. This occurs because the previous year’s crash generated a new population state, with low density as well as large proportion of prime-aged animals, showing little sensitivity to ROS. This promotes population recovery (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). If the second ROS winter is delayed until 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 2, the previous year’s recovery in population size induces a slight population decline due to the harsh feeding conditions. Because of these lagged effects of a population crash, it takes about 7 years before the impact of an icy winter returns to the initial level at 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 0 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>). Accordingly, if there are several extreme ROS winters in a row, population size converges towards a reduced density of 1000–1500 individuals due to relaxation of density dependence (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). These interactions between climate effects, density, and age structure explain why our study population did not crash in recent icy winters (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). Such lagged responses to environmental stochasticity are predicted by theory

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>). Thus, to our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence from the wild that fluctuations in population size of long-lived species are dampened when extreme climate events become more frequent

  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). When ROS is still that rare, ungulate populations are more likely to be in the kind of state (in terms of density, as well as demographic structure) that may lead to a crash when an extreme event occurs.

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>), is that the impact of an extreme ROS winter on the population growth rate is far less dramatic if it occurs soon after a previous perturbation (i.e. moving towards high and very high ROS frequencies, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). This is a likely characteristic of the near-future winter climate in many coastal Arctic regions

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Our case study clearly demonstrates that population-dynamic inference based solely on single events and their short-term impacts—ignoring potential long-term impacts, as well as the consequences of multiple events—may lead to erroneous conclusions. In particular, our results emphasize how internal density-dependent feedback processes can modify the effects of environmental stochasticity and, hence, buffer populations of long-lived species if extreme events become the norm due to global warming.
