 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We evaluated the demographic consequences of a set of ROS scenarios for the reindeer population, using stochastic simulations of the population model (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Global circulation models suggest that mid-winter warm spells and heavy ROS events will become more frequent in the future Arctic

  </span>, including Svalbard. Therefore, we varied the frequency of extreme ROS winters (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>) from very low (virtually never) to low, medium (as observed in the past, i.e. 1962–2014), high, and very high (the likely future scenario). A very high frequency of extreme ROS winters (rightmost panels in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) reduces the mean population size by only 11% (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>, Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) compared to the scenario describing observed historical conditions (i.e. medium ROS winter frequency, mid panels in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) and by 25% (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>, Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) compared to the very low frequency scenario (leftmost panels in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). However, very frequent ROS winters also result in a strong reduction in the temporal variability in population sizes and growth rates (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Such a change in population variability occurs because the impact of a bad year interacts with density and age structure (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), which, in turn, are likely to be influenced by the time since the previous bad year. This also has implications for the frequency and magnitude of population crashes under different ROS scenarios (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Accordingly, the probability of going extinct (population size 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 0) during a period of 100 years is about 15,000 times higher for the medium ROS scenario, i.e. the observed historical climate, than for the very high ROS scenario anticipated under continued global warming (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Likewise, the probability of going quasi-extinct (here arbitrarily defined as 
  <span class="italic">N</span> &lt; 100) is 10-fold.
