  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a preliminary analysis, we first explored the impact of ROS and population density on annual reindeer population growth rates over the study period 1994–2014 (Fig.

   </span>, including Svalbard. Therefore, we varied the frequency of extreme ROS winters (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>) from very low (virtually never) to low, medium (as observed in the past, i.e. 1962–2014), high, and very high (the likely future scenario). A very high frequency of extreme ROS winters (rightmost panels in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) reduces the mean population size by only 11% (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>, Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) compared to the scenario describing observed historical conditions (i.e. medium ROS winter frequency, mid panels in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) and by 25% (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>, Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) compared to the very low frequency scenario (leftmost panels in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). However, very frequent ROS winters also result in a strong reduction in the temporal variability in population sizes and growth rates (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Such a change in population variability occurs because the impact of a bad year interacts with density and age structure (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), which, in turn, are likely to be influenced by the time since the previous bad year. This also has implications for the frequency and magnitude of population crashes under different ROS scenarios (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Accordingly, the probability of going extinct (population size 
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 0) during a period of 100 years is about 15,000 times higher for the medium ROS scenario, i.e. the observed historical climate, than for the very high ROS scenario anticipated under continued global warming (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Likewise, the probability of going quasi-extinct (here arbitrarily defined as 
   <span class="italic">N</span> &lt; 100) is 10-fold.

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate how climate–demography interactions can lead to such differences in long-term population dynamics and persistence under contrasting ROS scenarios, we ran deterministic population simulations where we increased the time elapsed between two extreme ROS winters (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). We modelled the extreme ROS winter as the maximum ROS amount ever recorded at the local weather station (i.e. 1996, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). Provided a rather high initial density characterized by a low proportion of prime-aged animals (i.e. 3–8-year olds) in year 
   <span class="italic">t</span> = 0 (i.e. representative of the population state before a known population crash in 1996), an extreme ROS winter leads to a dramatic decline in population size in year 
   <span class="italic">t</span> = 1 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>). In particular, many calves and old animals die (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) and very few new calves are born (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>) in crash years
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span>, also resulting in a marked increase in the proportion of prime-aged animals (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). With no subsequent ROS winter (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>, leftmost panel), the low density (i.e. relaxation of density dependence) and new age structure allow the population to recover towards an asymptotic population size (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>) and stable age structure (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>, leftmost panel). If a second ROS winter occurs immediately after the first one (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>, second leftmost panel), the model predicts no additional decrease in population size before recovery commences. This occurs because the previous year’s crash generated a new population state, with low density as well as large proportion of prime-aged animals, showing little sensitivity to ROS. This promotes population recovery (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). If the second ROS winter is delayed until 
   <span class="italic">t</span> = 2, the previous year’s recovery in population size induces a slight population decline due to the harsh feeding conditions. Because of these lagged effects of a population crash, it takes about 7 years before the impact of an icy winter returns to the initial level at 
   <span class="italic">t</span> = 0 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>). Accordingly, if there are several extreme ROS winters in a row, population size converges towards a reduced density of 1000–1500 individuals due to relaxation of density dependence (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). These interactions between climate effects, density, and age structure explain why our study population did not crash in recent icy winters (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). Such lagged responses to environmental stochasticity are predicted by theory

   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>), is that the impact of an extreme ROS winter on the population growth rate is far less dramatic if it occurs soon after a previous perturbation (i.e. moving towards high and very high ROS frequencies, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). This is a likely characteristic of the near-future winter climate in many coastal Arctic regions

   </span>. Our case study clearly demonstrates that population-dynamic inference based solely on single events and their short-term impacts—ignoring potential long-term impacts, as well as the consequences of multiple events—may lead to erroneous conclusions. In particular, our results emphasize how internal density-dependent feedback processes can modify the effects of environmental stochasticity and, hence, buffer populations of long-lived species if extreme events become the norm due to global warming.
