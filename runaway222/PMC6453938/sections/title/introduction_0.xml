 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extreme climate events can induce severe population crashes and destabilized population dynamics across animal taxa and biomes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. For instance, El Niño years severely affect the dynamics of birds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>, and droughts have led to extinctions in butterflies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. As accumulated evidence now suggests that global warming comes with an increase in the frequency of extreme climate events
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>, their ecological impacts are also receiving more attention
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>, yet mostly in plants. Given the inherent rareness of extreme events and the anecdotal approaches to study them in animals, the scientific focus has almost exclusively been on single events and their short-term effects
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. However, especially in long-lived species where intrinsic properties regulate population dynamics, the impact of an environmental perturbation could vary with how often it occurs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. Thus, ignoring longer-term impacts, as well as anticipated changes in event frequencies under global warming
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>, may ultimately lead to biased predictions of population persistence
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As some types of (previously extreme) events become progressively less rare—typically in climate change hotspots, such as the Arctic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>—novel opportunities for mechanistic insights and a predictive understanding of their ecological impacts are now emerging. In the Arctic, extreme warm spells and rain-on-snow (ROS) events in winter may cause impenetrable snow-packs and even encapsulate the entire vegetation in thick ground-ice
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Such environmental perturbations on the tundra are no longer that rare
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, and population crashes and destabilized dynamics linked to icing events have been reported for a range of herbivore species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>, including muskoxen 
  <span class="italic">Ovibos moschatus</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>, caribou, and wild reindeer 
  <span class="italic">Rangifer tarandus</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. One intuitive, yet perhaps naive, extrapolation from observations of single population crashes following extreme ROS events would be to expect more variable dynamics and greater extinction risk with continued warming. However, theoretical studies indicate that this may not necessarily be the case
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. The effects of environmental stochasticity on population growth can be buffered by density-dependent feedbacks
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Perturbations may have little or no impact at low density when resource competition is weak
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. In addition, population responses to environmental stochasticity can depend on demographic structure, with some age classes being less sensitive to environmental fluctuations than others
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. A change in population structure towards more resilient age classes after a population crash, i.e. a new population state
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>, may therefore promote positive population growth rates and reduce the probability of new crashes in subsequent years. Thus, it has been suggested that high frequencies of bad years may lead to less variable population growth and, hence, stabilized rather than destabilized population dynamics
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. However, empirical support for this prediction is still lacking.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, based on demographic population modelling of empirical time-series data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>, we evaluate how changes in the frequency of rainy and icy winters affect wild reindeer

  <span class="italic">platyrhynchus</span> population dynamics in Svalbard, a climate change hotspot in the High Arctic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Because of the rapidly warming winter climate and the strong ROS signals in both reindeer demographic performance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span> and abundance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>, this northernmost ungulate represents an excellent case study for exploring the effects of more frequent extreme events. We show that the impact of an extreme ROS and icing event on reindeer survival, fecundity, and population growth rate is strongly age- and density-dependent. A population crash causes relaxation of density dependence, more resilient age structure, and, thereby, a long-lasting reduction in the population sensitivity to subsequent extreme events. Thus, because effects of environmental stochasticity are modified by internal density-dependent feedback, frequent extreme events dampen the population dynamics and even reduce the extinction risk.
