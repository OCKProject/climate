  <span class="italic">N</span>

  <sub>

  </sub>, linearly detrended) and climate covariates, namely ROS and length of the winter (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). We found a negative effect of length of the winter (
  <span class="italic">t</span> to 
  <span class="italic">t</span> + 1) and a negative interaction effect between the amount of ROS (
  <span class="italic">t</span> to 
  <span class="italic">t</span> + 1) and population size (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), suggesting a density-dependent ROS effect and supporting the assumption that increased plant abundance due to warmer summers

  </span> has a gradual effect on the carrying capacity 
  <span class="italic">K</span> (thereby, the detrended 
  <span class="italic">N</span>). To visually illustrate the ROS–density interaction effect (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>), we divided population sizes into high, medium, and low 
  <span class="italic">N</span> (detrended). The respective linear regression model replacing the covariate 
  <span class="italic">N</span> with these population size classes (as factor) provided qualitatively similar results as the model described above (Supplementary Table
