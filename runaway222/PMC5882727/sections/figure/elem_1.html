         <p>Thermoacoustic instabilities occur in combustion chambers for aeronautic and power-generation
            applications. (
            <span>a</span>) Schematic of our laboratory-scale swirled combustor. (
            <span>b</span>) Illustration of this unstable coupling. Under a certain phase difference relationship,
            well known as the Rayleigh criterion, a constructive feedback establishes between
            the unsteady heat release rate 
            <span>q</span>(
            <span><span>x</span></span>,
            <span>t</span>) and the acoustic field 
            <span>p</span>(
            <span><span>x</span></span>,
            <span>t</span>). (
            <span>c</span>) Thermoacoustic limit cycle in the laboratory-scale combustor used for this work.
            In the left loop, four snapshots of the flame showing the coherent motion of the flame
            leading to 
            <span>q</span> and originating from the thermoacoustic feedback. Time traces of acoustic pressure
            and heat release rate are shown on the right.
