 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A subcritical Hopf bifurcation of a thermoacoustic system was investigated in this work. A laboratory-scale combustor was operated under different values of methane/air equivalence ratio, which serves as bifurcation parameter: depending on its value, acoustic pressure amplitude in the chamber is either damped, intermittently switching between low and high amplitudes, or attracted towards high-amplitude, which corresponds to a stable limit cycle. The main focus of the work was on the transient dynamics: the equivalence ratio was ramped in time and dynamic hysteresis and delayed bifurcation were observed. A nonlinear oscillator surrogate model was used to investigate the effect of the ramp rate on the bifurcation delay. It was shown that when the control parameter is ramped faster, the transition from the damped regime to the limit cycle occurs for higher values of the bifurcation parameter. The corresponding first passage problem in a time-varying potential was solved with the unsteady Fokkerâ€“Planck equation and with Monte Carlo simulations of the process. This study primarily addresses a major problem of practical combustion systems. Operating conditions of gas turbines are often varied in time, for matching power grid requirement, and similar rapid changes of the combustion regimes also occur in aeronautical engines, especially at take-off. If a subcritical thermoacoustic bifurcation is present, a delayed bifurcation results in a sudden and unexpected acoustic pressure level rise, which is detrimental to the machine integrity. Therefore, a slow variation of the machine parameters is advisable, especially when mapping the operating points of a new combustor. More broadly, this study is relevant for the countless systems which exhibit critical transitions. This work highlights the importance of carefully considering the rate of change of the bifurcation parameter, when investigating tipping points.</p>
