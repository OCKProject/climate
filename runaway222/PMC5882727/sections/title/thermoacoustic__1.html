      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thermoacoustic coupling is a phenomenon that has fascinated scientists for over two
         centuries. In 1777, Dr William Higgins reported, with surprise, on a hydrogen flame
         emitting ‘sweet tones’ if placed inside a glass tube [
         <a>44</a>]. In 1894, Lord Rayleigh provided an explanation to this observation: the gas in
         the tube resonates if the flame (or any other source) provides heat at the moment
         of maximum gas compression [
         <a>45</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many years after, during the Cold War, thermoacoustic instabilities became a very
         critical issue for one of the most challenging projects ever realized by humankind:
         the Apollo programme to take man to the Moon. As detailed in [
         <a>46</a>], the F-1 engines propelling the Saturn V had destructive combustion instabilities
         that required 2000 full-scale tests, with empirical modifications of the chamber geometry
         before the rocket was ready for take-off.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More recently, thermoacoustic instabilities became a recurrent issue in the development
         phase of heavy-duty gas turbines for power generation and turbofans for air transportation.
         This is because the resulting intense acoustic fields induce high-cycle fatigue of
         the combustion chambers [
         <a>47</a>]. For heavy-duty gas turbines, the pressing demand for machines with high power density
         and ultra-low emissions, which are capable of compensating the production intermittency
         of the wind and solar sources, led to the use of lean premixed flames. Unfortunately,
         these flames are more prone to thermoacoustic instabilities. In the case of aeroplane
         turbofans, these instabilities constitute an increasingly serious obstacle to the
         development of new aeroengines complying with more stringent emission regulations
         [
         <a>48</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The suppression of these instabilities is very challenging due to the uniqueness and
         complexity of engines in real-life application [
         <a>49</a>]. Despite the achievements attained over the past decades in terms of passive mitigation
         implementation, development engineers cannot predict if a combustor prototype will
         have a sufficiently large pulsation-free operating window, over which the acoustic
         level is acceptable for the mechanical integrity of the components.

         <span><a>1</a></span> The air premixed with methane enters the plenum, a volume that, in practice, evens
         the flow delivered by the compressor and guides it to the inlet of the burner. Then,
         the mixture passes through the swirler, a set of curved blades that rotate the flow.
         This rotational motion is essential to achieve a stable anchoring of the flame. Then,
         the flow enters the combustion chamber, where combustion takes place. At any operating
         point, the fluctuating component

         <a>50</a>]. As illustrated in 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>b</span>, the geometry of the combustor and the temperature distribution define a set of acoustic
         modes in the chamber. Each mode is characterized by a shape and an eigenvalue. The
         latter determines whether the thermoacoustic mode is linearly stable or unstable.
         The system stability depends on several operating parameters, such as the mass flows
         of fuel

         </div>. The transition from linearly stable to linearly unstable regime occurs at Hopf bifurcations,
         where the sign of the growth rate of the mode changes. If unstable, the thermoacoustic
         dynamics is characterized by a limit cycle, with amplitudes 
         <span>p</span><sub>rms</sub> and 
         <span>q</span><sub>rms</sub> being defined by the natural acoustic damping of the chamber, and by the linear and
         nonlinear components of the flame response to acoustic perturbations [
         <a>50</a>,
         <a>51</a>]. The non-coherent component of the heat release rate fluctuations, which is induced
         by turbulence, acts as a broadband forcing on this self-sustained thermoacoustic oscillation.

         presented in 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>c</span> (see also the movie in the electronic supplementary material). The four panels in
         the loop show instantaneous flame pictures and the corresponding phase-averaged flame
         shapes. The right plot displays the time traces of the acoustic pressure signal 
         <span>p</span> (in red) and the heat release rate 
         <span>q</span> (in blue) (note the symbols on the time trace corresponding to the four flame snapshots
         in the left loop). The flame exhibits a periodic motion at the frequency of the first
         acoustic mode (150 Hz), with sound intensity at the anti-nodes exceeding 150 dB, which
         is considerable for a burner operated at atmospheric pressure. This dynamic state
         would not be acceptable in a commercial aeronautical engine or in a heavy-duty gas
         turbine, because the acoustic loading, which scales with the engine operating pressure,
         would be highly detrimental for the mechanical components.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work, we focus on the transient thermoacoustic dynamics associated with the
         passage through the Hopf bifurcation when one of the critical operating parameters—the
         equivalence ratio—is ramped. We show experimental evidence of a bifurcation delay
         and explain the phenomenon using a surrogate low-order model. This is particularly
         relevant for the development of new aeronautical and land-based gas turbines, which
         require fast loading or deloading, and which may be at risk due to such rate-delayed
         tipping points.
