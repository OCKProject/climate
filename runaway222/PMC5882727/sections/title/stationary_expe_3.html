      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results demonstrate how the system undergoes a subcritical Hopf bifurcation
         when the control parameter is varied. For low equivalence ratio 
         <span>ϕ</span>, the system state is attracted towards zero. The small fluctuations of the acoustic
         signal envelope are due to the stochastic forcing exerted by the intense turbulence
         in the combustor. For intermediate values of 
         <span>ϕ</span>, two states are possible: small amplitude acoustic pressure and high amplitude limit
         cycle. The intermittency between the two states is triggered by the turbulence-induced
         stochastic forcing (N-tipping, as in 
         <a>figure 1</a><span>c</span>). For higher equivalence ratio 
         <span>ϕ</span>, the stochastically forced limit cycle is the only stable state. The reader can refer
         to the electronic supplementary material for the movies of the three regimes.
