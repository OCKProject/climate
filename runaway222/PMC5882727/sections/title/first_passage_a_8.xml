 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this section, we imagine that a tipping point is feared due to the monotonous change of a key parameter of the system, and that one wants to ramp back this parameter sufficiently early to avoid the critical transition. In that situation, the underlying time-varying potential landscape is unknown and a controller monitors the state of the system while the parameter varies. As is usually done when new prototype engines are tested, we will take the current state of the system to feed the controller. Indeed, gas turbines and aeronautical engine combustors are equipped with a controller that constantly monitors the acoustic pressure level in the chamber. In case the measured acoustic pressure is too high, the control system intervenes, either changing the parameters to bring the operating condition back to a safe point, or in extreme cases, shutting off the flame by closing the fuel supply valve.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the combustor features a subcritical bifurcation on the varied parameter (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span>), the system inertia is a factor that has to be taken into account. In this case, the transition from low to high amplitudes happens suddenly and, if the bifurcation delay is long, the reached acoustic pressure level can be considerable. In this situation, the control system detects the danger late and might be ineffective in avoiding damages to the system. A way to estimate the hazard represented by the delayed bifurcation is to compute, using the surrogate model, the statistic of the time 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>fp</sub> needed to reach a certain danger level. This is similar to the classical problem of first passage time, often addressed in the context of bifurcation theory for stochastic dynamics in steady double-well potential [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C3">3</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS172078C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C55">55</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS172078C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C58">58</a>]. A major difference in the present situation is that the potential evolves with time. Ramp rate and noise intensity are expected to influence this escape problem as theoretically shown for other types of bifurcation in [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C59" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C59">59</a>] or [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C60">60</a>]. The statistic of the first passage time can be computed either performing an ensemble average over many time-domain simulations of the process, or solving the unsteady Fokker–Planck equation and imposing an absorbing boundary condition at that threshold level. Details about the two methods, with results in close agreement, are provided in appendix A.3. The value 
  <span class="italic">ν</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>th</sub>)=
  <span class="italic">ν</span>
  <sub>th</sub> of the control parameter 
  <span class="italic">ν</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) at the first passage time 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>th</sub> is of particular interest: this quantity is proportional to the danger of the delayed transition, as it determines the limit cycle amplitude when the transition occurs. This 
  <span class="italic">ν</span>
  <sub>th</sub> statistic can be determined as 
  <span class="italic">ν</span>
  <sub>th</sub>=
  <span class="italic">ν</span>
  <sub>0</sub>+
  <span class="italic">Rt</span>
  <sub>th</sub>. The results are presented in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F6" href="#RSOS172078F6">figure 6</a>. The contour levels represent the probability density of 
  <span class="italic">ν</span>
  <sub>th</sub> as a function of the ramp rate 
  <span class="italic">R</span>. The mean value of 
  <span class="italic">ν</span>
  <sub>th</sub> (plotted in blue, 〈
  <span class="italic">ν</span>
  <sub>th</sub>〉) increases with the ramp rate 
  <span class="italic">R</span>, while the time needed to reach the danger level is shorter (see the iso-time lines). This finding indicates that a fast ramp of the control parameter is dangerous if a subcritical bifurcation is present, as exemplified in the two test cases presented in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F7" href="#RSOS172078F7">figure 7</a>. Here the process was simulated in Simulink: the parameter 
  <span class="italic">ν</span> was ramped up at two different rates 
  <span class="italic">R</span> (10 and 50 rad s
  <span class="sup">−2</span>) and when the danger level was reached, ramped back down at the maximum rate 
  <span class="italic">R</span>=−50 rad s
  <span class="sup">−2</span>. In 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F7" href="#RSOS172078F7">figure 7</a>
  <span class="italic">a</span>,
  <span class="italic">b</span>, many realizations of this process are presented. As a function of the initial condition and of the random excitation, each realization has a different evolution and, therefore, a different first passage time. The two extreme realizations (shortest and longest first passage times) are highlighted with thick lines. The respective deterministic bifurcation diagrams are superimposed to provide a visual reference. The PDFs obtained with a KDE over the realizations are plotted in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F7" href="#RSOS172078F7">figure 7</a>
  <span class="italic">c</span>,
  <span class="italic">d</span>. The control system effectively brings the oscillations back to a safe level in both cases. However, the combined action of the finite ramp-down rate, dynamic hysteresis and inertia causes the system to stay in the danger zone for a certain time. The faster case 
  <span class="italic">R</span>=50 m s
  <span class="sup">−2</span> is more critical: as discussed before, the crossing of the threshold level happens on average when the target 
  <span class="italic">ν</span> is already high. As a result, the system abruptly reaches high-amplitude oscillations and has to travel a long distance on the bifurcation diagram upper branch before reaching the safety zone. This effect can be gauged by comparing two quantities for the two cases 
  <span class="italic">R</span>=10 and 50 rad s
  <span class="sup">−2</span>: in the latter case, the mean residence time over the safety threshold Δ
