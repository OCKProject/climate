      <p><span>A.1. Experimental set-up</span></p>
      <p>The experiments were conducted using a turbulent, small-scale, swirled combustor operated
         at atmospheric pressure. Electrically heated air (300
         <span>°</span>C) and methane are premixed upstream of the plenum. The mixture then goes through
         a swirler and reaches the combustion chamber. The total mass flow rate was kept constant,
         with a bulk velocity of 10 m s
         <span>−1</span> at the combustor inlet. The equivalence ratio was varied from 
         <span>ϕ</span>=0.580 to 
         <span>ϕ</span>=0.635, corresponding to a thermal power of about 12 kW. The inner and outer diameters
         of the eight-blade axial swirler are 19 mm and 41 mm, respectively. This swirler imparts
         rotation to the flow, with a swirl number of 0.6. A quartz window located on one side
         of the cylindrical combustion chamber provides optical access to the flame.
         
      </p>
      <p>Local acoustic pressure and spatially integrated OH* chemiluminescence were acquired
         synchronously at a rate of 10 kHz. Acoustic pressure was recorded by means of four
         calibrated water-cooled microphones (Brüel&amp;Kjær, type 4939) at several axial locations
         (−235, 25, 115 and 245 mm from the combustion chamber inlet). The OH* chemiluminescence
         intensity was recorded using a photomultiplier equipped with a 310 nm bandpass-filter.
         For such perfectly premixed lean flames, this signal can be considered as proportional
         to the heat release rate.
      </p>
      <p>The high-speed movies (1000 fps) of the turbulent flame are obtained with a LaVision
         HSS X camera coupled to a HS-IRO image intensifier. The UV-optimized lens (Nikkor
         105 mm 
         <span>f</span>/4.5) of the intensifier is equipped with a 310 nm filter, which band-passes the OH*
         chemiluminescence.

      <p><span>A.3. Calculation of the first passage time distribution using the FPE</span></p>
      <p>The following procedure was adopted to compute the distribution of the first passage
         time 
         <span>t</span><sub>th</sub> above the threshold 
         <span>A</span><sub>th</sub>. The FPE (

         <span>t</span>)=
         <span>ν</span><sub>0</sub>+
         <span>Rt</span> was numerically solved using the Matlab
         <span>®</span> ode23, imposing the Dirichlet condition 
         <span>P</span>(
         <span>A</span>=0;
         <span>t</span>)=0 on the lower boundary and an absorbing boundary condition on the threshold: 
         <span>P</span>(
         <span>A</span>;
         <span>t</span>&gt;
         <span>t</span>* |

         <span>t</span>*)=
         <span>A</span><sub>th</sub>;
         <span>t</span>*)=0. This boundary condition is a probability sink, which leads to a monotonic decay
         in time of the integral

         </div>. This integral represents the probability of not having crossed the threshold 
         <span>A</span><sub>th</sub> before time 
         <span>t</span>. Therefore, the probability of having crossed the threshold before 
         <span>t</span> is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the first passage time

         </div>. Subsequently, the PDF for the first passage time was obtained by differentiating
         the CDF and the results are given in 
         <a>figure 9</a><span>a</span>(i)(ii). In contrast with the FPE simulation presented in 
         <a>figure 8</a>, 
         <span>P</span>(
         <span>A</span>;
         <span>t</span>) is soaked up at 
         <span>A</span>=
         <span>A</span><sub>th</sub> due to the absorbing boundary condition. In turn, 
         <span>C</span>(
         <span>t</span>) increases monotonically from zero at 
         <span>t</span>=0 and approaches 1 for increasing likelihood of having passed the tipping-point.
         The PDF 
         <span>P</span>(
         <span>t</span><sub>th</sub>) (blue curve) is then deduced by differentiating 
         <span>C</span>(
         <span>t</span>) and the mean first passage time 〈
         <span>t</span><sub>th</sub>〉 is then readily computed as the mean of this probability distribution. In order
         to validate this FPE-based method, the first passage time probability distribution
         is computed doing a statistic of 5000 time-domain simulations of the process in Simulink
         <span>®</span>. Similarly to the unbounded case presented in the previous section, simulations are
         initialized according to the stationary PDF at time 0. For each simulation, the first
         time when the amplitude of the oscillations exceeds the amplitude 
         <span>A</span><sub>th</sub> is recorded, and the distribution of this time over all the realizations is computed.
         The results are presented in 
         <a>figure 9</a><span>b</span>(i)(ii): the outcome of the Monte Carlo simulations (histograms) confirms those of
         the FPE method for all the ramp rates 
         <span>R</span>. The map in 
         <a>figure 6</a> was generated repeating the FPE procedure presented in this section for different
         
         <span>R</span> and applying the mapping 
         <span>ν</span><sub>th</sub>=
         <span>ν</span><sub>0</sub>+
         <span>Rt</span><sub>fp</sub>. This approach is significantly cheaper from the computational viewpoint compared
         with the statistic of the time-domain simulations.

      <p><span>A.4. Supercritical bifurcation</span></p>
      <p>Bifurcation delays exist for any type of bifurcations. In the context of thermoacoustic
         instabilities in practical combustion chambers, supercritical stochastic Hopf bifurcations
         are very common. The Van der Pol oscillator with stochastic forcing is the simplest
         model for this type of bifurcation:

         of the subcritical Hopf bifurcation, simulations were performed to illustrate the
         incurred risk when one of the system parameters is ramped at a finite rate while a
         controller is fed with the current state of the system. The parameter 
         <span>ν</span> was ramped up in time and as soon as the oscillation amplitude exceeded the control
         threshold 
         <span>A</span><sub>th</sub>,
