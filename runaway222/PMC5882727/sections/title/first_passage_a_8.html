      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this section, we imagine that a tipping point is feared due to the monotonous change
         of a key parameter of the system, and that one wants to ramp back this parameter sufficiently
         early to avoid the critical transition. In that situation, the underlying time-varying
         potential landscape is unknown and a controller monitors the state of the system while
         the parameter varies. As is usually done when new prototype engines are tested, we
         will take the current state of the system to feed the controller. Indeed, gas turbines
         and aeronautical engine combustors are equipped with a controller that constantly
         monitors the acoustic pressure level in the chamber. In case the measured acoustic
         pressure is too high, the control system intervenes, either changing the parameters
         to bring the operating condition back to a safe point, or in extreme cases, shutting
         off the flame by closing the fuel supply valve.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the combustor features a subcritical bifurcation on the varied parameter (e.g.
         
         <span>ϕ</span>), the system inertia is a factor that has to be taken into account. In this case,
         the transition from low to high amplitudes happens suddenly and, if the bifurcation
         delay is long, the reached acoustic pressure level can be considerable. In this situation,
         the control system detects the danger late and might be ineffective in avoiding damages
         to the system. A way to estimate the hazard represented by the delayed bifurcation
         is to compute, using the surrogate model, the statistic of the time 
         <span>t</span><sub>fp</sub> needed to reach a certain danger level. This is similar to the classical problem
         of first passage time, often addressed in the context of bifurcation theory for stochastic
         dynamics in steady double-well potential [
         <a>3</a>,
         <a>55</a>–
         <a>58</a>]. A major difference in the present situation is that the potential evolves with
         time. Ramp rate and noise intensity are expected to influence this escape problem
         as theoretically shown for other types of bifurcation in [
         <a>59</a>] or [
         <a>60</a>]. The statistic of the first passage time can be computed either performing an ensemble
         average over many time-domain simulations of the process, or solving the unsteady
         Fokker–Planck equation and imposing an absorbing boundary condition at that threshold
         level. Details about the two methods, with results in close agreement, are provided
         in appendix A.3. The value 
         <span>ν</span>(
         <span>t</span><sub>th</sub>)=
         <span>ν</span><sub>th</sub> of the control parameter 
         <span>ν</span>(
         <span>t</span>) at the first passage time 
         <span>t</span><sub>th</sub> is of particular interest: this quantity is proportional to the danger of the delayed
         transition, as it determines the limit cycle amplitude when the transition occurs.
         This 
         <span>ν</span><sub>th</sub> statistic can be determined as 
         <span>ν</span><sub>th</sub>=
         <span>ν</span><sub>0</sub>+
         <span>Rt</span><sub>th</sub>. The results are presented in 
         <a>figure 6</a>. The contour levels represent the probability density of 
         <span>ν</span><sub>th</sub> as a function of the ramp rate 
         <span>R</span>. The mean value of 
         <span>ν</span><sub>th</sub> (plotted in blue, 〈
         <span>ν</span><sub>th</sub>〉) increases with the ramp rate 
         <span>R</span>, while the time needed to reach the danger level is shorter (see the iso-time lines).
         This finding indicates that a fast ramp of the control parameter is dangerous if a
         subcritical bifurcation is present, as exemplified in the two test cases presented
         in 
         <a>figure 7</a>. Here the process was simulated in Simulink: the parameter 
         <span>ν</span> was ramped up at two different rates 
         <span>R</span> (10 and 50 rad s
         <span>−2</span>) and when the danger level was reached, ramped back down at the maximum rate 
         <span>R</span>=−50 rad s
         <span>−2</span>. In 
         <a>figure 7</a><span>a</span>,
         <span>b</span>, many realizations of this process are presented. As a function of the initial condition
         and of the random excitation, each realization has a different evolution and, therefore,
         a different first passage time. The two extreme realizations (shortest and longest
         first passage times) are highlighted with thick lines. The respective deterministic
         bifurcation diagrams are superimposed to provide a visual reference. The PDFs obtained
         with a KDE over the realizations are plotted in 
         <a>figure 7</a><span>c</span>,
         <span>d</span>. The control system effectively brings the oscillations back to a safe level in both
         cases. However, the combined action of the finite ramp-down rate, dynamic hysteresis
         and inertia causes the system to stay in the danger zone for a certain time. The faster
         case 
         <span>R</span>=50 m s
         <span>−2</span> is more critical: as discussed before, the crossing of the threshold level happens
         on average when the target 
         <span>ν</span> is already high. As a result, the system abruptly reaches high-amplitude oscillations
         and has to travel a long distance on the bifurcation diagram upper branch before reaching
         the safety zone. This effect can be gauged by comparing two quantities for the two
         cases 
         <span>R</span>=10 and 50 rad s
         <span>−2</span>: in the latter case, the mean residence time over the safety threshold Δ
         <span>t</span><sub>th</sub> is twice larger and the mean released energy
