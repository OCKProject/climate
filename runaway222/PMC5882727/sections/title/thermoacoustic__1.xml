 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thermoacoustic coupling is a phenomenon that has fascinated scientists for over two centuries. In 1777, Dr William Higgins reported, with surprise, on a hydrogen flame emitting ‘sweet tones’ if placed inside a glass tube [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C44" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C44">44</a>]. In 1894, Lord Rayleigh provided an explanation to this observation: the gas in the tube resonates if the flame (or any other source) provides heat at the moment of maximum gas compression [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C45" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C45">45</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many years after, during the Cold War, thermoacoustic instabilities became a very critical issue for one of the most challenging projects ever realized by humankind: the Apollo programme to take man to the Moon. As detailed in [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C46" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C46">46</a>], the F-1 engines propelling the Saturn V had destructive combustion instabilities that required 2000 full-scale tests, with empirical modifications of the chamber geometry before the rocket was ready for take-off.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More recently, thermoacoustic instabilities became a recurrent issue in the development phase of heavy-duty gas turbines for power generation and turbofans for air transportation. This is because the resulting intense acoustic fields induce high-cycle fatigue of the combustion chambers [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C47">47</a>]. For heavy-duty gas turbines, the pressing demand for machines with high power density and ultra-low emissions, which are capable of compensating the production intermittency of the wind and solar sources, led to the use of lean premixed flames. Unfortunately, these flames are more prone to thermoacoustic instabilities. In the case of aeroplane turbofans, these instabilities constitute an increasingly serious obstacle to the development of new aeroengines complying with more stringent emission regulations [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C48">48</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The suppression of these instabilities is very challenging due to the uniqueness and complexity of engines in real-life application [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C49">49</a>]. Despite the achievements attained over the past decades in terms of passive mitigation implementation, development engineers cannot predict if a combustor prototype will have a sufficiently large pulsation-free operating window, over which the acoustic level is acceptable for the mechanical integrity of the components.

  </span> The air premixed with methane enters the plenum, a volume that, in practice, evens the flow delivered by the compressor and guides it to the inlet of the burner. Then, the mixture passes through the swirler, a set of curved blades that rotate the flow. This rotational motion is essential to achieve a stable anchoring of the flame. Then, the flow enters the combustion chamber, where combustion takes place. At any operating point, the fluctuating component

  <span class="italic">p</span> (in red) and the heat release rate 
  <span class="italic">q</span> (in blue) (note the symbols on the time trace corresponding to the four flame snapshots in the left loop). The flame exhibits a periodic motion at the frequency of the first acoustic mode (150 Hz), with sound intensity at the anti-nodes exceeding 150 dB, which is considerable for a burner operated at atmospheric pressure. This dynamic state would not be acceptable in a commercial aeronautical engine or in a heavy-duty gas turbine, because the acoustic loading, which scales with the engine operating pressure, would be highly detrimental for the mechanical components.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work, we focus on the transient thermoacoustic dynamics associated with the passage through the Hopf bifurcation when one of the critical operating parameters—the equivalence ratio—is ramped. We show experimental evidence of a bifurcation delay and explain the phenomenon using a surrogate low-order model. This is particularly relevant for the development of new aeronautical and land-based gas turbines, which require fast loading or deloading, and which may be at risk due to such rate-delayed tipping points.</p>
