 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this section, the dynamics of the system under transient operation is analysed. In the first part, experimental results obtained by ramping the bifurcation parameter are provided. They highlight the presence in the system dynamics of B- and N-tipping mechanisms combined with inertial and hysteresis effects. In the second part, the model introduced in §3.2 is used to study the influence of the ramp rate on the system dynamics.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following test was performed on the test rig to highlight the peculiar dynamics of this combustor. The methane and air mass flows were controlled such that the equivalence ratio 
   <span class="italic">ϕ</span> repeated 100 times the following four-step cycle: (1) linear increase for 4 s from 
   <span class="italic">ϕ</span>
   <sub>0</sub>=0.580 to 
   <span class="italic">ϕ</span>
   <sub>E</sub>=0.635; (2) idle for 10s at

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F4" href="#RSOS172078F4">Figure 4</a> presents the results of this experiment. The panels are grouped in two rows: the upper row corresponds to the statistic of the 100 ramps up, the lower row to the one of the 100 ramps down. Each column corresponds to an equivalence ratio. The PDFs of this ramp experiment were obtained via a kernel density estimation (KDE) applied over the 100 realizations, and they are plotted in colour (blue for the ramp up, red for the ramp down). In all the panels, the stationary PDF for the corresponding

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The system experiences dynamic hysteresis: in the bistable region, even though the stationary PDF features two maxima, the system stays in the low-amplitude (respectively, high-amplitude) range when 
   <span class="italic">ϕ</span> is ramped up (respectively, down). Another feature is the delay in transition, easily observable in the bottom row: the dynamic PDF peak is at an amplitude that is higher than the one of the stationary PDF at the same 
   <span class="italic">ϕ</span>. This means that the system experiences inertial effects, remaining close to the initial state longer: a bifurcation delay is observed. This observation corresponds to the case depicted in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F1" href="#RSOS172078F1">figure 1</a>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ramp rate, together with the ramp profile, is expected to influence the bifurcation delay, as shown in [
   <a rid="RSOS172078C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C31">31</a>] for a deterministic system. We therefore used the surrogate oscillator model to investigate this aspect in more detail. The parameter 
   <span class="italic">ν</span> was varied linearly in time between two values 
   <span class="italic">ν</span>
   <sub>0</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">ν</span>
   <sub>E</sub> at different rates 
   <span class="italic">R</span>. Two approaches were used. The first is to simulate (
   <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="RSOS172078M3x7" href="#RSOS172078M3x7">3.7</a>) in Simulink, varying the initial condition and running different realizations of the process. Extracting the envelope for each realization and considering the ensemble statistic, it is possible to draw maps of the evolution in time of the amplitude PDF 
   <span class="italic">P</span>(
   <span class="italic">A</span>;
   <span class="italic">t</span>). The other approach is to integrate numerically the FPE (
   <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="RSOS172078M3x8" href="#RSOS172078M3x8">3.8</a>) and obtain directly 
   <span class="italic">P</span>(
   <span class="italic">A</span>;
   <span class="italic">t</span>). The two methods closely agree, as shown in appendix A.2. In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F5" href="#RSOS172078F5">figure 5</a>, the results of the FPE integration are presented. A ramp up/idle/ramp down/idle cycle is solved, for two different ramp rates 
   <span class="italic">R</span>=50 rad s
   <span class="sup">−2</span> and 
   <span class="italic">R</span>=10 rad s
   <span class="sup">−2</span>. The dynamic stochastic bifurcation delay is captured and it is observed that a faster ramp leads to a more pronounced delayed transition from one stable point to the other.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important aspect of the phenomenon depicted in this figure is that the state transitions are delayed with respect to the bifurcation point, but not time delayed (the horizontal axis in these figures is normalized by the physical duration of the cycle). In other words, a higher rate of change of the time-varying potential induces a faster transition into the neighbouring basin of attraction, but the transition occurs for a delayed value of the bifurcation parameter compared to the quasi-steady picture of the system.</p>
