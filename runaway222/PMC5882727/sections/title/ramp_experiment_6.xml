 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following test was performed on the test rig to highlight the peculiar dynamics of this combustor. The methane and air mass flows were controlled such that the equivalence ratio 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span> repeated 100 times the following four-step cycle: (1) linear increase for 4 s from 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span>
  <sub>0</sub>=0.580 to 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span>
  <sub>E</sub>=0.635; (2) idle for 10s at 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span>
  <sub>E</sub>; (3) linear decrease for 4 s back to 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span>
  <sub>0</sub>; (4) idle for 10 s at the lowest equivalence ratio. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F4" href="#RSOS172078F4">Figure 4</a> presents the results of this experiment. The panels are grouped in two rows: the upper row corresponds to the statistic of the 100 ramps up, the lower row to the one of the 100 ramps down. Each column corresponds to an equivalence ratio. The PDFs of this ramp experiment were obtained via a kernel density estimation (KDE) applied over the 100 realizations, and they are plotted in colour (blue for the ramp up, red for the ramp down). In all the panels, the stationary PDF for the corresponding

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The system experiences dynamic hysteresis: in the bistable region, even though the stationary PDF features two maxima, the system stays in the low-amplitude (respectively, high-amplitude) range when 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span> is ramped up (respectively, down). Another feature is the delay in transition, easily observable in the bottom row: the dynamic PDF peak is at an amplitude that is higher than the one of the stationary PDF at the same 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span>. This means that the system experiences inertial effects, remaining close to the initial state longer: a bifurcation delay is observed. This observation corresponds to the case depicted in
