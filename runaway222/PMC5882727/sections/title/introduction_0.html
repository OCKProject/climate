      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many systems exhibit abrupt changes, or tipping, e.g. population extinction [
         <a>1</a>,
         <a>2</a>], emergence of infectious diseases [
         <a>3</a>], financial systems crisis [
         <a>4</a>], compression buckling of mechanical structures [
         <a>5</a>] and climate transitions [
         <a>6</a>–
         <a>8</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping is dangerous if some states of the system are associated with extreme or catastrophic
         events, and this explains the interest this subject has received in the last decades.
         Recently, different studies demonstrated that economical or environmental disasters
         can be modelled as dynamical systems incurring a tipping. Therefore, the development
         of tipping forecasting techniques with early indicators is an active research area
         [
         <a>9</a>–
         <a>11</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A key aspect in this context is the distinction between three types of tipping, rooted
         in different causes [
         <a>12</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span>B-tipping</span> is induced by a 
         <span>bifurcation</span> where the system state changes drastically for a small change of a control parameter.
         In this case, the tipping can be often predicted with techniques that rely on the
         popular concept of critical slowing down [
         <a>13</a>–
         <a>17</a>], or that make use of other properties of the attractor [
         <a>18</a>,
         <a>19</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 
         <span>N-tipping</span>, dynamic 
         <span>noise</span> induces jumps between several coexisting attractors (e.g. [
         <a>20</a>–
         <a>23</a>]); in this case, the analysis of the time-series statistic can help in detecting
         precursor of critical transitions [
         <a>24</a>,
         <a>25</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span>R-tipping</span> is induced by the 
         <span>rate</span> at which a control parameter is varied, if several possible attractors are present
         in the range of parameter variation. Inertial effects play a central role in R-tipping.
         In the case of standard R-tipping, the system starts from an attractor but, if the
         parameter rate of change is larger than a critical value, it cannot follow this attractor
         and tips to another one [
         <a>26</a>–
         <a>29</a>]. In the case of ‘preconditioned R-tipping’, the system starts from an unstable condition
         and, depending on the rate of change, it evolves towards one of the possible attractors
         [
         <a>30</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inertial effects can also delay the bifurcation, moving the tipping point to higher/lower
         values of the bifurcation parameter as observed, for example, by Baer &amp; Gaekel [
         <a>31</a>] for the FitzHugh–Nagumo model. This delay is in general a function of the parameter
         rate of change. Therefore, we will refer to this effect as ‘rate-delayed tipping’.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All those mechanisms can manifest independently, or, like in the present study, simultaneously.
         In this case, the evolution of the system results from the interplay of different
         time scales set by the ramp rate, the noise intensity and the system relaxation time
         [
         <a>32</a>]. Several examples can be found in the recent literature. Ashwin 
         <span>et al.</span> [
         <a>33</a>] study the regimes of transition and the escape time in a network of bistable nodes
         as a function of the coupling and noise strengths. Sun 
         <span>et al</span>. [
         <a>34</a>] assess the possibility of tipping for a Duffing–Van der Pol oscillator with time-delayed
         feedback, as a function of forcing noise intensity, feedback time delay and feedback
         intensity. The work from Clements &amp; Ozgul [
         <a>35</a>] deals with two stochastic models for population dynamics, and studies the effect
         of the rate of change of one governing parameter on the system dynamics and on the
         predictability of tipping. Berglund &amp; Gentz [
         <a>36</a>] provide theoretical and numerical analyses for rate-delayed tipping in the presence
         of noise in supercritical pitchfork bifurcations. An analogous study is carried out
         by Ritchie &amp; Sieber [
         <a>37</a>] for a rate-dependent tipping in a saddle-node bifurcation. Kwasniok [
         <a>38</a>] introduces a method to predict a fold and a Hopf bifurcation in the presence of
         noise. Kuehn [
         <a>39</a>] studies the delay in a Hopf bifurcation with a random initial condition.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we show experimental evidence of simultaneous B-, N- and rate-delayed
         tipping mechanisms at a Hopf subcritical bifurcation, in a laboratory-scale combustor
         subject to thermoacoustic instabilities in the presence of turbulence-induced noise.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The four panels in 
         <a>figure 1</a> illustrate how the three types of tipping combine in our system. In these diagrams,
         the amplitude 
         <span>A</span> is plotted as a function of the bifurcation parameter 
         <span>ν</span>. In the absence of noise and for a quasi-steady change of the bifurcation parameter
         (
         <a>figure 1</a><span>a</span>), the system state evolves on the deterministic attractor, leading to B-tipping and
         hysteresis (blue and red for increasing and decreasing 
         <span>ν</span>). This quasi-steady picture changes if the bifurcation parameter varies at a finite
         rate (
         <a>figure 1</a><span>b</span>): bifurcation delay occurs, and it is a function of the rate (e.g. [
         <a>40</a>–
         <a>42</a>]). For a quasi-steady variation of 
         <span>ν</span> in the presence of stochastic forcing (
         <a>figure 1</a><span>c</span>), the hysteresis is suppressed in a statistical sense. For each value of the bifurcation
         parameter, the state is defined by a probability density distribution. In this case,
         N-tipping occurs in the bistable region (e.g. [
         <a>6</a>,
         <a>43</a>]). Finally, when the bifurcation parameter is varied at a finite rate in the presence
         of stochastic forcing (
         <a>figure 1</a><span>d</span>), the highest probability of state transition is delayed. This is the case discussed
         in this work. Our scenario, therefore, results from the combination of a finite-rate
         ramping through a stochastic subcritical bifurcation.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper is organized as follows. In §
         <a>2</a>, we introduce the physical problem of thermoacoustic instabilities. In §§3.1 and
         4.1, we show experimental results where the average tipping point is delayed when
         the control parameter is ramped at a finite rate. In §§3.2 and 4.2, we develop a low-order
         stochastic model of the system and demonstrate with a quantitative first-passage time
         analysis how the bifurcation delay statistic varies with the ramping rate. Finally,
         in §
         <a>5</a> we consider a situation where a control parameter is ramped up and, if tipping is
         detected, ramped down in order to come back to the initial safe state. In this situation,
         the system may suffer irreversible damage if the ramp up is too fast, which applies
         to many industrial applications or to natural systems like, for instance, climate
         transitions.
