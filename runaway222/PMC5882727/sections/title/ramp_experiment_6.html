      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following test was performed on the test rig to highlight the peculiar dynamics
         of this combustor. The methane and air mass flows were controlled such that the equivalence
         ratio 
         <span>ϕ</span> repeated 100 times the following four-step cycle: (1) linear increase for 4 s from
         
         <span>ϕ</span><sub>0</sub>=0.580 to 
         <span>ϕ</span><sub>E</sub>=0.635; (2) idle for 10s at 
         <span>ϕ</span><sub>E</sub>; (3) linear decrease for 4 s back to 
         <span>ϕ</span><sub>0</sub>; (4) idle for 10 s at the lowest equivalence ratio. 
         <a>Figure 4</a> presents the results of this experiment. The panels are grouped in two rows: the
         upper row corresponds to the statistic of the 100 ramps up, the lower row to the one
         of the 100 ramps down. Each column corresponds to an equivalence ratio. The PDFs of
         this ramp experiment were obtained via a kernel density estimation (KDE) applied over
         the 100 realizations, and they are plotted in colour (blue for the ramp up, red for
         the ramp down). In all the panels, the stationary PDF for the corresponding 
         <span>ϕ</span> (no ramping, already presented in 
         <a>figure 3</a><span>a</span>) is given in grey as a reference.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The system experiences dynamic hysteresis: in the bistable region, even though the
         stationary PDF features two maxima, the system stays in the low-amplitude (respectively,
         high-amplitude) range when 
         <span>ϕ</span> is ramped up (respectively, down). Another feature is the delay in transition, easily
         observable in the bottom row: the dynamic PDF peak is at an amplitude that is higher
         than the one of the stationary PDF at the same 
         <span>ϕ</span>. This means that the system experiences inertial effects, remaining close to the
         initial state longer: a bifurcation delay is observed. This observation corresponds
         to the case depicted in 
         <a>figure 1</a><span>d</span>.
