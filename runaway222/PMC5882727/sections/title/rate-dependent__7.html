      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ramp rate, together with the ramp profile, is expected to influence the bifurcation
         delay, as shown in [
         <a>31</a>] for a deterministic system. We therefore used the surrogate oscillator model to
         investigate this aspect in more detail. The parameter 
         <span>ν</span> was varied linearly in time between two values 
         <span>ν</span><sub>0</sub> and 
         <span>ν</span><sub>E</sub> at different rates 
         <span>R</span>. Two approaches were used. The first is to simulate (
         <a>3.7</a>) in Simulink, varying the initial condition and running different realizations of
         the process. Extracting the envelope for each realization and considering the ensemble
         statistic, it is possible to draw maps of the evolution in time of the amplitude PDF
         
         <span>P</span>(
         <span>A</span>;
         <span>t</span>). The other approach is to integrate numerically the FPE (
         <a>3.8</a>) and obtain directly 
         <span>P</span>(
         <span>A</span>;
         <span>t</span>). The two methods closely agree, as shown in appendix A.2. In 
         <a>figure 5</a>, the results of the FPE integration are presented. A ramp up/idle/ramp down/idle
         cycle is solved, for two different ramp rates 
         <span>R</span>=50 rad s
         <span>−2</span> and 
         <span>R</span>=10 rad s
         <span>−2</span>. The dynamic stochastic bifurcation delay is captured and it is observed that a faster
         ramp leads to a more pronounced delayed transition from one stable point to the other.

                  <span>ν</span><sub>E</sub>=5.5 for the oscillator model (
                  <a>3.7</a>) for two different ramp rates 
                  <span>R</span>. The contour plot represents the PDF

                  <span>A</span>;
                  <span>t</span>) computed by time-marching the FPE (
                  <a>3.8</a>). The time is normalized with the ramp time

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important aspect of the phenomenon depicted in this figure is that the state transitions
         are delayed with respect to the bifurcation point, but not time delayed (the horizontal
         axis in these figures is normalized by the physical duration of the cycle). In other
         words, a higher rate of change of the time-varying potential induces a faster transition
         into the neighbouring basin of attraction, but the transition occurs for a delayed
         value of the bifurcation parameter compared to the quasi-steady picture of the system.
