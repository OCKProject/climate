      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this section, the dynamics of the system under transient operation is analysed.
         In the first part, experimental results obtained by ramping the bifurcation parameter
         are provided. They highlight the presence in the system dynamics of B- and N-tipping
         mechanisms combined with inertial and hysteresis effects. In the second part, the
         model introduced in §3.2 is used to study the influence of the ramp rate on the system
         dynamics.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following test was performed on the test rig to highlight the peculiar dynamics
            of this combustor. The methane and air mass flows were controlled such that the equivalence
            ratio 
            <span>ϕ</span> repeated 100 times the following four-step cycle: (1) linear increase for 4 s from
            
            <span>ϕ</span><sub>0</sub>=0.580 to 
            <span>ϕ</span><sub>E</sub>=0.635; (2) idle for 10s at 
            <span>ϕ</span><sub>E</sub>; (3) linear decrease for 4 s back to 
            <span>ϕ</span><sub>0</sub>; (4) idle for 10 s at the lowest equivalence ratio. 
            <a>Figure 4</a> presents the results of this experiment. The panels are grouped in two rows: the
            upper row corresponds to the statistic of the 100 ramps up, the lower row to the one
            of the 100 ramps down. Each column corresponds to an equivalence ratio. The PDFs of
            this ramp experiment were obtained via a kernel density estimation (KDE) applied over
            the 100 realizations, and they are plotted in colour (blue for the ramp up, red for
            the ramp down). In all the panels, the stationary PDF for the corresponding 
            <span>ϕ</span> (no ramping, already presented in 
            <a>figure 3</a><span>a</span>) is given in grey as a reference.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The system experiences dynamic hysteresis: in the bistable region, even though the
            stationary PDF features two maxima, the system stays in the low-amplitude (respectively,
            high-amplitude) range when 
            <span>ϕ</span> is ramped up (respectively, down). Another feature is the delay in transition, easily
            observable in the bottom row: the dynamic PDF peak is at an amplitude that is higher
            than the one of the stationary PDF at the same 
            <span>ϕ</span>. This means that the system experiences inertial effects, remaining close to the
            initial state longer: a bifurcation delay is observed. This observation corresponds
            to the case depicted in 
            <a>figure 1</a><span>d</span>.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ramp rate, together with the ramp profile, is expected to influence the bifurcation
            delay, as shown in [
            <a>31</a>] for a deterministic system. We therefore used the surrogate oscillator model to
            investigate this aspect in more detail. The parameter 
            <span>ν</span> was varied linearly in time between two values 
            <span>ν</span><sub>0</sub> and 
            <span>ν</span><sub>E</sub> at different rates 
            <span>R</span>. Two approaches were used. The first is to simulate (
            <a>3.7</a>) in Simulink, varying the initial condition and running different realizations of
            the process. Extracting the envelope for each realization and considering the ensemble
            statistic, it is possible to draw maps of the evolution in time of the amplitude PDF
            
            <span>P</span>(
            <span>A</span>;
            <span>t</span>). The other approach is to integrate numerically the FPE (
            <a>3.8</a>) and obtain directly 
            <span>P</span>(
            <span>A</span>;
            <span>t</span>). The two methods closely agree, as shown in appendix A.2. In 
            <a>figure 5</a>, the results of the FPE integration are presented. A ramp up/idle/ramp down/idle
            cycle is solved, for two different ramp rates 
            <span>R</span>=50 rad s
            <span>−2</span> and 
            <span>R</span>=10 rad s
            <span>−2</span>. The dynamic stochastic bifurcation delay is captured and it is observed that a faster
            ramp leads to a more pronounced delayed transition from one stable point to the other.

                     <span>A</span>;
                     <span>t</span>) computed by time-marching the FPE (
                     <a>3.8</a>). The time is normalized with the ramp time

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important aspect of the phenomenon depicted in this figure is that the state transitions
            are delayed with respect to the bifurcation point, but not time delayed (the horizontal
            axis in these figures is normalized by the physical duration of the cycle). In other
            words, a higher rate of change of the time-varying potential induces a faster transition
            into the neighbouring basin of attraction, but the transition occurs for a delayed
            value of the bifurcation parameter compared to the quasi-steady picture of the system.
