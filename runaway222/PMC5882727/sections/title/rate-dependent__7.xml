 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ramp rate, together with the ramp profile, is expected to influence the bifurcation delay, as shown in [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C31">31</a>] for a deterministic system. We therefore used the surrogate oscillator model to investigate this aspect in more detail. The parameter 
  <span class="italic">ν</span> was varied linearly in time between two values 
  <span class="italic">ν</span>
  <sub>0</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">ν</span>
  <sub>E</sub> at different rates 
  <span class="italic">R</span>. Two approaches were used. The first is to simulate (
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="RSOS172078M3x7" href="#RSOS172078M3x7">3.7</a>) in Simulink, varying the initial condition and running different realizations of the process. Extracting the envelope for each realization and considering the ensemble statistic, it is possible to draw maps of the evolution in time of the amplitude PDF 
  <span class="italic">P</span>(
  <span class="italic">A</span>;
  <span class="italic">t</span>). The other approach is to integrate numerically the FPE (
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="RSOS172078M3x8" href="#RSOS172078M3x8">3.8</a>) and obtain directly 
  <span class="italic">P</span>(
  <span class="italic">A</span>;
  <span class="italic">t</span>). The two methods closely agree, as shown in appendix A.2. In 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F5" href="#RSOS172078F5">figure 5</a>, the results of the FPE integration are presented. A ramp up/idle/ramp down/idle cycle is solved, for two different ramp rates 
  <span class="italic">R</span>=50 rad s
  <span class="sup">−2</span> and 
  <span class="italic">R</span>=10 rad s
  <span class="sup">−2</span>. The dynamic stochastic bifurcation delay is captured and it is observed that a faster ramp leads to a more pronounced delayed transition from one stable point to the other.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important aspect of the phenomenon depicted in this figure is that the state transitions are delayed with respect to the bifurcation point, but not time delayed (the horizontal axis in these figures is normalized by the physical duration of the cycle). In other words, a higher rate of change of the time-varying potential induces a faster transition into the neighbouring basin of attraction, but the transition occurs for a delayed value of the bifurcation parameter compared to the quasi-steady picture of the system.</p>
