 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many systems exhibit abrupt changes, or tipping, e.g. population extinction [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C1">1</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS172078C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C2">2</a>], emergence of infectious diseases [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C3">3</a>], financial systems crisis [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C4">4</a>], compression buckling of mechanical structures [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C5">5</a>] and climate transitions [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C6">6</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS172078C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C8">8</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping is dangerous if some states of the system are associated with extreme or catastrophic events, and this explains the interest this subject has received in the last decades. Recently, different studies demonstrated that economical or environmental disasters can be modelled as dynamical systems incurring a tipping. Therefore, the development of tipping forecasting techniques with early indicators is an active research area [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C9">9</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS172078C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C11">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A key aspect in this context is the distinction between three types of tipping, rooted in different causes [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C12">12</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">B-tipping</span> is induced by a 
  <span class="italic">bifurcation</span> where the system state changes drastically for a small change of a control parameter. In this case, the tipping can be often predicted with techniques that rely on the popular concept of critical slowing down [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C13">13</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS172078C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C17">17</a>], or that make use of other properties of the attractor [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C18">18</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS172078C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C19">19</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 
  <span class="italic">N-tipping</span>, dynamic 
  <span class="italic">noise</span> induces jumps between several coexisting attractors (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C20">20</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS172078C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C23">23</a>]); in this case, the analysis of the time-series statistic can help in detecting precursor of critical transitions [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C24">24</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS172078C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C25">25</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">R-tipping</span> is induced by the 
  <span class="italic">rate</span> at which a control parameter is varied, if several possible attractors are present in the range of parameter variation. Inertial effects play a central role in R-tipping. In the case of standard R-tipping, the system starts from an attractor but, if the parameter rate of change is larger than a critical value, it cannot follow this attractor and tips to another one [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C26">26</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS172078C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C29">29</a>]. In the case of ‘preconditioned R-tipping’, the system starts from an unstable condition and, depending on the rate of change, it evolves towards one of the possible attractors [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C30">30</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inertial effects can also delay the bifurcation, moving the tipping point to higher/lower values of the bifurcation parameter as observed, for example, by Baer &amp; Gaekel [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C31">31</a>] for the FitzHugh–Nagumo model. This delay is in general a function of the parameter rate of change. Therefore, we will refer to this effect as ‘rate-delayed tipping’.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All those mechanisms can manifest independently, or, like in the present study, simultaneously. In this case, the evolution of the system results from the interplay of different time scales set by the ramp rate, the noise intensity and the system relaxation time [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C32">32</a>]. Several examples can be found in the recent literature. Ashwin 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C33">33</a>] study the regimes of transition and the escape time in a network of bistable nodes as a function of the coupling and noise strengths. Sun 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C34">34</a>] assess the possibility of tipping for a Duffing–Van der Pol oscillator with time-delayed feedback, as a function of forcing noise intensity, feedback time delay and feedback intensity. The work from Clements &amp; Ozgul [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C35">35</a>] deals with two stochastic models for population dynamics, and studies the effect of the rate of change of one governing parameter on the system dynamics and on the predictability of tipping. Berglund &amp; Gentz [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C36" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C36">36</a>] provide theoretical and numerical analyses for rate-delayed tipping in the presence of noise in supercritical pitchfork bifurcations. An analogous study is carried out by Ritchie &amp; Sieber [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C37">37</a>] for a rate-dependent tipping in a saddle-node bifurcation. Kwasniok [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C38">38</a>] introduces a method to predict a fold and a Hopf bifurcation in the presence of noise. Kuehn [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C39">39</a>] studies the delay in a Hopf bifurcation with a random initial condition.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we show experimental evidence of simultaneous B-, N- and rate-delayed tipping mechanisms at a Hopf subcritical bifurcation, in a laboratory-scale combustor subject to thermoacoustic instabilities in the presence of turbulence-induced noise.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The four panels in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F1" href="#RSOS172078F1">figure 1</a> illustrate how the three types of tipping combine in our system. In these diagrams, the amplitude 
  <span class="italic">A</span> is plotted as a function of the bifurcation parameter 
  <span class="italic">ν</span>. In the absence of noise and for a quasi-steady change of the bifurcation parameter (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F1" href="#RSOS172078F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">a</span>), the system state evolves on the deterministic attractor, leading to B-tipping and hysteresis (blue and red for increasing and decreasing 
  <span class="italic">ν</span>). This quasi-steady picture changes if the bifurcation parameter varies at a finite rate (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F1" href="#RSOS172078F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">b</span>): bifurcation delay occurs, and it is a function of the rate (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C40" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C40">40</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS172078C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C42">42</a>]). For a quasi-steady variation of 
  <span class="italic">ν</span> in the presence of stochastic forcing (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F1" href="#RSOS172078F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">c</span>), the hysteresis is suppressed in a statistical sense. For each value of the bifurcation parameter, the state is defined by a probability density distribution. In this case, N-tipping occurs in the bistable region (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSOS172078C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C6">6</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS172078C43" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS172078C43">43</a>]). Finally, when the bifurcation parameter is varied at a finite rate in the presence of stochastic forcing (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS172078F1" href="#RSOS172078F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">d</span>), the highest probability of state transition is delayed. This is the case discussed in this work. Our scenario, therefore, results from the combination of a finite-rate ramping through a stochastic subcritical bifurcation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper is organized as follows. In §
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s2" href="#s2">2</a>, we introduce the physical problem of thermoacoustic instabilities. In §§3.1 and 4.1, we show experimental results where the average tipping point is delayed when the control parameter is ramped at a finite rate. In §§3.2 and 4.2, we develop a low-order stochastic model of the system and demonstrate with a quantitative first-passage time analysis how the bifurcation delay statistic varies with the ramping rate. Finally, in §
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s5" href="#s5">5</a> we consider a situation where a control parameter is ramped up and, if tipping is detected, ramped down in order to come back to the initial safe state. In this situation, the system may suffer irreversible damage if the ramp up is too fast, which applies to many industrial applications or to natural systems like, for instance, climate transitions.
