This study aimed to assess the feasibility of an intervention intended to improve patient safety in general practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A randomised controlled feasibility study was conducted with general practices in the Republic of Ireland (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) and Northern Ireland (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2), randomly assigned to the intervention (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) or control (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) group. The nine-month intervention consisted of: 1) repeated safety climate (SC) measurement (using GP-SafeQuest questionnaire) and feedback (comparative anonymised practice-level SC data), and 2) patient record reviews using a specialised trigger tool to identify instances of undetected patient harm. For control practices, SC was measured at baseline and study end only. The intervention&#x02019;s perceived usefulness and feasibility were explored via an end-of-study questionnaire and semi-structured interviews.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Thirteen practices were invited; 11 participated; 10 completed the study. At baseline, 84.8% of intervention practice staff (39/46) and 77.8% (42/54) of control practice staff completed the SC questionnaire; at the study terminus, 78.3% (36/46) of intervention practice staff and 68.5% (37/54) of control practice staff did so. Changes in SC scores, indicating improvement, were observed among the intervention practices but not in the control group. The trigger tool was applied to 188 patient records; patient safety incidents of varying severity were detected in 19.1% (36/188). Overall, 59% of intervention practice team members completed the end-of-study questionnaire, with the majority in both healthcare systems responding positively about the intervention. Interviews (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) identified the intervention&#x02019;s usefulness in informing practice management and patient safety issues, time as a barrier to its use, and the value of group discussion of feedback.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">This feasibility study suggests that a definitive randomised controlled trial of the intervention is warranted. Our findings suggest that the intervention is feasible, useful, and sustainable. Practices were willing to be recruited into the study, response and retention rates were acceptable, and there is possible evidence of a positive effect of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">The trial registration number is: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN11426121">ISRCTN11426121</ext-link> (retrospectively registered 12th June 2018).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12875-019-0909-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Patient safety</kwd><kwd>General practice</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Feasibility</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>safety climate</kwd><kwd>safety culture</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010414</institution-id><institution>Health Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CTN-2014-011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Andrew W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par17">The importance of an increasing focus on patient safety in healthcare has been recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, whilst the majority of patient contacts occur in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], there has been a far greater focus on patient safety in hospital settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], arguably due to a perception of primary care as a relatively lower-risk endeavour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, both patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and practice factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] have contributed to a growing complexity of clinical practice for general practitioners (GPs) which, combined with the sheer volume of patient contact, increases the potential for patient safety incidents (PSIs) in primary care. This is particularly concerning as GPs have reported several barriers to monitoring patient safety, such as limited and unreliable data on serious incidents, time to review practice-level data, and lack of examples of serious harm or &#x02018;never&#x02019; events that are applicable to primary care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Recognising the limited data on patient safety in primary care, the World Health Organisation has noted the pressing need to study and address patient safety in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In secondary care settings, targeted strategies have been implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], with varying degrees of supporting evidence. However, a systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] of interventions to improve safety culture in primary care identified only two published interventional studies. Although both studies reported positive outcomes, methodological issues precluded the derivation of conclusive recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The Scottish Patient Safety Programme in Primary Care (SPSP-PC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] is one of the first comprehensive and coordinated attempts to improve patient safety in primary care. This programme has been implemented in 90% of Scottish general practices, with 83% reporting that it enabled them to make changes within their practice, resulting in safer, higher quality patient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. GP feedback on the programme&#x02019;s acceptability, feasibility, and utility has been predominantly positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, its impact has not yet been evaluated independently of its developers, or assessed using a strong experimental design. Given the dearth of information on safety interventions in primary care, we therefore aimed to inform the design of a definitive randomised controlled trial of a primary care patient safety intervention.</p><p id="Par20">We report the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial of an intervention, developed previously by SPSP-PC, within primary care settings in two different healthcare systems; the Republic of Ireland (RoI) and Northern Ireland (NI). Following recommendations for good practice when designing pilot and feasibility studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], we aimed to evaluate rates of recruitment and retention of practices, response rates to questionnaires, completion of outcome measures, and participants&#x02019; perceptions of the intervention and effects of the intervention on safety climate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par21">Our study protocol was published previously and provides a detailed overview of the study&#x02019;s methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] in accordance with CONSORT guidelines for pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par22">A randomised controlled design was used, whereby participating practices were assigned to either the intervention or control group by an external researcher using online randomisation software.

A purposeful sample of RoI practices was recruited through the Western Research Network (WestREN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], an Irish GP research network. Practices were stratified according to size (large (&#x0003e;&#x02009;2 GP principals) or small (&#x02264;2 GP principals) and location (urban or rural). In the RoI, 13 practices were invited to participate, with 11 practices agreeing: two declined, due to the required time commitment. In NI, two practices of similar size and location (large; urban) were invited through the NI Clinical Research Network Primary Care Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]: both agreed to participate.</p><p id="Par25">Invitation letters were sent to the principal GP(s) in the selected practices (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and, with their consent, other staff were then invited to participate. In the RoI, GPs provide services for private patients who pay for each consultation, and for patients with medical cards, whose healthcare is publicly funded. In NI, GP services are provided free-of-charge through the National Health Service.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the SAP-C feasibility study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12875_2019_909_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Setting and participants</title><p id="Par26">Of the 11 practices who initially joined the study, 10 completed (8 RoI, 2 NI; 7 urban, 3 rural).

In each practice, all staff provided personal written consent regarding their participation and all data were recorded anonymously.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Procedure</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention practices</title><p id="Par27">The intervention consisted of two components: (1) safety climate (SC) measurement and feedback and (2) patient record review using a specialised trigger tool to identify instances of harm (i.e., the trigger review method (TRM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]).</p><p id="Par28">SC was assessed using the GP-SafeQuest for primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. SC is described as a measurable snapshot of an underlying safety culture at a particular period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The GP-SafeQuest is a valid and reliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] survey instrument, designed specifically to measure SC perception, in primary care settings, across five subscales (leadership, teamwork, communication, workload, and safety systems), using Likert scales. Paper copies and stamped addressed envelopes were delivered to practices at three time points (baseline, study midpoint, and study terminus; see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">Each intervention practice received individualised practice-level feedback (a written report) on their baseline and study midpoint SC surveys, within a month of survey completion. Simple descriptive statistics and illustrative diagrams allowed comparison of SC scores with other practices&#x02019; anonymised data. Additionally, a research team member presented and led discussion of the findings at a practice meeting where the primary care team also discussed PSIs identified through reviews of their patients&#x02019; records, as described below.</p><p id="Par30">One GP from each practice was asked to conduct a patient record review using the TRM at 3 and 7&#x02009;months (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The GP who conducted the review attended a two-hour training workshop delivered one-to-one by a facilitator (CC) using previously developed materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is important to indicate that the TRM was an intervention component and not an outcome measure: its purpose was to facilitate the identification of specific patient safety issues within each practice.</p><p id="Par31">At each time-point, the reviewer was requested to apply the TRM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] to a minimum of 20 and maximum of 30 records from a high-risk group (aged &#x0003e;&#x02009;75&#x02009;years), randomly selected from patients who had attended the practice during the previous three months. Records were first reviewed in order to detect whether they contained a &#x02018;trigger&#x02019;, defined as flags, occurrences or prompts that alert reviewers to potential errors and previously undetected adverse events (e.g., more than three consultations in seven days, hospital admission, repeat medication stopped) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. If a trigger was found, the record was reviewed in greater detail to determine whether the patient experienced any harm. Based on the definition used by De Wet and Bowie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], harm was defined as &#x02018;anything that happens as a result of interaction with health services that you would not want to happen to you or your relatives&#x02019;. If no harm was detected, or the reviewer was unsure whether harm had occurred, they were advised not to record the incident. If harm was detected, the reviewer classified its perceived severity, and whether it was preventable and originated in secondary or primary care, using previously developed rating scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Participants completed a Trigger Review Summary Report (TRSR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], a standardised form containing a summary of anonymised data on the number of detected triggers, details of PSIs, and actions that were or should be taken as a result of the review.</p><p id="Par33">Each intervention practice received 1000 Euro for participating.

Within both these systems our findings regarding rates of recruitment, retention and completion, and evidence of potential positive impact suggest that a definitive trial is feasible. Only two practices declined to participate; one practice withdrew from the study, after the doctor leading participation left the practice, demonstrating the importance of a local &#x02018;champion&#x02019; to drive the intervention. The overall response rates to the SC (over 70%) and end-of-study questionnaires (59%) were encouraging: obtaining good response rates from GPs is challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par61">Our intervention group&#x02019;s perceptions that the TRM was useful in improving patient safety concurred with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The number of PSIs, their severity, and the proportions considered preventable and originating in primary care were within the range of previous studies reporting TRM use in primary care; a recent systematic review reported an overall mean of 12.6 safety incidents (range: 2.3 to 26.5) per 100 records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, caution should be taken in comparing numbers of PSIs between studies as differences may be attributable to different methodologies. The chart review in our study was used to identify areas for improvement: its reliability in assessing PSIs as a measure of patient safety cannot be determined as it was conducted by only one GP, with limited training, in each practice.</p><p id="Par62">The intervention was generally well received but time was the main barrier to its use. Therefore, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], there would be a need to incentivise participation and compensate practices for the time required to participate in a definitive trial of the intervention. Such incentives could be financial, or alternatives may be identified by prospective trial participants. Particularly if the intervention is to be translated into routine practice, the issue of time allocation for its use must be considered.</p><p id="Par63">In the control practices, changes in subscale and overall SC scores were either in the undesired direction or minimal but in intervention practices, all the changes in SC scores were in the desired direction, although the size of change varied across subscales. The mean scores we observed on the five SC subscales are broadly comparable to other studies which have used the GP-SafeQuest survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Concurring with previous reports, managerial groups tended to have a more positive view of SC than had the non-managerial groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Of note, amongst the intervention managerial group, the workload subscale had the lowest mean score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. High workload is of particular concern given that it has been found to have a negative effect on patient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and&#x000a0;doctor well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], as well as being&#x000a0;considered to be a major contributor to the recruitment and retention crisis facing UK general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. There is a need for improved understanding of the contributors to workload in primary care and of its implications for patient safety.</p><p id="Par64">Although it is widely agreed that a good SC is associated with safety, and that there is a relationship between safety culture and PSIs, the nature of the causal relationship between these variables is not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, whilst we have identified a potential positive effect on SC from our intervention, which may be used to inform a sample size calculation for a definitive trial, other appropriate primary outcome measures of patient safety should also be considered. One such measure may be the change in the number of PSIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] identified in an independent and blinded review of high-risk patient charts using the TRM. However, this outcome was not explicitly assessed in the current study and has limitations, particularly in terms of the required resources and recent European data protection regulations. These regulations require consent from patients for review of their records, or the records must be anonymised prior to review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Another interventional technique developed by the SPSP-PC, the safety checklist for general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which offers a practical approach to the identification of potential hazards in the practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], may also be considered for use in further work. However, of note, a recent systematic review has identified that as yet there is no evident &#x0201c;best&#x0201d; method of measuring patient safety in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p id="Par65">Consistent with recommendations that analysis of feasibility studies should be mainly descriptive, we did not conduct inferential statistics or hypothesis testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Our sample size was pragmatic, aiming to include practices of diverse size and location, and from two different healthcare systems. There was a potential for selection bias to occur, as practices in which there is a greater focus on patient safety, and consequently an increased motivation to implement interventions to improve patient safety, may be more likely to choose to partake in the proposed study and this may impact upon intervention outcomes. Whilst there was a reliance on self-report (i.e., of SC and PSIs) rather than objective data, a strength of our study was that we preserved anonymity of all data, both within and between participating practices in order to minimise reporting bias.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par66">We believe our feasibility study suggests that a novel definitive randomised controlled trial of an intervention to improve patient safety in primary care is warranted. Our findings suggest that the intervention we have tested is feasible, useful, and sustainable in two different healthcare systems but requires recognition of time required, particularly for reviewing records. There is evidence of a possible positive effect, practices were willing to be recruited, response rates were acceptable, and almost all participants remained for the duration of the trial. However, further consideration is required regarding the clinical significance of changes in SC scores and choice of an appropriate primary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec30"><p>
