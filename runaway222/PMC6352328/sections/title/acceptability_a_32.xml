 <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most interviewees welcomed the intervention; one noted 
  <span class="italic">“I definitely think it’s worth it”</span> (NM2), although a commonly perceived barrier was lack of time; 
  <span class="italic">“It was time intensive- with current workloads and demands on time it couldn’t be given a priority”</span> (NM5)
  <span class="italic">,</span> and that 
  <span class="italic">“many practices do not have the resources</span>” (M3).
 </p>
 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The general consensus was that the intervention was worth investigating in a larger trial and that evidence of its effectiveness would promote its use in routine practice. Comments revealed perceptions that the SC questionnaire 
  <span class="italic">“asked same basic questions in different ways”</span> (NM4) but this was welcomed as it allowed opportunity to consider different situations within their responses. Also, comments indicated some uncertainty in identifying PSIs: group discussion was valued in developing an agreed definition. Interviewees offered recommendations, such as, 
  <span class="italic">“… the [TRM] tool needs a few tweaks- it’s a good way of assessing how things go but thought should be given to giving it more rigour”</span> (NM6) and, regarding the time required, 
  <span class="italic">“obviously that has to be reimbursed”</span> (NM3).
