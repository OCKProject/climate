  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Process outcomes of interest were: willingness of practices to participate; response rates to questionnaires; retention of control and intervention practices; and the intervention group’s views on the feasibility, usefulness, and sustainability of the intervention. Semi-structured interviews were conducted (see ‘Interview Schedule for SAP-C’ in Additional files 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>) with between one and three members of each intervention practice team regarding their perceptions of the intervention and an end-of-study questionnaire was circulated to all members of the intervention practices. Purposive sampling was used to select interview candidates, in order to obtain perspectives from a range of healthcare professionals and practices. We aimed to interview at least one GP in each practice and, where feasible, others with nursing or administrative responsibilities.

  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviews were conducted by a human factors psychologist (POC) and General Practitioner (MC). The interviews were either carried out by phone or face-to-face, digitally recorded and then transcribed.</p>
