 <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This novel study investigated the feasibility of determining the impact of an intervention, derived from the SPSP-PC [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>], on the SC of primary care practices in two different health care systems, one with a mixed public/private economy and the other funded publically. Within both these systems our findings regarding rates of recruitment, retention and completion, and evidence of potential positive impact suggest that a definitive trial is feasible. Only two practices declined to participate; one practice withdrew from the study, after the doctor leading participation left the practice, demonstrating the importance of a local ‘champion’ to drive the intervention. The overall response rates to the SC (over 70%) and end-of-study questionnaires (59%) were encouraging: obtaining good response rates from GPs is challenging [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our intervention group’s perceptions that the TRM was useful in improving patient safety concurred with previous reports [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. The number of PSIs, their severity, and the proportions considered preventable and originating in primary care were within the range of previous studies reporting TRM use in primary care; a recent systematic review reported an overall mean of 12.6 safety incidents (range: 2.3 to 26.5) per 100 records [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. However, caution should be taken in comparing numbers of PSIs between studies as differences may be attributable to different methodologies. The chart review in our study was used to identify areas for improvement: its reliability in assessing PSIs as a measure of patient safety cannot be determined as it was conducted by only one GP, with limited training, in each practice.
 </p>
 <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The intervention was generally well received but time was the main barrier to its use. Therefore, as previously suggested [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>], there would be a need to incentivise participation and compensate practices for the time required to participate in a definitive trial of the intervention. Such incentives could be financial, or alternatives may be identified by prospective trial participants. Particularly if the intervention is to be translated into routine practice, the issue of time allocation for its use must be considered.
 </p>
 <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the control practices, changes in subscale and overall SC scores were either in the undesired direction or minimal but in intervention practices, all the changes in SC scores were in the desired direction, although the size of change varied across subscales. The mean scores we observed on the five SC subscales are broadly comparable to other studies which have used the GP-SafeQuest survey [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. Concurring with previous reports, managerial groups tended to have a more positive view of SC than had the non-managerial groups [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Of note, amongst the intervention managerial group, the workload subscale had the lowest mean score [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. High workload is of particular concern given that it has been found to have a negative effect on patient care [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>] and doctor well-being [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], as well as being considered to be a major contributor to the recruitment and retention crisis facing UK general practice [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. There is a need for improved understanding of the contributors to workload in primary care and of its implications for patient safety.
 </p>
 <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although it is widely agreed that a good SC is associated with safety, and that there is a relationship between safety culture and PSIs, the nature of the causal relationship between these variables is not well understood [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Therefore, whilst we have identified a potential positive effect on SC from our intervention, which may be used to inform a sample size calculation for a definitive trial, other appropriate primary outcome measures of patient safety should also be considered. One such measure may be the change in the number of PSIs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>] identified in an independent and blinded review of high-risk patient charts using the TRM. However, this outcome was not explicitly assessed in the current study and has limitations, particularly in terms of the required resources and recent European data protection regulations. These regulations require consent from patients for review of their records, or the records must be anonymised prior to review [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. Another interventional technique developed by the SPSP-PC, the safety checklist for general practice [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>], which offers a practical approach to the identification of potential hazards in the practice [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>], may also be considered for use in further work. However, of note, a recent systematic review has identified that as yet there is no evident “best” method of measuring patient safety in primary care [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>].

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations and strengths</div>
  <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consistent with recommendations that analysis of feasibility studies should be mainly descriptive, we did not conduct inferential statistics or hypothesis testing [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. Our sample size was pragmatic, aiming to include practices of diverse size and location, and from two different healthcare systems. There was a potential for selection bias to occur, as practices in which there is a greater focus on patient safety, and consequently an increased motivation to implement interventions to improve patient safety, may be more likely to choose to partake in the proposed study and this may impact upon intervention outcomes. Whilst there was a reliance on self-report (i.e., of SC and PSIs) rather than objective data, a strength of our study was that we preserved anonymity of all data, both within and between participating practices in order to minimise reporting bias.
