 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One interviewee reported how the intervention had indicated that 
  <span class="italic">‘changes should be made…….but that takes effort and time’</span> (NM4)
  <span class="italic">.</span> However, this perception of inaction was a deviant view: other interviewees, including others from the same practice, reported changes in practices’ processes and management. For example, 
  <span class="italic">“note taking got a bit better after house calls”</span> (NM1), changes were made to protocols; “
  <span class="italic">we were all actually using different protocols kind of to change the Warfarin dosage…we standardised that and we have it in now in our system”</span> (NM3), 
  <span class="italic">“the prophylactic antibiotics given for UTI… are now changed to nitrofurantoin – because guidelines had changed”</span> (NM6). The intervention encouraged clinical meetings in one practice and in another, there was a plan to 
  <span class="italic">“try to make discussions at those more inclusive”</span> (NM5)
  <span class="italic">.</span>
