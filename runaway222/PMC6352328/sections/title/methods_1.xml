 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A randomised controlled feasibility study was conducted with general practices in the Republic of Ireland (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 9) and Northern Ireland (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 2), randomly assigned to the intervention (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 5) or control (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 6) group. The nine-month intervention consisted of: 1) repeated safety climate (SC) measurement (using GP-SafeQuest questionnaire) and feedback (comparative anonymised practice-level SC data), and 2) patient record reviews using a specialised trigger tool to identify instances of undetected patient harm. For control practices, SC was measured at baseline and study end only. The intervention’s perceived usefulness and feasibility were explored via an end-of-study questionnaire and semi-structured interviews.
