 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SC questionnaire staff response rate was 84.8% (39/46) for intervention practices and 77.8% (42/54) for controls at baseline and 78.3% (36/46) for intervention practices and 68.5% (37/54) for controls at the study terminus. Overall, the questionnaire was completed by 81% (range 42.9–100%) and 73% (range 57.1–100%) of practice staff at baseline and study terminus respectively.</p>
 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At baseline, 35.8% (29/81) of respondents were in managerial roles (GP principal, practice manager), and 61.7% (50/81) had non-managerial positions (GP assistant/ locum/ trainee/ intern, practice nurse, administrator, pharmacist). At the study terminus, 32.9% (24/73) of respondents were in managerial positions; 63% (46/73) were in non-managerial positions.</p>
 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> shows means, standard deviations, and differences in subscale and total SC scores, before and after the intervention. Across the two time-points, total SC scores increased for the intervention group, suggesting an improved safety climate (negative Cohen’s d), but fell slightly in the control group. Effect sizes for the intervention group were generally small to moderate, with the strongest differences (Cohen’s d &gt; 0.6) observed in the teamwork, safety systems and total SC scores of managerial staff.
