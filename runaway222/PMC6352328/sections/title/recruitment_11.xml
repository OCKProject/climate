 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our sample size was pragmatic, aiming to include practices of diverse size and location, and from two different healthcare systems, in order to test the intervention’s feasibility in a range of settings. A purposeful sample of RoI practices was recruited through the Western Research Network (WestREN) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>], an Irish GP research network. Practices were stratified according to size (large (&gt; 2 GP principals) or small (≤2 GP principals) and location (urban or rural). In the RoI, 13 practices were invited to participate, with 11 practices agreeing: two declined, due to the required time commitment. In NI, two practices of similar size and location (large; urban) were invited through the NI Clinical Research Network Primary Care Group [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]: both agreed to participate.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Invitation letters were sent to the principal GP(s) in the selected practices (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) and, with their consent, other staff were then invited to participate. In the RoI, GPs provide services for private patients who pay for each consultation, and for patients with medical cards, whose healthcare is publicly funded. In NI, GP services are provided free-of-charge through the National Health Service.
