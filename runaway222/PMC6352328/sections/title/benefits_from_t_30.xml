 <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several interviewees considered that the intervention was helpful in raising awareness of safety issues, promoting learning and 
  <span class="italic">“beneficial for your own practice…and for your own patients”</span> (NM1). One commented that the intervention “
  <span class="italic">would cover areas that I suppose we mightn’t, you know, be aware of”</span> (M1)
  <span class="italic">,</span> and noted that it “
  <span class="italic">highlighted things to us that we mightn’t have realised at all were issues”</span>.

 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SC survey was beneficial in providing a ‘voice’ for more junior and non-managerial staff. Interviewees recognised that 
  <span class="italic">“it’s hard to raise concerns on a personal basis…it’s good to do this sort of thing anonymously”</span> (NM6) and commented on the tailored practice-level feedback: 
  <span class="italic">“it was good to see how you compared to other practices as well to use it as a benchmark”</span> (NM3). Group discussions identified different approaches within practices, of primary care team members, to decision-making and patient management, that were previously unrecognised. Revelations of “w
  <span class="italic">here unnecessary work was being done and where gaps were being left”</span> (NM4) were beneficial to organisational planning.
