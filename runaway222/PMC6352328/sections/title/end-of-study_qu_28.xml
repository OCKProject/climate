 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, we evaluated end-of-study questionnaires for 59% (27/46) of the intervention practice staff; the true response rate was probably higher as, due to an administrative error, some participants did not receive a questionnaire. Most respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that feedback on the SC survey and trigger tool chart audit was useful for improving patient safety (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). Almost all (92.6%) agreed/strongly agreed that completing the survey helped them reflect on how patient safety was managed in practice.

 <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approximately half of respondents (55.5%) agreed/strongly agreed that changes were made based upon information obtained from the intervention. Two thirds of respondents (66.6%) agreed/strongly agreed that it had a positive effect on patient safety, while 74% agreed/strongly agreed that it was worth evaluating as a randomised controlled trial.</p>
 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Open-ended responses confirmed individuals’ Likert scale responses. A total of 19 of the respondents (70.4%) provided open ended responses. Written comments that the intervention allowed ‘
  <span class="italic">reflection on current practice</span>’ and ‘
  <span class="italic">prompted consideration of factors which put patients at higher risk</span>’, suggested that respondents had considered the questions in relation to their personal work situation. Concerns included whether ‘
  <span class="italic">it may engender negative feelings in practice whereby staff are not receptive to honesty</span>’, and that ‘
  <span class="italic">the volume of records [reviewed] were insufficient to make viable recommendations</span>’. In order to improve the intervention, participants suggested that practices should ‘
  <span class="italic">assign more time to partake in the study</span>’.
