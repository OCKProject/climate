 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Like all studies, this research had some limitations. First, common method variance (CMV) remains a concern (
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">Fuller et al., 2016</a>). While the study adopted a two-wave ESM, all the data were collected from a self-report questionnaire, increasing the risk of a CMV problem. Future studies should assess voice from the perspective of supervisors or colleagues, to rule out CMV and to test the robustness of these results.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, we cannot infer causal relationships between our focal variables. We attempted to establish a firm causal effect between supervisor developmental feedback on employee voice using multi-wave diary analysis. However, a reverse causal effect remains a possibility. A different experimental design may support the development of firm causal results.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">Lawler and Thye (1999)</a> proposed that an individual’s emotional state is the starting point of a relationship. 
  <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">Sears and Hackett (2011)</a> provided empirical evidence for the positive relationship between positive affect and LMX. To consider the implicit influence of positive affect on perceived rapport, we collected data at different time points in a day. However, the current study did not provide significant support for this relationship (γ = 0.133, n.s.). This outcome aligns with findings by 
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">Hsiung (2012)</a> and 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">Colquitt et al. (2013)</a>, which also found that the relationship and affect paths are independent. Thus, future studies should examine potential boundary conditions to assess the relationship between these two paths.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fourth, this research adopted a two-wave ESM design to collect data at 10:00 A.M. and 17:00 P.M. to explore the relationship between supervisor development feedback and employee voice and its underlying mechanism based on previous research. However, the daily self-report experiences (e.g., positive affect and perceived rapport with supervisors) fluctuate within a workday. Our research did not capture the influence of the variations in our focal variables. Future research could combine an ecological momentary assessment and an ESM to offer a more comprehensive insight into the dynamic social exchange process.</p>
