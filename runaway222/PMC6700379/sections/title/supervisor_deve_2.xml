 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The definition of supervisor developmental feedback provided by 
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">Zhou (2003)</a> suggests that it includes three specific characteristics. First, feedback is informational in nature. Supervisor developmental feedback is useful and provides valuable information for employees, facilitating improvements on the job. Second, supervisor developmental feedback is future-oriented, focusing on the employees’ growth in the organization, rather than on the discrepancies between anticipated goals and achieved outcomes. Third, developmental feedback is well suited to creating a positive team climate, free from fear of making mistakes (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Employee voice is risky and costly, because it challenges the 
  <span class="italic">status quo</span> and places stress on existing workplace relationship (
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">Ng and Feldman, 2012</a>). Previous research has indicated that whether employees render voice or not depends on supervisors’ supportive behavior (
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Supervisor developmental feedback reveals supervisors’ genuine care and attention, which nurtures employees’ sense of gratitude and indebtedness. This ensures a reciprocal interpersonal relationship and further motivating them to voice to provide change-oriented suggestions to the organizations as a way of reciprocating for the positive treatment they have received from their supervisors (
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Carnevale et al., 2017</a>). Furthermore, the agreeable team climate created by supervisor developmental feedback strengthens employee psychological safety, which has been examined as a critical motivator of employee voice. Research has provided firm empirical evidence for the relationship between supervisor support and employee voice within social exchange framework (
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">Liang et al., 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">Liu et al., 2017</a>). For example, 
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Carnevale et al. (2017)</a> argue that a supervisor facilitates employees’ proactive attempts to express their voice by offering valuable resources. Thus, we hypothesized the following:
