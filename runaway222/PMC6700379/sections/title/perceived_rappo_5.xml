 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trust toward supervisors and perceptions of justice are two core factors associated with perceived rapport (
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Curhan et al., 2010</a>). Previous research has shown a positive relationship between perceived rapport and sequential active behavior (
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Curhan et al., 2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Voice means challenging the 
  <span class="italic">status quo</span>, placing stress on existing team relationships (
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">Morrison, 2014</a>). Trust in supervisors is a psychological state and includes positive expectations about the supervisor’s intentions or behaviors when they engage in taking risks (
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">Gao et al., 2011</a>). Trust in supervisors signals a strong sense of sharing within the relationship, where employees tend to exhibit new ideas and concerns without fear of being ridiculed (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Chen et al., 2014</a>). 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">Gao et al. (2011)</a> argued that when employees have a high level of trust in their supervisors, employees will engage in voice, even when it means taking extra risks.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perceived rapport also involves perceptions of justice toward interaction with supervisors. When employees perceive that supervisors treat them with dignity and respect in daily encounters, they are more likely to engage in voice (
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">Takeuchi et al., 2012</a>). A high level of perceived rapport communicates that supervisors consider employee needs and that supervisors are willing to develop and maintain an ongoing relationship with them (
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">Tyler and Lind, 1992</a>). In such a context, employees are likely to be broadly and deeply invested in this relationship, and work beyond their formal job descriptions in return. For example, this may involve initiating changes in organizations (
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">George and Brief, 1992</a>; 
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">Zhang et al., 2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, we hypothesized the following:</p>
 <div list-type="simple" id="S2.I3" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Hypothesis 3. Day-level perceived rapport relates to day-level employee voice.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supervisor developmental feedback provides valuable information to employees, fostering their development in organizations and job-related improvements. This feedback helps create a positive team climate, free from pressure and fear of making mistakes (
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">Zhou, 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Li et al., 2011</a>). Thus, in daily encounters, supervisor developmental feedback nurtures employee perceptions of justice and trust in supervisors, enhancing perceived rapport. In turn, when employees develop perceived rapport based on a supervisor’s demonstration of developmental feedback, the relationship becomes more of a social exchange. Once they regard their relationships with their supervisors as beyond the traditional economic exchange relationship, they are more likely to reciprocate the supervisor developmental feedback. This is done by expressing constructive suggestions and concerns, oriented toward facilitating organizational effectiveness. 
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">Zhang et al. (2015)</a> found that supervisor expression of genuine and holistic concerns toward employees develop high-quality relationships that encourage discretionary expressions of employee voice. Following the logic of SET, we developed the following hypothesis:
 </p>
 <div list-type="simple" id="S2.I4" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Hypothesis 4. Day-level perceived rapport mediates the relationship between day-level supervisor developmental feedback (morning) and day-level employee voice.</p>
