 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Employee voice is the discretionary communication of ideas, suggestions, or concerns intended to benefit the organization (
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">Morrison, 2011</a>). It is believed to play a critical role in enhancing organizational effectiveness and promoting employee development (
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">Mowbray et al., 2015</a>). Considering the importance of voice for both organizations and employees, most voice research has focused on exploring the antecedents of employee voice. 
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">Morrison (2014)</a> suggested that a latent voice opportunity is the starting point for employee voice. Whether or not an employee renders his or her voice depends on the inherent desire or motivation to bring about a constructive change for the organization.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within a social exchange theory (SET) framework, past research has examined the positive relationship between leadership and employee internal voice motivation (
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">Detert and Burris, 2007</a>). The expectation that employees will exercise their voices depends on supervisors showing support (
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">Lin et al., 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">Ye et al., 2019</a>). When supervisors convey concerns for employee improvement, employees develop the belief that their organization has a positive orientation toward their growth in organizations. This, in turn, increases the probability that employees will participate in social exchanges and share their beneficial ideas to facilitate organization effectiveness (
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">Tucker et al., 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">Mo and Shi, 2018</a>). This is because a supervisor is an organization’s representative (
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">Eisenberger et al., 2002</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous research examined voice trajectories over longer time periods (
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Li and Sun, 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). However, short-term tends have not been addressed (
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">Morrison, 2011</a>). 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">Liu et al. (2017)</a> and 
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">Starzyk et al. (2018)</a> provided evidence for the possible fluctuations at the episode level. This highlights the importance of exploring the antecedents of voice by adopting a within-person approach and provides a more dynamic picture of employee voice (
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">Morrison, 2011</a>). Within a daily organization context, supervisors play critical roles as information providers to their employees (
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Abu Bakar et al., 2010</a>). Feedback is a basic strategy of a leader interacting with employees (
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">Mayfield and Mayfield, 2007</a>). 
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">Zhou (2003)</a> proposed the concept of supervisor developmental feedback, which refers to the extent to which supervisors provide helpful or valuable information to their employees. This feedback supports on-the-job learning, development, and improvements. Previous research examined the influence of supervisor-provided feedback on enhancing employee creativity and in-role performance (
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">Zhou, 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Li et al., 2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study examined supervisor developmental feedback as a critical antecedent to employee voice, because it provides a resolution for employee concerns that they must “read the wind” to discern whether it is appropriate to express voice with their leaders in a specific situation (
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">Milliken et al., 2003</a>). Supervisor developmental feedback offers employees a clear guide for how to behave in organizations. This feedback helps create a positive atmosphere free from pressure, facilitating employee willingness to express voice (
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Li et al., 2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study draws on SET (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005</a>). SET contends that leader behavior is a social influence process, through which emergent reciprocal cooperation and consequential beneficial changes are socially developed (
  <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">Uhl-Bien, 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Chun et al., 2016</a>). SET is relational in nature (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005</a>). Workplace relationships is the aspect of SET that has garnered the most research attention (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005</a>). Usually, relationship is considered the main reason why employees render positive work behavior, returning supportive gestures from supervisors 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">Lawler and Thye (1999)</a>, 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">Lawler (2001)</a> introduced affect into SET. He argued that employees’ daily feelings are intertwined with social exchange. Emotions are subtle signals to employees about their responses based on their interactions with supervisors. Furthermore, 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">Colquitt et al. (2013)</a> regarded relationship and affect as two distinct paths in social exchange based on a meta-analysis. Based on this logic, we adopted two key dimensions to elaborate how daily supervisor developmental feedback influences employee voice. The first was perceived rapport, which is the employees’ subjective perceptions of outcomes of interaction with their supervisors, including the viewpoint that one has been justly heard and treated. This perspective relates to the positive impressions and trust that employees have toward their supervisors (
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Curhan et al., 2010</a>). The second perspective is positive affect, which is the extent to which a person feels alert, active, and enthusiastic (
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">Watson et al., 1988</a>). We assume that the supervisor provides developmental feedback to the employee. This enhances employees’ perceived rapport and positive affect, strengthening their reciprocal motivation and ability to engage in voice.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted a multi-wave diary study to test our theoretical model of whether and how supervisor developmental feedback benefits employee voice (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). This research contributes to the voice and SET literature in two ways. First, by focusing on the positive influences of daily supervisor developmental feedback, we extend previous research on the relationship between supervisor behavior and employee voice. Previous research has provided fruitful results related to this relationship. However, it remains unclear how a supervisor interacting with employees affects voice. Feedback is a basic interaction strategy for supervisors, conveying important information relevant to employee development and career growth in organizations (
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">Moss and Martinko, 1998</a>). This research explores the episodic influence of supervisor developmental feedback on employee voice, extending our understanding of the antecedents of employee voice.

 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, by uncovering the dynamic mediating role of perceived rapport and positive affect, we contribute to the development of SET. Previous social exchange research has been conducted mainly at the between-person level (
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">Aryee et al., 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">Yan et al., 2016</a>). However, social exchange is a dynamic process, and employee perceptions about their supervisors are not stable (
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">Ellis et al., 2018</a>). Gaining insights into the possible episodic fluctuations in a beneficial social exchange process has important implications for the long-term maintenance of the positive influences of supervisor behavior and the extension of sustainable employee proactive work behavior over time (
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">Neff and Karney, 2009</a>). Our research highlights the underlying mechanism through which supervisor developmental feedback affects employee voice, by unveiling the mediating role of perceived rapport and positive affect at the episode level. Using this approach, this research offers a dynamic social exchange process in organizations.
