 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our research contributes to the voice and SET literature in two ways. First, this study revealed the positive influences of supervisor developmental feedback on employee voice at the episode level, extending our understanding of the antecedents of voice. Given the importance of voice for both organizations and individuals, previous research focused on the relationship between supervisor behavior and voice (
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">Mowbray et al., 2015</a>). However, those studies have not considered the influences of supervisors’ daily interaction with employees. In a daily organization context, supervisors’ managerial strategies are implemented and transferred through interaction with their employees (
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">Schaubroeck et al., 2016</a>). It is important to gain insights into this dynamic process to enhance managerial effectiveness.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study adopted supervisor developmental feedback, one of the basic supervisor interaction strategies, as an influencer of employee voice. Day-level supervisor developmental feedback enhances employees’ potential opportunities to develop and grow, by providing them with general rules about how to behave in organizations (
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">Zhou, 2003</a>). In addition, supervisor developmental feedback can help create a positive team climate, free from pressure and fear of making mistakes. This can minimize the psychological costs of voice (
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Li et al., 2011</a>). Thus, driven by the reciprocal norm (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005</a>), employees are more likely to engage in voice to improve organizational effectiveness, returning the benefits offered by supervisors. Our research provides a new perspective on how voice is integrated in the daily interaction of supervisor–employee interaction, enlarging the scope of the voice literature.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, this study explored both the affect and relationship paths through which day-level supervisor developmental feedback influences day-level employee voice, contributing to SET. Within the SET framework, previous research provided evidence of the mediating role of relationship and affect at the between-person level (
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">Hsiung, 2012</a>). However, few studies have explored these two mechanisms at the within-person level. Perceived rapport with supervisors or affect fluctuates on a daily basis. We advanced 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">Colquitt et al. (2013)</a> dual path social exchange model, by introducing the notion of daily within-person variations in employee positive affect and perceived rapport with supervisors. This study investigated whether the relationship and affect mechanisms that explain the employee voice associated with resource exchanges at the episode level are similar to those at the between-personal level. This adds to our knowledge of the dynamic social exchange process.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study found that supervisor developmental feedback provides employees valuable information and a positive climate, facilitating their growth in organizations (
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">Zhou, 2003</a>). Day-level supervisor developmental feedback enhances employees’ positive affect and perceived rapport with supervisors. Consequently, positive affect and perceived rapport advance employee motivation and strengthen the ability to express voice. This study found no significant difference between affect and relationship path. Positive affect and perceived rapport have the same influences in facilitating the transformation from supervisor developmental feedback to employee voice. Our research advances SET by examining SET at the episode level.
