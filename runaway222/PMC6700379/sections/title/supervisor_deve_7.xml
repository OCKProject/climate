 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Positive affect is a relatively short-lived positive evaluative state, with neurological and cognitive elements (
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">Lawler and Thye, 1999</a>). Positive affect is immediate, internal, and involuntary. It is produced by the results of a social exchange process (
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">Weiner, 1985</a>). Beneficially initiating social exchange actions can engender positive affect (
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">Cropanzano et al., 2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When receiving developmental feedback, employees are likely to be immersed in their current jobs, pay attention to skill mastery (
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">Zhou, 2003</a>), and capture potential opportunities to achieve career growth in organizations. Increasing expectations of career success in organizations enhances employees’ positive affect in the workplace (
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Kidd, 2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, supervisor developmental feedback is meant to enhance employees’ learning and development in the future (
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Li et al., 2011</a>). This also signals employees that their supervisors support and care about the benefits they provide the organization. From a social exchange perspective, supervisors’ expressions of sincere concerns about followers’ personal welfare will induce employees’ positive affect in the relationship (

  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Fredrickson (2003)</a> suggested that positive affect occurs in safe and comfortable circumstances. 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">Heled et al. (2016)</a> discovered a positive relationship between beneficial team climate and employees’ positive emotional state. Integrating arguments above, we hypothesized the following:

   <p>Hypothesis 5. Day-level supervisor developmental feedback (morning) positively relates to day-level positive affect (morning).</p>
