 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected data at the between-person level (gender, education, and tenure) and at the within-person level (supervisor developmental feedback, positive affect, perceived rapport, and employee voice) from our samples. Considering the nested nature of our data, we adopted multilevel data modeling (
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002</a>) for the analysis. We applied Mplus 7.4 (
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">Muthén and Muthén, 1998/2012</a>) software, using a restricted maximum likelihood estimation method for the analysis. Based on previous research, the multilevel path analysis was effective to test our conceptual model (
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Koopman et al., 2016</a>), because it permitted a simultaneous examination of the underlying affect (i.e., positive affect) and relationship (i.e., perceived rapport) paths through which daily supervisor developmental feedback impacted employee voice.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first stage of hypothesis testing was to investigate the systematic within- and between-person variance for the daily variables. The proportion of within-person variance for voice was 23%; for supervisor developmental feedback, it was 26%; for positive affect, it was 34%; and for perceived rapport, it was 29%. These results justified the use of multilevel analysis. We ran the multilevel path analysis with multiple mediators with random slope and used robust estimators indicated the within-person effect. Before the regression analysis, all the daily variables were group centered.</p>
