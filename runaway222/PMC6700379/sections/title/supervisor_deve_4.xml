 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perceived rapport is the immediate subjective outcome of interaction with the supervisor (
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">Curhan et al., 2006</a>). Rapport is composed of two factors: feelings about the process and feelings about the relationship. Feelings about the process include perceptions that the employees have been justly treated and heard, and that the interaction process with supervisors is efficient. Feelings about the relationship include the positive impressions of and trust toward the supervisors. This creates a solid foundation for working and interacting with the supervisors in the future (
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Curhan et al., 2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social exchange theory is relational in nature (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005</a>). Previous research has adopted leader–member exchange (LMX) to indicate the relationship between supervisor and employee in the social exchange process (
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">Reb et al., 2018</a>). LMX is a two-way interaction, in which a supervisor and an employee deliberately exchange tangible or intangible resources relevant to work tasks and social intentions (
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">Sheer, 2015</a>). Given the daily supervisor–subordinate interaction context, subordinates form perceptions of relationship quality with supervisors based on the subjective experiences. This is the dynamic foundation for LMX (
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">Selvarajan et al., 2018</a>). This study’s goal was to examine the underlying mechanism through which supervisor developmental feedback influences employee voice at the episode level. As such, the study adopted perceived rapport, instead of LMX, as the proxy mediator between supervisor developmental feedback and employee voice.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the arguments above, we proposed that supervisor developmental feedback influences perceived rapport by enhancing feelings about the process and feelings about the relationship. Feelings about the process involve employees’ perceptions of procedural and interpersonal justice with respect to communication with supervisors (
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">Curhan et al., 2006</a>). SET suggests that employees tend to recognize the quality of treatment received through exchanges with supervisors as an indicator of perceived justice (
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">Lee and Jensen, 2014</a>). The provision of feedback to employees is an important process, as it allows supervisors to influence employees’ perceptions of justice (
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">Karkoulian et al., 2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supervisor developmental feedback is future-oriented, focusing on employee improvement on the job (
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">Zhou, 2003</a>). Developmental feedback reveals a supervisor’s care for an employee’s career growth. It involves devoting valuable resources to reward appropriate behavior (
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">Zhou, 2003</a>). As such, employees will feel respect and that they are treated with sensitivity when receiving supervisor developmental feedback. This strengthens their perceptions of justice toward the communication process.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feelings about the relationship include positive impressions of and trust toward supervisors. Employees develop trust toward their supervisors when they attribute the supervisors’ behavior to sincere motives and selflessness (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Chen et al., 2014</a>). Further, they develop positive impressions toward their supervisors, based on the supervisors’ demonstration of character. Developmental feedback reveals supervisors’ expressions of sincere and holistic concern about their employees’ personal welfare. Thus, supervisor developmental feedback is likely to trigger employees’ gratitude and indebtedness, ensuring reciprocal supervisor–employee relations and firm affective bonds of trust. Thus, we hypothesized the following:

   <p>Hypothesis 2. Day-level supervisor developmental feedback (morning) positively relates to day-level perceived rapport.</p>
