 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We adapted four items from the rapport dimension of the Subjective Value Inventory (SVI), developed by 
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">Curhan et al. (2006)</a>. The four items were “Did your supervisor consider your wishes, opinions, or needs today?”; “Do you feel your supervisor listened to your concerns today?”; “How satisfied are you with your relationship with your supervisor as a result of the communication today?”; and “Does the communication today make you trust your supervisor?” Items were rated on a five-point scale, ranging from “1 = not at all” to “5 = a great deal.” The Cronbach’s α of this scale was 0.927.
