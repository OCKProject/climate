 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A self-reported five-point Likert scale was used in the study: 1 indicated “strongly disagree” and 5 indicated “totally agree,” if there was not a special explanation. All items were translated into Chinese using a back translation procedure (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the three-item scale developed by 
   <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">Zhou (2003)</a> to measure supervisor developmental feedback. A sample item was “Today my supervisor focused on helping me to learn and improve while giving me feedback.” The Cronbach’s α for this scale was 0.941.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Voice</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The four-item voice scale, developed by 
   <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">Van Dyne and LePine (1998)</a> based on the research of 
   <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">Lebel (2016)</a>, was used to measure employee voice. A sample item was: “Today I spoke up with concerns about work not being done effectively.” The scale yielded a Cronbach’s α of 0.871. The study adopted self-reported questionnaires, rather than supervisor-reported questionnaires, to measure voice. This is because in ESM, it is difficult for supervisors to differentiate employee voice on a daily basis (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 20-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) scale was adopted to measure daily positive affect. The current adopted five items with highest loadings in the positive affect scale (e.g., Enthusiastic, Interested, Determined, Excited, and Inspired). The Cronbach’s α for this scale was 0.909.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perceived Rapport</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We adapted four items from the rapport dimension of the Subjective Value Inventory (SVI), developed by 
   <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">Curhan et al. (2006)</a>. The four items were “Did your supervisor consider your wishes, opinions, or needs today?”; “Do you feel your supervisor listened to your concerns today?”; “How satisfied are you with your relationship with your supervisor as a result of the communication today?”; and “Does the communication today make you trust your supervisor?” Items were rated on a five-point scale, ranging from “1 = not at all” to “5 = a great deal.” The Cronbach’s α of this scale was 0.927.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Control Variables</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We incorporated gender (coded as 0 for male and 1 for female), education (coded as 1 for college and below, 2 for bachelor, and 3 for master and above), and tenure in the current organization (years), based on their potential influence on our results (
   <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">Hsiung, 2012</a>;

   <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">Qian et al., 2018</a>). Following the suggestion of 
   <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Aguinis and Vandenberg (2014)</a>, we conducted separate analyses with and without the control variables. The results were virtually the same, and removing the control variables from the equation models did not alter the interpretation of the findings. Thus, we reported the results without control variables in this study.
