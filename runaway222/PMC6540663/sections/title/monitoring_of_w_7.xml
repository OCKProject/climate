 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and total alkalinity (A
  <sub>T</sub>) were monitored daily. Irradiance was measured once a month to monitor the decrease in light intensity using a HOBO UA‐002‐64 Pendant Temp/Light data logger (accuracy: 0.47°C, resolution: 0.1°C. Tempcon, Arundel, UK). Temperature and salinity were measured with a CO310‐1 portable salinity and temperature probe (accuracy: 0.2% for salinity, ±0.2°C for temperature; resolution: 0.1 for salinity, 0.1°C for temperature. VWR, Leicestershire, UK). Dissolved oxygen and pH were measured with an HQ30d portable multi‐parameter meter and a luminescent dissolved oxygen (LDO101, accuracy: ±0.1 mg/L. HACH, Manchester, UK) and pH probe (PHC301, accuracy: ±0.02 pH, HACH, Manchester, UK. Calibrated on the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) scale and converted into total scale values using Tris/HCl and 2‐aminopyridine/HCl buffer solutions after Dickson, Sabine, and Christian (

  <sub>T</sub> was monitored daily in one randomly chosen replicate for each treatment, using the alkalinity anomaly technique after Smith and Key (

  <sub>T</sub> titrations were carried out with an automatic titrator TitroLine 7000 (measurement accuracy: 0.002 ± 1 digit, dosing accuracy: 0.15%, dosing precision: 0.05%–0.07%. Schott SI Analytics, Mainz, Germany) to ensure minimal variation. As titrant, 0.1N hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used, which was validated against Certified Reference Material provided by Andrew G. Dickson (Batch 154, Scripps Institution of Oceanography).
