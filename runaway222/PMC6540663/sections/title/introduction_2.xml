 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anthropogenic input of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulted in a changing climate over the past decades and might further fuel global climate change in future centuries (IPCC, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0041">2013</a>). Key components of climate change in the ocean are ocean acidification (OA; decreasing pH and Ω

  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0005">2010</a>; Lesica &amp; McCune, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0049">2004</a>; Sanford, Holzman, Haney, Rand, &amp; Bertness, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0066">2006</a>). Investigating and monitoring organism physiology provides important information to predict their acclimatization and resilience to future environmental conditions and potential changes in their distribution (Kelly &amp; Hofmann, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0047">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is suggested that the geographic center of a species distribution holds the most favorable conditions and therefore holds the highest population density (Brussard, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0011">1984</a>; Whittaker, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0074">1956</a>). When moving away from the center toward the margins of the distribution, environmental variables are thought to become less favorable due to greater abiotic stress and increased interspecific competition (Aitken, Yeaman, Holliday, Wang, &amp; Curtis‐McLane, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0002">2008</a>), initiating a decrease in population densities and lower relative fertility (Case &amp; Taper, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0013">2000</a>). Further, Watkinson and Sutherland (
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0072">1995</a>) described a higher mortality than recruitment rate for local marginal populations, also called sink populations, whose survival depends on influx of zygotes or spores from source populations. Species react differently to environmental changes. In terrestrial studies, Franco et al. (
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0031">2006</a>) showed that three out of four butterfly species are reported extinct or showed drastic distributional changes due to climate change along with habitat degradation and loss. Another study by Lesica and McCune (
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0049">2004</a>) showed that the southern margin of arctic–alpine indicator plants species declined in their abundance within 13 years which is caused by increasing average summer temperatures. Previous research has also found that different populations of the same species respond differently to altered environmental conditions (Bozinovic, Calosi, &amp; Spicer, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0007">2011</a>; Calosi et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0012">2017</a>; Gaston, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0033">2009</a>). In the marine environment, a number of studies across several taxonomic groups, for example, fish, molluscs, zooplankton, or seaweed, have focused on the diversification of populations along a thermal‐latitudinal gradient (Bennett, Wernberg, Arackal Joy, Bettignies, &amp; Campbell, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0004">2015</a>; Dam,

  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0058">2009</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Calcifying organisms are at the forefront of those affected by climatic changes and can therefore act as indicator species for induced impacts on marine organisms. One of the major groups effected by climate change is calcifying benthic macroalgae (Kroeker et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0048">2013</a>). Amongst those are coralline red algae (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) which are critical components of marine shallow water ecosystems from polar regions to the tropics (Adey &amp; MacIntyre, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0001">1973</a>; Steneck, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0069">1986</a>). They function as important ecosystem engineers and play a crucial role as an essential structural element in the majority of rocky coastal zones (Benedetti‐Cecchi, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0003">2006</a>; Dayton, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0021">1972</a>; van der Heijden &amp; Kamenos, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0071">2015</a>; Johansen, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0042">1981</a>; Jones, Lawton, &amp; Shachak, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0044">1994</a>; Kelaher, Chapman, &amp; Underwood, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0045">2001</a>; Nelson, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0060">2009</a>; Noël, Hawkins, Jenkins, &amp; Thompson, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0062">2009</a>). They often form complex, extremely dense, and highly branched turfs which are considered the extreme end of algal structural complexity (Coull &amp; Wells, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0016">1983</a>; Davenport, Butler, &amp; Cheshire, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0019">1999</a>). Branches consist of calcified segments (intergenicula), which are produced through high‐magnesium (Mg) calcite precipitation in the cell walls, and noncalcified segments (genicula); this structure provides flexibility and elasticity for every individual branch (Martone &amp; Denny, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0055">2008</a>). Coralline turf is highly variable, with frond length and density differing at small spatial scales; they can host abundant and diverse macrofaunal assemblages with up to 250,000 individuals per m

  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0045">2001</a>). In addition, macroalgal physiological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration alter CO

  </div> in the water in the intertidal environment. This causes changes in pH across diurnal as well as spatial scales related to species distributions (Morris &amp; Taylor, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0059">1983</a>; Williamson et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0075">2014</a>; Williamson, Perkins, Voller, Yallop, &amp; Brodie, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0076">2017</a>). Depending on the extent of these changes in the carbonate chemistry and especially in combination with the climatic changes named above, calcification of coralline algae can be severely affected.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geniculated coralline algae (also known as articulated coralline algae), like 
  <span class="italic">Corallina officinalis</span>, form turfs across large areas on hard substratum in the intertidal ecosystems of the Northeast Atlantic. 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> is commonly found in sheltered, low intertidal zones, where it primarily inhabits the lower part of rock pools and channels that remain damp or filled during extreme tides or conditions, and at the edge of the intertidal to subtidal zones (Digby, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0026">1977</a>; Egilsdottir, Noisette, Noel, Olafsson, &amp; Martin, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0028">2013</a>; Williamson et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0075">2014</a>). In order to maintain their abundance in temperate intertidal ecosystems, coralline algae are suggested to have a good ability to adapt to great and fast changes in environmental conditions, such as solar irradiance, physical stress, water temperature, or carbonate chemistry (e.g., large pH variations) which fluctuate tidally, diurnal, monthly, and seasonally (Egilsdottir et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0028">2013</a>; Hofmann et al.,

  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0075">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In particular, temperature is one of the main factors governing the small‐scale vertical distribution of macroalgae on a shore (Lüning, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0053">1990</a>) and the large‐scale geographical distribution of macroalgal species (Ganning 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0032">1971</a>). At the organism level, temperature regulates major chemical reactions, which in turn affect metabolic pathways (Lobban &amp; Harrison, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0052">1994</a>). For example, carbonic anhydrase (CA) is affected by temperature altering the carbon fixation pathways in photosynthesis (Lobban &amp; Harrison, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0052">1994</a>). Water temperature affects recruitment, survival, growth as well as reproduction of macroalgae (Breeman, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0008">1988</a>) and thus drives the species’ distribution (Breeman, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0008">1988</a>; Lüning, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0053">1990</a>). Most importantly, current increase in global temperature, and therefore a possible exceeding of the species’ temperature threshold, is causing species‐level responses in macroalgae, such as species range shifts (reviewed by Helmuth, Mieszkowska, Moore, &amp; Hawkins, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0036">2006</a>; Nicastro et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0061">2013</a>; Smale &amp; Wernberg, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0067">2013</a>; Parmesan,

  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0073">2011</a>). This ongoing temperature increase, and what is predicted for future scenarios, is causing a chronic, due to gradual warming, or an acute stress, due to extreme temperature events (Brodie et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0010">2014</a>). Adaptations will need to include facilitation of all metabolic processes at elevated temperatures, especially those for photosynthesis, respiration, calcification, and therefore growth. Hofmann Straub and Bischof (

  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0028">2013</a>), and Noisette et al. (2013) found that with ongoing climate change, and therefore worsening OA and rising water temperatures, interactions between coralline algal physiology and variable environmental parameters are likely to be significantly negatively affected.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It remains unclear how and whether the wider distributed, turf‐forming algae 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> will be able to withstand such changes. It is likely that the species as a whole will show some resilience when exposed to predicted climate change conditions. However, it is uncertain which areas or portions of the species distribution will be affected the most by the changes. At present, there are very few studies regarding the physiological responses of intertidal benthic organisms to current climate conditions across its distribution (reviewed by Helmuth et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0036">2006</a>; Díez, Muguerza, Santolaria, Ganzedo, &amp; Gorostiaga, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0025">2012</a>). This gap in knowledge complicates the establishment of detailed predictions for this species future (Brodie et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0010">2014</a>; Nelson, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0060">2009</a>; Williamson et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0076">2017</a>). In this study, physiological responses (photosynthesis, respiration, calcification, photosynthesis–irradiance curves, and calcification–irradiance curves) of 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> across its natural distribution in the eastern North Atlantic were investigated using the approach of common garden experiments. England was chosen as central population for this study, referring to confirmed genetic data by Brodie, Walker, Williamson, and Irvine (
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0009">2013</a>). Spain was studied representing the southern margin of the species distribution (Williamson et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0078">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We hypothesized that central populations are more robust to elevated temperatures and therefore are able to adapt to the temperature conditions already experienced by southern populations. In contrast, we predicted that southern populations will be able to adapt to the most favorable central conditions.</p>
