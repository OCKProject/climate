 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the physiology of 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> and its interactions with the environment is crucial to predict how different portions of the species distribution may be affected by current and future warming rates. We present evidence for distinct vulnerability to thermal stress of central and peripheral populations of 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis,</span> a key marine ecosystem engineer (Daleo, Escapa, Alberti, &amp; Iribarne, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0017">2006</a>; Kelaher, Underwood, &amp; Chapman, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0046">2003</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study also provides genetic evidence that 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> is found farther south than reported by earlier studies of 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> distribution (Williamson et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0078">2015</a>). We present Illa de Arousa (SP1) and Tragove (SP2) as the most southern, genetically confirmed populations of 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> distribution in the Eastern North Atlantic.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oxygen evolution curves (P‐I curves) and calcification evolution curves (C‐I curves) show clear regional responses. This suggests that data obtained in this study could be interpreted as representative data for most populations of these and surrounding regions (Egilsdottir, Olafsson, &amp; Martin, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0029">2015</a>; Williamson et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0076">2017</a>), excluding those in extreme environments. However, there is added complexity when we consider the maximum level of oxygen produced (
  <span class="italic">P</span>
  <sub>max</sub>), indicating its dependency with the initial environment of the population. Central populations may get more stressed under higher temperature conditions, as already published for crustose coralline algae (Diaz‐Pulido, Anthony, Kline, Dove, &amp; Hoegh‐Guldberg, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0022">2012</a>). 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>max</sub> confirms that central conditions are more favorable than southern conditions for all four populations. In P‐I curves, southern populations show a steeper α than central populations, demonstrating a more efficient light harvesting capability. The steeply decreasing α in oxygen evolution curves of southern populations under central conditions can be explained either by increased physiological stress and a lower capacity for photosynthesis or by a geographic effect causing different responses depending on latitudinal origin of populations (Williamson et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0077">2018</a>). For the same populations and conditions however, α of the calcification evolution curves increases slightly which outline an opposite trend compared to α of oxygen evolution curves described above. This coincides with the observed, significant reduction of net production but not calcification rates for southern populations. A minimal increase of α in oxygen evolution curves of central populations under southern conditions correlates with Williamson et al. (
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0077">2018</a>) who also found that central populations do not differ significantly in winter and summer conditions, which are similar to southern conditions in this study. In warmer temperatures, the tested populations also show an increase in their saturating light irradiance (
  <span class="italic">I</span>
  <sub>K</sub>) for C‐I curves; however, even higher 
  <span class="italic">I</span>
  <sub>K</sub> values for calcification evolution have been reported in France and the UK (Egilsdottir et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0029">2015</a>; Williamson et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0076">2017</a>). This indicates that 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> might be able to withstand future central conditions regarding 
  <span class="italic">I</span>
  <sub>K</sub> for its calcification, up to a certain extent. 
  <span class="italic">I</span>
  <sub>K</sub> values for P‐I curves are lower under southern compared to central conditions for all populations in this study. This indicates that all specimens maintained under southern conditions reach their maximum photosynthetic level at lower irradiance and could therefore experience damage of photosynthetic systems sooner compared to same populations living under central conditions. Additionally, maximum photosynthetic levels at low irradiance together with the lower light harvesting efficiency may result in exhaustion of photosynthetic systems due to very fast reactions within the metabolic pathways and the energy consumption for photon harvesting. Southern temperature conditions, therefore, present a less favorable environment for all populations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study highlights a significant change in primary production of southern margin and central populations when subjected to temperature conditions of the opposite distributional region. Central populations show reduced respiration rates under southern conditions. Similar behavior was found by Davison (
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0020">1991</a>) for the brown alga 
  <span class="italic">Saccharina latissima</span>. Central populations show reduced net production under southern conditions indicating stress. However, they are still able to withstand warmer temperatures, in contrast to southern populations which may not be able to survive changing conditions over prolonged periods in their current habitat and may experience a southern range contraction (Lima, Ribeiro, Queiroz, Hawkins, &amp; Santos, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0051">2007</a>). Net production rates of southern populations drop drastically under central conditions, resulting in oxygen uptake instead of production. These rates are similar to rates found under southern conditions, indicating these populations are unable or may take a longer time to adapt to central conditions. It has been shown that photosynthesis can stimulate calcification and that its increase could offset the CaCO
  <sub>3</sub> dissolution in different calcifying algae in response to increased CO
  <sub>2</sub> (Borowitzka, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0006">1989</a>; Gattuso, Allemand, &amp; Frankignoulle, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0034">1999</a>; Hofmann et al. 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0038">2012</a>; Johnson, &amp; Carpenter, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0043">2012</a>; McCoy, Pfister, Olack, &amp; Colman, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0056">2016</a>). Therefore, it can be expected and findings indicate that central populations downregulate calcification before photosynthesis and respiration in warmer temperature conditions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Calcification in the light and in the dark showed drastic negative changes for central populations under southern conditions, confirming the uncoupling of photosynthesis and calcification. Central populations are shutting down light calcification metabolism resulting in dissolution. Central and southern populations have similar light calcification before and after the experiment under central control conditions demonstrating that there was no tank/experiment effect on the populations. Light calcification and dark calcification found in the literature are lower than these found in this study (Egilsdottir et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0028">2013</a>; El Haïkali, Bensoussan, Romano, &amp; Bousquet, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0030">2004</a>; Williamson et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0076">2017</a>). This coincides with the elevated photosynthesis and respiration rates. Southern populations reduce light calcification only by a small amount under central conditions (McCoy et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0056">2016</a>) but show increased respiration and decreased net production, suggesting downregulation of photosynthetic activity before calcification mechanisms. This is also supported by 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>max</sub> values obtained in this study which are higher under central conditions than under the control southern conditions. High variability in dark calcification was observed in all populations in all treatment, reflecting findings of McCoy et al. (
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0056">2016</a>), and indicating that the already small amount of dark calcification is easily influenced by environmental parameters such as temperature. Dark calcification rates of central populations decreased to close to zero under southern conditions, confirming downregulation of dark calcification. This, in addition to the decline in light calcification rates, results in a higher dissolution rate of central populations under southern conditions than under control conditions. A decrease of dark calcification of southern populations under central conditions indicated slow or no ability of southern populations to adapt to colder temperature regimes. At the same time, central populations show similar behavior in warmer temperatures. All of this shows that the two processes of calcification and photosynthesis are not as tightly coupled as previously assumed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While oxygen evolution and calcification evolution data perfectly mirror the net production and respiration, calcification results show the high in situ variability between central populations which is due to environmental adaptations rather than genetic adaptations. This is supported by the very similar calcification rates in the light after the incubation of central populations in southern conditions compared to the pre‐experimental measurements. This also means that we are unable to determine the timing of when central populations kept under southern conditions began to reduce light calcification rates.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A high variability in both 
  <span class="italic">α</span> and 
  <span class="italic">I</span>
  <sub>K</sub> of P‐I and C‐I curves, also found by Egilsdottir et al. (
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0029">2015</a>), in southern populations shows that adaptation ability can strongly depend on region of origin and the stress already experienced in their natural environment. Combining the knowledge gained from this study, central populations seem to be more robust, resilient, and adaptable to future climatic changes as predicted by the IPCC (
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0041">2013</a>) than southern populations. According to Williamson et al. (
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0076">2017</a>), 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> populations in South England are adapted to variability in environmental stressors both in short (tidal) and long (seasonal) timescales. This is consistent with the findings of primary production, respiration as well as light and dark calcification, leaving the central populations better adapted to changes than southern populations in this study and others. This supports the center‐to‐margin hypothesis (Guo, Taper, Schoenberger, &amp; Brandle, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0035">2005</a>) for 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span>. Additionally, this study also demonstrates that 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> needs a minimum amount of 4 weeks, but preferably longer, to fully acclimatize to altered conditions such as changes in temperature or pCO
  <sub>2</sub>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even though relatively static conditions were kept in this experiment and no tidal movement was simulated due to facility restrictions, parameters were chosen to be at the predominant existing light and temperature conditions of the season in which the algae were sampled in and which they would experience when submerged during intertidal periods. This ensured the measurement of the optimum and most realistic physiological responses of 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> to the opposite populations conditions by being in their predominant state of being submerged and not stressed by abiotic factors during low tide conditions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The speed in which climatic changes are observed today may be too rapid for this species to be able to adapt fully to them. This may result in loss of genetic diversity in 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis,</span> and species ranges may shift and become confined. This was previously also found by Collevatti, Nabout, and Diniz‐Filho (
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0015">2011</a>) in a common garden experiment with the neotropical tree species 
  <span class="italic">Caryocar brasiliense</span>, which experiences a climate change induced restriction of ideal habitat for their southern margin populations. According to the authors, this leads to a drastic decrease of genetic diversity and numbers of alleles due to the survival and reproduction success of only the most adapted genotypes under future climatic conditions. Additionally, it leads to the reduction in individual fitness and therefore population evolutionary potential. Another study performed a common garden experiment on multiple species of ants and found an elevated temperature induced decrease in survival and brood production (Pelini et al., 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0065">2012</a>). The authors of this study indicate that the decline in these two factors will lead to a loss of genetic diversity. A potential change in genetic diversity and percentage cover due to a potential decrease in growth rates of 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> in rocky shore intertidal ecosystems has been suggested to lead to loss of diversity of this macroalgae genus as well as associated flora and fauna. It is unclear, however, how flora and fauna would adapt to gradual changes in hosts.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To conclude, central populations may be adapting better to warmer temperature conditions in future oceans but at the same time may experience a loss in percentage cover in intertidal, rocky, coastal zones. Central populations’ calcification is negatively impacted by elevated sea surface temperatures, potentially resulting in reduced resilience. Southern populations' most negatively affected physiological process in central conditions was production rates, implying a reduced resilience in these populations as well. With sea surface temperatures warming up in northern regions of the species distribution, southern populations may be able to shift their distribution northern wards and therefore potentially disappear entirely in their original environment due to even warmer conditions in future ocean environments.</p>
