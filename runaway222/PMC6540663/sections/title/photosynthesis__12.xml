  <a rid="ece35162-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35162-fig-0003">3</a>) in central populations did not change significantly in the different conditions over the course of the experiment. Contrary to central population 1, central population 2, however, showed significantly lower primary production rates under southern compared to central conditions after the experiment (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis 
  <span class="italic">H</span> test). Southern populations showed a similar oxygen production rate before and after the experiment under southern conditions. Central populations showed lower oxygen production rates under southern conditions but higher rates under central conditions compared to pre‐experiment measurements (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35162-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35162-fig-0003">3</a>). Only southern population 2 showed a significant negative change in production rates, actually resulting in respiration rates, under central experimental conditions compared to starting conditions (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis 
  <span class="italic">H</span> test). When comparing populations within regions, none of the central or southern populations were significantly different within each other before the experiment. However, central populations were significantly different from southern population 1 prior to the experiment (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis 
  <span class="italic">H</span> test).
