  <span class="italic">n</span> = 72) of 
  <span class="italic">Corallina officinalis</span> Linneaus populations (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 2) were collected intertidally, during low tide in an average depth of 0.31m from the water surface at sites in the South East Coast of the UK (central population 1: St Margarets Bay: N 51.148056, E 1.385056; population 2: Westbrook Bay: N 51.388840, E 1.367170; beeline distance between populations: 26.85 km) and the North West Coast of Spain (southern margin population 1: Illa del Arousa: N 42.56870, W 8.89171; population 2: Tragove: N 42.52444, W 8.82772; beeline distance between populations: 7.19 km) in February 2017. Specimens were transported into the laboratory at the Institute of Marine Sciences of the University of Portsmouth, UK, using temperature‐insulating containers. Only healthy specimens without epiphytes and indication of bleaching or damage were selected for this study.
