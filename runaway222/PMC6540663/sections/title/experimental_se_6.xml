 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the laboratory, specimens were carefully placed upright onto a rock in the water, held in place with a net (2 mm mesh size) in order to simulate natural conditions and each population was color coded for future identification. Aquaria of 11.1 L (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3) for each of the two countries and temperature conditions (total 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 12) were set up in a water bath (for detailed setup see Figure 
  <a rid="ece35162-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35162-fig-0001">1</a>). 75% of the water in the replicate aquaria was changed every second day and treated with UV light (P2‐110W Commercial UV Steriliser, max. flow rate: 65 L/min. Tropic Marine Centre (TMC), London, UK) prior to the disposal. Temperature conditions were kept constant using TK‐2000 chillers (cooling capacity of 870 W, 800 L/hr. TECO, Ravenna, Italy). Each aquarium was equipped with a water pump (V
  <span class="sup">2</span>PowerPump 800, Flow rate: 700 L/hr. TMC, London, UK) and an air stone to simulate tidal water movements and ensure oxygen supply with ambient air. Specimens were kept at their respective local in situ temperatures measured during sampling (central conditions: temperature: 5.7°C, light: 57 μmol m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> s
  <span class="sup">−1</span>; southern conditions: temperature: 11.3°C, light: 184 μmol m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> s
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). Both treatments were subject to a light:dark cycle of 10:14 hr (taken from the average of natural conditions of center and southern locations) produced and controlled by AQUABEAM 600 Ultima Reef White lights with cloud function (TMC, London, UK). Additionally, sunset and sunrise were mimicked through a slow increase and decrease of light intensities over a period of 1 hr. All specimens were kept in their corresponding conditions for a minimum of 1 week to acclimate to aquaria conditions. Following the initial acclimatization, half of the central and southern populations were gradually acclimatized (increase/decrease of 1.5°C/week and 40 μmol m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> s
  <span class="sup">−1</span>/week, respectively) to the opposite temperature and light conditions over a period of 3.5 weeks. After acclimatization, specimens were randomly and equally distributed within the corresponding replicate aquaria and kept for three months (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35162-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35162-fig-0001">1</a>).
