 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All analyses were run in SPSS Statistics 24 (IBM Corp, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0040">2016</a>), and data were tested for normality and homogeneity prior analyses (Shapiro–Wilk and Levene's test, for 
  <span class="italic">p</span> values, Table S1, see Data Repository). Data for net production (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3) were not normally distributed, resulting in statistical analysis using the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis 
  <span class="italic">H</span> test. Data for respiration (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3) as well as dark calcification (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3) measurements showed a significant Levene's test with raw as well as transformed data due to high variance. Therefore, data were analyzed using multiple single comparisons of one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Normally distributed data of the dependant variable light calcification (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3) were analyzed using two‐way ANOVAs for individuals from each country of origin (UK (center) or SP (southern margin)) with treatment (three levels: pre‐experiment, central conditions, and southern conditions) as the fixed factor. When significant effects were found, data were further explored by running a post hoc Tukey's HSD test. Tests were performed for central and southern populations under each temperature condition comparing measurements before and after the experiment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additional two‐way ANOVAs and Tukey's HSD post hoc tests of central and southern populations were performed to identify significant differences in their maximum oxygen production and calcification level of all populations in all temperature treatments.</p>
