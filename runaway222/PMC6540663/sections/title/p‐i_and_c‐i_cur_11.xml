  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, Tukey HSD 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, 2‐way ANOVA in both cases). Southern population 1 showed a significant difference versus central populations under southern conditions (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, Tukey HSD 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, 2‐way ANOVA in both cases). The photosynthetic efficiency, α, of central populations did not differ in both treatments. However, all southern populations under central conditions showed up to 50% less light harvesting efficiency than under southern conditions. The saturating light intensity 
  <span class="italic">I</span>
  <sub>K</sub> of all populations was noticeably higher in central than in southern populations, under southern conditions, but very similar under central conditions. Southern populations developed a ~50% higher saturating light intensity in central (~85 μmol m
