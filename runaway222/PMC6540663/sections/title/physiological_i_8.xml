 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine saturating light levels of 
  <span class="italic">C. officinalis</span> populations before and after the experiment, the oxygen production (P‐I curve) and calcification (C‐I curve) evolution under increasing light conditions were measured. For this, 0.97 ± 0.07 g fresh weight of algal fronds was transferred into a clear closed cell 58 ml incubation chamber and incubated successively for 1 hr at each of the seven different light intensities (0, 20, 80, 160, 320, 500, and 700 μmol m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> s
  <span class="sup">−1</span>; AQUARAY Nature Perfect, TMC, London, UK), starting from the lowest to the highest to minimize stress. Three replicates per light intensity were incubated simultaneously and bubble‐free. To account and correct for metabolism effects by other organisms, reference incubations without algae were performed alongside the above‐described incubations for all light intensities. Aluminum foil was used to coat the chambers to determine calcification and respiration rates in the dark. Irradiance was measured with a Quantitherm PAR/Temperature Sensor with a QTP1 probe (resolution: 1 μmol m

  <span class="sup">−1</span>, 0.02°C, respectively. Hansatech, Norfolk, UK).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in oxygen concentration, pH, and A
  <sub>T</sub> were determined in order to calculate photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification rates by measuring oxygen, pH, and A
  <sub>T</sub>, respectively, before and after the incubations. Prior to the A
  <sub>T</sub> measurements, seawater samples were filtered through a syringe filter (hydrophilic 25 mm, 0.2 μm PTFE. Fisherbrand, Loughborough, UK) into sterile 50 ml tubes (Plastic Centrifuge Tubes. Fisherbrand, Loughborough, UK). Immediately after, potentiometric titrations were performed using an automatic titrator (details: see above) calibrated on the NBS scale. Results were calculated based on a Gran function after Dickson et al. (
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0024">2007</a>). The carbonate system of the seawater was calculated from pH, A
  <sub>T</sub>, salinity, and temperature using the Excel Macro CO2Sys (Version 2.1, Lewis &amp; Wallace, 
  <a rid="ece35162-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35162-bib-0050">1998</a>) with K1 and K2 according to Mehrbach, Culberson, Hawley, and Pytkowicx (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine changes in photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification rates most likely to be found in the field, additional incubations (

  <span class="sup">−2</span> s
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for center and 184 μmol m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> s

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The weight of algae fronds used in the incubations was transformed from FW into dry weight (DW) by multiplying FW measurements with the factor 0.62286. This factor was determined from FW and DW weight measurements of thirty 1 g frond bundles from all populations before and after algae were left to dry for 48 hr in an oven at 60ºC.</p>
