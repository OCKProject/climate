  <p>(
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Mean latitudes of the GSNW line in two longitude ranges—the robust GS zone of 75°W–50°W (blue solid and dotted lines) and GS extension (less robust) zone of 50°W–40°W (green solid and dotted lines) from 1965 to 2015; solid lines show 5-year averaged and dotted lines show independent annual positions. Blue and green dotted trend lines show the trends of the GSNW position calculated using the annual data. Mean latitudes of the 5-year averaged positions of ZLWSC in the robust and extension zones are shown by orange and gray lines, respectively, for the time period from 1980 to 2015 (from SODA 3.3.1; see text); (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Mean latitudes of GSNW lines as in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) vs three major ocean-atmosphere interaction indices—AMO (red dash line), MEI (purple dash line), and NAO (black dotted line) and North Atlantic ocean heat content in the upper 700 m (red line, units = 0.25*Joules*10
   <span class="sup">22</span>); (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) Mean annual latitudes of GSNW at nine different longitudes; the dotted lines in (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) show the linear trends calculated using 5-year averaged data. All parameters in (
   <span class="bold">b</span>,
   <span class="bold">c</span>) were smoothed with a 5-year moving average.
