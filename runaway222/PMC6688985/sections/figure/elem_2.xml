  <p>Positions of the zero line of annually averaged wind stress curl (ZLWSC) for each year from 1980 to 2015 (grey lines). The bold blue line shows the GSNW position averaged over all years from 1965 to 2017 for the GS area (same as in Fig.Â 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Pentadal ZLWSC positions from 1980 to 2015 shown as colored lines. The ZLWSC averaged over all pentads is shown by the bold magenta line. Wind stress data are from SODA v3.3.1 re-analyses. The ZLWSC is shown only above the GS jet region, with the areas adjacent to the East Coast and the Grand Banks excluded.
