The standard deviations (STD) derived from 1965–2017 annual mean locations at chosen longitudes are shown in the insert in Fig.

  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> represents the average annual position of the GSNW for all years from 1965 to 2017. The data coverage in the entire GS region is quite good across all decades since 1965, so the widening of the GS envelope east of 50°W in 2005–2017 is most probably natural variability caused by a change in the balance of some of the key forcings rather than inter-decadal data coverage differences. The data coverage, error distributions, and other statistics are available at the WOA18 website

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the annual pathways imply, inter-annual GSNW variability is noticeably different west and east of ~50°W. There are two distinct variability zones—a rather narrow envelope (~3° of latitude-wide) west of 50°W, and a twice wider envelope (~6° of latitude-wide) east of 50°W, which indicates more disperse pathways near the Mid-Latitude Transition Zone (MLTZ)

  </span>. The GSNW decadal annual positions west of the Grand Banks deviates from the multi-decadal average very little, and thus this region is hereafter called the “robust zone” of the GS which is also present in previous GS path reconstructions, both at the surface and 200 m depth, e.g.

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>—between 45°W and 40°W—the GS path’s variability significantly increases. As can be seen in the insert in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, the inter-annual variability of the GSNW position in the extension zone east of 50°W is two times larger than in the robust zone between 65°W and 50°W. Despite the GS being exposed to multiple external forces and experiencing internal instabilities and continuous interactions with surrounding water masses, the robustness of the GS pathway between 75°W and 50°W is nothing less than spectacular. Decadally-averaged seasonal GSNW positions (winter and summer - not shown here) reveal similar decadal GSNW path’s dynamics but with very small differences between seasonal positions (seasonal thermohaline signal is much weaker at 200 m depth than near the sea surface
  <span class="sup">

 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within the ~50-year timeline, the period of 2005–2017 is marked by far more spread in the annual GSNW positions than the previous decades, especially between 50°W and 40°W (thin dotted magenta lines in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Although the increased spatial range of the individual paths in the last decade may influence inter-annual AMOC dynamics further north, it does not lead to any noticeable change in the 2005–2017 decadal position when compared to other decades. It is not clear if this recent tendency of a wider spread of yearly GSNW positions relative to the decadal average will continue and, if it will, how it may impact future decadal GSNW positions and eventually the entire AMOC system. New data in the forthcoming decades may bring more certainty to this issue.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first mentioned the remarkable long-term robustness of the thermal structure of the GS between 75°W and 50°W while mapping the decadal annual positions of the 18 °C isotherms at 10 m and 15 °C at 200 m depth

  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Since the wind stress data used in our analysis are available only from 1980 to 2015, pentadal ZLWSC were computed for this time interval (see Data and Methods section). The decadal GSNW and pentadal ZLWSC lines run almost in parallel from 75°W to 50°W. East of 50°W, the multi-decadal averaged positions of GSNW and ZLWSC begin to converge and then cross each other at approximately 43°W and then become disjointed, with ZLWSC being more aligned with the North Atlantic Current and GSNW more aligned with the Azores Current (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Similar to GSNW (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), the decadal ZLWSC positions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) are very coherent between 75°W and 50°W with increased spread in the vicinity of the MLTZ/NSS east of 45°W.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Connection with the curl of wind stress is less convincing. Although the mean latitude of the GSNW position is drifting northward in both longitudinal zones, the mean latitude of the ZLWSC is drifting

We cannot currently offer any plausible explanation of these counter-directed tendencies east of 50°W, except for perhaps noting that WSC reacts to NAO forcing while GSNW does not—there is a significant correlation between WSC and NAO but not between GSNW and NAO (not shown). Note, that this applies only to WSC and NAO for the extension zone. The sea surface path of the GS was shown to correlate with NAO in a number of publications, e.g.,

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To perceive how our GSNW reconstructions compare, at least qualitatively, with previous studies, we examined the latitudes of the annual position of the 15 °C isotherm at 200 m depth at nine meridional sections. The locations of six of these sections match those used for calculating GS indices at the sea surface in
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a> shows the GSNW annual position changes from 72°W to 40°W (all curves in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a> are plotted using 5-year moving averages). None of the curves reveal any annual southward drift of the GSNW. On the contrary, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a> unambiguously shows that GSNW drifts northward at all nine longitudes. West of ~50°W, the GSNW drifts northward slowly, while east of 50°W it drifts faster. The fastest drifts east of 50°W give ~2.6° of latitudinal shift over ~50 years, while the slowest (west of 50°W) reveals less than ~0.2° over the same period. Most of the northward drifting east of 50°W occurred from 1972 to 1982 with the rate of drift decreasing afterward and becoming comparable to that across the western sections. The change in the rates of the GSNW latitudinal migration is most probably connected to the change in the OHC accumulation rates that varied from cooling in the 1960s and early 1970s to warming with the highest warming rates occurring between the late 1970s and early 1990s, as can be seen in

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many diverse factors influence the GS dynamics. It is therefore unlikely that the GSNW would correlate significantly with all or most of them over the long run. In fact, the GSNW multidecadal variability at 200 m depth correlates rather poorly with some atmospheric-related indices (ZLWSC, NAO, MEI). However, there are significant correlations between the GSNW variability and that of AMO and OHC, especially in the extension zone (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The correlation coefficients 
  <span class="italic">r</span> between the latitude of GSNW positions and AMO and OHC anomalies in the two zones and along the entire stretch of the GSNW between 75°W and 40°W were calculated using 5-years moving averages, independent pentadal, and independent annual values. The independent pentadal and annual correlations were tested for confidence by calculating their 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-values. Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> provides correlation coefficients and corresponding 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-values. Correlation of GSNW with annual and pentadal OHC and AMO is significant at the 95% confidence level in the extended zone. Correlation with annual OHC and GSNW is significant at the 90% level in the robust zone. This analysis could not find any significant correlations between AMO and GSNW in the robust zone, but there are significant correlations between these two indices in the extension zone east of 50°W (see more on this in Discussion).

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span> indicates that there is about a 2-year lag between AMO and the GS path variations. We found lagged correlations (not shown) between the GSNW and AMO (AMO leads) at 2 to 4-year lags in the 50°W–40°W zone, but the difference between lagged and no-lagged correlations appeared rather small and thus inconclusive.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important and novel revelation evident in the displayed results is that there are significant correlations between the GSNW and OHC in the upper 700 m layer of the North Atlantic, with especially significant correlations (
  <span class="italic">r</span> &gt; 0.8, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) in the extension zone. Equally important are the results showing that variability of the most resilient portion of the GSNW stretch (robust zone) is significantly correlated only with OHC and exhibits little correlation with any atmospheric-related forcing (not shown).
