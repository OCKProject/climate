 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are two important issues related to the long-term displacements of the Gulf Stream (GS) path that have not yet been unambiguously resolved. First, it is not completely clear how significantly the GS path’s position varies on decadal timescales. Second, it is still not well known whether the decadal changes in the path’s displacements can be caused by or linked to the long-term ocean warming or cooling. These two issues comprise the main subject of our study. What is unique to this study is relating the decadal variability of the GS path to changes in the North Atlantic ocean heat content (OHC)

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are other western boundary currents in the Global Ocean (e.g., Kuroshio, East Australian, South China Sea, Agulhas, etc.) which have been discussed in many studies, e.g.

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. The GS begins as the Florida Current merging with the Antilles Current and continues as a powerful western boundary current flowing northward along the shelf break. At Cape Hatteras, the GS separates from the shelf and advances eastward toward the Grand Banks where it splits into two branches: one flowing north-north-east as the North Atlantic Current while another continuing eastward as the Azores Current

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The warm and salty GS water is separated from the cold and fresh shelf water by a buffer zone occupied by the Slope Water (SW). The boundary between the GS and SW lies along the Gulf Stream north wall (GSNW). It is customary to approximate the GS pathway by the 15 °C isotherm at 200 m depth, which by convention coincides with the GSNW at this depth

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Another widely used method is to define the GS path by the maximum gradient of sea surface height (SSH) across the jet

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. The actual GS path, defined most broadly as the line of maximum current speed, lies slightly south of the GSNW defined by the 15 °C isotherm at 200 m depth

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>, we focus this study on decadal variability of the GSNW position traced by 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> data at 200 m depth. This sub-surface definition of the GS path is advantageous to this study as it is not impacted by surface dynamics resulting from air-sea interactions (e.g., Ekman currents, off-shore precipitations, etc.).

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GS position varies both seasonally and inter-annually

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. Near the surface, the seasonal signal in the GS displacement is approximately sinusoidal with most southerly positions in spring and most northerly in fall
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. However, the seasonal signal in temperature and salinity fades quickly with depth

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span> and so does the amplitude of the GS displacement (compare seasonal temperature fields for any decade at the World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA18) website

  </span>. Many believe that the GS variability could be linked to several aggregated indices describing basin-scale interactions between ocean and atmosphere. Some suggest that interannual latitudinal migrations of the GS path can be associated with one or more natural modes of climate variability such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)

  </span>. There are many factors in play, including, but not limited to bottom torque, wind stress variability, baroclinic instability of the free jet, and eddy-jet interactions. Some authors suggest that there is a feedback between wind-stress and the GS which maintains the jet stability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span> and it is possible that the GS affects the wind and thermal structure of the near-surface atmosphere and thus its fingerprint can be seen in the wind stress curl (WSC)
