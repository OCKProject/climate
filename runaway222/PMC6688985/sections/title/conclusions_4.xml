 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The principal conclusion of our analysis, based on over fifty years of 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> observations, is that the GS between Cape Hatteras and the Grand Banks is not only stiff but maintains its position with astounding resiliency. It does migrate slowly northward as a whole, but it is unlikely that such slow and spatially insignificant migration might have caused substantial changes of the AMOC (i.e., like the AMOC transport decline since 2004
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>). In contrast, in the extension zone near the Grand Banks, the GS northward shift is noticeable—more than 2.6° (based on 5-year average GSNW positions) in latitude over ~50 years—and could have some impacts on the AMOC long-term dynamics. Notably, we found significant correlations in the GS extension zone between the GSNW and OHC variability that may be the most critical for the GS path resilience and its future changes over decadal and longer time scales. Moreover, the significant correlations between OHC and GSNW in the extension zone rose from 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.5 for annual to 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.8 for pentadal to 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.90 decadal (not shown) time scales.

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The AMOC decadal variability has been addressed in many studies (e.g., a review in
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>). It is then enticing to speculate whether the GSNW migration may be a factor in AMOC fluctuations. However, our analysis indicates that establishing this relationship between GSNW position changes and AMOC decadal variability is problematic. In an attempt to connect the dots with this issue, we offer our view of how the GSNW and AMOC decadal variability can be interrelated. Given the remarkable GSNW robustness, a hypothesis can be put forth that the upper arm of the GS influence over the AMOC on decadal and longer timescales may stem from (a) strong decadal variability of the GS volume transport within a stiff and resilient jet between 75°W and 50°W (this possibility is debated by some authors
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>), (b) wandering of the GS extension and North Atlantic Current east of 50°W, or (c) some combination of the two. Namely, if AMOC’s decadal variability, primarily controlled by ocean-atmosphere interactions in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>, is indeed influenced by the GS decadal changes it can only be through the aforementioned mechanisms and not through decadal variations of the GSNW position, which we have shown to be rather small in the robust zone, but may become a more potent factor in the extension zone (the latter is yet difficult to prove without direct measurements of the AMOC variability in this zone). We also assert that the OHC may become the best indicator of the GS path’s variability on decadal and longer time scales. Understanding the synergy of subpolar air-sea interactions and the GS influence on the AMOC multidecadal changes calls for a more complex analysis that would require an in-concert use of 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> data, modeling, and remote sensing observations.
