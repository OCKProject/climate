 <p>We want to thank the scientists, technicians, data center staff, and data managers for their contributions of data to the IOC/IODE, ICSU/World Data System, and NOAA/NCEI Ocean Archive System, which provided a foundation of 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> oceanographic data for this work. We are especially thankful to Sydney Levitus (retired, formerly of NOAA/NCEI) for his pioneering work on the World Ocean Climatology that initiated all subsequent efforts in building WOD and all ocean climatologies founded on this database. We also thank our colleagues at NOAA/NCEI for many years of data processing and constructing the World Ocean Database and World Ocean Atlas and especially to Tim Boyer for his leadership role in the WOD project. We are grateful to Scott Cross of NOAA/NCEI for his useful comments and suggestions. This study was partially supported by NOAA grant NA14NES4320003 [Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites (CICS)] at the University of Maryland/ESSIC. Further support was provided by NOAA’s Climate Program Office’s Ocean Observing and Monitoring Division. We are thankful to two anonymous reviewers for their useful comments and suggestions that helped to substantially improve the manuscript.
