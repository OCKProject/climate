 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most impressive features of the GS is its “stiffness”
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> meaning that the width and lateral structure of the GS remains well-preserved along the GS pathway despite vigorous meandering, ring shedding, filaments forming, etc.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. There are many external factors impacting the GS such as: wind, bottom topography torque, SW variability, water exchange with the GS surrounding
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>, barotropic and baroclinic instabilities of the jet, freshwater impacts and related surface salinity changes, and strong seasonal effects imposed by tropical storms and hurricanes. Given many various impacts, the resilience of the GS pathway emerges as an undeniably remarkable phenomenon sustaining an unwavering jet that remains stiff and robust over many decades.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With many factors shaping the GS system, we do not expect any single one to dominate in maintaining the GS pathway’s long-term stiffness and stability. However, two factors stand out as the potentially strongest candidates controlling the GS path variability on decadal and longer timescales. The first is WSC which is responsible for developing and maintaining (via Ekman pumping) the dipole of two water gyres—south (warm and salty) and north (cold and fresh) of the GS system. However, it does not explain the overall northward shift of the GSNW. As Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a> illustrates, the long-term shifts of ZLWSC and GSNW are of opposite directions between 50°W and 40°W. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, the WSC and GS dynamics are coupled
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span> making it difficult to conclude with certainty which of the two leads in maintaining the stable and highly coherent ZLWSC and GSNW patterns between 75°W and 50°W (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another potentially critical long-term impact factor is the ongoing warming of the ocean’s interior southeast of the GSNW manifested in highly localized warm water heaving
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. This localized interior warming correlates well with AMO (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.74) and could be the cause of the GSNW northward shift—the most logical conclusion based on both the OHC
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> and our GSNW mappings. The most substantial connection is between the GSNW migration and OHC local accumulation and is followed by a weaker connection between GSNW migration and AMO (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There may be a number of reasons why the GSNW decadal-scale variability correlates weakly with ZLWSC, NAO, and MEI, as Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a> implies. First, correlations between GS long-term variability and atmospheric indices can be expected to be stronger at the sea surface than at 200 m depth, on which this study is focused. Second, the robust zone may not correlate well with atmospheric indices because the residual forcing may counterbalance individual impacts, which is exactly what the GS resilience implies—independence of the GS long-term path from cumulative external forcings. Third, decadal timescales may be substantially longer than most atmospheric processes represented by major climate-change indices, except perhaps for AMO (tied closely to OHC with which the GSNW is bonded most strongly).
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amplitude of latitudinal spread of the annual GSNW positions increases in the most recent time period of 2005–2017 without any significant deviation of the corresponding decadally averaged pathway from the multi-decadal average. It is too early to make any definitive assumption whether this tendency of increased latitudinal displacements may reverse, as the long-term resilience of the GS system would imply, or if it will continue or stagnate. As was discussed earlier, we do not attribute the recent widening of the GSNW vacillations east of 50°W to better 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> data coverage over the past decade, but rather we connect it to the actual recent change of ocean climate in the vicinity of the GS extension zone (perhaps due to increased intensity of interactions between the NAC and the Labrador Current).
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the GS resilience may be due, at least partially, to internal dynamics of jet-eddies interactions that is known to be able to rectify a baroclinic jet. The geostrophic turbulence theory
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span> predicts that eddy energy can facilitate an inverse energy cascade from smaller to larger scales, also known as rectification of the main jet by eddies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>. Proving these arguments are beyond the scope of our study but still worth mentioning as possible additional explanations of the GS resiliency.
