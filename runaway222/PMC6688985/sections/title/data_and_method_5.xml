 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our analyses, we used the 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> seawater temperature profile data from the most recent version of the World Ocean Database published online in 2018 (WOD18) and available at 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD/pr_wod.html" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD/pr_wod.html</span>. All available profiles of seawater temperature within the 80°W–40°W and 30°N–50°N domain were used to extract annual and decadal coordinates of the 15 °C isotherm at 200 m depth using the Ocean Data View (ODV) software

  </span> (the reanalysis is with one-half of a degree spatial resolution) described at https://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ocean/ for the 1980–2015 period, and the ZLWSC positions were analyzed using annual and pentadal averages. The domain of the ZLWSC computation was limited to the area of GSNW variability.
