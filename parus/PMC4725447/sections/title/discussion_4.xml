 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we show that BMR is related to winter survival in a wild population of blue tits and that the direction of this direct or indirect selection can vary between years. Although we can only speculate about the underlying causes of this pattern, it seems likely that this fluctuating selection could be explained by differences in meteorological conditions in the two winters (Table 
  <a rid="ece31954-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece31954-tbl-0001">1</a>). Metabolic requirements are known to increase during the winter (Swanson 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0035">2010</a>) at the same time as food availability and time for acquiring the food decrease. This induces a strong selection pressure for utilising energy in an efficient way, and even small differences in the pattern of energy acquisition and allocation are likely to have substantial fitness effects. In the temperate region, thermoregulation makes up a large part of the daily energy budget during winters and the cost increases rapidly with decreasing ambient temperatures (McNab 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0024">2002</a>; McKechnie 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0022">2008</a>). In contrast to mammals, birds only thermoregulate by shivering their muscles (especially the large pectoral muscle), and in line with this, several studies have found a link between BMR and maximal thermoregulatory capacity (Liknes and Swanson 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0020">1996</a>; Liknes et al. 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0021">2002</a>). A similar link has been found between BMR and susMR (sustainable metabolic rate) (Nilsson 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0025">2002</a>; Tieleman et al. 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0037">2008</a>; Sears et al. 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0032">2009</a>). An increase in maximal thermoregulatory capacity or susMR requires an increased mass of energy‐supplying organs such as intestines, liver, kidney, and heart as well as increased muscle mass to sustain shivering thermogenesis (Raichlen et al. 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0029">2010</a>; Zhang et al. 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0046">2015</a>). These organs and muscles are also very metabolically active, establishing the functional link between BMR and susMR (Nilsson 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0025">2002</a>; Raichlen et al. 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0029">2010</a>). Selection on these energy‐supplying organs is probably the reason for observed variation in BMR in cold environments.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the second winter of this study, the mean temperature was lower (Table 
  <a rid="ece31954-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece31954-tbl-0001">1</a>) and consequently the need for high cold resistance and the resulting thermoregulatory costs were higher than during the previous winter. During these conditions, it is therefore not surprising that birds with high BMR survive better (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31954-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31954-fig-0001">1</a>B), because the high BMR allows them to have a high capacity of thermogenesis. As has been argued for selection on personalities (Careau et al. 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0008">2008</a>), in situations when a high susMR is needed, selection will indirectly favour individuals with a high BMR. This selection pressure will, however, potentially be lessened when the need of a high susMR or high thermogenesis capacity is relaxed. High‐BMR individuals could then instead be selected against, as they still have to pay the cost of higher energetic needs without the advantage of a need for increased thermoregulatory capacity. Thus, during a mild winter, as in the first year of the study, there is no need for high rates of thermogenesis and a high BMR would then be disadvantageous as it only leads to costs in the form of increased food requirements and potentially increased risks of predation. This is in line with the generally observed reduction in BMR at southern latitudes, with a reduced need for high rates of thermogenesis, compared to more northerly latitudes although ambient temperatures may be well below the thermoneutral zone in both areas (Broggi et al. 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0003">2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We suggest that the temporally varying selection pattern that we found, together with a trait heritability of 0.59 in this population (Nilsson et al. 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0027">2009</a>), will produce a substantial variation in BMR in the wild. In line with our study is the finding that the relation between reproductive success and metabolic rate of bank voles (
  <span class="italic">Myodes glareolus</span>) also varies between seasons (Boratyn'ski and Koteja 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0001">2010</a>). These examples of fluctuating selection, together with the evidence that selection on BMR can be sex dependent (Boratyn'ski and Koteja 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0001">2010</a>; Boratyn'ski et al. 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0002">2010</a>), corroborate the recently proposed “context dependence” hypotheses for the relation between BMR and fitness (Burton et al. 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0007">2011</a>). Fluctuating selection could not only explain the pronounced variation in BMR in wild populations, but will also give us new insights into how energy turnover rates can shape the life‐history strategies of animals. Because the selection direction seems to depend on the winter conditions in our case, the favoured metabolic phenotype will vary between years. As BMR has been suggested to be intimately related to life‐history variation, for example, in reproductive strategies along a fast–slow axis (Wikelski et al. 
  <a rid="ece31954-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31954-bib-0043">2003</a>), this variation may be predicted to also differ between years according to the selective process during the previous winter. Furthermore, in a global warming scenario, selection on winter survival may result in a directional reduction in BMR, potentially indirectly affecting the general life history in the population favouring low BMR genotypes with a slow rate of living.
