 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In total, 167 individuals were included in the study (2004–2005: 92 birds; 2005–2006: 75 birds). Residual BMR was used to control for the factors affecting winter BMR in the survival analysis (respirometer channel as random factor and mass as a covariate; mass: 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>1,162</sub> = 152.94, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001). Survival was related to residual BMR, but the direction of selection differed between the two winters (GENMOD: residual BMR × year: 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 4.59; 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.032). In the winter 2004–2005 (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31954-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31954-fig-0001">1</a>A), selection favoured the birds with low residual BMR (regression coefficient: 7.44 ± 6.74), while in 2005–2006 (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31954-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31954-fig-0001">1</a>B), it favoured the birds with relatively high residual BMR (regression coefficient: 11.69 ± 6.44). The overall effect of residual BMR for the two winters combined was nonsignificant (residual BMR: 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.31; 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.58). Survival probability did not differ between the two winters (
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 1.85; 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.17), but males and older birds were more likely to survive than females and first‐year birds (sex: 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 4.58; 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.032, age: 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 5.53; 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.019).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature characteristics differed between the two winters (Table 
  <a rid="ece31954-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece31954-tbl-0001">1</a>). The first winter was quite mild and had only a few days with snow cover, while the second winter was colder and with snow cover lasting for several weeks. Whereas snow coverage does not affect the thermoregulatory costs, it can potentially affect foraging costs negatively, thereby adding to the costs of the lower temperature.
