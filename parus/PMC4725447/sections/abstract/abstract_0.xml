  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">BMR</span> (Basal metabolic rate) is an important trait in animal life history as it represents a significant part of animal energy budgets. 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">BMR</span> has also been shown to be positively related to sustainable work rate and maximal thermoregulatory capacity. To this date, most of the studies have focused on the causes of interspecific and intraspecific variation in 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">BMR</span>, and fairly little is known about the fitness consequences of different metabolic strategies. In this study, we show that winter 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">BMR</span> affects local survival in a population of wild blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>), but that the selection direction differs between years. We argue that this fluctuating selection is probably a consequence of varying winter climate with a positive relation between survival and 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">BMR</span> during cold and harsh conditions, but a negative relation during mild winters. This fluctuating selection can not only explain the pronounced variation in 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">BMR</span> in wild populations, but will also give us new insights into how energy turnover rates can shape the life‐history strategies of animals. Furthermore, the study shows that the process of global warming may cause directional selection for a general reduction in 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">BMR</span>, affecting the general life‐history strategy on the population level.
