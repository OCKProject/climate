 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One population parameter that might affect among-year variability in population size and, as a consequence, the results of our study is population density. One example of such an effect would be if populations at high density are close to carrying capacity. If that is the case, population size at high density is unlikely to vary much, and temporal variation in population size should be smaller than at low population density. However, populations at high density might vary to the same extent as populations at low density, the former mostly decreasing and the latter mostly increasing in size. In that case we would not expect a difference in temporal variation between populations with high and low density. Furthermore, in some populations with occasional or regular demographic explosions (e.g. snowy owl 
  <span class="italic">Nyctea scandiaca</span>; [
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>]), variability in population size may be larger at high than at low density. Whatever happens in particular cases, density-dependence of population size variation is a general rule in a wide range of animal taxa [
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>-
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">50</a>]. Population indices do not provide information on absolute density (number of individuals per unit area), because they are relative values in relation to population size in a particular year. However, they give information about relative density within a population, because large population indices correspond to high density and small population indices to low density in that particular population. Therefore, within-population comparisons among years with (relatively) high and low density are possible. We estimated effects of density-dependence on among-year variability of population indices by comparing CV between years with high and low population indices (within populations). Specifically, for every bird population (i.e., every species in every country) we ranked population indices decreasingly and then divided the data in two halves, one with the largest population indices and the other with the smallest population indices. When number of study years was an odd number, the mid-point population index was included in both halves. In this way, the two subsets for a given population always included the same number of population indices. Then, CV of population indices was estimated for each of the two subsets, CV
  <sub>high</sub> for large population indices and CV
  <sub>low</sub> for small population indices. Since number of study years (n) used to calculate CV varied among countries and sometimes also among species within a country, CV values were transformed to obtain CV corrected for sample size (CV*) with the following transformation: CV* = CV (1 + 1/4n) [
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">51</a>]. Reduced Major Axis (RMA) regressions of CV*
  <sub>high</sub> on CV*
  <sub>low</sub> had in general slopes not significantly different from one after sequential Bonferroni correction ([
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">52</a>]; 12 tests; mean (SE) slope = 1.02 (0.05), 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 11, range from 0.79 to 1.25; -2.83 ≤ 
  <span class="italic">t</span> ≤ 2.71, 56 ≤ df ≤ 168, and 
  <span class="italic">P</span> ≥ 0.0078 for 11 countries, the exception being Poland: slope = 0.76, 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>100</sub> = -3.65, and 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001) and intercepts not significantly different from zero after sequential Bonferroni correction (mean (SE) intercept = -0.37 (0.59), 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 12, range from -4.47 to 2.39; -2.08 ≤ 
  <span class="italic">t</span> ≤ 1.68, 56 ≤ df ≤ 168, and 
  <span class="italic">P</span> ≥ 0.044 for the 12 countries). CV*
  <sub>high</sub> and CV*
  <sub>low</sub> did not differ significantly from each other after sequential Bonferroni correction when they were compared within populations (paired 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-test; -2.60 ≤ 
  <span class="italic">t</span> ≤ 1.72, 57 ≤ df ≤ 169, and 
  <span class="italic">P</span> ≥ 0.012 for the 12 tests). As density-dependence should be controlled statistically, we included in our analyses a variable that reflected density-dependence in every population calculated as log
  <sub>10</sub>CV*
  <sub>high</sub> - log
  <sub>10</sub>CV*
  <sub>low</sub>. Very large positive values would imply strong density-dependence with larger variation at high than at low densities. In contrast, very large negative values would indicate strong density-dependent effects with larger variation at low than at high densities. Values around zero would imply weak or no density-dependence.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another parameter that might have an effect on population size is habitat fragmentation [
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">53</a>-
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>]. Fragmentation of land due to urbanisation, transport infrastructure and agriculture has been estimated for most European Union countries by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Methods used by EEA to calculate fragmentation indices and a map of Europe at a 10x10 km grid resolution showing levels of fragmentation can be found at the website http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/fragmentation-by-urbanisation-infrastructure-and-agriculture. In this map, the degree of fragmentation is shown by different colours representing six categories of fragmentation from minimal to extreme. We first calculated the percentage of the area of each country for every category of fragmentation by using the software Adobe Photoshop CS4 Extended, v. 11.0.2 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). We then assigned a value of fragmentation from one to six to the different degrees of fragmentation and calculated the mean fragmentation index weighted by area for every country (
  <a rid="pone-0077654-t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t001">Table 1</a>). Information on fragmentation was unavailable for Norway, but we assumed that it was very similar to the fragmentation index of the other countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula, i.e., Finland and Sweden. We performed all the statistical analyses three times using as fragmentation index for Norway the Finnish value, the Swedish value, or the mean of the Finnish and Swedish values. As results were qualitatively identical in the three cases, for brevity we only present results obtained using the mean of the Finnish and Swedish values.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> At least two methodological factors might affect the estimation of population indices. First, we would expect that sampling effort affected population size estimates, with possible implications for among-year variability of estimates. Sampling effort was calculated as the number of fieldworkers in a country (this information can be found at the EBCC website, see 
  <a rid="pone-0077654-t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t001">Table 1</a>) divided by area of the country (
  <a rid="pone-0077654-t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t001">Table 1</a>), i.e., fieldworkers per square kilometre. Second, census method might influence estimates of population fluctuations if some methods are more prone to errors than others. Actually, this seems to be the case, especially because point-counts show particularly large errors (B.-E. Sæther, personal communication). Observation errors have been suggested to significantly affect not only estimates of variation in population size [
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">50</a>], but also the apparent influence of density-dependence on this variation [
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">56</a>]. According to the EBCC website, most countries only used point-counts in their censuses, but methodology differed in four countries (
  <a rid="pone-0077654-t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t001">Table 1</a>). To control for different methodologies in different countries, we included in the analyses the variable “census method” with two categories, countries exclusively using point-counts (eight countries) and countries using other methods (four countries).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The present study implicitly assumes that global warming is both geographically and temporally uniform, allowing comparisons between time series of 34 years (Sweden) and only seven years (Poland), or between southern and northern European populations. Although these assumptions might not generally hold, we consider them to be acceptable in our case for the following reasons. Regarding geographic variation, almost all 12 countries included in this study have experienced a temperature increase during the twentieth century (range from -0.05°C to 1.27°C, mean (SE) = 0.67 (0.12) °C; temperature data obtained from [
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">57</a>]), while the relationship between temperature change and latitude for the 12 countries is far from significant (Pearson correlation, 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = -0.250, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 12, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.43). In relation to temporal variation, and using data from the EEA (http://www.eea.europa.eu), the relationship between annual temperature change in Europe during 1975-2008 and year is also not statistically significant (Pearson correlation, 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.074, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 34, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.68). These results suggest that warming has been similar in southern and northern Europe and constant over the 34 years considered in the present study. We here use temperature variation as a proxy for climate variation that is necessarily more complex than just differences in temperature.
