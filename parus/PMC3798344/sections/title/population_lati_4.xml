 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to estimate the marginality of bird populations, i.e., whether populations were central or marginal within the breeding distribution range, we first calculated a latitude index for each of the 12 European countries included in the study (
  <a rid="pone-0077654-t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t001">Table 1</a>). This latitude index was estimated as the latitude of the mid-point between the northernmost and the southernmost mainland points of every country. This information was obtained using maps in atlases and online with the software Google Earth (http://earth.google.com). Islands were not considered because they generally add a lot of distance in terms of latitudinal degrees, but very small area in relation to the entire country. The exception was Denmark, because a large part of that country is made up by islands, and the southernmost point of the country was located at Falster. The latitude index for each country was considered the latitude for all bird populations in that particular country regardless of the actual distribution of every species within a country. Once the latitude of the bird populations had been estimated, we calculated the distance (in degrees) from the bird population latitude to the northernmost and southernmost limits of the breeding distribution range of the species. The smaller of these two distances (L) was considered the smallest distance to the distribution limits of the species. In the few cases in which the country latitude index was more southern than the southernmost limit of the species range (herring gull 
  <span class="italic">Larus argentatus</span> in France), or more northern than the northernmost limit of the species range (reed warbler 
  <span class="italic">Acrocephalus scirpaceus</span> and golden oriole 
  <span class="italic">Oriolus oriolus</span> in Finland, yellow-legged gull 
  <span class="italic">Larus michahellis</span>, great spotted cuckoo 
  <span class="italic">Clamator glandarius</span>, cattle egret 
  <span class="italic">Bubulcus ibis</span>, southern grey shrike 
  <span class="italic">Lanius meridionalis</span>, black-eared wheatear 
  <span class="italic">Oenanthe hispanica</span>, subalpine warbler 
  <span class="italic">Sylvia cantillans</span>, and Sardinian warbler 
  <span class="italic">Sylvia melanocephala</span> in France, and woodlark 
  <span class="italic">Lullula arborea</span> and red kite 
  <span class="italic">Milvus milvus</span> in Sweden), the distance between bird population latitude and southernmost or northernmost limits of the distribution range of the species was considered to be zero. Northernmost and southernmost limits of the breeding distribution range of every species were obtained from published maps [
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">46</a>]. We also calculated the latitude of the mid-point between the northernmost and the southernmost limits of the distribution range of the species, and the distance (C) in degrees between this latitude and the bird population latitude. Marginality of a population was estimated as log
  <sub>10</sub>(C+1) - log
  <sub>10</sub>(L+1), with positive values representing marginal populations and negative values central populations. Finally, these values were transformed to ensure that marginality estimates ranged from 0 (central population) to 1 (marginal population). The transformation consisted of adding the absolute value of the most negative number and dividing by the largest value resulting from the previous addition.
