 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main result of this study was the significant relationship between latitude and population trend, once marginality and other confounding factors had been controlled statistically. Northern populations of European bird species showed more positive trends than southern populations, as expected if climate warming had an effect on population size. Our study is therefore consistent with the conclusion reached in previous studies using other approaches or investigating other taxa [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>,
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>,
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">45</a>,
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">60</a>], namely that climate change is having a non-negligible effect on population trends, and that this effect is more beneficial for northern than for southern populations. We are aware that the relationship between latitude and population trend does not necessarily imply an effect of climate warming, because any other latitude-related factor might be responsible for such an association. However, the large amount of literature suggesting an effect of climate change on animal populations (see references above and in the Introduction), together with the fact that some factors potentially affecting population trend (e.g. density-dependence or habitat fragmentation) were already taken into account, make global warming a likely candidate to explain our result.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Until now, most studies investigating the effect of global warming on population trends have focused on changes in the range of the distribution, either latitudinal or altitudinal (e.g. [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>,
  <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">61</a>]), and fewer studies have focused on changes in population size (e.g. [
  <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">62</a>,
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">63</a>]). The present study used a direct and statistically powerful approach focusing on latitudinal variation in population trends within species. This approach has not been used before, possibly because of difficulties in obtaining population size estimates for different populations of the same species. Inclusion in this study of population indices of European birds covering many species and populations was possible because (i) birds are one of the best studied classes of animals, particularly in Europe, with thousands of professional and non-professional birders surveying bird populations, (ii) international continent-wide programmes such as the Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme provide the opportunity to standardize methodologies and share resources, and (iii) the information obtained by this programme is often freely accessible. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Another important result of our study was the predicted positive relationship between population fluctuations and marginality, once the effects of latitude and other confounding factors had been controlled. Marginality was defined as the distance from the population latitude to the closest (northern or southern) limit of the breeding distribution range of the species relative to the distance to the centre of the breeding distribution range. Ecological conditions at the margin were most likely suboptimal for that particular species compared to conditions at the centre of the distribution range [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>,
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">64</a>,
  <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">65</a>]. The bird species included in this study fluctuated more widely at the edges of their distribution range and, as explained in the Introduction, the larger the fluctuation the higher the risk of extinction of a particular population. Therefore, southern and northern populations of European bird species suffered greater fluctuations than central populations because of their marginality. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to our results, northern populations of European birds experienced an increase in size, while southern populations did not experience such an increase. In addition, both southern and northern populations suffered greater fluctuations than central populations. Therefore, southern populations might be particularly vulnerable to extinction: they fluctuate greatly because they are marginal populations, but do not benefit from global warming because they are living at low latitudes for the species. These two factors, population trend and fluctuations, could even interact, because a reduction in population size may cause a further increase in population fluctuations [
  <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">66</a>,
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>] and consequently also an increase in the risk of extinction. Moreover, if local extinctions mainly occur in southern populations, such populations will experience greater fragmentation that in turn may contribute to accelerate the extinction of the remaining southern populations [
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">68</a>,
  <a rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69">69</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variations in population size may have significant genetic consequences. Nagylaky [
  <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">70</a>] and Wakeley [
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">71</a>] showed that the number of heterozygous loci under certain assumptions is a function of effective population size and mutation rate. Published estimates of effective population size only exist for a couple of the species included in our study. However, species that differ little in population fluctuations and continuously have large populations should be able to maintain greater levels of genetic variation as shown for the species included in the present study [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]. The positive relationship between genetic variation and population size implies that a long-term decline in population size will reduce the level of genetic variation that in turn will increase the risk of extinction [
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">72</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Both density-dependent effects and census methods were significantly related to temporal variation in population size. First, population trends were not only related to latitude but also to density-dependence. When populations fluctuated more markedly at low than at high densities, these high densities were probably close to carrying capacity. In these circumstances, bird populations showed more positive trends. This means that populations that increased in size might be close to carrying capacity at the end of the surveys. In contrast, the larger the population fluctuation at high compared to low densities, the further such high densities probably were from carrying capacity. These populations showed more negative trends, implying that they might have already been far from carrying capacity when surveys began, and decreased in size even more during the following years. It can be deduced from these results that populations either increasing or decreasing considerably in size were generally far from carrying capacity when surveys started. Moreover, as northern populations increased in size more than southern populations (see Results), northern populations should be closer to carrying capacity than southern populations at the end of the surveys. Second, population fluctuations were significantly related to census method, because our estimates of population fluctuations were larger in countries in which point-counts exclusively had been used to estimate population size. One possible explanation for this result is that point-count methods are more prone to observer errors than other census methods, thus giving rise to larger estimates of variation in population size. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Interestingly, temporal variation in population size always differed significantly among species (see 
  <a rid="pone-0077654-t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t002">Table 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077654.s001" href="#pone.0077654.s001">Appendix S1</a>). If populations of some species vary more markedly in size than others we can speculate that certain ecological, life-history or genetic characteristics of the species will be related to the degree of variation. Any predictions relating population fluctuations to ecology of different species are so far generally untested.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that climate change is having a substantial effect on population size of European bird species, and southern populations are suffering from large fluctuations because of marginal distribution but do not benefit from global warming. This has significant implications for conservation strategies, and southern populations of European bird species should be priority targets of conservation measures, especially species with local population differentiation hence representing unique biological diversity.</p>
