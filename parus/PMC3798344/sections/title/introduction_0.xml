 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is currently general agreement that global warming is affecting animal and plant populations in multiple ways [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>-
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>]. In temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, a northward shift in species distribution range has been detected [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>-
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>], and this shift might be due not only to positive effects of increased temperatures on northern populations of a given species, but also to negative effects on southern populations. If that was the case, the latitude of a population would strongly determine the possible effects of increased temperatures on that population. We would expect a positive relationship between population trend and latitude, with positive trends at high latitudes and negative (or less positive) trends at low latitudes. In other words, populations close to the southern limit of the distribution of a species would be suffering to a greater extend (or benefiting less) from global warming than northern populations of the same species. Moreover, both southernmost and northernmost populations are also often marginal populations, and marginality (versus centrality) of a population across the distribution range may have a strong effect on fitness-related traits (e.g. developmental stability [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>], predation rate [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>], and reproductive success [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>,
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]) and thus potentially on population size variation. It is believed that marginal populations generally face worse environmental (biotic and/or abiotic) conditions than central populations [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>,
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. In addition, marginal populations often have lower genetic variation than central populations [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>-
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>], preventing or delaying marginal populations from adapting to extreme conditions. Because southernmost populations in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere would be particularly sensitive to both global warming and marginality, assessment of effects of global warming on these populations would require teasing apart the independent effect of the two phenomena. In general, marginal populations suffer greater fluctuations in abundance than central populations [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>,
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>], and, therefore, a positive relationship between degree of fluctuation and marginality within species would be expected.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To disentangle the effects of latitude and marginality on temporal variation in population size we used European bird species as a case study. During recent years, the effects of climate change on bird species have been studied extensively, particularly in Europe. For example, we know that many bird species have experienced phenological changes paralleling the increase in temperature [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. Such climate-driven changes may be due to phenotypic plasticity [
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>] or micro-evolutionary adaptations [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. Importantly, the inability to provide appropriate phenological responses to climate changes has led to population declines in some species [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>,
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>]. Distribution ranges have also changed in a number of bird species [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>,
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>], with a northward move in agreement with predictions of habitat suitability changes due to global warming [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. In the present study we investigated long-term trends in avian breeding populations in several European countries covering a wide latitudinal range. Taking into account variation in population size in different countries for every species, we were able to detect latitude-related differences in population changes. This approach has not been used so far, and it allowed us to make statistically powerful comparisons among populations (i.e., among countries) within species. As temperature varies with latitude, effects of global warming are predicted to differ among latitudes, and we were able to test whether latitudinal differences in population size variation were as predicted while simultaneously taking into account the effects of marginality.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temporal variation in population size, and the causes and consequences of such variation, is a central topic in population biology (e.g. [
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>-
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]), with clear implications for conservation biology [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>,
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>]. Variation in any parameter is often measured as the coefficient of variation (CV), and this is also the case when estimating variation in population size. For example, we can estimate CV of population size among years. However, the CV of population size among years can be split into two different factors, in the same way as CV in the relative size of morphological traits [
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>,
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>]. If estimates of population size are regressed on years, high levels of among-year variation could arise either from large (positive or negative) slopes, from large dispersion of points around the regression line, i.e., a large standard error of the estimate (SEE), or both. These two components of variation provide qualitatively different information, and their independent effects should both be quantified. Slopes provide an estimate of population trends, with positive slopes for populations that are increasing in size, negative slopes for populations decreasing in size, and slopes close to zero when population size does not change over time. In contrast, SEE provides an estimate of population fluctuations, a factor that strongly affects the extinction risk of a population because larger fluctuations increase the probability that one of these reaches zero, i.e., extinction [
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>-
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>]. In addition, greater population fluctuations should also reduce genetic variation and hence the possibility for different species to adapt to changing environmental conditions (e. g. [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>,
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>]). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that both latitude and marginality of the breeding distribution are independently related to temporal variation in population size. In within-species comparisons, we predicted (i) more positive population trends in northern than in southern populations, i.e., a positive relationship between slope and mean population latitude; and (ii) greater population fluctuations in marginal than in central populations, i.e., a positive relationship between SEE and population marginality.</p>
