 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population latitude was significantly positively related to the slope of the relationship between population size and year, but not to CV or SEE (
  <a rid="pone-0077654-t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t002">Table 2</a>). The relationship between population latitude and slope indicates that population trends were more positive for northern than for southern populations. While northern populations generally increased in size over time (mean slope (SE) = 0.0079 (0.0032); one-sample 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-test against zero; 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>72</sub> = 2.48, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.015), southern populations did not change significantly in size during the same period (mean slope (SE) = 0.0030 (0.0037); 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>72</sub> = 0.83, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.41). In contrast, marginality of populations, i.e., whether populations were close to the latitudinal limits of distribution of the species (marginal populations) or close to the centre of that distribution (central populations), was positively and significantly related to CV, and this association was due to the relationship with SEE, while it was not significantly related to the slope (
  <a rid="pone-0077654-t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t002">Table 2</a>). Specifically, marginal populations showed larger dispersion of observations around the regression line and hence larger among-year variability than central populations. However, the degree of marginality was not significantly related to the trend of the population (

  <a rid="pone-0077654-t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t002">Table 2</a>), with both variables showing larger values when exclusively point-counts had been used to estimate population size (CV: point-counts, least squares (LS) mean (SE) = 23.90 (0.57),

  <a rid="pone-0077654-t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t002">Table 2</a>). Sampling effort was not significantly related to CV, slope or SEE (
  <a rid="pone-0077654-t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t002">Table 2</a>, but see results below when outliers were included in the analyses). Significant density-dependent effects were found for CV, mainly because of the negative relationship between density-dependence and slope (
  <a rid="pone-0077654-t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t002">Table 2</a>). Large positive slopes occurred when population indices varied more at low than at high densities, and large negative slopes when population indices varied more at high than at low densities. Fragmentation was significantly related to CV and SEE (
  <a rid="pone-0077654-t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t002">Table 2</a>), with highly fragmented habitats associated with high levels of among-year variation in population size. Finally, the number of years was significantly related to CV (
  <a rid="pone-0077654-t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0077654-t002">Table 2</a>), with populations surveyed for many years showing larger CV than populations surveyed for few years.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The analyses performed after including outliers (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077654-g001" href="#pone-0077654-g001">Figure 1</a> for visualization of outliers and Methods for further explanations) provided qualitatively identical results in relation to population latitude and marginality (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077654.s001" href="#pone.0077654.s001">Appendix S1</a>), although there were differences for other variables. First, inclusion of outliers yielded a significant relationship between slope and number of study years (beta (SE) = -0.102 (0.046), 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>1,686</sub> = 4.93, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.027). Second, the relationship between habitat fragmentation and SEE was no longer significant, a similar result to that obtained when including only species with data for at least seven or nine countries (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077654.s001" href="#pone.0077654.s001">Appendix S1</a>). Third, the slope was significantly related to sampling effort when outliers were included (beta (SE) = 0.105 (0.044),

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> We considered that the relationship between two variables was robust only when all analysed subsets of data provided qualitatively similar results, i.e., when the relationship was statistically significant in all cases. With this criterion, we found that the slope (i.e., the population trend) was only significantly related to latitude and the index of density-dependence. In contrast, SEE (i.e., population fluctuations) was significantly related to population marginality and census method. Finally, CV of population indices was significantly related to population marginality, census method, density-dependence, habitat fragmentation, and number of years surveyed. In cases in which mixed results were obtained with different subsets of data, we considered that our study did not provide support for accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis.</p>
