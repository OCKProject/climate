Although attributes of ecosystems directly of use to human societies are not the only ones worth protecting, emphasizing their services may be the most effective means of communicating risks of toxicants to the general public. However, although spatial and temporal scales of experiments to assess risk vary relatively little, actual spatial scales vary considerably, from local environments to global ecosystems. Generally, models are used to bridge these gaps in scale. In this paper, we examine ways in which toxicity test endpoints have been developed to describe effects of pollutants on essential ecosystem functions and the ways in which results are then extrapolated to scales that risk managers can use.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>p936-a</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00407-0038-a" xlink:role="936"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00407-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="936" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00407-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="937" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00407-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="938" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00407-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="939" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
