 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In those cases where species do not realise fully their potential range extension, the magnitude of the climatic change relative to the breadth of the species' climatic niche becomes important, determining the extent of the overlap between the species' future potential and realised ranges. Species for which this overlap becomes small relative to their initial range are most likely to suffer associated population reduction and may have an increased risk of extinction. Species whose future potential range is markedly smaller in extent than their present range also face the likelihood of population reduction and heightened extinction risk 
  <a rid="pone.0001439-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-Thomas1">[13]</a>, even if they are able to respond sufficiently rapidly that their realised range corresponds to their potential range. Mean overlap (
  <span class="italic">O</span>) and extent (
  <span class="italic">R</span>) of species' potential future ranges relative to their present ranges are presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001439-t001" href="#pone-0001439-t001">Table 1</a>, as are the numbers of species with potential future overlaps (
  <span class="italic">O
   <sub>0</sub>
  </span>) or range extents (
  <span class="italic">R
   <sub>0</sub>
  </span>) of zero or of less than one tenth (
  <span class="italic">O
   <sub>10</sub>
  </span>, 
  <span class="italic">R
   <sub>10</sub>
  </span>) the extent of their present ranges. Regardless of the scenario, mean overlap rarely exceeded 
  <span class="italic">ca</span>. 50% and mean future range extent 
  <span class="italic">ca</span>. 80% of the extent of the present range. Similarly, even the most moderate scenario resulted in some species with zero overlap or zero potential future range extent in Europe; in the most extreme scenarios 
  <span class="italic">ca</span>. 14% and 
  <span class="italic">ca</span>. 5% of species respectively were in these two categories. For most scenarios a larger number of species had future overlaps or range extents that are non-zero but &lt;10% of the extent of their present range.
