 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simulated general reduction in mean range extent resulted in a reduction in the simulated mean number of breeding species per grid cell (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001439-t001" href="#pone-0001439-t001">Table 1</a>), and hence a general decrease in local avian species-richness across Europe. As in previous studies of the potential impacts of climatic change 
  <a rid="pone.0001439-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-Thomas1">[13]</a>, this number was calculated in two ways, firstly assuming ‘perfect’ dispersal (
  <span class="italic">N</span>), i.e. species fully realise their potential range as simulated for a future climate scenario, and secondly assuming ‘dispersal failure’ (
  <span class="italic">N</span>′), i.e. species occupy none of the newly climatically suitable areas but fail to persist in parts of their present range that are no longer climatically suitable. The smallest impact amongst the scenarios examined, for the GFDL B2 scenario and assuming ‘perfect’ dispersal, was a 6·8% average reduction in species number breeding in a 50 km grid square, whereas the largest impact, for the ECHAM4 A2 scenario and an assumption of ‘dispersal failure’, was a 56·4% reduction.
