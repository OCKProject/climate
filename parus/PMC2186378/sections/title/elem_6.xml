  <span class="italic">Locustella naevia</span> (Grasshopper Warbler). This species is selected for this purpose because it is in many senses close to the ‘average’ of the 431 species in the ensemble. The centroids of the two simulated ranges are shown, as are the geodesic distance (
  <span class="italic">D</span>) between the two centroids, and the initial azimuth (
  <span class="italic">θ</span>) of the geodesic path from the centroid of the ‘present’ range to that of the potential future range.

   <p>(a) Simulated distribution of 
    <span class="italic">Locustella naevia</span> (Grasshopper Warbler) in Europe for the ‘present’ (1961–90) climate. Blue symbols represent grid squares simulated as suitable, yellow symbols grid squares simulated as unsuitable, and white areas of the map regions with climatic conditions unlike those anywhere where data for the species are available in the EBCC dataset 
    <a rid="pone.0001439-Hagemeijer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-Hagemeijer1">[6]</a>. The red star indicates the position of the centroid of the species' simulated range. The response surface model has a ‘high’ performance (AUC = 0·952) as assessed by its ability to describe the observed distribution as recorded in the EBCC atlas 
    <a rid="pone.0001439-Hagemeijer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-Hagemeijer1">[6]</a>. (b) Simulated potential distribution of 
    <span class="italic">Locustella naevia</span> in Europe for the HadCM3 B2 future climate scenario (2070–99). Blue and yellow symbols, and white areas of the map, as in (a). For this climate scenario the species' potential future range extent, in terms of potentially suitable grid squares, is 66% of the extent of its simulated present range. The area of overlap of the simulated future potential and present ranges is 37% of the extent of the latter. The red star indicates the position of the centroid of the species' simulated potential future range; the red star outline indicates the position of the centroid of the species' simulated range for the ‘present’ climate. The line joining these two stars, length 
    <span class="italic">D</span> (808 km), represents the geodesic path between the two centroids. Also plotted is a line indicating the direction of north (N) from the centroid of the species' simulated range for the ‘present’ climate; the angle 
    <span class="italic">θ</span> (10·6°) between north and the geodesic path between the two centroids is the initial azimuth of the geodesic path.

   <p>The distance and direction of each species' potential range centroid displacement (see 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001439-g001" href="#pone-0001439-g001">Figure 1</a>) is illustrated for the six potential future climate scenarios, each point in each plot representing an individual species. The radial distance from the centre of the plot at which a point is located indicates the geodesic distance (
    <span class="italic">D</span>) between the centroids of its simulated present and potential future ranges; the angular position of a point indicates the initial azimuth (
    <span class="italic">θ</span>) of the geodesic path between the present and potential future range centroids as a bearing relative to North (0°). The same logarithmic scale is used to plot radial distances in all six plots; the centre point of each plot represents a geodesic distance of 20 km, whilst their circumferences correspond to a distance of 3750 km.

  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001439-t001" href="#pone-0001439-t001">Table 1</a> presents the mean and range of the geodesic distances (
  <span class="italic">D</span>) and the mean initial azimuth (
  <span class="italic">θ</span>) for all species. The mean geodesic distance ranged from 258 to 882 km, the range for individual species and across all future scenarios being much greater (20–3578 km). The mean initial azimuth ranged from 341° (NNW) to 45° (NE), although as 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001439-g002" href="#pone-0001439-g002">Figure 2</a> illustrates this too varied considerably amongst species. 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001439-t001" href="#pone-0001439-t001">Table 1</a> also presents the mean and range of the rates of range boundary extension (
  <span class="italic">V</span>) required to realise potential range changes for each of the six scenarios. The mean rate ranged from 3·61 to 6·62 km yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, with extreme values for individual species and scenarios of 0·37 and 24·85 km yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Several types of evidence can be used to estimate rates at which species are likely to achieve extensions of their range boundaries. Historical distribution data allow species' range boundary changes of the past few decades, interpreted as responses to recent climatic change, to be estimated. In a global study, average rates of 0·61±0·24 km yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> were reported across a range of taxa 
  <a rid="pone.0001439-Parmesan2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-Parmesan2">[4]</a>, although a more recent study in the United Kingdom that examined a wider range of taxonomic groups reported faster mean rates of range extension, especially for less well recorded grid squares, of 1·37 to 2·48 km yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>
  <a rid="pone.0001439-Hickling1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-Hickling1">[34]</a>. Despite the relative rapidity of these mean range extensions, there is evidence that many species have not fully realised potential range boundary extensions because other factors, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, are acting to limit both their population size and the effectiveness of their dispersal 
  <a rid="pone.0001439-Warren1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-Warren1">[12]</a>. Palaeoecological evidence from the late Quaternary shows that terrestrial organisms from many taxonomic groups extended their ranges in response to the rapid climatic changes at the transition from the last glacial stage to the Holocene, about 11,500 years ago. These data can also be used to estimate rates of range boundary extension, although systematic estimates are restricted principally to higher plants 
  <a rid="pone.0001439-Huntley5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-Huntley5">[35]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0001439-Davis2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-Davis2">[36]</a>. Rates of 0·2 to 2·0 km yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> have been reported for both Europe 
  <a rid="pone.0001439-Huntley5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-Huntley5">[35]</a> and eastern North America 
  <a rid="pone.0001439-Davis2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-Davis2">[36]</a>, although recent molecular genetic evidence suggests that for at least some taxa in the latter region these rates are likely to be over-estimates 
  <a rid="pone.0001439-McLachlan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-McLachlan1">[37]</a>. Although molecular genetic evidence 
  <a rid="pone.0001439-Mila1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-Mila1">[38]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0001439-Ruegg1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-Ruegg1">[39]</a> shows that birds exhibited similar magnitudes of late-Quaternary range extension, too few records of avian fossils are available to allow direct estimates of the rates at which their range boundary extensions were achieved. A third line of evidence relates to range boundary extensions achieved by invasive introduced species and by the very few species that have extended their natural range by colonising previously unoccupied geographical regions during historical times (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Streptopelia decaocto</span> (Collared Dove) that has expanded across Europe from Turkey since 
  <span class="italic">ca</span>. 1900). Although the mean rate of 43·2 km yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> reported for seven studies of such species 
  <a rid="pone.0001439-VandenBosch1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0001439-VandenBosch1">[40]</a> is much more rapid than mean rates estimated from other lines of evidence, this is not unexpected given that these species are by definition characterised by their rapidly invasive behaviour. Evidence from past range changes thus indicates that most species, apart from those of an invasive character, are likely to extend their range boundaries at rates little more than half that required to realise their potential range boundary extension even for the most modest of the climatic change scenarios examined (GFDL B2). For the other scenarios examined, many species' range boundary extension rates are likely to be at least an order of magnitude less than those required to realise potential range changes. It thus must be expected that many species will fail to realise fully their potential future ranges within the present century. Although a small minority of native species may prove to have the characteristics required for invasive behaviour, and thus fully realise their potential range changes, it is not possible on the basis of our present knowledge and understanding to predict with any confidence which they may be.
