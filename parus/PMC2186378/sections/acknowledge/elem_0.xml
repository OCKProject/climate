  <span class="bold">Funding: </span>The research work reported was supported in part by a grant from the UK Natural Environment Research Council and in part by a contract from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). During the preparation of the manuscript Prof. Brian Huntley was in receipt of financial support from a Royal Society - Wolfson Foundation ‘Research Merit Award’. The post of Prof. Rhys E. Green at Cambridge University also is funded by the RSPB. Nonetheless, the sponsors have played no direct role in the design or conduct of the study, nor in the interpretation of the data or the preparation, review or approval of the manuscript. Data relating to the European breeding distributions of birds were collected by the European Bird Census Council (EBCC), who made those data available to us to use in our work. The EBCC played no role in the research work nor in the preparation of this paper.
