 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA barcoding employs sequences from a short standardized gene region to identify species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B1" href="#B1">1</a>]. The mitochondrial gene cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">c </span>oxidase I (COI) has been firmly established as the core barcode region for animals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>] and its performance has been evaluated in birds from several regions, including North America [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B3" href="#B3">3</a>], Brazil [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B4" href="#B4">4</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B5" href="#B5">5</a>], Argentina [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>], and Korea [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">7</a>]. While most bird species are readily identifiable through morphological traits [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>], their well-developed taxonomy makes them a valuable group to test the efficacy of barcoding. Additionally, avian taxonomy is not immune to change, and in recent decades DNA evidence has clarified many species boundaries. Broad surveys, such as DNA barcoding, can expedite this process by quickly spotlighting species that merit further taxonomic investigation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B9" href="#B9">9</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B11" href="#B11">11</a>]. This capacity is illustrated by several recently described species that were earlier revealed as divergent lineages during barcode surveys [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">12</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the avian diversity of the Palearctic is relatively depauperate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" href="#B15">15</a>] and its taxonomy was stable for decades, modern molecular techniques have spurred the recognition of overlooked species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B16" href="#B16">16</a>]. These new species were often hidden within morphologically cryptic assemblages, which impeded their discovery [e.g. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B17" href="#B17">17</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B18" href="#B18">18</a>]]. In other cases, biological species hypotheses could not be tested because divergent populations had allopatric distributions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">19</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">21</a>]. Molecular analyses continue to illuminate the phylogeographic structure of birds in this region [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B20" href="#B20">20</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">22</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>]. A recent barcoding survey of Scandinavian birds by Johnsen 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>] revealed high species resolution plus a few divergent lineages, including some between European and North American populations of trans-Atlantic species. The Atlantic Ocean serves as a relatively impermeable barrier to dispersal for non-pelagic birds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" href="#B15">15</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B30" href="#B30">30</a>], but the situation is very different in the eastern Palearctic, where intercontinental exchange across the Bering Strait is more frequent [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">19</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">24</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B31" href="#B31">31</a>]. Johnsen 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>] also highlighted sequence divergences within a few species that failed to correspond to known subspecies or logical geographical patterns - a pattern not observed in a comprehensive survey of Nearctic birds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B3" href="#B3">3</a>]. To determine if this pattern is recurrent, to highlight further cases of cryptic divergences, and to explore general patterns in sequence divergence, we advance COI barcode coverage in this study to include the breeding birds of the eastern Palearctic region, including Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the growth of DNA barcode libraries, no consensus has yet emerged on the best method to analyze DNA barcode data [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B32" href="#B32">32</a>]. Some of the original tools proposed to delimit species using COI sequences, such as neighbour-joining profiles [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">33</a>] and distance thresholds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>], have been criticized by several authors for not realistically addressing the complexity of species boundaries [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B38" href="#B38">38</a>]. More recent tools have gained complexity, incorporating coalescent theory and more elaborate statistical methods, though at the cost of computational time and power [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B38" href="#B38">38</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B40" href="#B40">40</a>]. The situation is further complicated by the dual purposes proposed for barcoding: species identification and species discovery [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B41" href="#B41">41</a>]. The majority of new generation tools require pre-defined species designations and consequently cannot be used to identify divergent genetic lineages within known groups. Although the use of DNA barcodes to "discover" species is contentious, it is generally accepted that barcode data can be used to flag potentially distinct taxa for further hypothesis testing [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">42</a>]. Because the taxonomy of Holarctic birds is relatively mature [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>], we take this opportunity to compare and contrast some of the more commonly used analytical methods.
