  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Divergence levels between closely related species were highly variable, ranging from approximately 0-16%; however, some of these values may be inflated for under-sampled genera and families. Recent studies have detached rate variation in the mitochondrial genome from factors such as population size, body size, and other life-history traits [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B52" href="#B52">52</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B54" href="#B54">54</a>]. While some authors contend that rate variation in birds is highly irregular [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B53" href="#B53">53</a>], a recent thorough review demonstrated relatively minor variation and upheld the occurrence of clock-like evolution [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B55" href="#B55">55</a>]. Consequently, we attribute the limited divergence between some sister species to recent speciation events. Studies documenting recent and rapid diversifications often address subspecific variants rather than full species [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B56" href="#B56">56</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B57" href="#B57">57</a>]. Still, low sequence divergence does not necessarily indicate that species should be synonymised [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B58" href="#B58">58</a>]. Low sequence divergence is particularly common in superspecies complexes, including those divided between continents, but the species within them remain valid units for both ecological studies and conservation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four species pairs and the large white-headed gulls included in this study featured virtually no variation for COI and could not be distinguished using any of the approaches employed in this study. Low divergence in mitochondrial markers had been previously demonstrated in each of these cases. Lumping has been considered for some, including 
   <span class="italic">Carduelis flammea/hornemanni </span>[
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B59" href="#B59">59</a>] and the recently split 
   <span class="italic">Gallinago gallinago/delicata </span>[
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>], but more evidence is required. The cause of shared mitochondrial haplotypes between 
   <span class="italic">Cuculus canorus </span>and 
   <span class="italic">C. optatus </span>has not been resolved (hybrids have never been documented [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B60" href="#B60">60</a>]), but their taxonomic distinction has been asserted based on song differences [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B61" href="#B61">61</a>]. 
   <span class="italic">Emberiza citrinella </span>and 
   <span class="italic">E. leucocephalos </span>are exceptionally interesting in that they are the most phenotypically distinct of these pairs and a survey of nuclear markers revealed genetic divergence [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B62" href="#B62">62</a>]. They are known to hybridize extensively and introgression is a likely explanation [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B62" href="#B62">62</a>]. Species boundaries in the large white-headed gulls may have also been confused by contemporary hybridization, though shallow history and slowed rates of evolution have also been implicated [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B63" href="#B63">63</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B64" href="#B64">64</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nearly one tenth of the species (7.5%) analyzed in this study contained divergent mitochondrial lineages, with divergences averaging 3.6%. While divergence at a single mitochondrial gene alone is insufficient evidence to define new species boundaries, it is cause for new hypothesis testing. Several recently split species that are morphologically similar to their nearest relative, such as the swallow 
   <span class="italic">Riparia diluta </span>and the warbler 
   <span class="italic">Locustella amnicola</span>, represent taxa that barcodes would flag for closer scrutiny. Distributions of most of the divergent lineages in this study conform to one of four previously documented phylogeographic trends (summarized in Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">2</a>): a unique lineage in the Caucasus region [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B65" href="#B65">65</a>]; a unique lineage in the Sakhalin region [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B66" href="#B66">66</a>]; divergent lineages divided into eastern and western populations [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B25" href="#B25">25</a>]; divergent lineages on either side of the Bering Strait [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">19</a>]. Species with multiple lineages can display more than one of these patterns. A few lineages appear to be parapatric, which could indicate areas of overlap or hybrid zones [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B67" href="#B67">67</a>]. Past climate change and its effect on historical habitat distribution is likely responsible for shaping patterns of genetic divergence in modern populations, but whether or not these populations were divided by the same historical events is difficult to determine without dating divergence times. While the COI sequences mostly appear to be evolving in a clocklike fashion, dating is risky given the absence of adequate calibration points and the reliance on various assumptions [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">24</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B55" href="#B55">55</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most species exhibited surprisingly limited variation between Old World and New World populations. Of the approximately 140 species with Holarctic distributions, 43% are represented in this study. Only 11 of these 61 species (18%) possessed intraspecific divergences great enough to signal likely species-level differences by either the NJ or MOTU method. The Bering Sea has served a variable but clear role as a barrier to gene flow for birds, particularly non-marine species. Several trans-Beringian species have already been split in recent years, due partly to molecular evidence (e.g. 
   <span class="italic">Brachyramphus marmoratus/B. perdix </span>[
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">21</a>], 
   <span class="italic">Picoides tridactylus/P. dorsalis </span>[
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">19</a>], 
   <span class="italic">Pica pica/P. hudsoni </span>[
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B68" href="#B68">68</a>]). Still, caution must be exercised when identifying species boundaries between allopatric populations. For example, one of the Palearctic 
   <span class="italic">Lanius excubitor </span>specimens from this study appears to belong to the North American clade, suggesting that some modern exchange might occur between the continents. Though it is more common for Palearctic species to invade the Nearctic, the reverse pattern has also been observed [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B69" href="#B69">69</a>]. Correct interpretation of this result requires further study with additional specimens.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This survey has identified a number of species that demand further taxonomic scrutiny (see Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">2</a>). It is likely that some of the divergent lineages identified here represent distinct species. Of course, genetic distances do not always correspond to species limits [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B69" href="#B69">69</a>]. Alternative explanations for the divergent lineages observed include historical phylogeographic isolation, female-restricted dispersal, or male-biased gene flow [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>]. The common phylogeographic patterns observed in many of the divergent lineages support the idea of historical isolation. Areas of secondary contact must be further studied to evaluate the gene flow between lineages [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B70" href="#B70">70</a>]. In a few exceptional cases genetic lineages appear largely sympatric, including within 
   <span class="italic">Alauda arvensis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Delichon dasypus</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Phoenicurus phoenicurus</span>. Nuclear copies of mitochondrial sequences (numts) are an unlikely explanation given the absence of stop codons and heterozygous peaks. 
   <span class="italic">Phoenicurus phoenicurus </span>was also noted by Johnsen 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>], who attributed the aberrant phylogeographic pattern to admixture of historically separated lineages. This situation is paradoxical compared to suspected introgressed genomes used to explain limited divergence in sister species. Selective sweeps are frequently invoked to explain the limited variation observed in mitochondrial markers [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B71" href="#B71">71</a>], which raises the question of how two mtDNA lineages manage to persist in one species but not another. Ongoing research of species limits and evolutionary histories is clearly still necessary in the Palearctic.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Methods comparison</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MOTU assignment program used in this study was originally developed for meiofauna with few morphological characters [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B47" href="#B47">47</a>]. Applying it to a group with better-established taxonomy allows more conclusive tests of its performance. Our results indicated a type II error rate of 10.9%, but this is inflated by the diversity of named white-headed gull species (
   <span class="italic">Larus spp</span>.); with these species eliminated, error is reduced to 8.8%. At this point, we don't consider type I errors a fault of this method since these cases are biologically interesting, do not necessarily impair identification, and may represent over-looked species [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>]. The major drawback to the program in its current form is the difficulty in associating any level of statistical support with species assignments, which may differ slightly depending on the input order of sequences. Although the program does allow a random re-sampling scheme, the output is not summarized, making statistical inference on the stability of taxonomic units virtually impossible. The major impediment now for biologists applying this method to microscopic invertebrates still lies in determining an operational threshold.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of a distance-based threshold technique has been a major point of contention in the DNA barcoding endeavour [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">37</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B72" href="#B72">72</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B73" href="#B73">73</a>]. While COI variation represents a product of evolution, an arbitrary cut-off value does not reflect what is known about the evolutionary processes responsible for this variation. The threshold approach depends on the existence of a gap between levels of intraspecific variation and interspecific divergence, which opponents argue does not exist. Early success in identifying a "barcoding gap" in North American birds was attributed to insufficient sampling of closely related species [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">37</a>]. We found the original "10× rule" proposed by Hebert et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>] to be too conservative to recognize recently diverged species and opted for a more liberal threshold of 1.6%. While this value was more effective at species identification, some sister species exhibited little or no variation, which eliminates the possibility of identifying a gap. However, invalidating the use of distance-based methods based on the failure of thresholds might be going too far. Identifying the nearest matches to a query sequence is still useful, even if a conclusive assignment is not provided [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B74" href="#B74">74</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The development of an NJ profile for identification depends on the coalescence of species and not an arbitrary level of divergence [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B36" href="#B36">36</a>]; in theory, species that failed recognition via the threshold approach may still be recognized. However, we found that the same species were typically problematic for both approaches (see Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>). This is not surprising: high bootstrap support is unlikely when a slight aberration in the data would alter the results [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B75" href="#B75">75</a>], which is the case when sequences are highly similar. Critics have argued that the bootstrap test for monophyly is simply too conservative and incorrectly rejects monophyly in too many cases [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B76" href="#B76">76</a>]. This is apparent from the 4% of species that appear monophyletic but with limited support. Alternative forms of statistical support based on coalescent theory suggest that increased sampling decreases the risk of monophyly by chance, which would support the reality of these patterns despite low bootstrap values [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B77" href="#B77">77</a>]. A modified NJ algorithm with non-parametric bootstrapping has been proposed to offer fast barcode-based identifications, but success still depends on the completeness of the reference database and weakly divergent species remain problematic [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B78" href="#B78">78</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The character-based method was effective, but did not feature the same scalability as the previous two methods. We found that the CAOS system was severely constrained by limits on the number of species that could be included for rule generation. More thorough benchmarking is necessary to determine the upper limits of the program, but at this point in time they are unclear. We also found that comprehensive sampling for each taxon is vital for accurate rules that account for intraspecific polymorphisms. When operating with smaller sets of taxa, the programs were successful in both identifying diagnostic characters and in subsequently identifying new sequences to species. However, we did find P-Elf to be highly susceptible to erroneous identifications for unrepresented species, counter to previous claims [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B79" href="#B79">79</a>]. When using smaller datasets, sequences introduced from novel taxa were typically given a species level identification, even when those taxa derived from a different order (
   <span class="italic">data not shown</span>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both distance-based and clustering-based methods appear to share the same computational strengths, handling even large datasets quickly. However, both methods are also impaired by the same issues: limited divergence between sister taxa. The results of the character-based method appear to complement the former two methods. While it is precise and able to detect minor differences in closely related taxa [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B80" href="#B80">80</a>], it is unable to handle large numbers of sequences. It is also susceptible to errors when the appropriate taxa have not been comprehensively sampled. When it comes to species identification, we propose that the best method might actually be a multi-tiered approach, where an initial method is used to narrow the identification to a select group of taxa and an alternate method is used to differentiate similar taxa. Similarly, Munch 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B78" href="#B78">78</a>] recommend incorporating methods that model population level variation to distinguish between closely allied species. For cases of limited divergence, sampling a longer stretch of COI or even alternative genes would increase support for identifications.
