 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MOTU assignment program used in this study was originally developed for meiofauna with few morphological characters [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B47" href="#B47">47</a>]. Applying it to a group with better-established taxonomy allows more conclusive tests of its performance. Our results indicated a type II error rate of 10.9%, but this is inflated by the diversity of named white-headed gull species (
  <span class="italic">Larus spp</span>.); with these species eliminated, error is reduced to 8.8%. At this point, we don't consider type I errors a fault of this method since these cases are biologically interesting, do not necessarily impair identification, and may represent over-looked species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>]. The major drawback to the program in its current form is the difficulty in associating any level of statistical support with species assignments, which may differ slightly depending on the input order of sequences. Although the program does allow a random re-sampling scheme, the output is not summarized, making statistical inference on the stability of taxonomic units virtually impossible. The major impediment now for biologists applying this method to microscopic invertebrates still lies in determining an operational threshold.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of a distance-based threshold technique has been a major point of contention in the DNA barcoding endeavour [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">37</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B72" href="#B72">72</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B73" href="#B73">73</a>]. While COI variation represents a product of evolution, an arbitrary cut-off value does not reflect what is known about the evolutionary processes responsible for this variation. The threshold approach depends on the existence of a gap between levels of intraspecific variation and interspecific divergence, which opponents argue does not exist. Early success in identifying a "barcoding gap" in North American birds was attributed to insufficient sampling of closely related species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">37</a>]. We found the original "10Ã— rule" proposed by Hebert et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>] to be too conservative to recognize recently diverged species and opted for a more liberal threshold of 1.6%. While this value was more effective at species identification, some sister species exhibited little or no variation, which eliminates the possibility of identifying a gap. However, invalidating the use of distance-based methods based on the failure of thresholds might be going too far. Identifying the nearest matches to a query sequence is still useful, even if a conclusive assignment is not provided [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B74" href="#B74">74</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The development of an NJ profile for identification depends on the coalescence of species and not an arbitrary level of divergence [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B36" href="#B36">36</a>]; in theory, species that failed recognition via the threshold approach may still be recognized. However, we found that the same species were typically problematic for both approaches (see Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>). This is not surprising: high bootstrap support is unlikely when a slight aberration in the data would alter the results [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B75" href="#B75">75</a>], which is the case when sequences are highly similar. Critics have argued that the bootstrap test for monophyly is simply too conservative and incorrectly rejects monophyly in too many cases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B76" href="#B76">76</a>]. This is apparent from the 4% of species that appear monophyletic but with limited support. Alternative forms of statistical support based on coalescent theory suggest that increased sampling decreases the risk of monophyly by chance, which would support the reality of these patterns despite low bootstrap values [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B77" href="#B77">77</a>]. A modified NJ algorithm with non-parametric bootstrapping has been proposed to offer fast barcode-based identifications, but success still depends on the completeness of the reference database and weakly divergent species remain problematic [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B78" href="#B78">78</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The character-based method was effective, but did not feature the same scalability as the previous two methods. We found that the CAOS system was severely constrained by limits on the number of species that could be included for rule generation. More thorough benchmarking is necessary to determine the upper limits of the program, but at this point in time they are unclear. We also found that comprehensive sampling for each taxon is vital for accurate rules that account for intraspecific polymorphisms. When operating with smaller sets of taxa, the programs were successful in both identifying diagnostic characters and in subsequently identifying new sequences to species. However, we did find P-Elf to be highly susceptible to erroneous identifications for unrepresented species, counter to previous claims [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B79" href="#B79">79</a>]. When using smaller datasets, sequences introduced from novel taxa were typically given a species level identification, even when those taxa derived from a different order (
  <span class="italic">data not shown</span>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both distance-based and clustering-based methods appear to share the same computational strengths, handling even large datasets quickly. However, both methods are also impaired by the same issues: limited divergence between sister taxa. The results of the character-based method appear to complement the former two methods. While it is precise and able to detect minor differences in closely related taxa [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B80" href="#B80">80</a>], it is unable to handle large numbers of sequences. It is also susceptible to errors when the appropriate taxa have not been comprehensively sampled. When it comes to species identification, we propose that the best method might actually be a multi-tiered approach, where an initial method is used to narrow the identification to a select group of taxa and an alternate method is used to differentiate similar taxa. Similarly, Munch 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B78" href="#B78">78</a>] recommend incorporating methods that model population level variation to distinguish between closely allied species. For cases of limited divergence, sampling a longer stretch of COI or even alternative genes would increase support for identifications.
