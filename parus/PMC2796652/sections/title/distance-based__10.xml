 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MOTU analysis identified 570 clusters, or taxonomic units, versus the 559 recognized by traditional taxonomy. The similarity of these numbers disguises discrepancies in species assignment. Poor resolution occurred in 22 groups representing 61 species (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>). These lumped taxa, as with the NJ clustering method, were mostly limited to pairs of species, save for two triplets (
  <span class="italic">Somateria spp</span>. and 
  <span class="italic">Turdus spp</span>.) and thirteen large white-headed gulls (
  <span class="italic">Larus canus, L. delawarensis, L. marinus</span>, and the aforementioned members of the Herring gull complex). Divergent groups were recognized in 42 species (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">2</a>); 95% of these overlapped with those recognized via NJ. Most were divided into two clusters, though three or more clusters were detected in five species. In two of the paraphyletic species (
  <span class="italic">Motacilla flava, Lanius collurio</span>), one lineage was lumped with a closely related species while the other lineage was divergent.
