We found a negative effect of temperature and a positive effect of female body mass on DEE but no evidence for differences in DEE between early and late laying females.

In many insectivorous species, for example, reproductive success declines over the course of the breeding season (e.g. Perrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1970</xref>; Verhulst and Tinbergen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1991</xref>; Verhulst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1995</xref>). Earlier broods have more fledglings with a higher recruitment rate due to their higher fledging mass and an effect of date per se (Tinbergen and Boerlijst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1990</xref>; Verboven and Visser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1998</xref>; Visser and Verboven <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1999</xref>). In some cases (e.g. great tits, <italic>Parus major</italic>, in The Netherlands), selection for early breeding has intensified over the past few decades because of an increasing mismatch between different trophic levels as a result of climate change (Visser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1998</xref>). However, considerable among-individual variation appears to be maintained within populations, despite consistent patterns of directional and/or stabilizing selection, highlighting the need to understand proximate and ultimate factors responsible for generating and maintaining these differences among individuals.</p><p>The classical explanation for differences in timing of breeding is that variation in the timing of local food availability during the nestling phase exists and as a consequence birds adapt their timing of reproduction to this local timing of food availability (Rowan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1926</xref>; Lack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1968</xref>; Daan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1989</xref>). Differences in the mean breeding date of populations might thus reflect adaptive evolutionary divergence, where early breeding occurs in places where food peaks in the nestling phase are earliest, while variation within populations could reflect a combination of genetic differences and adaptive plasticity (e.g. where individuals occupying different territories adjust their breeding time to match local food peaks).</p><p>An alternative explanation for adaptive variation in timing of breeding is that laying dates (date when the first egg of a clutch is laid) are affected by food conditions in the period <italic>before</italic> egg laying. Egg laying is energetically costly as shown by increased metabolic rates in egg laying females (Walsberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1983</xref>; Nilsson and Raberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2001</xref>; Vezina and Williams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2002</xref>). In order to match the timing of maximum food requirements (late in the nestling period; Moreno et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1995</xref>; Verhulst and Tinbergen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1997</xref>) with the timing of maximum food availability (caterpillar food peak; Visser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2006</xref>), eggs have to be laid up to 5&#x000a0;weeks in advance of the food peak. Thus, eggs are laid in cold weather conditions under which foraging efficiency is low (Avery and Krebs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1984</xref>) and energetic costs are high (Stevenson and Bryant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2000</xref>). For a long time, it was thought that limitation of resources set the earliest possible laying date within a year, and that birds did not lay earlier simply because they were unable to obtain enough resources (Perrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1970</xref>). However, this resource limitation hypothesis could also be seen as a trade-off between costs and benefits. Early laying potentially allows for a better match with the food peak for the nestlings (resulting in nestlings of good condition which are more likely to recruit), but producing eggs under harsh conditions early in the season can result in an increase in energetic costs (direct costs) which can have negative effects on current and future reproductive success (indirect costs). Fitness costs of increased work load have been studied by Monaghan et al<italic>.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1998</xref>), who showed that female lesser black-backed gulls (<italic>Larus fuscus</italic>) which had experimentally increased costs during egg laying (by producing more eggs) had reduced offspring rearing capacity in the nestling stage, resulting in reduced fledgling body mass. Visser and Lessells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2001</xref>) showed that experimentally increasing costs of reproduction in 1&#x000a0;year affected the timing of breeding the following year&#x02014;female great tits with increased costs started egg laying later in the year after manipulation. Survival of females also decreased with increasing costs sustained during the breeding cycle (Visser and Lessells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2001</xref>), at the expense of future reproductive success. Therefore, it may be adaptive for some females to lay her eggs later than what would be best for the match between chicks&#x02019; needs and food conditions during chick feeding in order to increase chances of future reproductive success (Visser et al., submitted). As income breeders, the energetic expenditure of gathering enough food for egg production by a female great tit can vary depending on local food availability before and during egg laying. So, under this hypothesis, differences in laying dates can result from differences in the timing or abundance of food availability on the territory level in the period before egg laying. Alternatively, differences in laying date may arise if there are among female differences in the energetic expenditure necessary to produce an egg, perhaps due to intrinsic differences in female quality.</p><p>We investigated whether there is variation among females in their daily energetic expenditure (DEE; measured using the doubly labelled water technique; Speakman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1997</xref>) during egg production. A difference in DEE between females indicates that something in their environment (ability to obtain resources at lower energetic costs) or their physiology (ability to produce eggs at lower energetic cost) differs. As environmental conditions improve over the season (and assuming that the environmental conditions are equal for all females), those females who are able to produce eggs at low costs will be able to lay already under poorer environmental conditions, and thus will breed earlier. Therefore, when comparing early and late breeding females on the same day, we predicted that early laying females have a lower DEE than later laying females.</p><p>Comparing DEE of early and late breeding females is difficult, since factors affecting DEE (e.g. weather conditions and food availability) change over the course of the season and from day to day. We compared DEE of females with different first egg laying dates on the same day, and thus avoid day to day variation in conditions, by making use of the overlap in their egg laying period (the great tit&#x02019;s laying period is around 8&#x000a0;days depending on the clutch size; 1 egg per day, average clutch size ~9 eggs). We compared DEE late in the laying sequence of early females with DEE of late females early in their laying sequence during their overlapping laying period. By comparing within single days, we did not need to correct for the effects of temperature and food availability. We also tested the assumption that there are no systematic differences in DEE at different times during the egg laying period by measuring DEE of a number of females twice during egg laying.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In 2008 and 2009, DEE of 78 female great tits in two nearby study areas (20&#x000a0;km apart) was measured during egg laying (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); 19 females (2008) from the Oosterhout population (51&#x000b0;52&#x02032;22&#x02033;N, 5&#x000b0;50&#x02032;22&#x02033;E) and 59 females (2008, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;50; 2009, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9) from the Hoge Veluwe population (52&#x000b0;02&#x02032;07&#x02033;N, 5&#x000b0;51&#x02032;32&#x02033;E).

The Oosterhout study site is an isolated deciduous forest dominated by oak trees (11&#x000a0;ha) along a residential area on rich clay soils near the river Waal with 150 nest boxes. Average first egg laying dates of the Oosterhout population are 3.4&#x000a0;days earlier compared to the Hoge Veluwe population (range &#x02212;4&#x02013;15.4; 5.8&#x000a0;days earlier in 2008; M.E.V., unpublished data).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Measuring daily energy expenditure</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Doubly labelled water technique using eggs as samples</title><p>The double labelled water technique enables us to measure DEE in free-living animals by measuring elimination rates of <sup>2</sup>H and <sup>18</sup>O which are enriched in the body water of the animal through injection (Speakman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1997</xref>; see below). Instead of measuring elimination rates of <sup>2</sup>H and <sup>18</sup>O isotopes in blood samples (as is usually done), we measured elimination rates in the albumen of the eggs produced (as was done by Ward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1996</xref>; Stevenson and Bryant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2000</xref>). This avoided recapture and handling stress in a period during which disturbance leads to high desertion rates (Kania <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1989</xref>). The period over which DEE is measured using this method depends on the exact timing after which water molecules can not freely move between the females&#x02019; body water pool and the water in the egg (i.e. the timing of which the egg shell is produced, separating the female body water pool from the water in the egg). Ward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1996</xref>) studied the relationship between isotope concentrations in the albumen and blood for barn swallows (<italic>Hirundo rustica</italic>) and found that the average time of the day at which the water pools of female and egg separate was around 2245&#x000a0;hours. Although this timing is not known in great tits, it is the timing of separation <italic>within</italic> a female over successive eggs which is important. No evidence exist that this timing differs between successive eggs <italic>within</italic> a female&#x02019;s laying sequence. Values of DEE found in this study are comparable to DEE values during egg laying found by Stevenson and Bryant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2000</xref>) and are about 2.5 times BMR, which was calculated with equation&#x000a0;5.1 in Kendeigh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1977</xref>) for the average body mass of a female great tit of our dataset (19.6&#x000a0;g), which falls well within the range of DEE/BMR-ratios found for this and other species (King <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1974</xref>; Daan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1990</xref>; Peterson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1990</xref>) in other parts of the breeding season.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Field methods</title><p>Nest boxes were checked twice a week from the beginning of April to monitor nest building. Once the bottom of the box was covered with nest material, nests were checked daily to determine exact laying dates. Eggs were numbered on the day they were laid. Female great tits were caught when leaving the nest box early in the morning, soon after egg laying using temporarily placed &#x02018;box nets&#x02019; (te Marvelde et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011a</xref>). Immediately after catching, each female was injected intraperitoneally with 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l DLW using a 0.3-ml syringe with a 0.33&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;12&#x000a0;mm needle. After injecting, the female was weighed to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;g and then released (usually within 10&#x000a0;min after catching). Early females were caught and injected with DLW on the morning they laid their sixth egg (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;25), whereas late females were injected in the morning they laid their second egg (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;18). The day after the injection, the third egg of a late and the seventh egg of an earlier female were collected. The next day, we collected the fourth and the eighth egg of those females. Because we can only capture the female the morning after we detect the first egg, the earliest measurement of DEE is the 24&#x000a0;h between the production of the third and the fourth egg. For the early females, we chose the eighth egg as a last sample since not all females produce more than eight eggs. All eggs taken as samples were replaced immediately by unbrooded eggs from a nearby study site to prevent the production of replacement eggs.</p><p>About 12&#x000a0;h after collection, the length, width and mass of the eggs were measured and the yolk and the albumen were separated and weighed to the nearest mg in the laboratory. The albumen was homogenised by hand and three samples of ~15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l were transferred to non-heparinised 25-&#x003bc;l capillaries which were flame-sealed immediately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Measuring isotope ratios in the samples</title><p>Isotopes were analysed at the Centre for Isotope Research (Groningen, The Netherlands) using methods described in detail elsewhere (Visser and Schekkerman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1999</xref>; Visser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2000</xref>; Van Trigt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>).

The rightmost term is a correction to the simple proportionality between TBW, decay rates difference and <italic>r</italic>CO<sub>2</sub>, which is caused by isotope fractionation effects. The coefficient of this term depends on the assumptions regarding the fraction of water loss through breath. Here, we follow Speakman&#x02019;s assumption that this fraction is 25%. This assumption has been found to be the most appropriate (Visser and Schekkerman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1999</xref>; Van Trigt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>). TBW depends on TBW% and body mass. TBW% can be estimated when a sample is taken 1&#x000a0;h after injection of the DLW. We were not able to estimate TBW% since our first sample is taken about 20&#x000a0;h after injection. We assume a constant TBW percentage of 66% based on dried great tits (Mertens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1987</xref>). We weighed the female immediately after injection of the DLW and do not have body mass at the sampling times represented by each egg. Since the TBW changes during egg laying (the production of the egg increases body mass, which drops again when the egg is laid), we used the average pool size as suggested by Lifson and McClintock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1966</xref>) by averaging the weight of the female with and without the egg of the final sample. An energy equivalent of 27.8&#x000a0;kJ per litre CO<sub>2</sub> produced was used to transform CO<sub>2</sub> production into energy expenditure per hour after which it is multiplied by 24 to get daily energy expenditure.</p><p>An important assumption in the comparison between early and late females is that no consistent differences in DEE exist within females during the egg laying sequence.

Since the timing of separation of the egg from the female TBW is largely unknown (but falls between ~1900 and 0600&#x000a0;hours), we tested average temperatures over three different 24-h periods (1900&#x02013;1900, 0000&#x02013;0000 and 0600&#x02013;0600&#x000a0;hours).

Although no clear differences in DEE existed between the females tested on different dates (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>B), in a linear mixed model where we substituted temperature for date, we found a temperature effect on DEE, similar to that in the full dataset.

On average, earlier females will therefore spend more energy during egg laying due to the seasonal trend of increasing temperatures in spring. However, we found no difference in energy expenditure over a 24-h period during egg laying between early and late females measured on the same day, under the same weather conditions. The hypothesis that variation in laying date could be explained by differences in the relationship of temperature with energetic expenditure during egg laying between early and late birds was thus not confirmed.</p><p>To compare early with late females, we made use of the overlapping nature of egg laying periods. In our case, the difference in laying date between early and late laying females was 4&#x000a0;days. Although 4&#x000a0;days is a relatively short period compared to the total duration on which birds start egg laying (difference in laying date between the earliest bird vs. latest bird is ~30&#x000a0;days), the standard deviation of laying dates in 2008 was only 4.2&#x000a0;days. This means that 68.2% of all birds start egg laying in a period of 8.4&#x000a0;days only and thus that an interval of 4&#x000a0;days is biologically relevant.</p><p>Even though we found no intrinsic differences in energy expenditure between early and late breeding females, this does not mean that there are no differences in the fitness consequences of laying under cold conditions between early and late breeders. It is possible that variation in the fitness costs of energetic expenditure exists among females, potentially explaining variation in laying dates. Many examples exist in which an increased workload (for example by increasing the number of nestlings in a brood) negatively affects the survival of the parents (e.g. Dijkstra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1990</xref>; Deerenberg and Overkamp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1999</xref>). However, to explain the maintenance in variation in laying dates from an optimality perspective, there have to be individual differences in fitness costs due to increased energetic expenditure. To our knowledge, this has never been demonstrated.</p><p>Our results show that female great tits in Oosterhout expended more energy during egg laying than the Hoge Veluwe females. This difference could be caused by genetic differences between the populations [none of the 3,376 known breeding birds in Oosterhout were born in Hoge Veluwe and only two known breeding birds in Hoge Veluwe (out of 13,979 birds) were born in Oosterhout]. Alternatively, the between-site difference in energy expenditure could be due to differences in the timing of the caterpillar food peak. The Oosterhout population is situated on rich river clay soil compared to the sandy soil of the Hoge Veluwe. The difference in soil type is most likely why tree leafing is earlier in Oosterhout compared to the Hoge Veluwe, resulting in an earlier caterpillar food peak. This means that Oosterhout females have to lay eggs earlier (and under colder conditions; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and thus expend more energy. Since great tits do not store large amounts of fat, maximum energy expenditure will directly depend on energy intake. From radio tracking data in both populations in the period before egg laying (L. te Marvelde and M.E. Visser, unpublished data), we know that females in Oosterhout often make use of the vast amount of supplementary bird food in the nearby village, whereas a food source like this is not available to the Hoge Veluwe population. The supplementary food in Oosterhout consists mainly of fat and peanuts; food full of energy but which does not contain the proteins needed for egg production. We have seen that females often visit the supplementary food for ~15&#x000a0;min after which they fly back to their territory to forage by hopping in the crown of the tree, most likely looking for (protein-rich) insects. The supplementary food then only serves as fuel that facilitates foraging for protein rich foods. As a consequence, they are able to work harder and therefore expend more energy compared to the Hoge Veluwe females.</p><p>A better understanding of the causes and consequences of variation in laying date among females is important as, due to climate warming, there is increased selection on laying date (Visser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2006</xref>). Selection is influenced by, and potentially alters, the costs and benefits of the entire reproductive cycle, so we need to understand how females differ in their energetic costs (and in fitness consequences of these costs) not only during egg laying but also during other periods of the breeding cycle, such as chick feeding (te Marvelde et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2011b</xref>). Understanding the proximate and ultimate factors maintaining variation among females will provide insight into patterns of phenotypic selection in natural populations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>&#x02018;Stichting Het Nationale Park De Hoge Veluwe&#x02019; and family Van Boetzelaer in Oosterhout kindly allowed us to conduct our research on their property.
