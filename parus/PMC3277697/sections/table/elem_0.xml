  <p>
   <span class="italic">Egg 4</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Egg 8</span> and
   <span class="italic"> Other</span> refer to the periods over which DEE is measured (i.e. for females measured on egg 4 we injected doubly labelled water in the morning the second egg was laid, we collected egg 3 and egg 4 and measured isotope elimination rates between egg 3 and 4 from which DEE was calculated. One egg was laid per day). Only measurements under 
   <span class="italic">Egg 4</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Egg 8</span> were used in the analyses for comparison of early and late females. Measured twice refers to the number of females of which DEE was measured twice during the same laying period
