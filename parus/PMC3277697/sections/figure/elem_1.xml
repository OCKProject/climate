  <p>Effect of ambient temperature (°C) on daily energy expenditure (kJ day
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) of female great tits during egg laying in two study areas (Oosterhout and Hoge Veluwe). Comparison of DEE between early and late females was done for those females measured on the day their fourth or their eighth egg was laid. 
   <span class="italic">Lines</span> represent the regression lines through the individual sets of points. 
   <span class="italic">Grey dashed lines</span> connect two DEE measurements of individual females measured twice in their laying period. Note that the regression lines of early and late females of the Hoge Veluwe (Hoge Veluwe egg 8 and egg 4, respectively) fall on top of each other and are not statistically different (see Table
