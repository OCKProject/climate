  </div>where 
  <span class="italic">N</span> is the total body water (TBW) and 
  <span class="italic">k</span>
  <sub>18O</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">k</span>
  <sub>2H</sub> are the 
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and 
  <span class="sup">2</span>H decay rates per hour (decay on a log scale divided by time interval between the two samples; 24 h for 81 measurements, 48 h for 10 measurements in case of a laying pause of 1 day after the first sample). The rightmost term is a correction to the simple proportionality between TBW, decay rates difference and 
  <span class="italic">r</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub>, which is caused by isotope fractionation effects. The coefficient of this term depends on the assumptions regarding the fraction of water loss through breath. Here, we follow Speakman’s assumption that this fraction is 25%. This assumption has been found to be the most appropriate (Visser and Schekkerman 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">1999</a>; Van Trigt et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2002</a>). TBW depends on TBW% and body mass. TBW% can be estimated when a sample is taken 1 h after injection of the DLW. We were not able to estimate TBW% since our first sample is taken about 20 h after injection. We assume a constant TBW percentage of 66% based on dried great tits (Mertens 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">1987</a>). We weighed the female immediately after injection of the DLW and do not have body mass at the sampling times represented by each egg. Since the TBW changes during egg laying (the production of the egg increases body mass, which drops again when the egg is laid), we used the average pool size as suggested by Lifson and McClintock (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">1966</a>) by averaging the weight of the female with and without the egg of the final sample. An energy equivalent of 27.8 kJ per litre CO
  <sub>2</sub> produced was used to transform CO
  <sub>2</sub> production into energy expenditure per hour after which it is multiplied by 24 to get daily energy expenditure.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important assumption in the comparison between early and late females is that no consistent differences in DEE exist within females during the egg laying sequence. To test this, DEE of 13 females [Hoge Veluwe, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 9 (2009); Oosterhout, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 4 (2008)] were measured twice in their egg laying sequence.
