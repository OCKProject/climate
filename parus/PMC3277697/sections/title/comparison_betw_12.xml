 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used two separate tests (two alternative ways) to test the difference in DEE between early and late laying females. First, we ran a 2-way ANOVA with DEE as the response variable, date as factor (with 9 levels) and egg number (egg 4 vs. egg 8 as 2 levels; Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>B). We used date as a factor to account for all possible differences that occurred between days.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an alternative way to answer the same question, we ran a linear mixed model with DEE as response variable, date as random variable and temperature, female body mass, egg number (egg 4 vs. egg 8 as 2 levels) and the interaction between temperature and egg number (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>C). Least significant terms were removed from the model, starting with the interaction terms, resulting in a final model with only significant variables.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All statistics were carried out using R version 2.9.2 (R Development Core Team
