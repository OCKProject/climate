 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperatures (measured every hour) were retrieved from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute location Deelen (~2 km from the Hoge Veluwe and ~21 km from the Oosterhout study site). Both study locations are inland and we have no reason to believe that differences in temperature exist for the two locations. Since the timing of separation of the egg from the female TBW is largely unknown (but falls between ~1900 and 0600 hours), we tested average temperatures over three different 24-h periods (1900–1900, 0000–0000 and 0600–0600 hours). Our results do not change depending on the period over which we average temperature, but since midnight–midnight temperature explained most of the variation, we present the results of average temperatures during this period.</p>
