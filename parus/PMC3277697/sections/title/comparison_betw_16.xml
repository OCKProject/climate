 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a 2-way ANOVA with date (factor with 9 levels) and egg number (factor with 2 levels; egg 4 vs. egg 8), we found no difference in DEE between early and late breeding female great tits (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>B), but DEE was related to female body mass. However, since females measured on egg 8 (early females) tended to be heavier than females measured on egg 4 (late females; Welch two-sample 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.059), differences in body mass could not mask differences in DEE between early and late breeding females. In fact, the difference in DEE between early and later breeders increased when correcting for female body mass (from 0.89 to 2.22 kJ day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) but remained non-significant. Although no clear differences in DEE existed between the females tested on different dates (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>B), in a linear mixed model where we substituted temperature for date, we found a temperature effect on DEE, similar to that in the full dataset. This effect of temperature on DEE did not differ between early and late laying females (interaction egg number × temperature) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>; Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>C).
