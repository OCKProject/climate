 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test the assumption that no consistent differences exist in DEE within a females’ laying sequence, we used the ‘within-subject centering’ procedure to separate within and between effects of egg number (e.g. egg number 4 is the 4th egg laid) on DEE in a linear mixed model (van de Pol and Wright 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2009</a>). We tested the significance of within female egg number on DEE in a mixed model with DEE as response variable (and female identity as a random effect) and average temperature (midnight–midnight), female body mass, mean egg number (showing the between female effect of egg number on DEE), deviation of the mean egg number for each individual DEE measurement (showing the within female effect of egg number on DEE) as explanatory variables. The latter variable is of most interest. We also included temperature and female body mass since these variables appeared to be of importance in the analyses of the full data set.
