 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily energy expenditure of female great tits during egg laying decreased with ambient temperature (using all 78 DEE measurements; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>; see Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>A for statistics). The slope of the temperature effect on DEE did not differ between the two study areas, but Oosterhout females expended more energy than the Hoge Veluwe females at a given temperature. Furthermore, DEE increased with body mass. There was no effect of various egg characteristics, clutch size, date or the number of eggs left to lay after the DEE measurement date on DEE.
