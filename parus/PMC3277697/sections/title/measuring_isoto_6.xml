 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Isotopes were analysed at the Centre for Isotope Research (Groningen, The Netherlands) using methods described in detail elsewhere (Visser and Schekkerman 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">1999</a>; Visser et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2002</a>). The albumen in the capillary tubes was distilled in a vacuum line and brought into a standard vial for automatic injection into the isotope ratio mass spectrometer system. Local water standards (gravimetrically prepared from pure 
  <span class="sup">2</span>H- and 
  <span class="sup">18</span>O-water), that cover the entire enrichment range of the albumen samples, were applied for calibration purposes. The actual 
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and 
  <span class="sup">2</span>H measurements were performed in automatic batches using a High Temperature pyrolysis unit (Hekatech) coupled to a GVI Isoprime Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer for the actual isotope analysis.
