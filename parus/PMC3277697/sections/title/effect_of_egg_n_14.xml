 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When corrected for temperature, female body mass and the among female effect of egg number on DEE, we found no significant within female effect for egg number on DEE (estimate ± SE = 0.080 (±0.45), 
  <span class="italic">df</span> = 1, error 
  <span class="italic">df</span> = 10,

  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.86; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), validating the assumption that costs during egg laying do not depend on where in the sequence of egg laying DEE is measured, and thus justifying the between female comparison below.
