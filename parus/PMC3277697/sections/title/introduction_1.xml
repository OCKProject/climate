 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strong linear or nonlinear relationships between the timing of breeding and offspring fitness are commonly observed in birds reproducing in highly seasonal environments. In many insectivorous species, for example, reproductive success declines over the course of the breeding season (e.g. Perrins 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1970</a>; Verhulst and Tinbergen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">1991</a>; Verhulst et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">1995</a>). Earlier broods have more fledglings with a higher recruitment rate due to their higher fledging mass and an effect of date per se (Tinbergen and Boerlijst 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">1990</a>; Verboven and Visser 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">1998</a>; Visser and Verboven 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">1999</a>). In some cases (e.g. great tits, 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>, in The Netherlands), selection for early breeding has intensified over the past few decades because of an increasing mismatch between different trophic levels as a result of climate change (Visser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">1998</a>). However, considerable among-individual variation appears to be maintained within populations, despite consistent patterns of directional and/or stabilizing selection, highlighting the need to understand proximate and ultimate factors responsible for generating and maintaining these differences among individuals.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The classical explanation for differences in timing of breeding is that variation in the timing of local food availability during the nestling phase exists and as a consequence birds adapt their timing of reproduction to this local timing of food availability (Rowan 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">1926</a>; Lack 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">1968</a>; Daan et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1989</a>). Differences in the mean breeding date of populations might thus reflect adaptive evolutionary divergence, where early breeding occurs in places where food peaks in the nestling phase are earliest, while variation within populations could reflect a combination of genetic differences and adaptive plasticity (e.g. where individuals occupying different territories adjust their breeding time to match local food peaks).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternative explanation for adaptive variation in timing of breeding is that laying dates (date when the first egg of a clutch is laid) are affected by food conditions in the period 
  <span class="italic">before</span> egg laying. Egg laying is energetically costly as shown by increased metabolic rates in egg laying females (Walsberg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">1983</a>; Nilsson and Raberg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2001</a>; Vezina and Williams 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2002</a>). In order to match the timing of maximum food requirements (late in the nestling period; Moreno et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">1995</a>; Verhulst and Tinbergen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1997</a>) with the timing of maximum food availability (caterpillar food peak; Visser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2006</a>), eggs have to be laid up to 5 weeks in advance of the food peak. Thus, eggs are laid in cold weather conditions under which foraging efficiency is low (Avery and Krebs 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1984</a>) and energetic costs are high (Stevenson and Bryant 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2000</a>). For a long time, it was thought that limitation of resources set the earliest possible laying date within a year, and that birds did not lay earlier simply because they were unable to obtain enough resources (Perrins 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1970</a>). However, this resource limitation hypothesis could also be seen as a trade-off between costs and benefits. Early laying potentially allows for a better match with the food peak for the nestlings (resulting in nestlings of good condition which are more likely to recruit), but producing eggs under harsh conditions early in the season can result in an increase in energetic costs (direct costs) which can have negative effects on current and future reproductive success (indirect costs). Fitness costs of increased work load have been studied by Monaghan et al
  <span class="italic">.</span> (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">1998</a>), who showed that female lesser black-backed gulls (
  <span class="italic">Larus fuscus</span>) which had experimentally increased costs during egg laying (by producing more eggs) had reduced offspring rearing capacity in the nestling stage, resulting in reduced fledgling body mass. Visser and Lessells (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2001</a>) showed that experimentally increasing costs of reproduction in 1 year affected the timing of breeding the following year—female great tits with increased costs started egg laying later in the year after manipulation. Survival of females also decreased with increasing costs sustained during the breeding cycle (Visser and Lessells 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2001</a>), at the expense of future reproductive success. Therefore, it may be adaptive for some females to lay her eggs later than what would be best for the match between chicks’ needs and food conditions during chick feeding in order to increase chances of future reproductive success (Visser et al., submitted). As income breeders, the energetic expenditure of gathering enough food for egg production by a female great tit can vary depending on local food availability before and during egg laying. So, under this hypothesis, differences in laying dates can result from differences in the timing or abundance of food availability on the territory level in the period before egg laying. Alternatively, differences in laying date may arise if there are among female differences in the energetic expenditure necessary to produce an egg, perhaps due to intrinsic differences in female quality.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated whether there is variation among females in their daily energetic expenditure (DEE; measured using the doubly labelled water technique; Speakman 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">1997</a>) during egg production. A difference in DEE between females indicates that something in their environment (ability to obtain resources at lower energetic costs) or their physiology (ability to produce eggs at lower energetic cost) differs. As environmental conditions improve over the season (and assuming that the environmental conditions are equal for all females), those females who are able to produce eggs at low costs will be able to lay already under poorer environmental conditions, and thus will breed earlier. Therefore, when comparing early and late breeding females on the same day, we predicted that early laying females have a lower DEE than later laying females.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparing DEE of early and late breeding females is difficult, since factors affecting DEE (e.g. weather conditions and food availability) change over the course of the season and from day to day. We compared DEE of females with different first egg laying dates on the same day, and thus avoid day to day variation in conditions, by making use of the overlap in their egg laying period (the great tit’s laying period is around 8 days depending on the clutch size; 1 egg per day, average clutch size ~9 eggs). We compared DEE late in the laying sequence of early females with DEE of late females early in their laying sequence during their overlapping laying period. By comparing within single days, we did not need to correct for the effects of temperature and food availability. We also tested the assumption that there are no systematic differences in DEE at different times during the egg laying period by measuring DEE of a number of females twice during egg laying.</p>
