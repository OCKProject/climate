  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When corrected for temperature, female body mass and the among female effect of egg number on DEE, we found no significant within female effect for egg number on DEE (estimate ± SE = 0.080 (±0.45),

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily energy expenditure of female great tits during egg laying decreased with ambient temperature (using all 78 DEE measurements; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>; see Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>A for statistics). The slope of the temperature effect on DEE did not differ between the two study areas, but Oosterhout females expended more energy than the Hoge Veluwe females at a given temperature. Furthermore, DEE increased with body mass. There was no effect of various egg characteristics, clutch size, date or the number of eggs left to lay after the DEE measurement date on DEE.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a 2-way ANOVA with date (factor with 9 levels) and egg number (factor with 2 levels; egg 4 vs. egg 8), we found no difference in DEE between early and late breeding female great tits (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>B), but DEE was related to female body mass. However, since females measured on egg 8 (early females) tended to be heavier than females measured on egg 4 (late females; Welch two-sample 
   <span class="italic">t</span> test, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.059), differences in body mass could not mask differences in DEE between early and late breeding females. In fact, the difference in DEE between early and later breeders increased when correcting for female body mass (from 0.89 to 2.22 kJ day
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) but remained non-significant. Although no clear differences in DEE existed between the females tested on different dates (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>B), in a linear mixed model where we substituted temperature for date, we found a temperature effect on DEE, similar to that in the full dataset. This effect of temperature on DEE did not differ between early and late laying females (interaction egg number × temperature) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>; Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>C).
