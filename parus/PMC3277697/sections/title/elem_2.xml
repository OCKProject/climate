 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2008 and 2009, DEE of 78 female great tits in two nearby study areas (20 km apart) was measured during egg laying (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>); 19 females (2008) from the Oosterhout population (51°52′22″N, 5°50′22″E) and 59 females (2008, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 50; 2009, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 9) from the Hoge Veluwe population (52°02′07″N, 5°51′32″E). Of these females, DEE of 13 females [Hoge Veluwe, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 9 (2009); Oosterhout, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 4 (2008)] was measured twice during their laying sequence for a within-female comparison of DEE as a function of egg sequence, resulting in a total of 91 measurements of DEE. Of the 59 females measured in the Hoge Veluwe study area, 43 females were randomly assigned to be measured early or late in their laying sequence for the comparison of DEE between early and late females.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Doubly labelled water technique using eggs as samples</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The double labelled water technique enables us to measure DEE in free-living animals by measuring elimination rates of 
    <span class="sup">2</span>H and 
    <span class="sup">18</span>O which are enriched in the body water of the animal through injection (Speakman 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">1997</a>; see below). Instead of measuring elimination rates of 
    <span class="sup">2</span>H and 
    <span class="sup">18</span>O isotopes in blood samples (as is usually done), we measured elimination rates in the albumen of the eggs produced (as was done by Ward 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">1996</a>; Stevenson and Bryant 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2000</a>). This avoided recapture and handling stress in a period during which disturbance leads to high desertion rates (Kania 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">1989</a>). The period over which DEE is measured using this method depends on the exact timing after which water molecules can not freely move between the females’ body water pool and the water in the egg (i.e. the timing of which the egg shell is produced, separating the female body water pool from the water in the egg). Ward (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">1996</a>) studied the relationship between isotope concentrations in the albumen and blood for barn swallows (
    <span class="italic">Hirundo rustica</span>) and found that the average time of the day at which the water pools of female and egg separate was around 2245 hours. Although this timing is not known in great tits, it is the timing of separation 
    <span class="italic">within</span> a female over successive eggs which is important. No evidence exist that this timing differs between successive eggs 
    <span class="italic">within</span> a female’s laying sequence. Values of DEE found in this study are comparable to DEE values during egg laying found by Stevenson and Bryant (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2000</a>) and are about 2.5 times BMR, which was calculated with equation 5.1 in Kendeigh et al. (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">1977</a>) for the average body mass of a female great tit of our dataset (19.6 g), which falls well within the range of DEE/BMR-ratios found for this and other species (King

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest boxes were checked twice a week from the beginning of April to monitor nest building. Once the bottom of the box was covered with nest material, nests were checked daily to determine exact laying dates. Eggs were numbered on the day they were laid. Female great tits were caught when leaving the nest box early in the morning, soon after egg laying using temporarily placed ‘box nets’ (te Marvelde et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2011a</a>). Immediately after catching, each female was injected intraperitoneally with 200 μl DLW using a 0.3-ml syringe with a 0.33 × 12 mm needle. After injecting, the female was weighed to the nearest 0.1 g and then released (usually within 10 min after catching). Early females were caught and injected with DLW on the morning they laid their sixth egg (
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 25), whereas late females were injected in the morning they laid their second egg (
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 18). The day after the injection, the third egg of a late and the seventh egg of an earlier female were collected. The next day, we collected the fourth and the eighth egg of those females. Because we can only capture the female the morning after we detect the first egg, the earliest measurement of DEE is the 24 h between the production of the third and the fourth egg. For the early females, we chose the eighth egg as a last sample since not all females produce more than eight eggs. All eggs taken as samples were replaced immediately by unbrooded eggs from a nearby study site to prevent the production of replacement eggs.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">About 12 h after collection, the length, width and mass of the eggs were measured and the yolk and the albumen were separated and weighed to the nearest mg in the laboratory. The albumen was homogenised by hand and three samples of ~15 μl were transferred to non-heparinised 25-μl capillaries which were flame-sealed immediately.</p>

    <span class="sup">2</span>H- and 
    <span class="sup">18</span>O-water), that cover the entire enrichment range of the albumen samples, were applied for calibration purposes. The actual

The rightmost term is a correction to the simple proportionality between TBW, decay rates difference and 
    <span class="italic">r</span>CO
    <sub>2</sub>, which is caused by isotope fractionation effects. The coefficient of this term depends on the assumptions regarding the fraction of water loss through breath. Here, we follow Speakman’s assumption that this fraction is 25%. This assumption has been found to be the most appropriate (Visser and Schekkerman 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">1999</a>; Van Trigt et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2002</a>). TBW depends on TBW% and body mass. TBW% can be estimated when a sample is taken 1 h after injection of the DLW. We were not able to estimate TBW% since our first sample is taken about 20 h after injection. We assume a constant TBW percentage of 66% based on dried great tits (Mertens 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">1987</a>). We weighed the female immediately after injection of the DLW and do not have body mass at the sampling times represented by each egg. Since the TBW changes during egg laying (the production of the egg increases body mass, which drops again when the egg is laid), we used the average pool size as suggested by Lifson and McClintock (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">1966</a>) by averaging the weight of the female with and without the egg of the final sample. An energy equivalent of 27.8 kJ per litre CO
    <sub>2</sub> produced was used to transform CO
    <sub>2</sub> production into energy expenditure per hour after which it is multiplied by 24 to get daily energy expenditure.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important assumption in the comparison between early and late females is that no consistent differences in DEE exist within females during the egg laying sequence. To test this, DEE of 13 females [Hoge Veluwe,

Both study locations are inland and we have no reason to believe that differences in temperature exist for the two locations. Since the timing of separation of the egg from the female TBW is largely unknown (but falls between ~1900 and 0600 hours), we tested average temperatures over three different 24-h periods (1900–1900, 0000–0000 and 0600–0600 hours).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test the assumption that no consistent differences exist in DEE within a females’ laying sequence, we used the ‘within-subject centering’ procedure to separate within and between effects of egg number (e.g. egg number 4 is the 4th egg laid) on DEE in a linear mixed model (van de Pol and Wright 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2009</a>). We tested the significance of within female egg number on DEE in a mixed model with DEE as response variable (and female identity as a random effect) and average temperature (midnight–midnight), female body mass, mean egg number (showing the between female effect of egg number on DEE), deviation of the mean egg number for each individual DEE measurement (showing the within female effect of egg number on DEE) as explanatory variables. The latter variable is of most interest. We also included temperature and female body mass since these variables appeared to be of importance in the analyses of the full data set.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used two separate tests (two alternative ways) to test the difference in DEE between early and late laying females. First, we ran a 2-way ANOVA with DEE as the response variable, date as factor (with 9 levels) and egg number (egg 4 vs. egg 8 as 2 levels; Table 
    <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>B). We used date as a factor to account for all possible differences that occurred between days.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an alternative way to answer the same question, we ran a linear mixed model with DEE as response variable, date as random variable and temperature, female body mass, egg number (egg 4 vs. egg 8 as 2 levels) and the interaction between temperature and egg number (Table 
    <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>C). Least significant terms were removed from the model, starting with the interaction terms, resulting in a final model with only significant variables.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All statistics were carried out using R version 2.9.2 (R Development Core Team 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2009</a>). All tests were two-tailed and an alpha level of 0.05 was applied throughout.
