   <span class="bold">A</span>) Total number of breeding females in the population in the future consists of (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) breeding females locally recruited (
   <span class="italic">n</span>), of age classes 2 (

   <sub>2</sub>), 3 (

   <sub>3</sub>), and 4 and older (
   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>4</sub>), and (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) newly arriving immigrant breeding females 
   <span class="italic">I</span>. Predicted densities are provided by the CDDPM from climate scenarios available for the study site (fig. S4, right). Shaded dark gray corresponds to 50% and light gray corresponds to 95% prediction intervals associated with the predicted densities. To improve the readability, confidence intervals are not shown for (B). Dotted lines on (A) and (C) as well as gray lines on (B) correspond to models including density-independent effects of winter conditions.
