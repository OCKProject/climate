 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyzing how environmental stochasticity and deterministic factors caused by density dependence affect survival, fecundity, and immigration rates is the first step required before constructing a more complex population model. To do so, we used individual-based data collected between 1979 and 2013 and considered four age classes of breeding females. Age class 1 corresponded to the first year of breeding (second calendar year of life), age class 2 to the second year of breeding and third calendar year of life, age class 3 to the third year of breeding and fourth calendar year of life, and age class 4 to older breeding females. For each year 
  <span class="italic">t</span> and for each age class 
  <span class="italic">i</span>, we estimated the survival 
  <span class="italic">S</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i,t</span>
  </sub> and recruitment 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i,t</span>
  </sub> rates (that is, the contribution of breeding females of age class 
  <span class="italic">i</span> to recruitment into the age class 1 breeding class next year) (see Materials and Methods) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a> and fig. S1). Then, we investigated the effect of several climate variables related to winter weather on these age-specific demographic rates (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>), as well as on the annual number of immigrant breeding females joining the local population. We particularly considered the effects of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>), local mean winter temperature (temp), and local mean winter precipitation (prec). We also investigated an effect of the total number of breeding females in the population (hereafter, density 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">t</span>
  </sub>) on the age-specific demographic rates (see

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean winter temperature was always the best environmental explanatory variable for all demographic rates (table S1). Warmer winters had a positive effect on survival and recruitment rates for all age classes, and this effect was age-specific (table S2). The effects of winter temperature on recruitment corresponded to the effects on the first-year survival because winter is a critical season for the survival of the white-throated dipper (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). Moreover, the significant interactions between winter temperatures and density (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>, A and B, tables S1 and S2, and fig. S2) indicated that climate variation mainly affects the demographic rates at high densities, suggesting an indirect effect of climate through resource limitation. There was a complex interaction between mean winter temperature and density of local females (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a> and tables S1 and S2) in explaining the number of immigrant females entering the local population (mainly females from age class 1; fig. S3). Particularly, milder winters were associated with higher number of immigrants than cold winters, but only when densities of local females were low (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>). Mean winter temperature was consequently the main environmental factor affecting demographic rates, mostly likely operating indirectly through resource limitation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both population density and mean winter temperature in a given year thus affect survival, recruitment, and immigration rates (table S2), which in turn influence the age-specific densities in breeding females the following year and thus the total density (see Materials and Methods) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). The dynamical impact of variation in climate is therefore dependent on the population density. The strength of density dependence decreases slightly with increasing winter temperatures (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>), and the effects of a change in temperature on the population growth rate are weaker in mild winters than in cold winters (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3B</a>). As a consequence, under global warming, the probability of an increase in numbers at small population sizes (for example, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 20) during a period of 40 years is much larger because of this interaction between density and temperature, compared to the case where density dependence and environmental stochasticity are considered as independent effects. Hence, predicted future population density becomes a complex function including the effects of environmental stochasticity and deterministic processes caused by density dependence, as well as their interaction.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the power of the resulting climate-densityâ€“dependent population model (CDDPM) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>) in predicting population size and structure, we started with the age-specific densities in 1979 and considered only the observed winter temperatures from 1979 to 2013 (fig. S4, left side). Then, we simulated 1000 stochastic trajectories in population sizes including demographic and environmental stochasticity (see Materials and Methods) from 1980 to 2013. Note that our population model can reconstruct the past fluctuations in population size very closely (fig. S5A) and past population structure as well (fig. S5, C and D), with a strong correlation 
  <span class="italic">r</span> between observed and predicted number of breeding females in each group (0.66 &lt; 
  <span class="italic">r</span> &lt; 0.82; see Materials and Methods).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Average surface temperatures at the closest model grid point (58.9Â°N, 7.5Â°E) were obtained from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble Community Project (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>) until 2050. These climate projections for the study area predict an increase in mean winter temperature in the coming years (fig. S4, right). We thus expect a future increase of survival and recruitment rates in all age classes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>, A and B) and thus a growing mean population size. Further, warmer winters should not result in an increase in the number of immigrants. This is because the effect of increasing temperatures on the number of immigrants was shown to be strongly density-dependent, with the same number of immigrants whatever the winter temperature is when the local population was large (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>). When including age-specific densities in 2013 in the CDDPM and the local climate projections by 2050 (fig. S4, right) (see Materials and Methods), we effectively found that the mean population size will have increased by 2050 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>). Such an increase is likely specifically due to a growing number of local females (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>) because our CDDPM predicts a somewhat constant number of immigrants (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4C</a>). Our results suggest that warmer winters may increase the demographic performance factors (that is, survival and recruitment) of the local population, which in turn reduces the proportion of immigrants joining the population through a density-dependent feedback on the number of immigrants. The expected changes in climate will reduce the rate of immigration into the population. This full understanding of the demographic mechanisms under climate change may not be achieved using a more typical population model including density-independent effects of climate. Because of the absence of interaction between winter conditions and density, such type of model overestimates the number of immigrants joining the local population at high densities during mild winters (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figs. 2C</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4C</a>, dotted lines) and tends to underestimate survival and recruitment rates of local birds (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figs. 2</a>, A and B, and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4B</a> and fig. S2, dotted lines). Likewise, at mild winters, it overestimates the effect of a change in the number of females and the effect of a change in mean winter temperatures on the population growth rate at equilibrium 
  <span class="italic">K</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>, dotted lines). Therefore, although neglecting interaction between climate and density may provide a reliable measure of total population size under climate change (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>), it does not allow for precise identification of the underlying processes.
