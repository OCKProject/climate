  <span class="italic">N</span> (fig. S5A, thin line) was within the 95% prediction interval in 94.1% of the cases, and within the 50% prediction interval in 61.8% of the cases, indicating a good match between observed and predicted total population size. Note that the observed densities were the densities obtained from the IPM (that is, corrected for observation error, the incomplete information on age structure in the monitoring data, and imperfect detection). To ensure that the CDDPM correctly modeled the full development of the population and not only the total population size, we computed the Pearsonâ€™s product-moment correlations 
  <span class="italic">r</span> and their associated 95% confidence intervals between the observed and predicted number of breeding females in each age class. That is, we compared the observed population structure (fig. S5, B and C, thin lines) with the population structure predicted with the CDDPM (fig. S5, C and D, thick lines). In practice, for each year between 1979 and 2013, we estimated the mean number of breeding females in each age class among the 1000 simulated stochastic trajectories and compared it with the observed number of breeding females [
