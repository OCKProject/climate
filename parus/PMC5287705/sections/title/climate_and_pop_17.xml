  </a>) the daily average surface temperatures at the closest model grid point (58.9°N, 7.5°E) for 40 ensemble members [see the work of Kay

  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>) for a full description of the climate projections]. For these 40 ensemble members, we calculated the mean temperature for each winter (December to February) between 1921 and 2050. As with the observed temperatures (see Climate-density–dependent population model), we standardized the winter weather scenarios (with the mean and the variance of the mean winter temperatures predicted between 1921 and 2015). Thus, the mean and the SD used for standardizing each of the members were the mean of means and the mean of SDs calculated for each member. Such a rescaling allowed observed temperatures and climate scenarios (on average across all 40 of them) to be aligned between 1921 and 2015 so that they had the same mean and variance (fig. S4, right).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the age-specific densities in 2013 that were previously estimated with the IPM and these standardized values of mean winter temperatures, we simulated with the CDDPM 100 stochastic trajectories in population sizes per ensemble member from 2013 to 2050, resulting in a total of 4000 stochastic trajectories. We computed the 95 and 50% prediction intervals of the predicted total population size (
