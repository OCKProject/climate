 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimating annual age-specific demographic rates and densities using an IPM</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We simultaneously integrated the recorded number of occupied nests (
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">t</span>
  </sub>), CR data of females with known age, and data on reproductive success (that is, 
  <span class="italic">B</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i,t</span>
  </sub> and 
  <span class="italic">J</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i,t</span>
  </sub>) into a Bayesian integrated population model (IPM) (
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>). This allows estimating annual survival, recruitment, and densities (that is, the number of breeding females 
  <span class="italic">N</span>) for each age class. Note that we defined density here as the annual number of breeding females because of the complexity of the breeding system in this species (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>). Females become reproductively mature in their first spring, which is the second calendar year of life. We used four age classes of breeding females, with age class 1 corresponding to the first year of breeding (second calendar year of life), age class 2 to the second year of breeding and third calendar year of life, age class 3 to the third year of breeding and fourth calendar year of life, and age class 4 to older breeding females. The joint analysis of these three data sets (recorded number of occupied nests, CR data, and data on reproductive success) increases the precision of the estimates of the shared parameters. Such a framework allows accounting for observation error associated with the recorded number of nests (
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>), for the incomplete information on age structure in the monitoring data (for example, some females are of unknown age), for imperfect detection (for example, recapture probability is not 1), for emigration in the first year of life, which is potentially high in this species (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>), and for demographic stochasticity (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model was fitted within the Bayesian framework, and noninformative priors were specified for all the parameters, allowing the inference to be dominated by information in the data and not by the information in the priors. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation was used for parameter estimation. To assess convergence, we ran four independent chains with different starting values for 1,000,000 MCMC iterations, with a burn-in of 500,000 iterations, thinning every 1000th observation and resulting in 2000 posterior samples. We used the Brooks and Gelman diagnostic
