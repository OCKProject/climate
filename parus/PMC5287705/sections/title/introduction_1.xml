 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding how to predict the future dynamics of natural populations as a response to global climatic change has become urgently required of ecologists and is crucial for producing appropriate management and conservation strategies. However, until now, this task has remained a challenge due to its scope because climate effects can influence the number of births, deaths, and immigrants in a population. Thus, climate effects have to be considered on all vital rates at all the (st)ages of the life cycle (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>), which requires long-term detailed individual-based data. Otherwise, predictions regarding future dynamics may be severely biased (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). Moreover, climate may interact with density-dependent factors to affect the population dynamics (

   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>). For example, when weather conditions affect limiting resources, climate effects should be studied in combination with density effects (
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>). Such interactions between climate and density may be complex (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>), and although often ignored, this interactive effect may strongly affect the population dynamics (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>). Consequently, reliable models of population dynamics in a changing environment must include such interactions between internal processes mainly operating through negative feedback of the number of individuals on the population growth rate and stochastic variation in the environment.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The white-throated dipper (
  <span class="italic">Cinclus cinclus</span>) is a small passerine bird widely distributed at northern latitudes that depends on open water for foraging and running water for nesting. The amount of ice during the winter influences the availability of feeding and breeding habitats (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). Previous studies on a population located in southern Norway have highlighted that the growth rate of that population was dependent on both environmental stochastic and deterministic density-dependent factors and that global warming should lead to an increase in the mean population size (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>). However, none of these studies have yet explored the underlying demographic responses to changes in climate. Here, we develop an integrative framework of climate effects on population dynamics, including the interaction between density-dependent and environmental stochastic factors, as well as environmentally driven immigration, survival, and fecundity. From this framework, we will predict the future persistence of the population using local climate scenarios.
