 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predictions of large declines and even extinctions caused by climate change of natural populations belonging to different taxa are growing in the literature (

  </a>). The present study shows that our white-throated dipper population located at the northern latitude may benefit from global warming in terms of abundance (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>). Going beyond the total population abundance, we have reconstructed the full dynamics of the population and disentangled the demographic responses of the population to environmental variations. Our results suggest that the expected increase of density may have important consequences to the way our population will respond to future environmental changes because of dynamical transitions caused by an interaction between density dependence and environmental stochasticity (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figs. 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3</a>). Whereas at low density, survival and recruitment rates only slightly depend on winter temperatures (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>, A and B, and fig. S2), at high density, they become strongly dependent on winter conditions and are less buffered against poor environmental conditions (cold winters) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>, A and B, and fig. S2). These findings highlight that, in addition to reduced immigration rate (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figs. 2C</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4C</a>), the local population will likely be less buffered against occasional cold winters in the coming years. Our findings highlight that predicting the putative effects of global warming on natural populations requires a detailed picture of the dynamics of the populations. This integrative predictive framework of climate effects on population dynamics can help to elaborate targeted management actions on specific demographic rates of any population for which long-term individual-based data and climate scenarios are available.
