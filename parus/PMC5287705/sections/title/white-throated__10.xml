 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The studied population is located in the river system of Lyngdalselva in southern Norway (58°08′–58°40′N, 6°56′–7°20′E). The study site covers 60 km inland from the river mouth, and the river is interrupted by Lake Lygne. The white-throated dipper (
  <span class="italic">C. cinclus</span>) is a 50- to 70-g small passerine bird species distributed in mountainous regions across the Palearctic. It is a short-lived species; the oldest breeding female recorded in our population was 8 years of age. This species depends on open water for foraging and running water for nesting. The amount of ice during the winter thus influences the availability of feeding and breeding habitats. Breeding sites are concentrated on the many small tributaries and on rapids in the main river. Locations of breeding territories span from sea level to an altitude of about 600 m above sea level.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1978 to 2013, all breeding sites were visited during the nest building period to identify breeding pairs and record occupied nests, denoted as 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">t</span>
  </sub>. During visits in the breeding season, fledglings were ringed, ringed mothers were identified, and unringed mothers were given a ring to allow for future identifications. These unringed mothers (1094 over the study period, with 233 of them females of unknown age) were assumed to have immigrated into the population during the year in question. The following year, they are then considered to be local females. The mother was not identified in 88 of the occupied nests. Overall, 992 breeding females of known age (local and immigrant) were monitored, providing capture-recapture (CR) data of known age females. Moreover, ringed fledglings were recorded as recruited to the breeding population if they were caught breeding in a subsequent year. From the monitoring of breeding females of known age, we reported for each year 
  <span class="italic">t</span> the observed number of breeding females in age class 
  <span class="italic">i</span> (
  <span class="italic">B</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i,t</span>
  </sub>) and also the observed number of locally recruited females produced per age class 
  <span class="italic">i</span> (
  <span class="italic">J</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i,t</span>
  </sub>). In total, this type of demographic data based on reproductive success consisted of 1880 breeding events. One hundred fourteen females were locally recruited.
