 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The volume of the ambient noise had no effect on the minimum song frequency for the blackbird and the great tit, and for the blue tit, it only plays a minor role in the minimal model. The pairwise correlation is not significant. Thus, hypotheses 1 and 2 can be rejected, that is, the minimum frequency in the songs of great tits and blackbirds is not higher at higher levels of ambient noise; and there is a slight albeit not significant downwards shift in the minimum frequency for the blue tit under ambient noise.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This might be because birds in Frankfurt generally face high noise pollution due to traffic, construction, planes, and highways in all three zones with an average of 60 ± 1 dB in each zone (Table 
  <a rid="ece33032-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33032-sup-0001">S2</a>). Gil et al. (
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0026">2015</a>) found that birds living near airports sing earlier in the morning and hence avoid the time of the first high noise event, which might also apply for the whole area of Frankfurt. This effect could be increased by artificial illumination, which is also supposed to lead to an earlier morning chorus (Kempenaers, Borgström, Loës, Schlicht, &amp; Valcu, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0034">2010</a>). As both of these conditions exist for the entire Frankfurt study area, the three study species might avoid an overlap with noise by singing earlier. Further studies are needed to examine whether the investigated species advance their dawn chorus in comparison to conspecifics living at the same latitude, but in more quiet habitats.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over all, the investigated urbanity parameters have a minor influence on song trait variability. They sometimes remain in the minimal models, but they rarely have low 
  <span class="italic">p</span>‐values, and the pairwise correlations between song and urbanity parameters often are not significant at all.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fact that the other investigated urbanity parameters besides the ambient noise do not show a great effect on the song parameters suggests that the city might be a favorable habitat, at least for the investigated species (Lancaster &amp; Rees, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0035">1979</a>), although providing different and supposedly harsher conditions than natural environments (Table 
  <a rid="ece33032-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33032-sup-0001">S2</a>) (Chamberlain et al., 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0010">2009</a>). Maklakov, Immler, Gonzalez‐Voyer, Rönn, and Kolm (
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0036">2011</a>) suggest that species with relatively big brains adapt or cope better with the conditions of urban environments. Members of the Paridae have relatively big brains (Maklakov et al., 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0036">2011</a>) and therefore might succeed better in urban areas, which would support our findings for the blue and great tits. The reason for the success of European blackbirds in colonizing urban areas remains unclear, but higher temperatures and a greater food supply might play a major role (Evans, Hatchwell, Parnell, &amp; Gaston, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0020">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have already shown that weather does have an impact on breeding, feeding, singing behavior, and on avian life cycles (Elkins, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0018">2004</a>; Poesel, Kunc, Foerster, Johnsen, &amp; Kempenaers, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0041">2006</a>; Slagsvold, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0048">1977</a>). This consequently raises the question why weather should not also have an impact on the song itself. For our three investigated species, we found many highly significant weather variables remaining in the minimal models as well as several highly significant correlations with weather parameters. Hence, it seems that weather parameters are more important for song trait variability. These findings including hypothesis (3) are discussed in the following sections.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The blue tit</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Along with the temperatures, the air pressure has a profound influence on the blue tit's song trait variability. There is not much known about how air pressure modulates sounds and thus birdsong, but it is known that with decreasing air pressure also the oxygen partial pressure decreases, that is, the lower the air pressure, the less oxygen in the air. Considering the lower oxygen partial pressure in the air, one might hypothesize that birds experiencing low air pressure would have a simpler song to ensure oxygen supply. The blue tit has a narrower bandwidth of the element with the maximum bandwidth within a verse, when the air pressure is low. Hence, our findings would support this conclusion.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There have been studies on bird song along elevational gradients, but they did not investigate the effect of the air pressure, and they did not compare within‐species variability but compared congeneric species, or species within a subfamily (Caro, Caycedo‐Rosales, Bowie, Slabbekoorn, &amp; Cadena, 
   <a rid="ece33032-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0009">2013</a>; Jankowski, Robinson, &amp; Levey, 
   <a rid="ece33032-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0033">2010</a>; Snell‐Rood &amp; Badyaev, 
   <a rid="ece33032-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0049">2008</a>). At this stage, there is no simple explanation why the three species in our study react differently to changes in air pressure. Therefore, there is a need for further investigation to better understand how air pressure modulates sound and which effect it has on different song traits and their transmission and if species with similar song characteristics show similar changes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of the blue tit, hypothesis 3, that the bandwidth of the song widens with increasing air temperature, can be rejected. The bandwidth of their song is not influenced by air temperature, but by other weather parameters such as atmospheric humidity and average soil temperature.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The great tit</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The atmospheric humidity is one of the most important variables in the minimal models for the great tit along with soil and air temperature variables and the amount of sunlight per day. The atmospheric humidity plays a more important role in the models of the structure parameters as in the minimal model for the duration of the shortest element within a verse. Briefly, with increasing atmospheric humidity, the elements become longer.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Harris (
   <a rid="ece33032-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0030">1966</a>) and Gomez‐Augustina, Dance, and Shield (
   <a rid="ece33032-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0029">2014</a>) describe the effects of air temperature and atmospheric humidity on sound attenuation and reverberation times. In general, high frequencies are absorbed the most and even more so when atmospheric humidity is low. Reverberation time is low when frequencies are high and when atmospheric humidity is low. The great tit, which has a mean frequency of about 4.6 kHz (Table 
   <a rid="ece33032-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33032-sup-0001">S1</a>), is situated in a medium frequency range and therefore less affected by sound attenuation. But as reverberation time increases with lower frequencies along the atmospheric humidity, it might be an explanation for the importance of the atmospheric humidity in the minimal models of the great tit as well as the highly significant correlation of the duration of the shortest elements within a verse with the humidity.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The great tit has longer elements within a verse when humidity is high, and hence, the elements have high reverberation times (for graphics see Harris (
   <a rid="ece33032-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0030">1966</a>) and Gomez‐Augustina et al. (
   <a rid="ece33032-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0029">2014</a>)). The high reverberation time might favor the sound transmission and might facilitate song perception by females (Slabbekoorn, Ellers, &amp; Smith, 
   <a rid="ece33032-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0046">2002</a>). Some of the great tit's song types might be defined as narrow frequency bandwidth notes as described by Slabbekoorn et al. (
   <a rid="ece33032-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0046">2002</a>) and might show these benefits from reverberation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of the great tit, hypothesis 3—increasing air temperatures supposedly leading to a wider bandwidth of the song—can be rejected. The minimum air temperature stays in the minimal model for the bandwidth of the song; nevertheless, the direct correlation is not significant. The bandwidth of the song might not be an appropriate song parameter for identifying the influence of weather parameters on the great tit's song. This might be due to the fact that the latter is grouped into motifs that are repeated, but mostly stay within a certain frequency range in contrast to, for example, the versatile song of the blackbird.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The blackbird</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil temperatures play a highly important role in the minimal models of the blackbird. Coming back to hypothesis 3 suggesting a positive relationship between the minimum air temperature and the bandwidth of the verse, we found that the minimum air temperature was discarded in the stepwise selection of the minimal model. Instead, the minimum soil temperature turned out to be the most important variable in the minimal model for the bandwidth within a verse. Briefly, with increasing minimum soil temperature, the bandwidth of the verse widens.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It seems that with warmer temperatures 5 cm below the ground surface, blackbirds have more energy for a more elaborate song. With warmer temperatures, they need less energy to sustain their body temperature and they might get additional energy from food sources below the ground, especially as the European blackbird mainly feeds on earthworms and caterpillars (Tomialojc, 
   <a rid="ece33032-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0052">1994</a>). Regarding earthworms, they can pull them out of the ground more easily as soon as the soil warms up and becomes softer.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds normally singing in a low‐frequency range might need more energy for singing in a wider frequency range and males that succeed in wider bandwidths might indicate a higher physical fitness and/or better nutrition. Both would be aspects a female might select for during courtship.</p>
