 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistics were performed in R 3.1.2 (R Development Core Team 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0042">2014</a>). The five or ten verses, which were measured, were aggregated for each male bird into the mean of every song variable. Several principal component analyses were carried out separately for each species to reduce the parameters by getting principal components that covered most of the variance of the parameters. Therefore, we performed principal component analyses for all song parameters, for all frequency, structure, urbanity, and weather parameters (Tables 
  <a rid="ece33032-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33032-tbl-0001">1</a> and 
  <a rid="ece33032-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33032-tbl-0002">2</a>). The principal component analysis for the urbanity parameters was based on the “degree of urbanity” introduced by Ziege et al. (
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0058">2015</a>) and was adjusted with relevant urbanity parameters for birds, like the building density and height.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We always extracted the first and the second principal component. In most cases, when combined, the first and second principal components explained over 50% of the variance of the corresponding variables (Table 
  <a rid="ece33032-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33032-sup-0001">S3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We performed a simple linear regression model for each song parameter for each species. We included all explanatory variables (Table 
  <a rid="ece33032-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33032-tbl-0002">2</a>) in the original model except for the principal components because of autocorrelation. We then chose a minimal model for each song parameter by performing a stepwise reduction of the explanatory variables, which had been put into the source model, using the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion). Only the models with the lowest AIC were kept for interpretation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also performed 528 correlation analyses for each species: we tested the correlation between each of the 22 song parameters and each of the 24 explanatory variables. Because of these multiple comparisons, we used Bonferroni's correction for all 
  <span class="italic">p</span> values, further on referred to as 
  <span class="italic">p</span>* (Armstrong, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0001">2014</a>; Streiner &amp; Norman, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0050">2011</a>). All of the tested explanatory variables were continuous except for the daytime, which was a two‐level categorical variable. Therefore, we calculated Pearson's rank correlations and for the daytime Wilcoxon tests.
