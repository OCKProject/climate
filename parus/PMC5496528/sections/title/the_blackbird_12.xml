 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil temperatures play a highly important role in the minimal models of the blackbird. Coming back to hypothesis 3 suggesting a positive relationship between the minimum air temperature and the bandwidth of the verse, we found that the minimum air temperature was discarded in the stepwise selection of the minimal model. Instead, the minimum soil temperature turned out to be the most important variable in the minimal model for the bandwidth within a verse. Briefly, with increasing minimum soil temperature, the bandwidth of the verse widens.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It seems that with warmer temperatures 5 cm below the ground surface, blackbirds have more energy for a more elaborate song. With warmer temperatures, they need less energy to sustain their body temperature and they might get additional energy from food sources below the ground, especially as the European blackbird mainly feeds on earthworms and caterpillars (Tomialojc, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0052">1994</a>). Regarding earthworms, they can pull them out of the ground more easily as soon as the soil warms up and becomes softer.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds normally singing in a low‐frequency range might need more energy for singing in a wider frequency range and males that succeed in wider bandwidths might indicate a higher physical fitness and/or better nutrition. Both would be aspects a female might select for during courtship.</p>
