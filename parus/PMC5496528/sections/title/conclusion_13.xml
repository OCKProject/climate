 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summarizing, we found that temperature variables play an important role for all of the three investigated species, but also other weather parameters such as air pressure, atmospheric humidity, but also the amount of sunshine and wind seem to influence song trait variability. Urbanity parameters sometimes remain in the minimal models with significant 
  <span class="italic">p</span>‐values, but they seem to be less important than weather parameters. We found a tendency that the smaller the study species (body mass means: blue tit 11.7 g, great tit 19 g, blackbird 86 g; Glutz von Blotzheim, Bauer, Haffer, van den Elzen, &amp; Grüll, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0028">1993</a>), the higher the coefficients of determination of the models (
  <span class="italic">r</span>² means: blue tit 0.54, great tit 0.43, blackbird 0.29) (Pearson's product‐moment correlation: 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.93, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .23, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3). As the models are mostly fitted with weather parameters, this indicates that smaller birds might have a stronger dependency on weather parameters.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the influence of meteorological variables on song traits, it seems that different species show different song adaptations, as unlike our findings, Brumm (
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0006">2004</a>) found no effect of environmental influences on song variables of the nightingale, 
  <span class="italic">Luscinia megarhynchos</span> (C. L. Brehm, 1831), when considering air temperature and atmospheric humidity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To conclude, we could show that song parameter variability for the three investigated species is driven more by weather than by urbanity in the city of Frankfurt. Consequently, the findings raise further questions. Perhaps the three species are not only affected by climate change due to a change in vegetation and in temperatures (that have an influence on the food supply and the breeding biology of birds; Visser, Holleman, &amp; Gienapp, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0053">2006</a>), but also by a direct effect on mate attraction and on the establishment and the defense of a territory. We therefore suggest that 
  <div list-type="order" id="ece33032-list-0003" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>weather parameters should be considered in future studies and it should be examined in more depth how they influence sound transmission and perception;</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>additional weather parameters should be tested, for example, the temperature or precipitation parameters from the previous day could influence the song whereas in this study, only daily means or sums of weather variables were considered;</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>this type of study should be replicated for other cities of comparable size in order to investigate, if the lack of correlations with the volume of the ambient noise is specific to Frankfurt because of high noise pollution throughout the city or to big cities in general;</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>earlier studies should be repeated to examine, if there have been changes, or further adaptations, in the bird populations investigated at that time;</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>and as already suggested by Nemeth and Brumm (
     <a rid="ece33032-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0039">2009</a>), the extent to which hormones play a role in singing behavior (van Duyse, Pinxten, &amp; Eens, 
     <a rid="ece33032-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0017">2003</a>) and on song parameters should be examined further as well as how hormone production and balance may be different in urban compared to rural environments (Fokidis, Orchinik, &amp; Deviche, 
     <a rid="ece33032-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0022">2009</a>; Partecke, Schwabl, &amp; Gwinner, 
     <a rid="ece33032-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0040">2006</a>). There is also the possibility, as weather parameters seem to have an effect on hormone levels (Wingfield, Moore, &amp; Farner, 
     <a rid="ece33032-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0057">1983</a>), that weather parameters might in fact indirectly affect song parameters.
