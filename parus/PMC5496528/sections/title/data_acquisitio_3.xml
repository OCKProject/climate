 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The investigated species all live throughout the city of Frankfurt as well as in the forests next to the city. Their breeding periods overlap, so they sing approximately at the same time of year (Bauer, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0002">2012</a>). We recorded only male individuals as ensured by visual identification during the recording.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Frankfurt, situated in the Lower Main Plain, is one of the biggest cities in Germany with a population of over 700,000 (City of Frankfurt am Main 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0012">2015‐10‐31</a>). It has many highways (see Figure 
  <a rid="ece33032-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33032-fig-0001">1</a>) and a highly frequented airport nearby (Gil, Honarmand, Pascual, Perez‐Mena, &amp; Macías García, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0026">2015</a>). The average temperature in January is around 2 °C, the average temperature in July is above 19 °C, and the average annual temperature is above 10 °C. In the area of the Lower Main Plain, precipitation is low with 600–800 mm per year (Gedeon, Grüneberg, &amp; Mitschke, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0024">2014</a>; Hessian National Office for Environment and Geology

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To generate an urbanity gradient from urban to rural, we divided Frankfurt into three zones: city, district (the districts surrounding the city, but not the suburbs), and forest (the forests next to the city) (Figure 
  <a rid="ece33032-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33032-fig-0001">1</a>). We never recorded twice at any recording site. Differences in the degree of urbanity between the zones are represented in the volume of the noise and in the principal components of the urbanity gradient containing information on the amount of impervious surface, further on referred to as the sealing off, and the building density and height (Table 
  <a rid="ece33032-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33032-sup-0001">S2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recording period was from 2nd March to 13th June of 2015, that is, from spring to beginning of summer, which covers the breeding season of the three species. Recordings were made with a Telinga
  <span class="sup">®</span> Pro6 microphone with a 2‐mm‐thick stationary dish (22” diameter) connected to a Marantz
  <span class="sup">®</span> PMD660 Portable Solid State Recorder. As recording format, PCM‐44.1 K was chosen with a mono recording channel and a bit rate of 705.6 K. A total of 235 recordings were made, but only recordings with a sufficient number of verses were kept and measured: 39 of the blue tit, 50 of the great tit, and 71 of the blackbird. For each week, at least one recording was measured per species and per zone. The differing number of measured recordings is due to the fact that the tits, especially the blue tit, ceased singing earlier during the recording period.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All sonagraphic measurements were performed with the software Raven Pro 1.5 (Bioacoustics Research Program 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0003">2014</a>). For all recordings, we used a Hamming window with a window size of 256 samples and 50% time grid overlap. The window frame was set to 0–11 kHz, and to 0–3 s, so that the spectrogram detail was always the same. The measurement frames were set manually. The duration and the bandwidth were noted automatically. All other song parameters were measured manually or calculated (Table 
  <a rid="ece33032-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33032-tbl-0001">1</a>). For the tits, we measured five verses and, for the blackbird, we measured ten verses per male due to its versatile song.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additional data were collected at each recording site: coordinates for each site using a Garmin
  <span class="sup">®</span> GPSmap 62 and the zone and volume of the ambient noise with a Voltacraft
  <span class="sup">®</span> SL‐50 sound level meter. Urban variables that were collected included the degree, from 0 to 4, of the sealing off in a radius of 10 m around the recording site, of the building density in a radius of 50 m, and the number of floors of the highest building in the building density area. Furthermore, we noted the number of other birds singing during the recording as the number of competitors.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The map in Figure 
  <a rid="ece33032-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33032-fig-0001">1</a> was created with the “OpenStreetMap” package (Fellows &amp; Stotz, 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0021">2013</a>) in R version 3.2.1 (R Development Core Team 
  <a rid="ece33032-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33032-bib-0043">2015</a>). The lines of the zones were added afterwards.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine the influence of the weather on the songs, we downloaded data of different weather parameters (Table 
  <a rid="ece33032-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33032-tbl-0002">2</a>) from the database of the Germany’s National Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dwd.de" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.dwd.de</span>) for the recording period. We chose data from weather station 1420, which is situated at Frankfurt airport. The values were modified by summing up the millimeters of precipitation and the hours of sunshine during a given day. All other hourly values were averaged per day. We also calculated the minimum and maximum temperature per day for soil and air.
