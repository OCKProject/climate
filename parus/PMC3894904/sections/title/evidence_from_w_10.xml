 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In great tits (Husby et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">2011</a>) and red billed gulls (Teplitsky et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2008</a>), where a decline in body size was observed, there was no temporal change in breeding values. This led to the conclusion that phenotypic changes were due to plasticity. In both populations, plasticity seemed to be triggered by environmental degradation and was most likely nonadaptive, as there was no evidence of selection favouring smaller individuals. The absence of genetic changes in red billed gulls was expected, as no selection on size was detected. In the great tits populations, if anything, positive trends in breeding values could have been expected, as there was some evidence for positive selection on size.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Soay sheep (Ozgul et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">2009</a>), the decrease in size was not an evolutionary response, as selection on size was positive. In the case of the size increase in the yellow-bellied marmot, growth rates explained 52% of size changes, but selection explained only 3% of the variation, providing little support for an evolutionary response (Ozgul et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">2010</a>), although it cannot be excluded.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under directional selection, size is likely to evolve rapidly given that body size is a complex trait with large amounts of genetic variability (e.g. Marroig and Cheverud 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">2010</a>) although genetic correlations among traits may affect the pace of this response (e.g. Arnold et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">2001</a>; Kopp and Matuszewski 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">2014</a>). Strong directional pressures on size due to selective harvesting have been shown to directly drive an evolutionary decrease in body size in bighorn sheep (
  <span class="italic">Ovis canadensis</span>). The selection imposed by trophy hunting targeting males with larger horns led to a decrease in horn length and body size both at the phenotypic and genetic levels, because of a strong genetic correlation between both traits (Coltman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2003</a>). Further studies on the effect of climate change on selection patterns are needed before we can speculate more on their evolutionary consequences.
