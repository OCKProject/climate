 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nature – evolutionary or plastic – of morphological changes is important for the long-term persistence of a population (Chevin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2013</a>; Kovach-Orr and Fussmann 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">2013</a>). Adaptive plasticity can be a rapid short-term response but can be limited, for example, if the environmental change exceeds the normal range of fluctuations (de Jong 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">2005</a>; Ghalambor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">2007</a>). Evolutionary changes imply a genetic change in the population, and such changes are now acknowledged to happen fast, on ecological time scales (Thompson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b91" href="#b91">1998</a>; Hairston et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">2005</a>; Carroll et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2007</a>). Recently, there is increasing use of molecular methods to identify candidate genes under selection and subject to selective sweeps (Hoffmann and Willi 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">2008</a>; Hansen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">2012</a>). Such studies are currently scarce, but may become increasingly numerous as the cost of analyses continues to decrease for nonmodel species.
