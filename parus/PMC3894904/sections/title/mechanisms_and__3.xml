 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergmann's rule was coined over 150 years ago and despite an extensive body of research accumulated on the topic, the mechanisms behind Bergmann's rule are still controversial (Blackburn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">1999</a>; Olson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b69" href="#b69">2009</a>; Meiri 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">2011</a>; Olalla-Tarraga 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" href="#b68">2011</a>; Watt and Salewski 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b97" href="#b97">2011</a>). The original definition by Bergmann involved a heat preservation mechanism through the reduction of the surface area to volume ratio.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experiment by Barnett and Dickson (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">1984</a>) is in favour of a direct effect of temperature on size. Two lines of wild house mice (
  <span class="italic">Mus musculus</span>) were reared under two ambient temperature conditions. After 11 generations, adult males of ‘Eskimo mice’ kept at −3°C were nearly 30% heavier than control mice kept at 21°C. There was no replicate in this experiment, yet the work of Barnett and Dickson (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">1984</a>) constitutes one of the rare direct tests of Bergmann's rule in a laboratory setting for a mammal.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hypothesis of a heat preservation mechanism has received mixed support (Blackburn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">1999</a>; Stillwell 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b89" href="#b89">2010</a>), and alternative mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed latitudinal size patterns. First, in addition to a decrease in the surface area to volume ratio, an increase in body mass also leads to a decrease in metabolic rate and associated energy loss. Second, body size could be affected by multiple climatic factors, including temperature and humidity. Finally, it has been proposed that primary plant productivity (Ho et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">2010</a>) or food availability could be the main drivers of body size variation in some species. Indeed, there is some evidence that prey size availability can constrain body size in predatory mammals. Larger bodied individuals may also have an advantage at higher latitudes because they can better withstand starvation (Cushman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">1993</a>). Recently, McNab (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">2010</a>) further emphasized the role of food availability by combining different geographical clines in body size under a common ‘resource rule’. Clearly, the debate on the mechanisms underlying Bergmann's rule is not settled (e.g. Blackburn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">1999</a>; Yom-Tov and Geffen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b101" href="#b101">2011</a>), and body size is most likely affected by a number of correlated environmental factors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the context of climate change, each of these different mechanisms could lead to contrasting responses in body size. Under the heat preservation hypothesis where a colder climate leads to an increase in body size, we would predict individuals to decrease in size with increasing temperature. In contrast, under the starvation resistance hypothesis where a larger body size increases resistance to starvation, we would expect an increase in size because temperature and rainfall are expected to become more unpredictable in the future (Goodman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">2012</a>). If Bergmann's rule was in part linked with gradients in food abundance or quality, then predicting the impact of climate change on body size becomes challenging, as this impact will depend on the responses of each individual compartments of the ecosystem (e.g. resources, consumers and predators, Sheridan and Bickford 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b85" href="#b85">2011</a>). The inability to make simple, clear predictions about body size changes in response to climate change further emphasizes that the adaptive nature of a size change cannot be inferred from patterns only (conformity or not to Bergmann's rule), and that estimating selection pressures acting on size is key to understand these trends.
