 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is evidence that selection for body size is more often positive, but there are also many nonsignificant and negative estimates of selection on body size (Kingsolver et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">2012</a>). However, we know very little about temporal patterns of variation in selection (Siepielski et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b86" href="#b86">2009</a>; Morrissey and Hadfield 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" href="#b66">2012</a>). Furthermore, there is very little information about selection patterns in relation to environmental factors, as it is very difficult to gain enough power to estimate selection accurately across years (Kingsolver et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">2012</a>). However, a couple of studies suggest that climate can be a strong driver of selection.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In their emblematic studies, Grant and Grant (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2002</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">2003</a>) showed that severe drought affected availability of food type for Darwin Finches (
  <span class="italic">Geospiza fortis</span>) on Daphne Major in the Gal√°pagos Islands. This shift in food type from small to hard large seeds imposed strong selection on beak shape, leading to rapid and strong evolutionary responses. Similarly, a model developed for desert birds predicted that a heat wave may select for larger body size as smaller birds will be more at risk from dehydration (McKechnie and Wolf 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">2010</a>). Both Darwin's finches and desert birds represent populations evolving in extreme environments. In more temperate environments, Jiguet et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">2006</a>) investigated the factors underlying bird population resilience to the heat wave of 2003 in France. They found that population resilience was explained by the thermal range of the species and not by body mass. Body mass was not correlated either with the species thermal range. Although data are still scarce, it does not appear that extreme climatic events select for smaller individuals.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While models of climate change predict an increase in the frequency of extreme climatic event, the impact of less extreme but sustained long-term changes (e.g. changes in mean temperature or average rain fall), can also be important in shaping selection patterns. For example, milder winters reduced selection against small individuals in Soay sheep, which partially explained the decrease in average size (Ozgul et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">2009</a>). A recent study on cliff swallows 
  <span class="italic">(Petrochelidon pyrrhonota)</span> found that normal climate variations could drive variation in selection patterns (Brown et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">2013</a>). In this system, stabilizing selection on tarsus length was stronger during cold, wet years, but there was no obvious increase in selection for smaller size during warm years.
