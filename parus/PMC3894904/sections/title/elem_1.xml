  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first assessed the prevalence of patterns that fit Bergmann's rule in time, that is, a direct correlation between body size and temperature, or more broadly, a temporal trend of decrease in body size in a locality where temperature had been increasing. We performed a search in ISI Web of Science. As this search was aimed at evaluating the conclusions of studies investigating Bergmann's clines and not size changes in general, the search was limited to the keywords ‘Bergmann + Climate Change’ OR ‘Bergmann + Global warming’. This search brought 105 references. We retrieved two more references with an additional search performed in Google Scholar using the keywords ‘body size + climate warming’, limited to the last 5 years. Of the 107 studies we found, we excluded papers focusing on past climate changes at a paleontological scale (i.e. predating recent climate warming) as well as studies focusing on geographical clines, thus focusing solely on studies reporting temporal size trends within a population over the last century. This resulted in 22 references (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S1</a>). For each of these papers, we then assessed whether the detected trends were in agreement with Bergmann's rule, and if these size trends were correlated with temperature.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, there was mixed evidence for Bergmann's rule in response to recent climate warming (Tables 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">S1</a>). When considering all trait and species combinations, patterns differed between birds and mammals (Fisher's exact test: 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01). Patterns in support of Bergmann's rule were found in 60% of the 566 cases in birds, but only in 7% of the 79 cases in mammals. This is in line with Gardner et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">2011</a>) who emphasized the heterogeneity of responses to climate warming among species. Mammals and birds may respond differently to environmental changes. In fact, Yom-Tov and Geffen (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b101" href="#b101">2011</a>) already noted such a discrepancy between birds and mammals. Negative trends in birds were often interpreted as adaptation to climate change following Bergmann's rule's original mechanism (Yom-Tov 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b100" href="#b100">2001</a>), whereas positive trends in mammals were thought to reflect an increase in food abundance due to human activities (e.g. Yom-Tov et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b105" href="#b105">2006a</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b109" href="#b109">2010b</a>). However, the actual mechanisms and selection pressures underlying the shifts in size were not investigated in these studies.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body size can be estimated from several metrics, such as wing length, skull dimensions or body mass. (e.g. Damuth and McFadden 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">1990</a>; Yom-Tov and Geffen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b101" href="#b101">2011</a>). In many of the studies reviewed here, multiple traits were investigated within the same population, and the majority of these studies revealed different trends depending on the trait investigated. This suggests that the choice of metrics has a strong impact on the type of response observed. For example, some linear measurements such as tail, foot or tarsus length are expected to decrease under colder climate to limit heat loss in body extremities (Allen's rule, Allen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" href="#b1">1877</a>), opposing Bergmann's rule. Sexual selection is also known to influence body size, or the size of some specific morphological traits in many species (Andersson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">1994</a>). Conflicting selection pressures may thus act on different sets of morphological traits. Blackburn et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">1999</a>) advocated using mass preferentially, as it is a better reflection of the overall body size. When we restricted our study to those investigating body mass, we still found differences between birds and mammals (Fisher's exact test 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01). Evidence for size declines was stronger in birds (80% of cases) but still weak in mammals (1 / 5, 20% of cases). Yet, most of these studies did not report the actual slope estimates for the relations between size and time or temperature. Thus, we could not formally test for an effect of the trait investigated on the likelihood of detecting a temporal trend in that trait.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With these data, it remains difficult to evaluate the generality of temporal size changes. Meiri et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">2009</a>) found little evidence of any change in size in 22 species of carnivorous mammals. Building on the lack of pattern in their study, the authors suggested that there was in fact a potential publication bias towards studies reporting only significant trends. In their study, however, sexual dimorphism was present in a majority of the species considered (Appendix S3 in Meiri et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">2009</a>) and could have masked a temporal trend. For instance, Post et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" href="#b76">1999</a>) found that sexual dimorphism resulted in divergent temporal size trends in the red deer in Norway. Males increased while female decreased in size in response to direct and indirect effects of climate warming over the last 30 years. Altogether, data are still lacking to assess the overall prevalence and direction of temporal size trends in the context of recent global change (Meiri et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">2009</a>; Gardner et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">2011</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergmann's rule was coined over 150 years ago and despite an extensive body of research accumulated on the topic, the mechanisms behind Bergmann's rule are still controversial (Blackburn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">1999</a>; Olson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b69" href="#b69">2009</a>; Meiri

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" href="#b68">2011</a>; Watt and Salewski 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b97" href="#b97">2011</a>). The original definition by Bergmann involved a heat preservation mechanism through the reduction of the surface area to volume ratio.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experiment by Barnett and Dickson (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">1984</a>) is in favour of a direct effect of temperature on size. Two lines of wild house mice (
   <span class="italic">Mus musculus</span>) were reared under two ambient temperature conditions. After 11 generations, adult males of ‘Eskimo mice’ kept at −3°C were nearly 30% heavier than control mice kept at 21°C. There was no replicate in this experiment, yet the work of Barnett and Dickson (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">1984</a>) constitutes one of the rare direct tests of Bergmann's rule in a laboratory setting for a mammal.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hypothesis of a heat preservation mechanism has received mixed support (Blackburn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">1999</a>; Stillwell 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b89" href="#b89">2010</a>), and alternative mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed latitudinal size patterns. First, in addition to a decrease in the surface area to volume ratio, an increase in body mass also leads to a decrease in metabolic rate and associated energy loss. Second, body size could be affected by multiple climatic factors, including temperature and humidity. Finally, it has been proposed that primary plant productivity (Ho et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">2010</a>) or food availability could be the main drivers of body size variation in some species. Indeed, there is some evidence that prey size availability can constrain body size in predatory mammals. Larger bodied individuals may also have an advantage at higher latitudes because they can better withstand starvation (Cushman et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">1993</a>). Recently, McNab (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">2010</a>) further emphasized the role of food availability by combining different geographical clines in body size under a common ‘resource rule’. Clearly, the debate on the mechanisms underlying Bergmann's rule is not settled (e.g. Blackburn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">1999</a>; Yom-Tov and Geffen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b101" href="#b101">2011</a>), and body size is most likely affected by a number of correlated environmental factors.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the context of climate change, each of these different mechanisms could lead to contrasting responses in body size. Under the heat preservation hypothesis where a colder climate leads to an increase in body size, we would predict individuals to decrease in size with increasing temperature. In contrast, under the starvation resistance hypothesis where a larger body size increases resistance to starvation, we would expect an increase in size because temperature and rainfall are expected to become more unpredictable in the future (Goodman et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">2012</a>). If Bergmann's rule was in part linked with gradients in food abundance or quality, then predicting the impact of climate change on body size becomes challenging, as this impact will depend on the responses of each individual compartments of the ecosystem (e.g. resources, consumers and predators, Sheridan and Bickford 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b85" href="#b85">2011</a>). The inability to make simple, clear predictions about body size changes in response to climate change further emphasizes that the adaptive nature of a size change cannot be inferred from patterns only (conformity or not to Bergmann's rule), and that estimating selection pressures acting on size is key to understand these trends.
