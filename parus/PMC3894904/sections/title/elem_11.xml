  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An adaptive plastic response to climate change is a developmental change triggered by a change in temperature or a related climatic factor, that leads to increased fitness (see section above ‘are these trends adaptive?’). Several methods can be used to investigate phenotypic plasticity. One approach is to use of common garden experiments (also recommended by Urban and Phillips 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b92" href="#b92">2014</a>), where individuals from the same population can be submitted to different environmental conditions, or the opposite (several populations, one experimental environmental conditions). There are very few examples in which the effect of temperature on body mass was directly tested in an experimental setting for mammals (see also Barnett and Dickson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">1984</a>). Riek and Geiser (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b82" href="#b82">2012</a>) induced a larger size (both head length and body length) in fat-tailed dunnarts (
   <span class="italic">Sminthopsis crassicaudata</span>) reared in a cold environment (16°C) compared to individuals reared in a warm environment (22°C). No other experimental evidence for developmental phenotypic plasticity induced by exposure to cold has been done for birds or mammals but generally, this experiment suggests that developmental plasticity in response to temperature is possible.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When experiments are not practical, other methods are available for analysing long-term population trends in the wild. First, the animal model allows us to assess plasticity: a phenotypic trend in the absence of a genetic changes implies plasticity. A second approach is to detect fine grain responses, given that plasticity allows a rapid response that closely tracks environmental variations. One possibility is to assess if temperature explains better variation in size than time alone, as done by Charmantier et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">2008</a>) for laying date in great tits. In their study of the stone marten (
   <span class="italic">Martes foina</span>) in Denmark, Yom-Tov et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b108" href="#b108">2010a</a>) found that there was no overall significant size decrease over the last 150 years. A closer look at the data revealed that skull size decreased during two periods of temperature increase that were separated by a short cooling period. Despite the correlation, these size decreases were not significantly related with mean annual temperature. A third, more direct, approach is the analysis of individual plasticity by (i) using a derivation of the Price equation to directly estimate the contribution of plasticity to a trait change in a variable environment (Coulson and Tuljapurkar 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2008</a>) or (ii) using within-subject centring, a statistical procedure that can discriminate within- from between-subject effects, and can thus be used to distinguish population from individual plasticity (Van de Pol and Wright 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b94" href="#b94">2009</a>). Using a similar approach, Phillimore et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b74" href="#b74">2010</a>) compared intra- and interpopulations responses to temperature to assess whether local adaptation or plasticity were explaining differences in spawning date among 
   <span class="italic">Rana temporaria</span> in Britain. This approach, however, is not commonly used, because most field studies focus on within-population variability and not among-population variability.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our data set, we retrieved four studies that assessed the nature of temporal size trends (Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" href="#tbl2">2</a>), and all concluded to an environmentally induced response. Size decreases in red billed gulls (Teplitsky et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2008</a>) and great tits (Husby et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">2011</a>) were not due to microevolutionary change but to nonadaptive plasticity. The decline in size of Soay sheep (Ozgul et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">2009</a>) and increase in size of the yellow-bellied marmots (Ozgul et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">2010</a>) were both due to plastic responses to changing environmental conditions, mostly affecting growth rates. The decrease in size in Soay sheep was density-dependent, with increased survival in slow growing individuals and increasing population density which negatively influenced lamb growth rates (Ozgul et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">2009</a>). The increase in body mass in the yellow-bellied marmot resulted from a longer growing season due to shifts in the phenology of individuals (e.g. an earlier weaning of offspring and earlier emergence from hibernation, Ozgul et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">2010</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In wild populations, it is essential to identify the factors that trigger the plastic response to understand the effects of phenotypic changes on population persistence. Many factors other than temperature can influence body size, and a phenotypic temporal trend in a locality where temperature is increasing does not provide sufficient evidence of a response to climate change. Assessing whether size trends are a response to climate change is challenging for at least two reasons.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, climate change can affect body size through both direct (e.g. a decrease in heat loss during milder winters which allows for an increased energetic allocation towards growth) and indirect effects (e.g. shorter winter and increased length of the growing season providing a longer access to food resources). A correlation between body size and temperature may not be apparent if the temporal size trend is linked to indirect effects of climate change, but this would not rule out a response to climate change. For example, in the Dutch great tit population, the body size decline observed in the past 29 years was not correlated with temperature at the breeding grounds, but was at least partially explained by the mismatch between hatching date and peak of food abundance (caterpillars, Husby et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">2011</a>). This temporal mismatch increased during the study period and was a consequence of climate change. Another example of the indirect effect of climate change is the decrease in body size in polar bears (
   <span class="italic">Ursus maritimus</span>) between 1982 and 2006 in the Beaufort Sea, Alaska, due to the lower availability of sea ice, their optimal habitat (Rode et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b83" href="#b83">2010</a>). Disentangling direct and indirect effects of climate change is not straightforward and requires extensive knowledge of the study system.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, a correlation between size and temperature may arise because both are changing through time but without a causal link between them. In red billed gulls, the body size decrease was correlated with a temperature anomaly in New Zealand (Teplitsky et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2008</a>). Survival was also declining in this population (Teplitsky et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2008</a>), but the decreased survival rate did not correlate with temperature (A. Robert &amp; J. A. Mills, unpubl. res.), suggesting that an environmental stressor other than temperature, is acting on this population. In the context of rapid global change, several possibly interacting factors (e.g. food abundance, hunting pressure) may be varying at the same time and influencing body size. Teasing apart the relative influences of different factors on body size change in natural populations can be challenging. For example, the same phenotypic response within the same species could be due to different factors among populations. In the European otter (
   <span class="italic">Lutra lutra</span>), both Swedish and Norwegian populations showed an increase in size through time. In the Swedish populations, this was attributed to decreased ice cover and longer fishing periods (Yom-Tov et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b109" href="#b109">2010b</a>), while this increase in their Norwegian conspecifics would be related with increased food availability due to fish farming (Yom-Tov et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b105" href="#b105">2006a</a>).
