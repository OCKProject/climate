  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To demonstrate an evolutionary response to climate change, genetic changes in response to selection pressures triggered by climate change need to be detected. In wild populations, the animal model is a commonly used tool to assess whether phenotypic shifts have a genetic or plastic basis (Kruuk 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">2004</a>). The animal model is a linear mixed model where one of the random effects is the identity of the individual, linked to its pedigree. The pedigree contains information about relatedness among individuals in the population. This approach allows disentangling the portion of phenotypic variation due to additive genetic variance from other sources of variance. The animal model also allows for the estimation of individual genetic value known as breeding values (Kruuk 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">2004</a>; Wilson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b99" href="#b99">2010</a>). A change in these values through time can be interpreted as a change in the genetic composition of the population. If immigration and drift can be excluded, a change in breeding values consistent with the expected change based on selection patterns can be interpreted as microevolution. Several caveats surround the use of the animal model (Postma 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b77" href="#b77">2006</a>; Postma and Charmantier 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b78" href="#b78">2007</a>; Hadfield et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">2010</a>), notably when accounting for errors in the estimation of breeding values (Hadfield et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">2010</a>; Wilson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b99" href="#b99">2010</a>). However provided these are properly accounted for (e.g. using MCMCglmm, Hadfield 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">2010</a>), the animal model remains a useful tool. Detecting temporal trends in breeding values is essential to assess whether there is an evolutionary change. Even if phenotypic selection is detected on a heritable trait, microevolutionary responses may not occur, due to genetic correlations among traits that can slow down or prevent a response to selection (Price and Langen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b80" href="#b80">1992</a>; Walsh and Blows 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b95" href="#b95">2009</a>), or because selection is acting on the environmental and not on the genetic component of the trait (Price et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b81" href="#b81">1988</a>; Merilä et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">2001b</a>; Morrissey et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" href="#b67">2010</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison to predictions based on the direction of selection (Method 3 in Merilä and Hendry 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">2014</a>) allows us, to some extent, to infer genetic changes. While a trend in the direction predicted by selection does not allow us to tease apart evolution from plasticity, the plastic nature of a change is apparent if the change occurs in the opposite direction of what is predicted by the direction of selection. In the latter case, however, a genetic change could occur but be masked by an environmental trend (Merilä et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">2001a</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">b</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In great tits (Husby et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">2011</a>) and red billed gulls (Teplitsky et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2008</a>), where a decline in body size was observed, there was no temporal change in breeding values. This led to the conclusion that phenotypic changes were due to plasticity. In both populations, plasticity seemed to be triggered by environmental degradation and was most likely nonadaptive, as there was no evidence of selection favouring smaller individuals. The absence of genetic changes in red billed gulls was expected, as no selection on size was detected. In the great tits populations, if anything, positive trends in breeding values could have been expected, as there was some evidence for positive selection on size.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Soay sheep (Ozgul et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">2009</a>), the decrease in size was not an evolutionary response, as selection on size was positive. In the case of the size increase in the yellow-bellied marmot, growth rates explained 52% of size changes, but selection explained only 3% of the variation, providing little support for an evolutionary response (Ozgul et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">2010</a>), although it cannot be excluded.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under directional selection, size is likely to evolve rapidly given that body size is a complex trait with large amounts of genetic variability (e.g. Marroig and Cheverud 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">2010</a>) although genetic correlations among traits may affect the pace of this response (e.g. Arnold et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">2001</a>; Kopp and Matuszewski 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">2014</a>). Strong directional pressures on size due to selective harvesting have been shown to directly drive an evolutionary decrease in body size in bighorn sheep (
   <span class="italic">Ovis canadensis</span>). The selection imposed by trophy hunting targeting males with larger horns led to a decrease in horn length and body size both at the phenotypic and genetic levels, because of a strong genetic correlation between both traits (Coltman et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2003</a>). Further studies on the effect of climate change on selection patterns are needed before we can speculate more on their evolutionary consequences.
