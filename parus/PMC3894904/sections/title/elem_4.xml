  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence for adaptive size changes</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the complexity of mechanisms driving body size variation, the adaptive nature of size changes needs to be evaluated for each specific case, if we are to understand their evolutionary consequences on population dynamics and persistence. Demonstrating the adaptive nature of climate-induced size changes requires an assessment of how much fitness increases with this phenotypic change under new environmental conditions, that is, an assessment of how climate influences patterns of natural selection. As emphasized by Merilä and Hendry (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">2014</a>), many methods to quantify selection, such as resurrection and reciprocal transplants, cannot easily be implemented with birds and mammals. To date, one of the most powerful tools to investigate the adaptive nature of responses in wild bird and mammal populations is the analysis of natural selection in long-term individual-based longitudinal data sets (Clutton-Brock and Sheldon 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">2010</a>). Such data allow the assessment of phenotypic selection on multiple traits, by regressing fitness (e.g. survival and / or fecundity) against phenotypic traits (Lande and Arnold 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">1983</a>). More recently, Coulson and Tuljapurkar (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2008</a>) showed that a derivation of the Price equation (Price 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b79" href="#b79">1970</a>) in age structured populations can be used in a longitudinal data set to assess not only the part of the trait change due to selection through change in survival and fecundity, but also the contribution of other processes in a variable environment (e.g. change in growth rate, plasticity).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So far, the evidence for the adaptive nature of size changes is weak and selection is rarely estimated in studies investigating climate-related size declines (Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" href="#tbl2">2</a>). In our review, three studies showed a size decline and investigated selection on size using long-term data with individually marked individuals. None of these studies found evidence of selection for smaller size. In red billed gulls (
   <span class="italic">Chroicocephalus scopulinus</span>), no selection on body mass was detected over 40 years (Teplitsky et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2008</a>). In contrast, selection on size (tarsus length or body mass) in great tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) over 29 years was mostly positive (or non significant, depending on the population), and there was no evidence for a temporal change in selection during the study period (Husby et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">2011</a>). Similarly, in Soay sheep (
   <span class="italic">Ovis aries</span>), selection for body mass was positive (Wilson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b98" href="#b98">2007</a>; Gratten et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">2010</a>) but selection explained only a small fraction of body mass variation over the last 20 years (Ozgul et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">2009</a>). The lack of significant selection for smaller size in these systems is sufficient to exclude the possibility that the size decrease is adaptive. This is not to say that shifts in body size are always nonadaptive. For instance, in the yellow-bellied marmot (
   <span class="italic">Marmota flaviventris</span>), an increase in size observed since 2000 was associated with increased survival and breeding success in the later years of the study, resulting in an abrupt increase in population size (Ozgul et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">2010</a>). Van Buskirk et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b93" href="#b93">2010</a>) suggested the possibility of selection for smaller size in bird species showing a size decrease. In this case, selection on size was estimated by comparing measurements in autumn and the following spring for spring migrants, and averaged across all years. They found some evidence for negative selection on mass but not on wing chord. However, the correlation between selection and size trends was more robust for wing chord than for mass, indicating the adaptive nature of these trends has yet to be confirmed.

More importantly, more data are needed to better understand how climatic factors shape selection pressures.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Patterns of selection on size</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is evidence that selection for body size is more often positive, but there are also many nonsignificant and negative estimates of selection on body size (Kingsolver et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">2012</a>). However, we know very little about temporal patterns of variation in selection (Siepielski et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b86" href="#b86">2009</a>; Morrissey and Hadfield 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" href="#b66">2012</a>). Furthermore, there is very little information about selection patterns in relation to environmental factors, as it is very difficult to gain enough power to estimate selection accurately across years (Kingsolver et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">2012</a>). However, a couple of studies suggest that climate can be a strong driver of selection.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In their emblematic studies, Grant and Grant (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2002</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">2003</a>) showed that severe drought affected availability of food type for Darwin Finches (
   <span class="italic">Geospiza fortis</span>) on Daphne Major in the Galápagos Islands. This shift in food type from small to hard large seeds imposed strong selection on beak shape, leading to rapid and strong evolutionary responses. Similarly, a model developed for desert birds predicted that a heat wave may select for larger body size as smaller birds will be more at risk from dehydration (McKechnie and Wolf 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">2010</a>). Both Darwin's finches and desert birds represent populations evolving in extreme environments. In more temperate environments, Jiguet et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">2006</a>) investigated the factors underlying bird population resilience to the heat wave of 2003 in France. They found that population resilience was explained by the thermal range of the species and not by body mass. Body mass was not correlated either with the species thermal range. Although data are still scarce, it does not appear that extreme climatic events select for smaller individuals.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While models of climate change predict an increase in the frequency of extreme climatic event, the impact of less extreme but sustained long-term changes (e.g. changes in mean temperature or average rain fall), can also be important in shaping selection patterns. For example, milder winters reduced selection against small individuals in Soay sheep, which partially explained the decrease in average size (Ozgul et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">2009</a>). A recent study on cliff swallows 
   <span class="italic">(Petrochelidon pyrrhonota)</span> found that normal climate variations could drive variation in selection patterns (Brown et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">2013</a>). In this system, stabilizing selection on tarsus length was stronger during cold, wet years, but there was no obvious increase in selection for smaller size during warm years.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nature – evolutionary or plastic – of morphological changes is important for the long-term persistence of a population (Chevin et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2013</a>; Kovach-Orr and Fussmann 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">2013</a>). Adaptive plasticity can be a rapid short-term response but can be limited, for example, if the environmental change exceeds the normal range of fluctuations (de Jong 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">2005</a>; Ghalambor et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">2007</a>). Evolutionary changes imply a genetic change in the population, and such changes are now acknowledged to happen fast, on ecological time scales (Thompson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b91" href="#b91">1998</a>; Hairston et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">2005</a>; Carroll et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2007</a>). Recently, there is increasing use of molecular methods to identify candidate genes under selection and subject to selective sweeps (Hoffmann and Willi 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">2008</a>; Hansen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">2012</a>). Such studies are currently scarce, but may become increasingly numerous as the cost of analyses continues to decrease for nonmodel species.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this review, of the 19 studies showing a size trend, only two formally investigated the plastic or evolutionary basis of size change in response to climate change (Table

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To demonstrate an evolutionary response to climate change, genetic changes in response to selection pressures triggered by climate change need to be detected. In wild populations, the animal model is a commonly used tool to assess whether phenotypic shifts have a genetic or plastic basis (Kruuk 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">2004</a>). The animal model is a linear mixed model where one of the random effects is the identity of the individual, linked to its pedigree. The pedigree contains information about relatedness among individuals in the population. This approach allows disentangling the portion of phenotypic variation due to additive genetic variance from other sources of variance. The animal model also allows for the estimation of individual genetic value known as breeding values (Kruuk 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">2004</a>; Wilson et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b99" href="#b99">2010</a>). A change in these values through time can be interpreted as a change in the genetic composition of the population. If immigration and drift can be excluded, a change in breeding values consistent with the expected change based on selection patterns can be interpreted as microevolution. Several caveats surround the use of the animal model (Postma 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b77" href="#b77">2006</a>; Postma and Charmantier 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b78" href="#b78">2007</a>; Hadfield et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">2010</a>), notably when accounting for errors in the estimation of breeding values (Hadfield et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">2010</a>; Wilson et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b99" href="#b99">2010</a>). However provided these are properly accounted for (e.g. using MCMCglmm, Hadfield 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">2010</a>), the animal model remains a useful tool. Detecting temporal trends in breeding values is essential to assess whether there is an evolutionary change. Even if phenotypic selection is detected on a heritable trait, microevolutionary responses may not occur, due to genetic correlations among traits that can slow down or prevent a response to selection (Price and Langen 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b80" href="#b80">1992</a>; Walsh and Blows 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b95" href="#b95">2009</a>), or because selection is acting on the environmental and not on the genetic component of the trait (Price et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b81" href="#b81">1988</a>; Merilä et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">2001b</a>; Morrissey et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" href="#b67">2010</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison to predictions based on the direction of selection (Method 3 in Merilä and Hendry 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">2014</a>) allows us, to some extent, to infer genetic changes. While a trend in the direction predicted by selection does not allow us to tease apart evolution from plasticity, the plastic nature of a change is apparent if the change occurs in the opposite direction of what is predicted by the direction of selection. In the latter case, however, a genetic change could occur but be masked by an environmental trend (Merilä et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">2001a</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">b</a>).

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">2011</a>) and red billed gulls (Teplitsky et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2008</a>), where a decline in body size was observed, there was no temporal change in breeding values. This led to the conclusion that phenotypic changes were due to plasticity. In both populations, plasticity seemed to be triggered by environmental degradation and was most likely nonadaptive, as there was no evidence of selection favouring smaller individuals. The absence of genetic changes in red billed gulls was expected, as no selection on size was detected. In the great tits populations, if anything, positive trends in breeding values could have been expected, as there was some evidence for positive selection on size.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Soay sheep (Ozgul et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">2009</a>), the decrease in size was not an evolutionary response, as selection on size was positive. In the case of the size increase in the yellow-bellied marmot, growth rates explained 52% of size changes, but selection explained only 3% of the variation, providing little support for an evolutionary response (Ozgul et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">2010</a>), although it cannot be excluded.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under directional selection, size is likely to evolve rapidly given that body size is a complex trait with large amounts of genetic variability (e.g. Marroig and Cheverud 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">2010</a>) although genetic correlations among traits may affect the pace of this response (e.g. Arnold et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">2001</a>; Kopp and Matuszewski 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">2014</a>). Strong directional pressures on size due to selective harvesting have been shown to directly drive an evolutionary decrease in body size in bighorn sheep (
    <span class="italic">Ovis canadensis</span>). The selection imposed by trophy hunting targeting males with larger horns led to a decrease in horn length and body size both at the phenotypic and genetic levels, because of a strong genetic correlation between both traits (Coltman et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2003</a>). Further studies on the effect of climate change on selection patterns are needed before we can speculate more on their evolutionary consequences.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Methods</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An adaptive plastic response to climate change is a developmental change triggered by a change in temperature or a related climatic factor, that leads to increased fitness (see section above ‘are these trends adaptive?’). Several methods can be used to investigate phenotypic plasticity. One approach is to use of common garden experiments (also recommended by Urban and Phillips 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b92" href="#b92">2014</a>), where individuals from the same population can be submitted to different environmental conditions, or the opposite (several populations, one experimental environmental conditions). There are very few examples in which the effect of temperature on body mass was directly tested in an experimental setting for mammals (see also Barnett and Dickson 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">1984</a>). Riek and Geiser (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b82" href="#b82">2012</a>) induced a larger size (both head length and body length) in fat-tailed dunnarts (
    <span class="italic">Sminthopsis crassicaudata</span>) reared in a cold environment (16°C) compared to individuals reared in a warm environment (22°C). No other experimental evidence for developmental phenotypic plasticity induced by exposure to cold has been done for birds or mammals but generally, this experiment suggests that developmental plasticity in response to temperature is possible.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When experiments are not practical, other methods are available for analysing long-term population trends in the wild. First, the animal model allows us to assess plasticity: a phenotypic trend in the absence of a genetic changes implies plasticity. A second approach is to detect fine grain responses, given that plasticity allows a rapid response that closely tracks environmental variations. One possibility is to assess if temperature explains better variation in size than time alone, as done by Charmantier et al. (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">2008</a>) for laying date in great tits. In their study of the stone marten (
    <span class="italic">Martes foina</span>) in Denmark, Yom-Tov et al. (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b108" href="#b108">2010a</a>) found that there was no overall significant size decrease over the last 150 years. A closer look at the data revealed that skull size decreased during two periods of temperature increase that were separated by a short cooling period. Despite the correlation, these size decreases were not significantly related with mean annual temperature. A third, more direct, approach is the analysis of individual plasticity by (i) using a derivation of the Price equation to directly estimate the contribution of plasticity to a trait change in a variable environment (Coulson and Tuljapurkar 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2008</a>) or (ii) using within-subject centring, a statistical procedure that can discriminate within- from between-subject effects, and can thus be used to distinguish population from individual plasticity (Van de Pol and Wright 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b94" href="#b94">2009</a>). Using a similar approach, Phillimore et al. (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b74" href="#b74">2010</a>) compared intra- and interpopulations responses to temperature to assess whether local adaptation or plasticity were explaining differences in spawning date among 
    <span class="italic">Rana temporaria</span> in Britain. This approach, however, is not commonly used, because most field studies focus on within-population variability and not among-population variability.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Insights from wild populations</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our data set, we retrieved four studies that assessed the nature of temporal size trends (Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" href="#tbl2">2</a>), and all concluded to an environmentally induced response. Size decreases in red billed gulls (Teplitsky et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2008</a>) and great tits (Husby et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">2011</a>) were not due to microevolutionary change but to nonadaptive plasticity. The decline in size of Soay sheep (Ozgul et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">2009</a>) and increase in size of the yellow-bellied marmots (Ozgul et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">2010</a>) were both due to plastic responses to changing environmental conditions, mostly affecting growth rates. The decrease in size in Soay sheep was density-dependent, with increased survival in slow growing individuals and increasing population density which negatively influenced lamb growth rates (Ozgul et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">2009</a>). The increase in body mass in the yellow-bellied marmot resulted from a longer growing season due to shifts in the phenology of individuals (e.g. an earlier weaning of offspring and earlier emergence from hibernation, Ozgul et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">2010</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In wild populations, it is essential to identify the factors that trigger the plastic response to understand the effects of phenotypic changes on population persistence. Many factors other than temperature can influence body size, and a phenotypic temporal trend in a locality where temperature is increasing does not provide sufficient evidence of a response to climate change. Assessing whether size trends are a response to climate change is challenging for at least two reasons.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, climate change can affect body size through both direct (e.g. a decrease in heat loss during milder winters which allows for an increased energetic allocation towards growth) and indirect effects (e.g. shorter winter and increased length of the growing season providing a longer access to food resources). A correlation between body size and temperature may not be apparent if the temporal size trend is linked to indirect effects of climate change, but this would not rule out a response to climate change. For example, in the Dutch great tit population, the body size decline observed in the past 29 years was not correlated with temperature at the breeding grounds, but was at least partially explained by the mismatch between hatching date and peak of food abundance (caterpillars, Husby et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">2011</a>). This temporal mismatch increased during the study period and was a consequence of climate change. Another example of the indirect effect of climate change is the decrease in body size in polar bears (
    <span class="italic">Ursus maritimus</span>) between 1982 and 2006 in the Beaufort Sea, Alaska, due to the lower availability of sea ice, their optimal habitat (Rode et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b83" href="#b83">2010</a>). Disentangling direct and indirect effects of climate change is not straightforward and requires extensive knowledge of the study system.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, a correlation between size and temperature may arise because both are changing through time but without a causal link between them. In red billed gulls, the body size decrease was correlated with a temperature anomaly in New Zealand (Teplitsky et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2008</a>). Survival was also declining in this population (Teplitsky et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2008</a>), but the decreased survival rate did not correlate with temperature (A. Robert &amp; J. A. Mills, unpubl. res.), suggesting that an environmental stressor other than temperature, is acting on this population. In the context of rapid global change, several possibly interacting factors (e.g. food abundance, hunting pressure) may be varying at the same time and influencing body size. Teasing apart the relative influences of different factors on body size change in natural populations can be challenging. For example, the same phenotypic response within the same species could be due to different factors among populations. In the European otter (
    <span class="italic">Lutra lutra</span>), both Swedish and Norwegian populations showed an increase in size through time. In the Swedish populations, this was attributed to decreased ice cover and longer fishing periods (Yom-Tov et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b109" href="#b109">2010b</a>), while this increase in their Norwegian conspecifics would be related with increased food availability due to fish farming (Yom-Tov et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b105" href="#b105">2006a</a>).
