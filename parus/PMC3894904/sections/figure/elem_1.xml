  <p>A theoretical framework for the effect of study scales on Bergmann's rule in space and time; 
   <span class="italic">X</span>-axis: temperature observed across either a geographical gradient or a temporal gradient; 
   <span class="italic">Y</span>-axis: body size. Each dot represents an individual. The dotted lines represent reaction norms at the population level. At the population level, there is no relation between body size and temperature, as the gradient in temperature within a population may be too low to detect such a pattern. However, individuals are still selected for an optimal temperature. Bergmann's rule, the decrease in body size with temperature is a pattern emerging at larger geographical or temporal scales.
