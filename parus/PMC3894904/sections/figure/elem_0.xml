  <p>The temperature gradients (spatial versus temporal) over which size trends were quantified; Data for geographical gradients are from the reviews of Ashton et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">2000</a>) for mammals, and Ashton (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" href="#b4">2002</a>) for birds. If the temperature gradient was not directly reported in the study, it was estimated from the latitudinal gradient. Data for temporal gradients are from this review. We used the global change in temperature anomaly to estimate the change in temperature when it was not readily available from the publication. On average, geographical trends were studied over a temperature gradient of 12.29
   <span class="bold">°</span>C, a gradient significantly larger than the recent climate warming (average temperature increase of 0.93
