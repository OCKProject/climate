 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study population is located in the river Lyngdalselva in southernmost Norway (58° 08′–58° 40′N, 6° 56′–7° 20′E) and has been studied since 1978. Monitoring of the population is standardised (see
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span> for details). The river system of Lyngdalselva is not utilised for hydropower production or subject to other major regulations and there are no nest boxes available for breeding. It is thus a natural system for studying dipper ecology where natural nest sites are complemented by nest sites in and under bridges and other manmade structures. The study system contains a strong altitudinal gradient in addition to being located along a coastal-inland gradient, ranging from the coastal zone to 60 km inland and 700 m a.s.l. Dippers defend territories which contain one or more appropriate nest sites, which are situated so that the opening of the nest is almost always located right above fast-flowing water. Because suitable nest sites are limited and spatially segregated, there is a limited number of territories available in the river system. Within the river system we have identified a total of 158 spatially separated territories. While some of them are always occupied (34 years), others are only used a single year. It is therefore clear that some territories are preferred over others. The downstream and upstream boundaries might fluctuate slightly between years, particularly depending on whether the upstream or downstream neighbouring territories are occupied or not, but the major part of the territory will remain constant between years. The size of the study population has ranged from 20 to 117 breeding pairs over the years

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. The number of breeding pairs with recorded phenology data is 1045, out of 2264 pairs with recorded first clutches (renesting attempts and second broods excluded). Breeding phenology was estimated as the hatching date of the first clutch of a female, according to the methods described in
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. In summary, hatching date was estimated based on the growth trajectory of the largest nestling in each brood. This implies that the phenology of nests that did not produce young, or produced young that were not measured, could not be estimated by this method. Breeding dippers were aged and sexed according to Svensson
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. At first encounter, breeding birds were ringed with an aluminium ring and given an individual colour code in the form of two plastic colour rings (95%). Consequently, birds did not have to be recaptured after ringing. Within the river system, the breeding outcome of almost all occupied nests was known and nearly all young were ringed.

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Laying date could have been estimated based on hatching, the length of the incubation period, and the number of eggs laid, but such calculations would increase the amount of uncertainty in the estimates. In those instances where we had observed egg-laying date, there was no difference in phenology between those nests that produced young and those that failed (successful: mean = 19
  <span class="sup">th</span> of April, SD = 4.5 days, N = 93; failed: mean = 22
  <span class="sup">nd</span> of April, SD = 14.2 days, N = 27; two-sample t-test with Welch’s approximation for degrees of freedom: t = 0.7, df = 43, p = 0.5) and the correlation between hatching and laying date was very high (r = 0.98, df = 98, p &lt; 0.0001).

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the effect of climate change, we used mean spring temperature, defined as the average temperature during Feb–Apr, provided by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span> for details). The period Feb–Apr approximately encompasses the time immediately before initiation of breeding and the early stages of incubation.

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Altitude and distance from the coast, indicating local climatic conditions at the location of each territory, were defined as the altitude (m a.s.l.) and the straight-line distance (m) to the river outlet of the most frequently occupied nest site within each territory. Altitude and distance from the coast were, as expected, correlated (r = 0.83, df = 156, p &lt; 0.0001). Territory quality was measured by four different methods: (1) occupancy rate of each territory averaged over the study period, given that the territory had been visited by us, (2) the rate of successful breeding at each territory, defined as the frequency of breeding events producing at least one ringed nestling, (3) mean clutch size at each territory, defined as the mean number of eggs laid in breeding attempts producing at least one egg, and (4) mean brood size at each territory, defined as the number of ringed nestlings in breeding events producing at least one nestling.</p>
