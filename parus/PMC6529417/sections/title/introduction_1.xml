 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenology is the study of the annual timing of recurring life history events, like the timing of migration and breeding in seasonal environments. Phenology has lately received large attention because phenological traits are responding to recent climate change, where the timing of spring events in particular has advanced. Among the studied taxa, birds show a particularly strong phenological response to climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. This response can be the result of the direct effects of a changing climate on the mechanisms regulating endogenous timing, e.g., physiology, or it can be caused by indirect effects through the food chain
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Most of the reported responses are due to phenotypic plasticity, with individuals adjusting their timing of breeding to annual variation in temperature
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. For successful breeding, some passerine birds are dependent on food resources that are limited to a brief time window when they are abundant
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>, while others are not subject to such time constraints
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. In this paper, we study the phenological response to environmental variation in the white-throated dipper 
  <span class="italic">Cinclus cinclus</span> (hereafter dipper), where the time constraints for successful breeding potentially posed by the food resources are unknown. We address the impact of ecological factors on individuals at the scale at which they interact with their environment, namely the scale of the territories birds occupy. Habitat heterogeneity may make individuals in the same population experience different environments, and, thus, selection may favour sensitivity to local scale variation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. Therefore, we here study issues related to local climate, territory location and quality, and the role of intraspecific competition, in addition to spring temperatures measured at a regional level.
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At northern latitudes, passerine egg-laying often occurs simultaneously with leafing of the trees and is strongly correlated with ambient temperatures
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. However, differences in ambient temperatures can also be found at local scales, e.g., due to altitudinal gradients
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. At increased elevation, the timing of egg-laying in great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> is delayed while clutch size and breeding success is reduced
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, which might be explained by temperature and food availability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> through both proximate and ultimate mechanisms. Therefore, both latitude and altitude may play a role in determining phenology.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat quality influences fitness, and some territories are therefore preferred to others
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. For example, in a study of black kites 
  <span class="italic">Milvus migrans</span>, high occupancy territories produce most of the young subsequently entering the breeding population, because these are often associated with lower predation risk and higher food abundances
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. In general, older or dominant individuals often occupy high quality territories
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. Moreover, birds settle earlier on high quality territories (especially migrants), suggesting that territory quality may be associated with the time of breeding.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breeding population density is an indication of the level of intraspecific competition in a population and can hence influence the availability of food resources and nest sites
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Increased breeding population density might lead to a scenario where all individuals suffer, or to a scenario where high-quality territory holders suffer little, but more low-quality territories are occupied than when breeding population density is low
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. In dippers, the location of the nest sites in some territories might be unfavourable despite an abundance of food and are therefore only occupied in high-density years. Breeding population density can therefore have a strong impact on average breeding performance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. An early start of breeding may be particularly beneficial under high population densities to utilize the resources as long as they last, thereby giving the offspring a good (and early) start in a competitive environment.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used data from a long-term study on the dipper in southernmost Norway (1978–2011) to address how the local climate, territory location and quality, and intraspecific competition affect the timing of breeding. The dipper is a medium-sized single-brooded bird (50–70 g) breeding in mountainous regions across the Palearctic. The five dipper species in the world occupy a special feeding niche by preying upon aquatic invertebrates and fish in running freshwater, with breeding occurring in the immediate vicinity of fast-flowing rapids. The birds in our population are partial migrants, and in particular in cold winters when most of the river system freezes, the resident fraction of the population is apparently severely reduced
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Breeding phenology was estimated as the hatching date of the first clutch of a female. In summary, hatching date was estimated based on the growth trajectory of the largest nestling in each brood (see methods for further details). Thus, phenology of nests that did not produce young, or produced young that were not measured, could not be included in the analyses. We measured the quality of each territory as overall mean territory occupancy rate, overall mean territory success rate, and overall mean territory clutch and brood size. The territories are spatially fixed, due to the dippers’ special requirements for a nest site, and only a certain number of physical locations in the river system are suitable, which are occupied year after year (see methods for further details). As in the black kite, some territories are obviously preferred over others by the dippers in our study population. In addition, in American dippers 
  <span class="italic">C. mexicanus</span>, fidelity to the breeding territory is very high, about 70% of both males and females return to the same territory
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, which lends support to the view that the territory is an important breeding component requiring further study.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we explore (i) whether breeding time has advanced over the study period, and whether increased spring temperatures have led to the advancement. Then we investigate, in an explorative context, (ii) the causes of variation in the timing of breeding, namely: whether breeding was earlier in warm than in cold springs, whether breeding was earlier closer to the coast and at lower altitudes compared to inland and at higher altitudes, whether local habitat quality at the territory level affected the variation in breeding time, and whether intraspecific competition affected breeding time, where high population density, and thus more competition, might select for earlier breeding. Finally, we consider (iii) the consequences of variation in the timing of breeding, by studying the fitness consequences (i.e. the number of fledglings or recruits) of the phenological response to the environment, and whether this response differs between years and might have been caused by increasing spring temperatures.</p>
