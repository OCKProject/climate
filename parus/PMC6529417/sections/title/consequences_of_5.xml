 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an explorative approach, we modelled the probability of fledging in a generalized linear mixed-effects model framework with the number of fledglings, given the number of eggs laid, as the response variable with the crossed (i.e. non-nested) random intercepts territory and female identity. The random intercept year had only a minor impact and it was consequently excluded from the models (including year: BIC = 1940.6, excluding year: BIC = 1933.7). Hatching date, year, spring temperature, population density and altitude, and the interactions between year and spring temperature, year and population density, spring temperature and population density, and altitude and population density, respectively, were included as predictor variables. We used model averaging to rank models based on BIC. The top model had considerably higher Bayesian weight (BIC
  <sub>w</sub> = 0.74) than the lower ranked models (ΔBIC ≥ 4, BIC
  <sub>w</sub> ≤ 0.08; Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>) The top model included hatching date, the quadratic effect of hatching date, year, spring temperature, and the interactions between hatching date and temperature, and temperature and year, respectively (random effects: territory id SD = 0.4, female id SD = 0.8; Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). The probability of fledging had a later optimal hatching date at low temperatures than at high temperatures (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). The probability of fledging increased during the study period with higher spring temperatures, while low spring temperatures had little effect over time on the probability of fledging (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>).

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, we modelled the probability of recruiting into the breeding population with the response variable the number of recruits, given the number of fledglings. We compared a range of likely models with the predictors hatching date, year, spring temperature, population density and altitude, and the interactions between year and spring temperature, year and population density, spring temperature and population density, and altitude and population density, respectively, using BIC. Female identity could be removed from the crossed random effects (including female id: BIC = 1385.3, excluding female id: BIC = 1379.4). The top model had considerably higher Bayesian weight (BIC
  <sub>w</sub> = 0.70) than the lower ranked models (ΔBIC ≥ 4, BIC
  <sub>w</sub> ≤ 0.20; Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>), and included only hatching date (b = −0.02, z = −2.5; random effects: year SD = 0.6, territory id SD = 0.5; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). In contrast to the results for the number of fledglings, given the number of eggs laid, spring temperature was not an influential predictor variable for the number of recruits, given the number of fledglings (Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). In conclusion, early breeding pairs produced more recruits than late breeders.
