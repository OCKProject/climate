  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean spring temperature, altitude, distance from the coast, population density, overall mean territory occupancy rate, overall mean territory success rate, and overall mean territory clutch, brood size were included in a linear mixed model framework in order to explain the variation in hatching date using an explorative approach. Because we were interested in potential interactions with mean spring temperature and population density, we compared models with the additional two-way interactions between them and the other variables. We used model averaging to rank models with the Bayesian Information Criterion, BIC, with the random intercepts year, territory identity and female identity. The top model had considerably higher BIC weight (BIC
   <sub>w</sub> = 0.71) than the lower ranked models (three models, ΔBIC &gt; 4.0, BIC
   <sub>w</sub> ≤ 0.09; Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The top model included spring temperature, altitude, distance from the coast, population density, overall mean territory success rate and overall mean territory brood size, in addition to the interactions between density and distance, density and overall mean territory success rate, and density and overall mean territory brood size, respectively, (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>), and it explained 78% of the variation in hatching date (conditional R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.78, marginal R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.61; random effects: year SD = 3.4, territory id SD = 2.7, female id SD = 2.9, residual SD = 5.9). Hatching date advanced with increasing spring temperature, and with decreasing altitudes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). Hatching date advanced with increasing population density at coastal territories, while it was delayed with increasing population densities inland (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). At low population density, hatching date at seldom occupied territories was earlier, while at high population density, often occupied territories hatched earlier (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). In contrast hatching was earlier at territories with large overall mean territory brood size during low population density years, while at high population density hatching occurred at the same time at all territories (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). Spring temperature (25.0%), the interaction between density and overall mean territory brood size (21.4%), altitude (13.7%) and density (12.0%) explained most of the variation, while overall mean territory brood size (7.8%), year (5.7%), female identity (4.1%), overall mean territory occupancy rate (2.6%), distance from the coast (1.8%), the interaction between density and distance from the coast (1.3%), and overall mean territory occupancy rate (1.1%) explained a smaller part of the variation in breeding time.

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an explorative approach, we modelled the probability of fledging in a generalized linear mixed-effects model framework with the number of fledglings, given the number of eggs laid, as the response variable with the crossed (i.e. non-nested) random intercepts territory and female identity. The random intercept year had only a minor impact and it was consequently excluded from the models (including year: BIC = 1940.6, excluding year: BIC = 1933.7). Hatching date, year, spring temperature, population density and altitude, and the interactions between year and spring temperature, year and population density, spring temperature and population density, and altitude and population density, respectively, were included as predictor variables. We used model averaging to rank models based on BIC. The top model had considerably higher Bayesian weight (BIC
   <sub>w</sub> = 0.74) than the lower ranked models (ΔBIC ≥ 4, BIC
   <sub>w</sub> ≤ 0.08; Table

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, we modelled the probability of recruiting into the breeding population with the response variable the number of recruits, given the number of fledglings. We compared a range of likely models with the predictors hatching date, year, spring temperature, population density and altitude, and the interactions between year and spring temperature, year and population density, spring temperature and population density, and altitude and population density, respectively, using BIC. Female identity could be removed from the crossed random effects (including female id: BIC = 1385.3, excluding female id: BIC = 1379.4). The top model had considerably higher Bayesian weight (BIC
