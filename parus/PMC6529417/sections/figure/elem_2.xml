  <p>The consequences of variation in the timing of breeding, measured as the number of fledglings given the number of eggs laid in the white-throated dipper in Lyngdalsvassdraget 1978–2011. The effects are shown for the interactions (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) between spring temperature and hatching day-of-year, where spring temperature is ordered from low to high with increasingly light grey tones where −1.5–−0.5 is symbolised by solid line and circles, −0.5–0.5 °C by broken line and triangles, 0.5–1.5 °C by dotted line and plus symbols, 1.5–2.5 °C by broken-dotted line and crosses, 2.5–3.5 °C by long-stapled line and diamonds, and 3.5–4.5 °C by long-stapled-dotted line and downwards-facing grey triangles, and (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) between spring temperature and year, where spring temperature is ordered from the earliest to the latest as in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>), from a mixed-effects model including the most influential predictor variables (RI &gt; 0.5) with the random crossed effects female and territory identity. N = 999.
