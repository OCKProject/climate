  <p>The causes of variation in the timing of breeding modelled in a linear mixed-effects model in the white-throated dipper in Lyngdalsvassdraget 1978–2011. Effects are shown for the following fixed effects, using model predictions and a restricted data set: (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) altitude (m above sea level), (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) the interaction between distance from the coast (m) and population density, where population density is ordered from low to high with decreasingly light grey tones, (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) the interaction between overall mean territory occupancy rate and population density, where population density is ordered as in (
   <span class="bold">b</span>), and (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) the interaction between overall mean territory brood size and population density, where population density is ordered as in (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) and (
   <span class="bold">c</span>),with the crossed random effects year, female identity and territory identity, on the hatching day-of-year. N = 992.
