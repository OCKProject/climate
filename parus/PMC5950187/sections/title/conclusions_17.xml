 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study explored the links between seasonal migration, hypoxia physiology and disease dynamics. We found a higher parasite intensity in the non-breeding season regardless of migratory strategy, which is in line with previous studies suggesting that winter induces the relapse of the previous yearâ€™s infections. Our results show that high intensity in mixed haemosporidian infections have the predicted negative effect on oxygen-carrying capacity of blood after controlling for host species. Future work on chronic parasite infection must consider parasite intensity, rather than only relying on infection status. These results imply a role of elevational migration in disease dynamics. The potentially increased exposure to high intensity infections with upslope disease spread in the face of climate change will exacerbate hypoxic stress experienced by high elevation birds.</p>
