 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blood smears were examined for the presence of infected blood cells and gametocytes following Godfrey et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. Briefly, all slides were first examined at low magnification (500×) for approximately 100 fields and then at least 100 fields were studied at high magnification (1000×) using an oil immersion lens (taking into account the 10× contribution from the ocular combined with objectives of the magnification reported). The intensity of infection was recorded as per the following criteria: low (+); 1–10 parasites per 100 thin film fields, medium (++); 11–100 parasites per 100 thin film fields, high (+++); 1–10 parasites in one thin film field and very high (++++); more than 10 parasites in one thin film field.
