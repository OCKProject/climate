 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within the study area, ten feeders were established at least 20 m apart from one another. Each feeder was filled with husked peanuts and suspended from a nail 1.5 m above ground on thick trunks of pines or deciduous trees. Feeders were metallic cylinders (25×5 cm) made from a 4.8 mm mesh net allowing birds access to food. Feeders never ran out of peanuts during the study period (so birds could not find them empty). The feeders were located at least 10 m away from the positions where the funnel traps were located, so feeder choice by foraging birds could not be linked with previous experience related to predation risk due to bird trapping.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We carefully selected the location of the ten experimental feeders within the natural forest environment according to a broad variation in temperature, light intensity and distance to the nearest vegetation cover considering our previous experience in the study area (see

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature and light intensity refer to those registered during the 14 sampling days. The dashed line divides feeders included in ‘near’ and ‘far’ categories. Feeding time and visits to feeders are cumulative numbers for all 38 birds, measured in seconds of feeder use and number of visits per 10 hours of recording time, respectively.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Air temperature and light intensity at each feeder was assessed with one data logger (HOBO Pendant, Onset; 58×33×23 mm) located at the lower end of each feeder. In order to standardize the registering of light intensity, the light sensor of the logger was pointed to the ground and a grey plastic plate of 60×40 mm was placed parallel to it and 2 cm below the light sensor. Thus, all loggers recorded the reflected light from same material of identical reflection properties. Data loggers recorded air temperature (measured in °C) and light intensity (measured in lux, lumens / m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) every minute during the sampling period. For each sampling day, 600 measurements of temperature and light intensity were obtained from 7:30 to 17:30 hours GMT. Data on temperature and light intensity during daytime at each feeder were averaged across the 14 days of sampling to characterize the environmental idiosyncrasy of feeders. Differences among feeding patches in average temperature ranged up to 3.7°C (from 4.5 to 8.2°C), while differences in average light intensity reached 9598 lux (from 299 to 9897 lux).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two situations were selected to simulate low and high-predation risk locations according to the distance to protective vegetation cover, considered here as needles, small branches, twigs of bushes, and tree regrowth (&lt;1 cm diameter) that could offer refuge to the birds when attacked by a predator. The low risk position (‘near’) was defined as at &lt;0.4 m from the nearest vegetation cover, and the high-risk position (‘far’) as at &gt;3 m from cover. Distance to cover is clearly associated with perceived predation risk, as previously found in similar studies reporting longer distances of escape to safe refuges, increases in vigilance rate, and decreases in average times spent at feeders per foraging bout in ‘far’ locations (e.g., 
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Lima2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Lima2">[26]</a> and references therein; 
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Carrascal1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Carrascal1">[6]</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Hinsley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Hinsley1">[13]</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Repasky1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Repasky1">[14]</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Walther1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Walther1">[15]</a>). We selected six feeders ‘near’ and four ‘far’ from refuge, that cluster into two relatively homogeneous levels when considering the logarithm of their distances (ln distance to refuge in ‘near’ feeders: mean = 0.2, sd = 0.12; ‘far’ feeders: mean = 1.6, sd = 0.23;distance to refuge is considered on its logarithm according to the accelerated nature of flight movement while taking off). We made this unbalanced selection as the best 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> solution to uncouple the natural variation of distances and both temperature and light intensity at each feeder. Thus, the covariation between distance to vegetation refuge (‘near’ vs. ‘far’) and both average temperature and luminosity were minimal (temperature: F
  <sub>1,8</sub> = 0.24, p = 0.635, R
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.03; luminosity in logarithm: F
  <sub>1,8</sub> = 0.34, p = 0.575, R
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.04; n = 10 feeders using data in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0068448-t001" href="#pone-0068448-t001">Table 1</a>). A high correlation between temperature and luminosity was unavoidable when considering average figures for each feeder, as both variables are naturally dependent on sun radiation (R
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.84). This correlation imposes a conflictive demand between the beneficial effects of temperature and the deleterious effects of luminosity.
