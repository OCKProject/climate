 <p>Relationship between the cumulative time spent at each feeder by forest birds and (A) the average temperature at feeders along the study winter period (20 Januaryâ€“10 February 2011) and (B) the distance to the closest vegetation refuge against predators, in a mixed montane forest of central Spain. Figures represent average and standard error of partial residuals from a General Linear Mixed Model on ln seconds of stay / 10 sampling hours (
