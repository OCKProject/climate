 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the everyday struggle for life, wintering animals strive to meet the high energy requirements imposed by the season through a suite of behavioral strategies such as feeding during long periods of time and managing heat interchange with their environment 
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Bicudo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Bicudo1">[1]</a>. Foraging patch selection can be viewed as a microclimate plus microhabitat selection process, being intended to optimize food search while minimizing both thermoregulation costs and predation risk. The risk of being predated may be related to multiple factors, among which the best known is the distance to a potential refuge against predators

  <a rid="pone.0068448-Carrascal1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Carrascal1">[6]</a>. However, there are other factors determining predation risk; for instance, illumination levels highly influence the probabilities of being seen by a potential predator as well as the probabilities of detecting that predator in the surroundings

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three-dimensional habitats such as forests create a complex sun-shade mosaic where each patch has a particular combination of sun incidence (and thus average temperature and light intensity), average food availability, and a given distance to the closer vegetation refuge from predators. Specifically, sun radiation is predicted to create a conflict in the decision-process of habitat use during foraging, due to the trade-off between energy savings by heating, and predation risk linked to high light intensity 
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Carrascal2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Carrascal2">[7]</a>. For instance, small passerines at low temperatures around zero Â°C reduce metabolic rate by approximately one half when exposed to sun radiation levels of ca. 1000 W/m

  <a rid="pone.0068448-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Wolf1">[11]</a>. Nevertheless, sun radiation may also increase predation risk through both higher probabilities of being detected by predators and reduced vision of prey due to glare effects 
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Carrascal2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Carrascal2">[7]</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0068448-FernandezJuricic1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-FernandezJuricic1">[8]</a>. Glare effects may not affect prey and predators in the same way, as predators choose the direction of attack in order to reduce detection by prey 
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Tucker1">[12]</a>. On the other hand, habitat configuration influences the availability of refuges where prey may shelter against predators, and distance to protective cover determines the perception of predation risk. Cover functions as both refuge for prey and as concealment for predators, so birds devote more time to vigilance farther from refuge and prefer to feed near vegetation cover (e.g.,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat structure, thermal, food and predation factors are tightly related in the wild. For instance, temperature is related to food availability through arthropod activation and fruit productivity

  <a rid="pone.0068448-Breckle1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Breckle1">[17]</a>, sun radiation determines both temperature and illumination levels, and it is at the same time influenced by the shade effect of vegetation cover. Due to their high level of correlation, the relative importance of these factors on foraging patch selection has rarely been assessed (but see 
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Carrascal2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Carrascal2">[7]</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Brown2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Brown2">[18]</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Lerman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Lerman1">[19]</a>). Nevertheless, disentangling these intervening effects is crucial to understand the decision-making process of foraging patch selection in wintering animals.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we quantify the relative importance of thermoregulation benefits associated with ambient temperature, and predation risk linked to both illumination levels and distance to the nearest refuge, in foraging patch use by wintering forest birds. We analyze the influence of thermal benefits and predation risk in a montane Mediterranean forest of central Spain, with temperatures well below the thermoneutral zone 
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Calder1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Calder1">[20]</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Kendeigh1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Kendeigh1">[21]</a>. To attain this goal we made field observations under controlled and comparable situations according to foraging substrate, food access and food quality. We used specially designed feeders located on tree trunks at variable distance to vegetation cover and exposure to sun radiation, in such a manner that distance to cover was not associated with temperature and illumination levels. We registered temperature and light intensity with data loggers located at feeders, and used video recording to measure the cumulative time that individually marked birds exploited each feeder. This manipulative procedure under field conditions controls for the confounding effects of natural food availability, predation risk and thermoregulation benefit on foraging patch selection.
