 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although many ringed birds were detected in video recordings, only those individual birds for which at least 10 visits to feeders were obtained were included in the statistical analyses. We used this threshold considering that a minimum of 10 visits would be necessary for a bird to be able to forage at least once at each feeder. The final sample size was 38 different birds: 10 nuthatches, 6 great tits, 6 blue tits, 5 crested tits and 11 coal tits.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A General Linear Mixed Model was applied to analyze the cumulative time spent feeding at each feeder (response variable) by 38 different individual birds (i.e., a data matrix with cumulative times at ten feeders by 38 focal birds). Bird identity (BIRD) was considered as a random factor, species (SPECIES) and distance to cover (DISTANCE) as fixed factors, and average diurnal temperature (T) and average light intensity (LI) at feeders as covariates. Bird identity was nested within the corresponding species (i.e., differences among species were tested considering the individual bird as the sample unit instead of the foraging stays at each feeder). The mean square (MS) and the degrees of freedom (df) of the error terms were estimated following Satterthwaite’s method, which finds the linear combinations of sources of random variation that serve as appropriate error terms for testing the significance of the respective effect of interest. We also tested for parallelism in the relationships between time spent at feeders and temperature (DISTANCE*T) or light intensity (DISTANCE*LI) across the two levels of distance. The cumulative time spent foraging at feeders and light intensity were transformed logarithmically prior to data analyses. Homoscedasticity and normality of residuals of the General Linear Mixed Model were checked and they did not deviate from the canonical assumptions. Data were analyzed using StatSoft’s Statistica 10.0 (StatSoft Inc, Tulsa, Oklahoma).</p>
