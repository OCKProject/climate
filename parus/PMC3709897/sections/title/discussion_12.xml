 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wintering birds were able to identify small variations in temperature across foraging patches, devoting more time to relatively warm patches and likely reducing the thermoregulation expenditure while searching for food (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068448-g001" href="#pone-0068448-g001">Figure 1A</a>). Birds also perceived the potential risk of being predated, spending more time foraging at safer patches with a close refuge available to escape from predators (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068448-g001" href="#pone-0068448-g001">Figure 1B</a>). Noticeably, minimizing predation risk was much more important than reducing thermoregulation metabolic costs in these Mediterranean forests of relatively mild winter climate.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wintering birds benefit from foraging at patches with higher environmental temperature where the costs of thermoregulation are reduced. Our results support this metabolic benefit in a forest scenario, where the sun-shade mosaic generates a broad spatial micro-variation in temperature

The energy saved by selecting the warmest foraging sites may be even more relevant when considering its cumulative effect on the long-term winter energy balance of these small birds, considering that they spend most of their winter daytime foraging under temperatures well below their thermoneutral zone (

  <a rid="pone.0068448-Cresswell1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Cresswell1">[33]</a>. Moreover, predation is an unpredictable risk of ‘all or nothing’ consequences: a sole successful event of predation will be lethal, increasing this risk with distance to shelter. Therefore, small differences in flight time and distance to a safe refuge against predators while foraging have a paramount influence on microhabitat use. In our study, the average distances to the nearest refuge of ‘close’ and ‘far’ feeders were 0.3 and 4.3 m, corresponding approximately to 0.5 and 2.1 seconds of escape flights 
  <a rid="pone.0068448-Kullberg1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068448-Kullberg1">[34]</a>. Our results show that birds follow anti-predator strategies steadily, even in the apparent absence of predators, as no predator attacks were observed during the ca. 420 hours devoted to fieldwork.

The hierarchical prioritization of predator avoidance over reduction of thermoregulation cost brings a sub-optimal exploitation of the thermal environment, as the time spent in patches with the lowest thermoregulation expenditure is not maximized

An optimal exploitation of the thermal environment may gain importance in colder environments, and thus the relative importance of predation and thermoregulation is prone to change with the environment. In Mediterranean forests, in spite of the uncertainty associated with predation, betting on survival against predators preponderates over the tangible benefits of reducing metabolic costs.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We predicted that sun radiation would promote a conflictive demand between the benefits of sunbathing and predation risk associated with visibility. Contrary to our expectations, we found no effect of illumination determining the time that a forest patch is exploited. This contrast with some studies that relate luminance with both the risk of being detected by a predator and the difficulties the glare poses to detect predators

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All species and all individuals within species followed a similar decision-making process in habitat use (see species, individual and interaction terms in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0068448-t003" href="#pone-0068448-t003">Table 3</a>). Therefore, the preponderance of avoiding predation over facilitating the maintenance of a positive energy balance is generalizable for small passerines facing the winter season, at least in relatively mild temperate Mediterranean forests. Thus, variations in the predation risk – thermoregulation trade-off would probably be related to the abiotic scenario rather than to the species involved. For this reason it would be interesting to test this trade-off in more restrictive scenarios according to winter climate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, wintering birds are able to identify and exploit subtle thermal variations in their foraging environment, minimizing the metabolic costs of thermoregulation while searching for food. Foraging intensity also depends on vegetation characteristics around feeding patches that define potential refuges against predators. The benefits of behavioral thermoregulation are direct, predictable and instantaneously perceived, but its quantitative importance is almost three times lower than that of reducing predation risk, which has an indirect and unpredictable effect.</p>
