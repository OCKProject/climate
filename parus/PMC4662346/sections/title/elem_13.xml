 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predicting future change in ecosystem functioning requires an understanding of the community impacts of both global environmental change and any associated remediation strategies. Climate change impacts on foundation species are likely to influence the diversity, distribution and abundance of associated taxa – whether these are beneficial ecosystem service providers or potential pests. The challenge for a given system is then to estimate likely consequences of both nonintervention and remediation; and where the impacts of remediation strategies take time to develop, to understand their trajectories through time. All of these aspects apply in particular to climate matching of long-lived foundation trees, which involves introduction of non-native genotypes that take decades to establish and live for centuries. Our analyses shed light on the likely consequences for native herbivores of introducing tree provenances that, although not initially climate-matched, become increasingly so as climate changes, while native provenances become increasingly mismatched and decline in performance. A key aspect of our study is its use of a provenance trial to quantify the consequences of host plant variation in performance and phenology on multiple species in the same guild, addressing a recognized need to quantify the impacts of environmental change at guild and community levels (e.g., Forkner et al.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Influences of oak provenance on the gallwasp guild, and incorporation of provenance covariance</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show that oak provenances vary significantly in phenotypic traits likely to influence associated herbivores and that this in turn is associated with significant variation in the population density (abundance per oak shoot) of multiple gallwasp species. We show that the form of these relationships is robust across models that assume very different patterns of variance–covariance among oak provenances, from identity models assuming total independence to models that estimate covariance based on population genetic and provenance origin data. Our results indicate that models that treat provenances as statistically independent entities, which we know not to be true, consistently underestimate provenance effects on gall densities relative to models in which covariance is specified based on a measure of genetic differentiation (
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>ST</sub> or 
   <span class="italic">GeoF</span>
   <sub>ST</sub>). If these models accurately describe provenance co-variance, then the influence of tree provenance on gall abundance is substantially greater (38–95%) than would be inferred by assuming provenances to be statistically independent. While pairwise 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>ST</sub> and related measures are consistently significantly larger than 0 (Tables S2.1 and S2.3 in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2" href="#sd2">Data S2</a>), their absolute values are small, providing little resolution of the relationship of genetic differentiation and geographic distance (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2" href="#sd2">Data S2</a> for a comprehensive discussion). It is therefore difficult to estimate a ‘true’ value for the impact of provenance and its explanatory power given the nonindependence of populations (Felsenstein 
   <a rid="b200" ref-type="bibr" href="#b200">2002</a>; Stone et al. 
   <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2011</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strong provenance effects we show are consistent with the growing body of community genetics work linking host plant genotypic variation to associated trophic levels (Wimp et al. 
   <a rid="b92" ref-type="bibr" href="#b92">2005</a>; Bangert and Whitham 
   <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2007</a>). A key challenge in this field is to understand the importance of host genetic effects for herbivore communities relative to other ecological factors (Hersch-Green et al. 
   <a rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" href="#b39">2011</a>). Working near the northern limit of pedunculate oak (
   <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>) in Finland, Tack et al. (
   <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">2010</a>) found spatial effects to be more important than tree genotypic effects in structuring a community of herbivorous insects that included several gallwasps. In reciprocal transplant experiments at local and regional scales, Tack et al. (
   <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">2010</a>) found no effect of tree genotype for any of the three gall types in their study (asexual and sexual generations of 
   <span class="italic">N. quercusbaccarum</span> are shared with our study). The contrast between this and the strong host plant provenance effects present at the Petite Charnie trial is likely to reflect contrasting levels of adaptive genetic and phenotypic diversity of the oaks in each study. Although Finnish oak populations show substantial intraspecific genetic diversity (Vakkari et al. 
   <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">2006</a>), they show substantially less genetic diversity (and we expect also phenotypic diversity) than the much wider geographic array of provenances present at La Petite Charnie (Petit et al. 
   <a rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" href="#b61">2002</a>). Our provenance trial study involves a much greater array of genetic diversity than would be expected from a single natural population, a feature shared with the studies of genetically diverse hybrid populations (e.g., Dungey et al. 
   <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2000</a>) that often show strong plant genotype effects on associated herbivores (Tack et al. 
   <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">2010</a>). Generally, the importance of host genetic effects relative to other factors is likely to correlate positively with the adaptive genetic diversity within a tree population present at a site, and we would expect this to be increased in situations where climate matching or other forms of assisted migration are implemented.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Impacts of between-provenance variation in phenology</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strongest predictor of between-provenance variation in gallwasp density is variation in spring budburst phenology. Phenological changes have long been recognized as a major component of species responses to climate change that can cascade through associated trophic levels. This has been shown, for example, in work on the impact of changes in oak budburst phenology on abundance of associated leaf-feeding moths and breeding responses of insectivorous birds – particularly 
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (Van Asch and Visser 
   <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2007</a>; Visser 
   <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2008</a>; Van Asch et al. 
   <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">2012</a>; Vatka et al. 
   <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2014</a>). A key question in research on these systems has been the extent to which responses of herbivores, and their natural enemies are the result of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is striking that although adaptation to individual trees has been demonstrated in oak–gallwasp interactions (Egan and Ott 
   <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2007</a>), none of our gall types showed declining abundance with increasing phenological mismatch between native oaks and planted provenances, rejecting our local adaptation hypothesis. We also found the responses of the spring and autumn generations in the gallwasp lifecycle can be very different. Spring galls were more abundant on early budbursting trees, while autumn generations of the same species (
   <span class="italic">N. numismalis</span> and 
   <span class="italic">N. quercusbaccarum</span>) were more abundant on late budbursting trees. Similar relationships to those we observed were recorded for 
   <span class="italic">Neuroterus</span> gallwasps in response to local phenological variation in native UK 
   <span class="italic">Q. robur</span> populations by Askew (
   <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">1962</a>, 
   <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">1984</a>) and Crawley and Akhteruzzaman (
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">1988</a>); our results show that the same trends can be extended to the wider phenological variation present in a provenance trial. We hypothesize that this contrast between the spring and autumn generations may exist because later budbursting trees may have higher abundance of phenologically young tissues suitable for gall induction. Annual gallwasp phenology may thus be the result of contrasting selection on the two lifecycle generations, perhaps limiting local phenological adaptation in either generation (Singer and Parmesan 
   <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">2010</a>). The dynamics of such complex lifecycles are poorly understood, and complex bottom-up impacts may apply to other groups with multivoltine or more complex lifecycles, particularly where these involve alternation between generations and/or plant hosts (including many aphids; Harrington et al. 
   <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2007</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Impacts of between-provenance variation in tree vigour</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tree vigour also explained significant between-provenance variation in oak gall density. In contrast, tree shape – commonly used as an indicator of physiological stress – had little impact. As with phenology, the sign of correlations between gall density and tree vigour varied among gall generations and taxa. Significant correlations with tree vigour were positive for spring sexual generation gall types, while two of three were negative for asexual generation gall types. Support was thus evenly split between the plant vigour hypothesis (Price 
   <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">1991</a>; Cornelissen et al. 
   <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2008</a>) and the plant stress hypothesis (White 
   <a rid="b87" ref-type="bibr" href="#b87">1969</a>, 
   <a rid="b88" ref-type="bibr" href="#b88">1974</a>, 
   <a rid="b89" ref-type="bibr" href="#b89">2009</a>). One possibility is that the apparent contrast in patterns for spring and autumn generation galls could be driven by the long-known seasonal shift in oak resource investment from growth in the spring to metabolic defence in the summer (Feeny 
   <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">1970</a>). Highly vigorous trees could then be both best for spring generation galls and worst (=best defended) for autumn generation galls. Mechanisms of oak defence against gallwasps remain poorly understood.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predicting the impact of climate-matched planting on associated herbivores</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate matching necessarily requires introduction of phenotypically divergent tree populations. In Europe, climate models predict warmer summers and winters (Giorgi and Coppola 
   <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2009</a>; Jenkins et al. 
   <a rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43">2009</a>), and climate matching will thus always involve introducing more southerly provenances that show earlier budburst (Ducousso et al. 
   <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">1996</a>; Broadmeadow et al. 
   <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2005</a>). Under low and high emissions scenarios for 2050, Broadmeadow et al. (
   <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2005</a>) identified climate-matched sites for five UK locations that were 0–2° and 5–12° further south, respectively (Broadmeadow et al. 
   <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2005</a>). Our results (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2C</a>) suggest that while the small latitudinal shifts required under a low emission scenario would probably have little impact on oak phenology, the shifts of &gt;10° of latitude required under a high emission scenario could lead to major phenological differences between native and climate-matched trees, and significantly dissimilar gallwasp assemblages.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The widespread existence of latitude-dependent photoperiod cues in plant phenology (Aitken et al. 
   <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2008</a>) suggests that the phenological contrasts between climate-matched and native oak populations will be shared by other plant species. The extent to which any such differences influence associated herbivores is likely to vary according to specific plant–herbivore interactions, reflecting available herbivore phenotypic plasticity and adaptive genetic diversity. We hypothesized that impacts of phenological mismatch will be greatest for interactions in which herbivore fitness is strongly correlated with successful exploitation of a narrow phenological ‘window of opportunity’ (Durant et al. 
   <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">2007</a>; Van Asch and Visser 
   <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2007</a>; Forkner et al. 
   <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2008</a>; Netherer and Schopf 
   <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2010</a>). This includes many insects that feed on newly flushed leaves (Van Asch and Visser 
   <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2007</a>; Forkner et al. 
   <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2008</a>). However, we found no evidence of such a window for gallwasps: while they prefer to oviposit (or survive better on) young tissues, they show no strong preference for host trees at a single phenological stage. As discussed above, impacts on herbivores with multivoltine or multihost lifecycles may be complex.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationships we found between host plant vigour and herbivore abundance are relevant to two stages in a climate matching strategy: the expected poor performance under current climates of introduced provenances matched to predicted future conditions, and the expected decline in the performance of native provenances as climates move away from any locally adapted range. The slope of the relationship between environmental variables and vigour for a specific provenance will dictate not only the impact on associated trophic levels, but also whether climate matching with that provenance is feasible at all. The challenge for forest managers is to identify a climate-matched provenance that is able to survive as a sapling and young tree before the conditions justifying its selection have been reached and become established before native provenances fail. Climate matching is a recently developed strategy and its success at maintaining forest productivity is untested (Broadmeadow et al. 
   <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2005</a>). Current guidelines in UK forestry advocate mixed planting of both matched and local provenances, which increases local resource heterogeneity for herbivores (Hubert and Cottrell 
   <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">2007</a>), and creates conditions that accelerate both environmental selection on host trees (Lefevre et al. 
   <a rid="b47" ref-type="bibr" href="#b47">2014</a>) and host plant-mediated selection on associated organisms.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assisted migration is increasingly seen as a viable strategy for commercial and conservation settings (Broadmeadow et al. 
   <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2005</a>; Stone 
   <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2010</a>; Dawson et al. 
   <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">2011</a>). Issues cited as slowing down the implementation of climate matching as an adaptive forestry strategy include lack of operating procedures, uncertainties over which climate models to use in matching algorithms and risks associated with moving plants outside their current ranges (Williams and Dumroese 
   <a rid="b91" ref-type="bibr" href="#b91">2013</a>). Theoretical studies nevertheless suggest that such adaptive-, rather than resilience-targeted strategies may be the best way to safeguard forest systems (Buma and Wessman 
   <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2013</a>; Lefevre et al. 
   <a rid="b47" ref-type="bibr" href="#b47">2014</a>). We would add that the community impacts of assisted migration need to be carefully considered, particularly so for foundation species such as forest trees. This requires better understanding of the relative contributions of host plant genotype and other ecological factors to the tree phenotypes exposed to herbivores (Tack et al. 
   <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">2010</a>). Geographical patterns of local adaptation and tree phenotypic variation have only been mapped in a tiny minority of species (Savolainen et al. 
   <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2007</a>; Robakowski et al. 
   <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2012</a>; Sork et al. 
   <a rid="b71" ref-type="bibr" href="#b71">2013</a>), and studies that target multiple provenance trial locations are required to separate genetic and environmental contributions to provenance phenotypes (Tack et al. 
   <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">2010</a>). While our study was based on a single trial, the oak phenotypic traits we analysed have been shown to be highly heritable in the sampled provenances (Sinclair 
   <a rid="b900" ref-type="bibr" href="#b900">2012</a>), so we expect the provenance effects we found to contain a significant genetic component. Given strong environmental effects on plant traits including phenology, repetition of the work in an array of trials spanning different environments is clearly desirable. Understanding herbivore numerical and adaptive responses then in turn requires understanding the impacts of both plant phenotypes and other ecological processes, including the mortality inflicted on herbivores by their natural enemies (Bidart-Bouzat and Imeh-Nathaniel 
   <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">2008</a>; Thomson et al. 
   <a rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" href="#b79">2010</a>; Van Asch et al. 
   <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">2012</a>; Rasmann et al. 
   <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2014</a>). Much more needs to be done before forest managers can take informed decisions concerning likely impacts of climate matching on forest-associated biodiversity.
