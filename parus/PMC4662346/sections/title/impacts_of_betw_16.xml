 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tree vigour also explained significant between-provenance variation in oak gall density. In contrast, tree shape – commonly used as an indicator of physiological stress – had little impact. As with phenology, the sign of correlations between gall density and tree vigour varied among gall generations and taxa. Significant correlations with tree vigour were positive for spring sexual generation gall types, while two of three were negative for asexual generation gall types. Support was thus evenly split between the plant vigour hypothesis (Price

  <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2008</a>) and the plant stress hypothesis (White 
  <a rid="b87" ref-type="bibr" href="#b87">1969</a>, 
  <a rid="b88" ref-type="bibr" href="#b88">1974</a>, 
  <a rid="b89" ref-type="bibr" href="#b89">2009</a>). One possibility is that the apparent contrast in patterns for spring and autumn generation galls could be driven by the long-known seasonal shift in oak resource investment from growth in the spring to metabolic defence in the summer (Feeny 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">1970</a>). Highly vigorous trees could then be both best for spring generation galls and worst (=best defended) for autumn generation galls. Mechanisms of oak defence against gallwasps remain poorly understood.
