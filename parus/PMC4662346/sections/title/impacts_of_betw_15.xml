 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strongest predictor of between-provenance variation in gallwasp density is variation in spring budburst phenology. Phenological changes have long been recognized as a major component of species responses to climate change that can cascade through associated trophic levels. This has been shown, for example, in work on the impact of changes in oak budburst phenology on abundance of associated leaf-feeding moths and breeding responses of insectivorous birds – particularly

  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2008</a>; Van Asch et al.

  <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2014</a>). A key question in research on these systems has been the extent to which responses of herbivores, and their natural enemies are the result of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is striking that although adaptation to individual trees has been demonstrated in oak–gallwasp interactions (Egan and Ott 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2007</a>), none of our gall types showed declining abundance with increasing phenological mismatch between native oaks and planted provenances, rejecting our local adaptation hypothesis. We also found the responses of the spring and autumn generations in the gallwasp lifecycle can be very different. Spring galls were more abundant on early budbursting trees, while autumn generations of the same species (
  <span class="italic">N. numismalis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">N. quercusbaccarum</span>) were more abundant on late budbursting trees. Similar relationships to those we observed were recorded for 
  <span class="italic">Neuroterus</span> gallwasps in response to local phenological variation in native UK 
  <span class="italic">Q. robur</span> populations by Askew (
  <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">1962</a>, 
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">1984</a>) and Crawley and Akhteruzzaman (
  <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">1988</a>); our results show that the same trends can be extended to the wider phenological variation present in a provenance trial. We hypothesize that this contrast between the spring and autumn generations may exist because later budbursting trees may have higher abundance of phenologically young tissues suitable for gall induction. Annual gallwasp phenology may thus be the result of contrasting selection on the two lifecycle generations, perhaps limiting local phenological adaptation in either generation (Singer and Parmesan 
  <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">2010</a>). The dynamics of such complex lifecycles are poorly understood, and complex bottom-up impacts may apply to other groups with multivoltine or more complex lifecycles, particularly where these involve alternation between generations and/or plant hosts (including many aphids; Harrington et al. 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2007</a>).
