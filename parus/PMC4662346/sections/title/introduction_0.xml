 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecosystems across the world are experiencing profound climate change (IPCC, 
  <a rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" href="#b42">2013</a>), driving population responses whose effects can influence community structure and function (Walther et al. 
  <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">2002</a>; Parmesan and Yohe 
  <a rid="b58" ref-type="bibr" href="#b58">2003</a>). Forest ecosystems are expected to be particularly sensitive to pressures imposed by climate because the long generation times of trees result in low rates of adaptation (Lindner et al. 
  <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2010</a>). Furthermore, because forest trees are foundation (and also often keystone) species for associated communities of plants, animals, fungi and microbes (Kennedy and Southwood 
  <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">1984</a>; McEwan et al. 
  <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">2011</a>; Lindenmayer et al. 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2014</a>), effects on them are expected to cascade through associated trophic levels (Frelich et al. 
  <a rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27">2012</a>). Consequently, there is considerable interest in developing adaptive forest management strategies to preserve ecosystem productivity and services in the face of climate change (Spittlehouse and Stewart 
  <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">2003</a>; Broadmeadow et al. 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2005</a>; Aitken et al. 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2008</a>; Bower and Aitken 
  <a rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13">2008</a>; Bolte et al. 
  <a rid="b12" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12">2009</a>). Assisted migration, in the form of climate matching, has emerged as one potential strategy facilitating forest adaptation to predicted future climates (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 
  <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2008</a>; Dawson et al. 
  <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">2011</a>), particularly in commercial forestry where potential for 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> adaptation may be limited (Broadmeadow et al. 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2005</a>; but see Cavers and Cottrell 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2014</a>). Climate matching is based on the premise that natural forest stands are locally adapted to current local climates (Savolainen et al. 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2007</a>, 
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2013</a>; Alberto et al. 
  <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2013a</a>), and for a given species and planting location involves the following steps: (i) identify climate variables that predict performance for the target tree species across its range; (ii) use regional climate models to predict future climates at the proposed planting site; (iii) identify locations within the species range that currently experience the predicted conditions; (iv) plant seed from tree populations in the identified locations (termed provenances in forestry) in the expectation that resulting trees will be well matched to future climates, and contribute adaptive variation that accelerates subsequent local adaptation (Broadmeadow et al. 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As remediation strategies, climate matching and other forms of assisted migration remain subjects of vigorous debate (Dawson et al. 
  <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">2011</a>; Lunt et al. 
  <a rid="b50" ref-type="bibr" href="#b50">2013</a>; Cavers and Cottrell 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2014</a>). Forests are biologically diverse ecosystems, and the value of climate matching, or any other strategy that modifies the genetic, physical or spatial structure of tree populations, must be considered not only in terms of its effectiveness in promoting forest adaptation and resilience, but also its impacts on local associated biodiversity. Community genetic research has shown that the organisms associated with forest stands reflect the genotypes and genetic diversity of the host trees (Dungey et al. 
  <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2000</a>; Wimp et al. 
  <a rid="b92" ref-type="bibr" href="#b92">2005</a>; Whitham et al. 
  <a rid="b90" ref-type="bibr" href="#b90">2012</a>), and a range of studies have shown adaptation of plants to local herbivores and 
  <span class="italic">vice versa</span> (Sork et al. 
  <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">1993</a>; Hanks and Denno 
  <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">1994</a>; Egan and Ott 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2007</a>; Tack and Roslin 
  <a rid="b77" ref-type="bibr" href="#b77">2010</a>; Bernhardsson et al. 
  <a rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10">2013</a>). As such, the introduction of new tree genotypes as part of a climate matching strategy may drive changes in the identity, abundance and genetics of associated species (Lefevre et al. 
  <a rid="b47" ref-type="bibr" href="#b47">2014</a>). However, it is difficult to forecast the direction and magnitude of such changes. While some studies predict increased abundance of herbivores on non-native tree provenances (Bernhardsson et al. 
  <a rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10">2013</a>), others suggest the opposite through local herbivore adaptation to plant phenology (Van Asch and Visser 
  <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2007</a>; Visser 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2008</a>; Pearse and Karban 
  <a rid="b59" ref-type="bibr" href="#b59">2013</a>). The key issues are the extent to which host plant provenances vary in phenotypic traits relevant to herbivore success, and the magnitude of herbivore population responses to such variation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we explore the community effects of climate matching by quantifying the impact of provenance on (i) the phenotype (growth performance and phenology) of an important and widespread European oak, 
  <span class="italic">Quercus petraea</span>, and (ii) the abundance of associated insect herbivores. Our approach exploits an established INRA forestry trial at La Petite Charnie in Northwest France, where 96 provenances of 
  <span class="italic">Q. petraea</span> grow surrounded by natural oak forest and are exposed to native herbivores. Our study focuses on oak cynipid gallwasps (Hymenoptera; Cynipidae), specialized herbivores whose larvae develop in galls on their oak hosts (Schönrogge et al. 
  <a rid="b68" ref-type="bibr" href="#b68">2000</a>; Stone and Schönrogge 
  <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2003</a>; Harper et al. 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2004</a>). Gall induction requires access to host oak tissues at the correct developmental stage (Harper et al. 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2004</a>), and oak cynipids are highly sensitive to host plant phenology (Askew 
  <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">1962</a>; Crawley and Akhteruzzaman 
  <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">1988</a>). These aspects of gallwasp biology, coupled with a partly parthenogenetic lifecycle, are associated with local adaptation to specific host plant populations (Mopper et al. 
  <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2000</a>; Mopper 
  <a rid="b52" ref-type="bibr" href="#b52">2005</a>; Egan and Ott 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2007</a>; Tack et al. 
  <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">2010</a>) and individuals (Egan and Ott 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2007</a>) and make gallwasps an appropriate sentinel taxon for exploration of the potential effects of climate matching.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We expect the performance of oak provenances to correlate positively with the extent to which they are adapted to prevailing climatic conditions (Broadmeadow et al. 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2005</a>; Lefevre et al. 
  <a rid="b47" ref-type="bibr" href="#b47">2014</a>). This hypothesis predicts that performance of locally native provenances will decline over time – and recent rapid climate change may mean that populations of long-lived trees are already somewhat mismatched to the conditions in which they grow. The hypothesis also predicts that provenances selected to match conditions furthest in the future should be least well matched to current conditions and so perform least well in the present. We test this hypothesis using multiple performance measures for 20 provenances planted at the La Petite Charnie provenance trial, selected to maximize the available range in source latitude and longitude as well as the mismatch in climate between the provenance trial and the provenance origin. We then test two contrasting hypotheses linking herbivorous insect abundance to observed variation in performance among oak provenances. The plant stress hypothesis predicts that herbivores should show improved performance and abundance on physiologically stressed plants, due to higher levels of mobilized nitrogen in stressed plant tissues and an associated increase in resource quality for herbivores (White 
  <a rid="b87" ref-type="bibr" href="#b87">1969</a>, 
  <a rid="b88" ref-type="bibr" href="#b88">1974</a>, 
  <a rid="b89" ref-type="bibr" href="#b89">2009</a>). In contrast, the plant vigour hypothesis (Price 
  <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">1991</a>; Cornelissen et al. 
  <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2008</a>) predicts increased herbivore performance and abundance on more vigorous plants or plant organs (those with high growth rates or large ultimate size relative to the population mean) through elevated nutrient content and reduced concentrations of defensive compounds. Here we test both hypotheses using abundance data across provenances for 20 cynipid gall types.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenological matching of key biological events is crucial for many interactions between forest trees and associated organisms. For example, synchronization of breeding with high plant resource availability (budburst for leaf-eating herbivores) is central to reproductive success in herbivores and associated trophic levels. We thus expect associated organisms to show local adaptation to host plant phenology (Ducousso et al. 
  <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">1996</a>; Yukawa 
  <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">2000</a>; Van Asch and Visser 
  <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2007</a>; Van Asch et al. 
  <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">2012</a>; Alberto et al. 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2013b</a>). Many plants show latitudinal clines in phenological events, such as the timing of budburst, whose onset is often determined by photoperiodic cues (Savolainen et al. 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2007</a>; Aitken et al. 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2008</a>) or the interaction between photoperiod and temperature (Laube et al. 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2014</a>). This is relevant to climate matching because, in a warming world, it often involves introducing plants to higher latitudes from lower latitudes. As a result, phenological mismatches with local herbivores might occur by disrupting any adaptation to the local combination of thermal and photoperiod cues, with associated impacts on the fitness of herbivores and trophically linked taxa such as natural enemies (Visser 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2008</a>; Thomson et al. 
  <a rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" href="#b79">2010</a>; Kerstes and De Jong 
  <a rid="b45" ref-type="bibr" href="#b45">2011</a>; Van Asch et al. 
  <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">2012</a>). Here we quantify the phenotypic mismatch in budburst date between the same 20 provenances and assess the impact of phenological mismatch on cynipid gall abundance. Specifically, we test the local adaptation hypothesis, that is that herbivore abundance will decline with increasing phenological difference between introduced and locally native oak provenances. We distinguish phenological effects from other potential differences between provenances (e.g., variation in chemical defences) by incorporating provenance phenology into our analyses.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analytical approach recognizes that tree populations are linked by shared common ancestry and gene flow and hence are unlikely to represent statistically independent replicates (Stone et al. 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2011</a>). Here we investigate the impact of potential nonindependence by comparing the results of analyses that incorporate the expected variance–covariance among populations in a generalized linear mixed model framework (Hadfield and Nakagawa 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2010</a>).
