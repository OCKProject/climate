 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cynipid species surveyed in this study all have broad geographic distributions; like 
  <span class="italic">Q. petraea</span> and closely related oaks, they span the Western Palaearctic from the Iberian Peninsula eastwards to Iran and the Caucasus. Cynipid gall abundance was sampled across the 20 selected provenances in 2008 and 2009. Gallwasps have a spring (sexual) and autumn (asexual) gall generation each year, and both were sampled, giving four surveys in total. For each of the 200 study plots, we sampled galls from 12 of the 24 available trees, a total of 2400 trees. To minimize edge effects, surveyed trees comprised the two internal rows of six trees within each plot. During each survey, using a pole pruner giving us approximately 4 m reach we selected 10 twigs on each tree, each consisting of the last 2 years’ growth identified using ring scars on the bark. For each twig, we surveyed the galls on all parts (buds, leaves, stem, catkins, acorns; there are no cynipid galls on female flowers in Europe) of its terminal shoot (a module of woody growth from the previous year carrying the new leaves). Galls were identified to species and generation in the field using a morphological key (Redfern and Shirley
