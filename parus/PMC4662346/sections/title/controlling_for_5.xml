 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One way to address potential statistical nonindependence of populations within species is to incorporate expected similarities among populations (due to shared common ancestry and/or gene flow) as one or more variance–covariance matrices in the random effect structure of a generalized linear mixed model (Stone et al. 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2011</a>). Covariance matrices for nonindependence arising through each of migration and common ancestry can be generated for small numbers of populations using population genomic data (e.g., Hearn et al. 
  <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">2014</a>). However, for larger numbers of populations (as here), and where more limited genotypic data are available, an alternative is to use a measure of pairwise genetic differentiation between populations such as 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> (Weir and Cockerham 
  <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">1984</a>) as an estimate of their expected covariance (Stone et al. 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2011</a>). Where genetic differentiation between populations correlates strongly with geographic distance, variance–covariance can be estimated as a function of geographic separation between populations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used data from 10 putatively neutral microsatellite markers (listed in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Data S2</a>; Guichoux et al. 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2011</a>) available for 17 of our 20 study provenances (Table
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>) to estimate pairwise 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> as implemented in 
  <span class="sc">fstat</span> version 2.8.3.2 (Weir and Cockerham

  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>, see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2" href="#sd2">Data S2</a>. To allow us to analyse data for all 20 study provenances, we used the highly significant relationship between 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> and geographic distance for the 17 provenances (Mantel test in the 
  <span class="italic">adegenet</span>
  <span class="sc">r</span> package, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>=

  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> for the full set of 20 provenances, referred to hereafter as 
  <span class="italic">GeoF</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> (full details are given in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2" href="#sd2">Data S2</a>). Variance–covariances between provenances were then estimated as either 1−
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> or 1−
  <span class="italic">GeoF</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>, such that expected covariance was greatest between provenances with lowest differentiation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore the consequences of using alternative approaches to control for provenance nonindependence, all of the analyses described below were conducted using the following five dataset/covariance matrix combinations: (i) the subset of 17 provenances for which genotypic data were available, using an identity matrix as the provenance covariance matrix. This identity model assumes provenances to be statistically entirely independent (i.e., 0 covariance between all populations); (ii) the same 17 provenances, using a covariance matrix estimated as 1−
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>; (iii) the same 17 provenances, using a covariance matrix estimated as 1−
  <span class="italic">GeoF</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>; (iv) the full set of 20 provenances using an identity model; and (v) the full set of 20 provenances where covariance is estimated as 1−
  <span class="italic">GeoF</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>. A detailed discussion of this approach to addressing population nonindependence, and values used in the covariance matrices, are provided in the
