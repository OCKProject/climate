Each sampled provenance is planted in multiple replicate plots of 24 trees distributed across five soil zones (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Data S1</a>). We selected two plots per soil zone per provenance, giving a total of 200 study plots containing 4800 trees. Previous INRA surveys provided data for each tree for the following phenotypic traits (see

     <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd4" href="#sd4">Data S4</a>). We thus regard using the 1995 data for all 20 provenances as unlikely to produce misleading or contrary results.

   <span class="italic">Q. petraea</span> and closely related oaks, they span the Western Palaearctic from the Iberian Peninsula eastwards to Iran and the Caucasus. Cynipid gall abundance was sampled across the 20 selected provenances in 2008 and 2009. Gallwasps have a spring (sexual) and autumn (asexual) gall generation each year, and both were sampled, giving four surveys in total. For each of the 200 study plots, we sampled galls from 12 of the 24 available trees, a total of 2400 trees. To minimize edge effects, surveyed trees comprised the two internal rows of six trees within each plot. During each survey, using a pole pruner giving us approximately 4 m reach we selected 10 twigs on each tree, each consisting of the last 2 years’ growth identified using ring scars on the bark. For each twig, we surveyed the galls on all parts (buds, leaves, stem, catkins, acorns; there are no cynipid galls on female flowers in Europe) of its terminal shoot (a module of woody growth from the previous year carrying the new leaves). Galls were identified to species and generation in the field using a morphological key (Redfern and Shirley

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One way to address potential statistical nonindependence of populations within species is to incorporate expected similarities among populations (due to shared common ancestry and/or gene flow) as one or more variance–covariance matrices in the random effect structure of a generalized linear mixed model (Stone et al. 
    <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2011</a>). Covariance matrices for nonindependence arising through each of migration and common ancestry can be generated for small numbers of populations using population genomic data (e.g., Hearn et al. 
    <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">2014</a>). However, for larger numbers of populations (as here), and where more limited genotypic data are available, an alternative is to use a measure of pairwise genetic differentiation between populations such as 
    <span class="italic">F</span>
    <sub>ST</sub> (Weir and Cockerham 
    <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">1984</a>) as an estimate of their expected covariance (Stone et al. 
    <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2011</a>). Where genetic differentiation between populations correlates strongly with geographic distance, variance–covariance can be estimated as a function of geographic separation between populations.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore the consequences of using alternative approaches to control for provenance nonindependence, all of the analyses described below were conducted using the following five dataset/covariance matrix combinations: (i) the subset of 17 provenances for which genotypic data were available, using an identity matrix as the provenance covariance matrix.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical modelling of provenance effects on gall abundance</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the influence of tree provenance on the abundance of each individual gall type, we combined the data for the two survey years and used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to partition the variance of gall counts per shoot into the effects of year (as a fixed effect with two levels) and provenance, soil zone, plot and tree (all as random effects). When applying an identity model for the relationship between provenances, the effect of provenance was represented by a single random effect with a unique independent level for each provenance. In models that incorporated the relationship between provenances, provenance co-variance was represented by two random effects. One incorporated the specified variance–covariance matrix (1−
    <span class="italic">F</span>
    <sub>ST</sub> or 1−
    <span class="italic">GeoF</span>
    <sub>ST</sub>) to account for provenance nonindependence, while the second incorporated an identity matrix to capture the ‘nugget effect’ (Matheron 
    <a rid="b201" ref-type="bibr" href="#b201">1963</a>), in which variation in the response variable exceeds that expected through correlation between levels of the effect. Models were fitted in a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework using the package MCMCglmm version 2.16 (Hadfield 
    <a rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32">2010</a>) in 
    <span class="sc">r</span> version 2.15.1. For fixed effects, prior settings assumed a normal distribution with a mean (
    <span class="italic">µ</span>) of 0 and a variance (
    <span class="italic">V</span>) of 10
    <span class="sup">8</span>. For random effect variances, scaled 
    <span class="italic">F</span>_{1,1} priors (with scale 1000) were used (Gelman 
    <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2006</a>) except for the residual variance for which an inverse-gamma prior was used with shape and scale equal to 0.001. Models were run for 500 000 iterations with a burn-in of 50 000 and parameter sampling every 450 iterations. As the response variable was count data and usually contained many zeros, a Poisson error distribution was applied. Our incorporation of 
    <span class="italic">year</span> as a fixed effect allowed for variation in abundance between years, while estimating the relationship between gall abundance and tree phenotypic traits across both years. The proportion of variance explained by the 
    <span class="italic">year</span> fixed effect was estimated as the marginal 
    <span class="italic">R</span>
    <span class="sup">2</span> of the model (RsqM), following Nakagawa and Schielzeth (
    <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2013</a>) (
    <span class="sc">r</span> code for deriving RsqM from MCMCglmm objects is provided in 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd3" href="#sd3">Data S3</a>). The variance component of each random effect was calculated by dividing its estimated variance parameter by the sum of all the random effect variance parameters, including the residual UNIT term – a random effect with a distinct level for each data unit that is fitted automatically for Poisson distributed models in the MCMCglmm package to account for overdispersion – and then multiplying each by the proportion of variance not explained by the fixed effect (i.e., 1−RsqM). We addressed the effects of multiple tests on false discovery rates – the expected proportion of false discoveries among the rejected hypotheses – following Benjamini and Hochberg (
    <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">1995</a>) and Benjamini and Yekutieli (
    <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2001</a>). The false discovery rate is a less stringent condition than the family-wise error rate, so this approach is more powerful than alternatives such as Bonferroni (Nakagawa 
    <a rid="b54" ref-type="bibr" href="#b54">2004</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate whether tree phenotypic traits were good predictors of variation in gall abundance, GLMMs were used to model counts of individual gall types with

   <span class="italic">Form</span> (tree health) or 
   <span class="italic">Budburst</span> (spring phenology) as fixed effects. While the influences of tree growth and health on gall abundance are expected to be linear, the local adaptation hypothesis for herbivores predicts that the influence of phenology will be curvilinear, with lower gall abundance on provenances that show budburst either before or after local oaks. The fixed effect 
   <span class="italic">Budburst</span> was therefore fitted as both untransformed and squared terms. To account for potential differences in abundance levels between the two study years, a factor 
   <span class="italic">year</span> was fitted as a fixed effect.

The probability that the posterior distribution of the fixed effect coefficients did not include zero (pMCMC) was used to assess the predictive capacity of the fixed effects.
