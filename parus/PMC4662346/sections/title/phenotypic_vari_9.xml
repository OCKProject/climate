 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If provenances are locally adapted, and divergence in selection history between provenance origins and the trial site increases with genetic distance, then we expect more genetically divergent provenances to show higher stress (measured using 
  <span class="italic">Form</span>) and lower vigour (measured using 
  <span class="italic">DBH</span>). 
  <span class="italic">Form</span> shows no linear relationship, but increases in variance in more divergent provenances (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2A</a>). Only the most genetically divergent provenance, from Telavi in Georgia, showed a markedly lower 
  <span class="italic">Form</span> score than other provenances. Plant vigour, measured using 
  <span class="italic">DBH</span>, does decrease with increasing genetic divergence (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2B</a>), consistent with local adaptation. Budburst phenology shows a strong relationship with latitude (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2C</a>), with more southerly provenances showing earlier budburst: by the time some southern provenance trees have open leaves (scores 4 and 5), northern provenances have yet to burst their buds (scores 0 and 1). We thus expect phenological mismatch with native oaks to correlate with differences in latitude between provenance origins and the trial site.
