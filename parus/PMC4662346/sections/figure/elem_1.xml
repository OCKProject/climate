 <div class="caption">
  <p>Between-provenance variation in three phenotypic variables (A) 
   <span class="italic">Form</span>, in which higher values indicate healthier trees; (B) and (D) 
   <span class="italic">Diameter at breast height</span> (
   <span class="italic">DBH</span>), in which higher values indicate more vigorous growth; and (C) 
   <span class="italic">Budburst</span> date, in which higher values indicate earlier budburst in the spring. In (A) and (B), the position of provenances on the 
   <span class="italic">x-axis</span> relates to their genetic differentiation (estimated as 
   <span class="italic">Geo</span>
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>ST</sub>) from the provenance closest to the provenance trial site (Forêt de Bercé). In (C) and (D), their position relates to the latitude of their site of origin with the identity of Forêt de Bercé shown. Modelling was conducted in the MCMCglmm 
   <span class="sc">r</span> package, and response variables were modelled with provenance fitted as a fixed effect and provenance, soil zone, plot and tree fitted as random effects. Models of (A) and (C) were fitted with a Poisson distribution, and (B) and (D) with a Gaussian distribution. Priors, burn-in, number of iterations and sampling frequency follow that described previously for the modelling of provenance effects on gall abundance. Vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals for each mean. MCMC, Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
