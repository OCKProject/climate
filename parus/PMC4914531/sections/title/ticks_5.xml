 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 2008 to 2010, 3195 ticks were collected, identified and connected to the bird data (Tables 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> and 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). The most frequently detected tick species was 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> (
  <span class="italic">I</span>.) 
  <span class="italic">ricinus</span> (78.02 %). 21.03 % of the ticks (especially engorged larvae) could only be identified as 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> spp. Among the 2520 ticks identified as different 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> spp., only 1.07 % belonged to the species 
  <span class="italic">I. hexagonus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">I. canisuga</span> or 
  <span class="italic">I. lividus</span>. Only three nymphs from three different birds were identified as 
  <span class="italic">Haemaphysalis</span> spp., other species like 
  <span class="italic">Hyalomma</span> spp. or 
  <span class="italic">Dermacentor</span> spp. were not found.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were mostly infested by nymphs (65.10 %), followed by larvae (32.96 %). Only 1.94 % of the bird-infesting ticks were female or male adult ticks.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only 12 of 838 tick-infested birds were infested with other than 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> or not further differentiated 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> spp. (mostly engorged larvae). Among these 12 birds, only three were infested with 
  <span class="italic">Haemaphysalis</span> spp. (three birds, three ticks), the others with 
  <span class="italic">I. canisuga</span> (four birds, 10 ticks), 
  <span class="italic">I. hexagonus</span> (two birds, two ticks) and 
  <span class="italic">I. lividus</span> (three birds, 15 ticks).
