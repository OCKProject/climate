 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From July 2008 to December 2010, data on captured birds and collected ticks were provided by 25 persons or groups of persons in six federal states in Germany. Nine of them did not send in a complete dataset (ticks and total number of birds caught); hence, we had to exclude them from the risk factor analysis for tick infestation. Nevertheless, these ticks were included in the following parts of our study about the screening for tick species and tick-borne pathogens. The remaining persons caught birds in five different federal states (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Birds were caught in mist nets or in Helgoland traps and were identified by species and ring number. If possible, sex and age were determined. Bird species were allocated to migratory birds and differentiated as long-distance migratory birds which overwinter in Sub-Saharan Africa, and short-distance migratory birds which overwinter in Western Europe and Northern Africa, and sedentary birds that stay in the same region year-round. Ticks were removed by special tweezers, collected in plastic vials, frozen at −20 °C, transported to the lab, and differentiated according to Estrada-Peña et al. (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data of birds and ticks from birds were statistically analysed with the R statistical software 3.1.1., using Fisher exact test (fisher.test {stats}) and MS Excel 2010.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Classification into ground feeders and non-ground feeders is not always clear because most bird species have main places where they search for food and visit both, ground and non-ground places. Additionally, the places where birds mainly find food depend on the season. In this study, classification was done regarding the tick season for sedentary birds and the breeding season for migratory birds. In addition to the statistical analysis of the registered data sets from ticks and birds, in adult ticks and nymphs arthropod- and bird-associated viral pathogens as well as 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. as the most common tick-borne bacterial pathogen in Germany were investigated. DNA and RNA were extracted as follows: Ticks were ground up in a mixer mill with three stainless steel beads (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) and 400 μl medium (MEM Earle, Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany). For DNA and RNA extraction, pools of five tick suspensions were generated with 100 μl of each tick suspension. The remaining sample was stored for further investigation of single ticks in case of pathogen detection in some of the pools. The pools were used for DNA and RNA extraction according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the NucleoSpin® 96 Virus kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Detection of viral pathogens was performed by using the TBEV-real-time RT-PCR according to Schwaiger and Cassinotti (
