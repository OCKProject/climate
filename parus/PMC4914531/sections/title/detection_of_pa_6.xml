 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For pathogen screening, a total of 425 pools created from five homogenized tick samples (nymphs, female and male adult ticks, larvae were not included) were investigated. In case of positive results, single ticks of the positive pool were investigated.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a first PCR-screening, all pools were investigated for TBEV-RNA as the most likely viral pathogen in ticks in Germany. The PCR was combined with an 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span>-specific extraction control in a duplex assay. Successful nucleic acid extraction could be confirmed in all 425 pools. However, no TBEV-RNA could be co-amplified from those samples. Identical negative results were obtained using the broad-range PCR-assays for Flaviviruses, Simbuviruses and Lyssaviruses as well as the Sindbisvirus RT-qPCR. However, the positive control reactions confirmed that the assay and test conditions were suitable.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the viral pathogens, the Pan-Borrelia real-time PCR determined 57 pools as 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive. Forty of the 57 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive tick pools consisted of tick samples collected from two or more birds. From these 40 pools, all single ticks were analysed together with 45 larvae that had not been tested in pools before. Ninety-seven 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive nymphs and 27 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive larvae were detected.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seventeen 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive pools were not checked as single ticks because each of these pools consisted of ticks collected from one bird. The result of 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive ticks in these pools can theoretically match between 17 (only one tick in the pool was 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive) and a maximum of 85 (all five ticks in the pool were 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. positive) and was not further differentiated. Together with the 97 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive nymphs and 27 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive larvae, investigated as single ticks, in total between 141 and 209 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive ticks were found. In relation to the whole number of 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span>-examined ticks (2125 nymphs and adults plus 45 larvae) 6.50–9.63 % of the ticks were found to be 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive ticks were collected from 76 birds, representing 8.52 % of all tick-infested birds. Among the 76 birds, a majority of 54 individuals were blackbirds (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>), followed by 12 song thrushes (
  <span class="italic">Turdus philomelos</span>), and 10 individuals belonging to six species: pied flycatcher (
  <span class="italic">Ficedula hypoleuca</span>), bullfinch (
  <span class="italic">Pyrrhula pyrrhula</span>), dunnock (
  <span class="italic">Prunella modularis</span>), great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), long-tailed tit (
  <span class="italic">Aegithalos caudatus</span>) and marsh warbler (
  <span class="italic">Acrocephalus palustris</span>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows the bird collecting places. All places where birds with 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive ticks were caught were marked with a red dot, places with 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-negative ticks were marked with a blue dot. Most birds with 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive ticks were caught in Mülverstedt, Thuringia (18 birds, 11.8 % of all tick-wearing birds caught at this place), Dresden, Saxony (14 birds, 13.5 % of all tick-bearing birds caught at this place), Frankfurt, Hesse (11 birds, 12.8 % of all tick-wearing birds caught at this place), and Annaberg-Buchholz, Saxony (10 birds, 13.7 % of all tick-bearing birds caught at this place).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three places with 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive ticks (Mülverstedt, Thuringia, Annaberg-Buchholz and Dresden, both Saxony) were chosen because ticks from birds were collected over 2 years at these places. Here, a species differentiation of 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. was performed. Forty-eight single ticks were tested, and, in spite of the very limited amount of original material, 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> strains from 18 ticks were successfully determined (Table 
  <a rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" href="#Tab6">6</a>). In total, the most common species at these three places was 
  <span class="italic">B. garinii</span> (10 samples, 5 different strains), followed by 
  <span class="italic">B. valaisiana</span> (6 samples, 2 different strains) and one strain each of 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> s.s. and 
  <span class="italic">B. afzelii</span>.
