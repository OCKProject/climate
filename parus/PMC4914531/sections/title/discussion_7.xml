 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For many years, it has been well known that birds can serve as hosts for ticks, and depending on their specific biology they can cover smaller or greater distances, for example a long-distance migratory bird up to 1600 km non-stop across the Sahara (Hoogstraal and Kaiser 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">1961</a>; Hoogstraal et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">1961</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">1963</a>). Ticks and tick-borne pathogens can thus be transported to new non-endemic areas. In Sweden, 13 tick species have been listed, at least some of them occasionally, and the potential introduction of exotic pathogens is considered to be evident. It is mainly caused by the large number of people, animals and materials transported across the world, but also by migratory birds (Jaenson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">1994</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In most of the existing studies, only a small number of migratory birds was found to be infested with ticks. In Sweden 8 % (Elfving et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2010</a>), in Great Britain 8 % (Jameson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2012</a>), in Greece (Antikythira) and Italy (Capri) 5 % (Lindeborg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2012</a>), in Finland 2.1 % of the birds were infested, on average with two ticks per bird (Nuorteva and Hoogstraal 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">1963</a>). Our results with 3 % tick-infested birds (2.45 % of the migratory birds, 4.29 % of the sedentary birds) were in the same range. For Finland, extrapolated on the whole number of 600 million migratory birds, this means that every year nearly 25 millions of ticks are imported by birds (Nuorteva and Hoogstraal 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">1963</a>). In the USA, more than 3000 birds were checked for ticks around the Gulf of Mexico. 3.56 % were infested with ticks (seven 
  <span class="italic">Amblyomma</span> spp., one 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> spp.), and extrapolation of these findings suggests that four to 39 million exotic neotropical ticks could be transported to the USA annually by migratory songbirds with uncertain consequences for humans and animals (Cohen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2015</a>). For Europe such hypothesis should be handled with care: Most of the ticks found on birds were 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> spp.. Larvae need 2–5 days and nymphs 2–7 days for the blood meal, which limits the transportation distance. Birds need five and more days from Southern France to Iceland; however, the time span is strongly influenced by the weather conditions (Mehl et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">1984</a>). The average daily distance of small migratory bird species included in this study is about 60 to 75 km with a maximum of 150 km (Alerstam and Lindström 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1990</a>; Ellegren 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">1993</a>; Berthold 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2012</a>). Depending on the bird species at least 6 to 14 days are needed to migrate from Northern African countries to Germany. In addition, the birds often stay at resting grounds for several days which further increases the migration time.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> spp. 
  <span class="italic">Hyalomma marginatum</span> needs up to 12–27 days for the blood meal (Balashov 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">1972</a>), and in this time span it is possible that ticks can be transported from Africa to Europe. This was e.g., confirmed by the detection of 
  <span class="italic">Hyalomma marginatum</span> in Norway (Mehl et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">1984</a>), Finland (Nuorteva and Hoogstraal 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">1963</a>) and Sweden (Brinck et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">1965</a>) as well as in Great Britain (Jameson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2012</a>), Italy and Greece (Molin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2011</a>; Lindeborg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2012</a>; Wallmenius et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2014</a>). In our investigations, no 
  <span class="italic">Hyalomma marginatum</span> ticks were found. Thus, it can be concluded that 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> spp. collected from long-distance migratory birds were most likely acquired at a stopover place or near the place birds were caught for tick collection. Thus, a pathogen transfer by these ticks for example from Africa is not very likely.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ground-feeder birds, migratory as well as sedentary birds, spend a predominant part of their live span in potential tick habitats and have a higher chance to be infested by ticks than birds that do not feed on the ground (Brinck et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">1965</a>; Cohen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2015</a>). This is in accordance with our results that demonstrated significant differences of tick infestation between ground feeders and non-ground feeders (5.59 % versus 1.40 % infested birds). Especially passerine birds, and in Europe the blackbird (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) appear to be very important for harbouring ticks (Špitalská et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2006</a>; Hasle 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2013</a>; Sándor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2014</a>). For Germany, our study confirmed that the blackbird (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) plays a very important role. However, of the 14 most strongly infested bird species, nine species were migratory birds and able to transport ticks and pathogens to new potential foci, for example from the Mediterranean Sea to Germany. The importance of migratory birds for tick transportation could also be shown in the Danube delta by Sándor et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2014</a>) where 92.25 % of the collected ticks were 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span>. This was also the predominant species in our investigations. Among the 3195 ticks, only three 
  <span class="italic">Haemaphysalis</span> spp. ticks were detected, all the others belonged to the 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> spp., mostly 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span>. In our study in most cases, birds were infested with a low number of ticks per bird, i.e., between one and five. A mean infestation rate of two ticks per bird was found in winter in the Czech Republic (Literak et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2007</a>), and six ticks per bird from spring to autumn in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (Taragel’ová et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2005</a>). An influence on bird condition can thus be excluded. Norte et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2013</a>) observed a significantly reduced general condition and weight loss in blackbirds (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) infested with up to 10 or more larvae. In our study, the highest infestation in one bird was 55 ticks; however, such a high infestation rate is very seldom (Brinck et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">1965</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ticks on birds can be infected with a varying number of tick-borne pathogens, like 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. (Anderson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1986</a>; Olsén et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">1995</a>; Gylfe et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2000</a>; Comstedt et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2006</a>; Poupon et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2006</a>; Franke et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2010a</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">b</a>), 
  <span class="italic">Babesia</span> spp. (Hildebrandt et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2011</a>), 
  <span class="italic">Rickettsia</span> spp. (Elfving et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2010</a>), 
  <span class="italic">Anaplasma</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Ehrlichia</span> spp. (Bjöersdorff et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2001</a>; Hildebrandt et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2011</a>). Only little is known about viral pathogens found in ticks from birds. Waldenström et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2007</a>) checked 13,260 migratory birds in Sweden, 447 (3.4 %) birds were infested with ticks but only four birds were infested with six TBEV-infected ticks. It was concluded that TBEV can be distributed by tick-infested migratory birds in spite of the very low number of TBEV positive ticks detected. These findings were confirmed in Estonia (Geller et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2013</a>), Switzerland (Lommano et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2014</a>) and Latvia (Kazarina et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2015</a>). Ernek et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1968</a>) detected TBEV antibodies in sera from blackbirds (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) and sparrows (
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span>) as well as TBEV in ticks from blackbirds (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>). Other bird species might have a high natural resistance against TBEV. Experimental infections of buzzards (
  <span class="italic">Buteo buteo</span>), kestrels (
  <span class="italic">Falco tinnunculus</span>) (Rehaček et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">1963</a>), great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) (Grešíková et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">1962</a>) or pheasants (
  <span class="italic">Phasianus colchicus</span>) (Nosek et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">1962</a>) induced only in some cases TBEV-specific antibodies; neither viraemia nor clinical signs were observed. In our investigations, no TBEV-RNA could be detected. However, the most infested species blackbird (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) could serve as transportation host for TBEV-infected ticks according to Ernek et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1968</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hubálek (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2004</a>) emphasized that some species of migratory birds play an important role for circulation and ecology of some arboviruses like Sindbis virus or some 
  <span class="italic">Flaviviridae</span>. Tick-borne 
  <span class="italic">Bunyaviridae</span> in wild birds were not amplified, no clinical signs occurred, but the virus was detected in the blood for several days, which might be sufficient for an effective transportation to a new area (Hubálek et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">1982</a>). It was predicted that natural foci of tick-borne 
  <span class="italic">Bunyaviridae</span> in Europe might spread from the south up to Switzerland, Austria and Germany, provided that winters in the next years are mild and summers are dry (Hubálek 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2009</a>). Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), mostly found in 
  <span class="italic">Hyalomma</span> spp., could adapt to other vectors (Bente et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2013</a>). It might be spread to the north via animal trade and migratory birds, viraemia in the birds is not a precondition (Bente et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2013</a>). Lindeborg et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2012</a>) collected ticks from migratory birds on Capri (Italy) and Antikythira (Greece), 5 % of the birds were infested with ticks, mostly 
  <span class="italic">Hyalomma marginatum</span>, only one bird was infested with three CCHFV virus positive 
  <span class="italic">Hyalomma marginatum</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estrada-Peña et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2012</a>) discussed CCHFV distribution, the lack of knowledge about vector competence of other tick species than 
  <span class="italic">Hyalomma marginatum</span>, and generally recommended more empirical studies on the importance of birds for distribution of infected ticks and survival chances of the pathogens in new and up to now non-endemic areas. It is possible that mosquito-borne pathogens can adapt to ticks as vectors. Hagman et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2014</a>) checked 747 ticks from migratory birds for West Nile virus (WNV), but all ticks were negative. Hubálek and Rudolf (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2012</a>) listed 27 tick-borne viruses in Europe, some of them are associated with birds. TBEV was detected in some bird species, like the common redpoll (
  <span class="italic">Acanthis flammea</span>) and the sparrow (
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span>); viraemia after experimental infection was observed in some bird species like the common quail (
  <span class="italic">Coturnix coturnix</span>) or the mallard (
  <span class="italic">Anas plathyrhynchos</span>). Birds were not susceptible for experimental infection with CCHFV. Experimental infection with Bunyavirus Bhanja was not lethal for passerine birds. Some bird species (European starling, 
  <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span>; chaffinch, 
  <span class="italic">Fringilla coelebs</span>) can serve as hosts for orbivirus Tribeć without clinical symptoms, the same applies to orthobunyavirus Bahig and passerine birds. In many cases, only little is known about virus and birds. For distribution of Thogotovirus migratory birds can also be important (Calisher et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">1987</a>; Hubálek and Rudolf 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our study, the screening results for viral pathogens (Flavivirus-RT-PCR, Simbuvirus-RT-qPCR, Lyssavirus-RT-qPCR, Sindbisvirus-RT-qPCR) in ticks from birds in Germany were all negative. It can be concluded that in our study, all checked birds could not be detected as competent hosts or transportation hosts for these viral pathogens. Nevertheless, screening of ticks and birds for viral pathogens should be continued, especially with broad-range PCR methods as an early warning system.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. were detected in ticks from birds (Table 
  <a rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" href="#Tab6">6</a>), distributed at nine of the 25 tick collecting places (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Birds, especially blackbirds (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) and song trushes (
  <span class="italic">Turdus philomelos</span>), play an important role in the distribution of 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. (Humair et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">1993</a>; Olsén et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">1995</a>; Taragel’ová et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2008</a>), serve as reservoir hosts (Lommano et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2014</a>), and can establish new 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> foci. In our study also rodent-associated 
  <span class="italic">B. afzelii</span> was found in ticks from birds and confirmed the findings of Olsén et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">1995</a>), Franke et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2010b</a>) and Geller et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2013</a>) that also rodent-associated 
  <span class="italic">B. afzelii</span> strains can be harboured in ticks feeding on birds. Gylfe et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2000</a>) found reactivation of 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infections in migratory birds caused by stress factors, which could explain the distribution of 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. over longer distances and the infection of a new so far non-infected tick population. Among the most strongly infested birds besides blackbirds (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) as a sedentary bird species, nine species were registered as short- or long-distance migratory birds (Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>) that have the potential to distribute 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. as described in new previously non-infected areas under stress conditions (Gylfe et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2000</a>). In conclusion, not only blackbirds (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) and other passerine birds should be examined for epidemiological studies of 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. but also migratory bird species with relevant tick infestation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To our knowledge, this was the first study about ticks and birds including such a large number of birds and ticks at different places in six federal states in Germany. In our investigations of birds, all collected tick species were well known in Germany and no unexpected exotic species was detected. For the first time, ticks from birds in Germany were also investigated for a wide range of viral pathogens. This was possible due to the established broad-range PCR systems for different virus genera. Nevertheless, no positive results were seen in this study, but cannot be excluded for the future. In addition, a high relevance of birds for the epidemiology of 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. could be confirmed. Blackbirds (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) but also some species of migratory birds highly infested with ticks should be focused for further investigations of this topic.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is further suggested that short-distance migratory birds should be checked frequently for ticks in the future. Their specific biology allows them to transport ticks with pathogens for example from around the Mediterranean Sea to Germany within a few days. In case of good weather conditions, progressing climate change and presence of susceptible hosts for ticks and pathogens new viral endemic foci can be generated within a short time.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estrada-Peña et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2012</a>) recommended more empirical studies on the importance of birds for distribution of infected ticks and survival chances of the pathogens in new and so far non-endemic areas. Hubálek and Rudolf (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2012</a>) suggested that an active search for new tick-borne viruses or for new pathogenic variants of the known tick-borne viruses in Europe should be continued because some of them may often pass unnoticed or be misdiagnosed. For the future, long-term studies in the field including pathogens, vectors, hosts, microclimate and habitat structure are needed and should be combined with laboratory investigations on the transmission competence of various hosts to improve the knowledge about viral tick-borne diseases (Estrada-Peña and de la Fuente 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2014</a>).
