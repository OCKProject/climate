 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Arthropod-borne and especially tick-borne diseases have become a growing public health concern over the past decades (World Health Organization 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2004</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">2014</a>) and cause severe health problems in humans and animals (Estrada-Peña 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2009</a>). In order to maintain tick-borne diseases in a population, it is essential that the pathogen, a susceptible vertebrate host, and ticks with competence for the pathogen are available. Many different biotic and abiotic factors can influence these three components and all components must be available in sufficient numbers at the same time and the same place as described e.g., by Pfeffer and Dobler (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2010</a>). In nature, for new and emerging diseases, the chance for such a scenario is most likely very low. Nevertheless, outbreaks of vector-borne animal diseases like bluetongue disease or Schmallenberg virus infection in Europe (Wilson and Mellor 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2009</a>; Hoffmann et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2012</a>) as well as Usutu virus infection in Germany (Becker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2012</a>) have shown that this scenario is reality, and in some cases cannot only cause severe medical problems but also financial losses in agriculture.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spread of ticks and tick-borne pathogens can be promoted by global trade, animal migration (Pfeffer and Dobler 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2010</a>), and climate change (Estrada-Peña 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2009</a>). In this context, migratory birds play a more important role than less mobile wingless hosts (Hasle 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Germany, only a small number of studies have been carried out to investigate ticks from birds for tick-borne pathogens, and so far no data are available about tick infestation of birds. Franke et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2010a</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">b</a>) checked 221 and 191 ticks, respectively, from birds for bacterial pathogens and detected 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">Anaplasma phagocytophilum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Rickettsia</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">Babesia</span> spp. and 
  <span class="italic">Francisella tularensis</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initially, our aim was to determine the number of tick-carrying birds in Germany. It was hypothesized that tick infestation depends on species and age and the biology of the individual bird species, migratory bird species were compared to sedentary bird species and ground feeder species were compared to non-ground feeder species.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Except for TBEV, knowledge about tick-borne viral pathogens in birds in Germany is limited. It is expected that viral infection is more likely in adult ticks or nymphs than in larvae. In addition to tick infestation of birds, adult ticks and nymphs were checked for viral pathogens. Ticks were investigated by various real-time PCR systems for detection of whole virus genera or phylogenetic groups as a screening test that is less time-consuming and costly than species specific PCR systems, and with some specific real-time PCR tests for viral pathogens that are common in Germany, such as TBEV and Sindbisvirus.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, adult ticks and nymphs were tested for 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp., the most common tick-borne pathogen in Germany.
