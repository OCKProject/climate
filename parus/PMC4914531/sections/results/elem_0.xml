  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In total, 892 birds infested with ticks were found. After removing all datasets with missing data, especially without the total number of captured birds, 725 tick-infested birds, captured during ringing of 23,949 birds, could be further analysed for infestation rates, and a mean rate of 3.01 % (CI 2.80–3.24) was found. Most of the ticks were collected at the head around beak, eye and ear. The infestation rates were 5.59 % (CI 5.13–6.08) in ground feeders and 1.40 % (CI 1.22–1.61) in non-ground feeders. There is a significant difference between both groups (OR 4.16,

   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>; Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Referring to migration behaviour, the infestation rates were 4.29 % (CI 3.84–4.78 %) in sedentary birds and 2.45 % (CI 2.22–2.70) in migratory birds (OR 1.78, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01). Short-distance migratory birds were affected with higher rates (3.03 %, CI 2.71–3.38) than long-distance migratory birds (1.55 %, CI 1.27–1.88) as illustrated in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> (OR 1.98,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the next steps, all 892 birds which were infested by ticks were included. In order to analyse tick infestation referring to data from birds, complete data sets were available from 838 tick-infested birds and were analysed with the following results: The mean tick infestation per bird was 4.2 ticks in the ground feeder group and 3.0 in the non-ground feeder group (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Referring to migration behaviour, remarkable differences were seen: Sedentary birds had an average of 4.7 ticks per bird, short-distance migratory birds 3.2 ticks and long-distance migratory birds only 2.0 ticks per bird (Table 
   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). Figure 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> highlights that in every group of birds referring to migration or feeding behaviour, some single individuals were infested by 10 up to 55 ticks per bird.

Therefore, only the years 2009 and 2010 could be compared in this study. A remarkable difference in the number of ticks per bird was only seen in the group of short-distance migratory birds, which were non-ground feeders: in 2009, 3.8 ticks were collected, whereas in 2010 only 1.9 ticks per bird could be collected (data not shown in detail). All other data did not differ remarkably between the years. For this reason, the data were interpreted in the discussion-section over the whole period of tick collection and not separated into 2009 and 2010.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The age of the birds was only recorded for tick-infested birds. These birds were divided into two groups: juvenile birds (up to one year) and adult birds. Four hundred forty-three juvenile birds and 422 adult birds with ticks were caught. No statistical differences between the two groups were noticed. For 27 birds, it was not possible to determine the age (data not shown in detail).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For pathogen screening, a total of 425 pools created from five homogenized tick samples (nymphs, female and male adult ticks, larvae were not included) were investigated. In case of positive results, single ticks of the positive pool were investigated.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a first PCR-screening, all pools were investigated for TBEV-RNA as the most likely viral pathogen in ticks in Germany. The PCR was combined with an 
   <span class="italic">Ixodes</span>-specific extraction control in a duplex assay. Successful nucleic acid extraction could be confirmed in all 425 pools. However, no TBEV-RNA could be co-amplified from those samples. Identical negative results were obtained using the broad-range PCR-assays for Flaviviruses, Simbuviruses and Lyssaviruses as well as the Sindbisvirus RT-qPCR. However, the positive control reactions confirmed that the assay and test conditions were suitable.

   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive tick pools consisted of tick samples collected from two or more birds. From these 40 pools, all single ticks were analysed together with 45 larvae that had not been tested in pools before. Ninety-seven 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive nymphs and 27

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seventeen 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive pools were not checked as single ticks because each of these pools consisted of ticks collected from one bird. The result of 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive ticks in these pools can theoretically match between 17 (only one tick in the pool was 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp.-positive) and a maximum of 85 (all five ticks in the pool were
