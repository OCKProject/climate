 <p>The importance of ticks and tick-borne pathogens for human and animal health has been increasing over the past decades. For their transportation and dissemination, birds may play a more important role than wingless hosts. In this study, tick infestation of birds in Germany was examined. Eight hundred ninety-two captured birds were infested with ticks and belonged to 48 different species, of which blackbirds (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) and song thrushes (
  <span class="italic">Turdus philomelos</span>) were most strongly infested. Ground feeders were more strongly infested than non-ground feeders, sedentary birds more strongly than migratory birds, and short-distance migratory birds more strongly than long-distance migratory birds. Mean tick infestation per bird ranged between 2 (long-distance migratory bird) and 4.7 (sedentary bird), in some single cases up to 55 ticks per bird were found. With the exception of three nymphs of 
  <span class="italic">Haemaphysalis</span> spp., all ticks belonged to 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> spp., the most frequently detected tick species was 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</span>. Birds were mostly infested by nymphs (65.1 %), followed by larvae (32.96 %). Additionally, ticks collected from birds were examined for several pathogens: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Sindbisvirus with real-time RT-PCR, Flaviviruses, Simbuviruses and Lyssaviruses with broad-range standard RT-PCR-assays, and 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. with a Pan-
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> real-time PCR. Interestingly, no viral pathogens could be detected, but 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. positive ticks were collected from 76 birds. 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> (
  <span class="italic">B</span>.) 
  <span class="italic">garinii</span>, 
  <span class="italic">B. valaisiaina</span>, 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi s.s</span>. and 
  <span class="italic">B. afzelii</span> were determined. The screening of ticks and birds for viral pathogens with broad range PCR-assays was tested and the use as an “early warning system” is discussed.
