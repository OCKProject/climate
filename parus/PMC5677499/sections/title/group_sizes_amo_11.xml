 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 6 years (2010, 2012–2016), we observed a total of 309 social groups in the summer, among which were 266 families with data for group sizes. The average group size of the whole population was 3.88 ± 1.19 individuals. The proportion of families with more than two members was 89.1% (237/266). The group sizes were significantly different across years (
