 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For territorial bird species, spatially closed social groups may be close relatives due to limited dispersal. They breed independently in summer but may amalgamate during a harsh winter, while communications between those spatially distant social groups may be limited due to territorial defense or the long distance between territories (Ke, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>). Intraspecific competition for resources, one of the main density‐dependent processes, will work mainly on a local scale in territorial species (Newton, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0049">1992</a>). Hence, for a territorial bird species living in strongly fragmented habitats, distant habitat patches can be seen as relatively independent land islands, in which the utilization of ecological resources is relatively exclusive. Similarly, distant groups or territories can be considered relatively independent. In contrast, neighboring habitat patches may be shared by neighboring groups across different seasons through group amalgamation or generational replacement. Although the members of the social groups may change across years or seasons, these neighboring habitat patches can be looked as a whole, which is shared by the continuum of family generations of these neighboring social groups. Correspondingly, the continuum can be looked as a subpopulation. Hence, the perspective can be changed as to how a subarea of the suitable habitat supports the social groups in the subpopulation across the years, regardless of who the group members are and where they are from.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Masked laughingthrushes live year‐round in territories within social groups, and their suitable habitats are partitioned by large areas of paddy field, water bodies, and higher mountains (Ke et al., 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0032">2011</a>; Figures 
  <a rid="ece33405-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33405-fig-0001">1</a> and 
  <a rid="ece33405-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33405-fig-0002">2</a>). Among these fragmented patches of suitable habitats, one family may occupy several patches, and one patch may also sometimes include several territories. In total, there were approximately 50 family groups scattered among these patches each year with an average nearest distance of 600 m (ranging from 230 m to 1,200 m) between territories (Ke et al., 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0032">2011</a>). Their territories may vary across the years because of new territory foundation, old territory shifting, territory budding, disappearing, and amalgamation. We recorded the geographic coordinates of the central points of all the territories over the six‐year period. Based on the location information, we clustered the contiguous habitat patches into subareas using the centroid linkage and clustered corresponding social groups across years into subpopulations. The total area of all the patches in a subarea is considered to be the area of suitable habitats for the subpopulation in the subarea.
