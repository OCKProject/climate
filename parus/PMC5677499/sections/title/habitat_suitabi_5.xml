 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to characteristics of vegetation composition and spatial structure, the habitat in our study area can be roughly distinguished into three types of compartmental patches with relatively distinct boundaries: (1) dense living grasses or bushes on the ground with dense or sparse trees; (2) bared grounds with sparse trees; and (3) sufficient ground litter under sparse trees. Masked laughingthrushes were usually foraging and breeding in those habitats characterized by sparse trees and a small amount of litter. All these types of patches in which we observed the behaviors of foraging and breeding of the birds (bird presence) more than three times were considered suitable habitats for the birds. The territory was defined as the area used for living and breeding (Maher &amp; Lott, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0045">1995</a>). Territories of different social groups were distinguished by territory defense behavior and the natural boundaries of the patches where there were no neighboring groups. Based on field observations of the natural boundary of habitat patches and territory defensive behaviors, we finally delineated the distribution map of the birds (FiguresÂ

  <a rid="ece33405-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33405-fig-0002">2</a>). We were then able to measure the areas of all the patches of suitable habitats. All the areas were measured using Google Earth Pro software.
