 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cooperative breeding is a reproductive system in which more than two individuals show parent‐like behavior toward young of a single nest or brood. Although the social structures of these systems vary across species or populations, from helping by close relatives to cooperative polygamy or plural breeding, cooperatively breeding birds usually live in groups of two to 15 individuals (Stacey &amp; Koenig, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0066">1990</a>; Ke, Griesser, &amp; Huang, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0030">2016</a>), with mean group sizes of &lt;10 individuals (Smith, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0064">1990</a>). The mean group size (MGS) can be used as an indicator of the prevalence of helpers in a cooperatively breeding population (Stacey &amp; Koenig, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0066">1990</a>; Koenig &amp; Dickinson, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0035">2016</a>). For certain cooperative populations, the larger group size suggests the higher popularity of helpers. In this case, it is crucial to explore how the group size varies with ecological factors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MGS of cooperative breeders was reported to be related to ecological harshness (prey abundance or rainfall; Emlen, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0019">1982</a>; Stacey &amp; Koenig, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0066">1990</a>; Russell, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0059">1999</a>; Ke, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>). For example, the MGS in Seychelles warblers 
  <span class="italic">Acrocephalus sechellensis</span> was larger in high‐quality territories (Komdeur, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0037">1992</a>); groups of the Superb starling 
  <span class="italic">Lamprotornis superbus</span> were larger in years with greater rainfall during the prebreeding period (Rubenstein, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0058">2016</a>). In addition, abundant insect prey or rainfall in the month preceding breeding led to a lower proportion of population helping in White‐fronted bee‐eaters 
  <span class="italic">Merops bullockoides</span> (Emlen, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0019">1982</a>), and extremely low rainfall led to a higher proportion of helping in the next year in Tibetan ground tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus humilies</span> (Ke, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>). Hence, it seems the relationship between the levels of helping and ecological background may differ for different species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The group size was also reported to be related to the territory size. Individuals may adjust territory size to ensure the resources necessary for survival and breeding (Dunk &amp; Cooper, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0017">1994</a>; Gass, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0023">1979</a>). Two conflict patterns were detected among different studies. A positive correlation occurred between the number of group members and territory size of White‐banded tanagers (Duca &amp; Marini, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0016">2014</a>). In the Cinnamon‐breasted rock bunting 
  <span class="italic">Emberiza tahapisi</span>, however, the flock size was negatively related to territory size; but positively related to food abundance (Atuo &amp; Manu, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0001">2013</a>). Territory density, refers as the average number of territories per unit area of suitable habitats, is the reciprocal of the mean territory size. The increasing of territory density would usually lead to the decreasing of territory size. While, there is a minimum size of territory to supply the needs of individuals (Hixon, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0027">1980</a>; Perrins &amp; Birkhead, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0053">1983</a>). As expected, the group size was found to be increased with territory density in blue korhaan 
  <span class="italic">Eupodotis caerulescens</span> (Moreira, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0047">2006</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the group sizes, territory size or density, prey availability and rainfall were all transient parameters measured at a particular point in time in all of the above studies, what in fact are they fluctuate across seasons or years (Emlen, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0019">1982</a>; Ke, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>; Komdeur, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0037">1992</a>; Rubenstein, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0058">2016</a>). Thus, the question arises whether there are more stable parameters to measure group size and these ecological factors. One case has been reported. A population of Seychelles warblers was maintained at approximately 300 birds and 120 groups in the isolated Cousin Island with an area of 29 ha, when it reached the upper limit of carrying capacity (Komdeur, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0037">1992</a>; Komdeur, Burke, Dughale, &amp; Richardson, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0038">2016</a>), which was different from that of their populations in other islands (Komdeur et al., 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0038">2016</a>). Thus, we can directly infer that the long‐term MGS and mean group density (MGD) or bird density stayed relatively stable under a certain level of carrying capacity (Komdeur, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0037">1992</a>; Komdeur et al., 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0038">2016</a>). In populations of territorial species, individuals are usually limited in social groups within certain territories. The surplus of ecological resources in one territory cannot be utilized by group members in other territories, and vice versa. As a result, the MGD is better than bird density to be used as a fitness measure in territorial bird species. Hence, we can hypothesize that the long‐term MGS should be correlated to long‐term MGD.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MGD is equal to mean territory density, which is also the reciprocal of mean territory size. Numerous studies have demonstrated that long‐term mean territory size is inversely related to food abundance per unit area (reviewed by Smith &amp; Shugart, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0065">1987</a>). When individual fitness is maximized in habitat of optimal quality, habitat quality may be the ultimate regulator of territory size (Smith &amp; Shugart, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0065">1987</a>). Thus, factors like food, nesting sites, cover, and predation rates would simply be components of the overall habitat quality (Franzblau &amp; Collins, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0021">1980</a>; Fretwell &amp; Lucas, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0022">1969</a>; Orians, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0052">1971</a>). In this way, the food abundance per unit area is one important indicator of habitat quality. It also suggests that mean territory size, mean territory density, and MGD can be all used as indicators of habitat quality (Holmes, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0028">1970</a>; Myers, Conners, &amp; Pitelka, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0048">1979</a>; Seastedt &amp; MacLean, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0060">1979</a>; Simon, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0061">1975</a>; Stenger, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0067">1958</a>). Additionally, long‐term MGD may be a better indicator of habitat quality compared with food abundance per unit area, because it is an ecological result of synthesized influences from nest sites, cover, predation, climate, etc. and not only from food abundance. Hence, the correlation between long‐term MGS and MGD can also explain how MGS varies with habitat quality. As shown in Ethiopian wolves 
  <span class="italic">Canis simensis</span>, a social group's composition is determined by its territory quality (Tallents, Randall, Williams, &amp; Macdonald, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0068">2012</a>). However, the correlation between long‐term MGS and MGD received little concern. The question remains regarding how MGS will change with habitat quality (as indicated by MGD) and over what periods “long‐term” MGD needs to be calculated, in order to provide a reliable predictor of habitat quality.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Masked laughingthrush 
  <span class="italic">Garrulax perspicillatus</span> is a bird species once placed in Timaliidae and now excluded as Leiothrichidae (Cibois, Gelang, &amp; Pasquet, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0010">2010</a>; Gelang et al., 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0024">2009</a>), which is widely distributed throughout southeastern China (Zhao, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0071">2001</a>; Zheng, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0072">2011</a>). Although the breeding ecology of Masked laughingthrushes had been recorded (Liu, Jia, &amp; Ning, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0041">2002</a>; Ma, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0042">1989</a>), their cooperatively breeding behaviors were recently confirmed (Ke, Long, Huang, Liao, &amp; Hu, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0032">2011</a>). The birds live in social groups within year‐round territories. Their suitable habitats are broken into pieces, which are scattered among residential area, paddy fields, water bodies, and hilly areas (Ke et al., 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0032">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, based on six years’ field observation on a population of Masked laughingthrushes, we recorded their group sizes and territory distribution. We measured the areas of all fragmented plots of suitable habitats, and finally, we explored the correlation between MGS and MGD and aimed (1) to show how MGS varied with MGD and (2) to explore the lower limit of time duration that can be tested for a stable correlation between MGS and MGD.</p>
