 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The volatility and stability of population dynamics</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown with the Seychelles warblers, the populations fluctuated across years but remained stable at an average level of approximately 120 groups and 300 individuals, when it reached the upper limit of carrying capacity (Komdeur, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0037">1992</a>), similar patterns were found in other populations (Komdeur et al., 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0038">2016</a>). These populations showed us the effects of both volatility year by year and stability averaged by certain time durations. Previous studies tried to explore how the group size varied with ecological gradients, while both parameters for the populations were measured for just one certain season or year (Emlen, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0019">1982</a>; Ke, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>; Komdeur, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0037">1992</a>). The inconsistent results in the above studies might be attributed to the effects of volatility across years (Reyer, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0056">1980</a>). In this study, the effects of both volatility and stability are explored. When the MGS is averaged for &lt;3 years and the MGD for &lt;4 years in populations of Masked laughingthrushes, the quadratic association between MGS and MGD is unstable, although it is occasionally significant (Table 
  <a rid="ece33405-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33405-tbl-0002">2</a>). The correlations were shown to be positive, negative, or quadratic as short‐term effects in different situations according to different time durations. Correspondingly, they are similar to those studies as simply positive (Komdeur, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0037">1992</a>; Rubenstein, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0058">2016</a>) or negative correlation (Emlen, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0019">1982</a>; Ke, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>). In contrast, when MGS is averaged for more than 2 years and MGD for more than 3 years, a reverse quadratic correlation between long‐term MGS and MGD becomes more constant (Table 
  <a rid="ece33405-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33405-tbl-0002">2</a>, Figure 
  <a rid="ece33405-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33405-fig-0004">4</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The external ecological factors may play important roles in the social structure and group dynamics, but their effect can be delayed. The current population state may be determined by ecological factors in the past; as shown in Tibetan ground tits, the current extreme drought led to intensified cooperation in the next year (Ke, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>). The transient group density is not just a result of current ecological conditions but a comprehensive result from ecological stresses experienced in at least several seasons or years (Batten &amp; Marchant, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0003">1977</a>; Marra &amp; Holmes, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0046">2001</a>). Due to the effects of the delayed ecological influences and the asynchrony of such influences among different populations, the volatility is understandable. However, when all the parameters are averaged for a sufficient elapsed time, it will show us the long‐term effects as stability. Such stability is sourced from the correlation between the population dynamic and long‐term habitat quality or the carrying capacity per unit area. A stable quadratic correlation between long‐term MGS and long‐term MGD in Masked laughingthrushes demonstrates this stability.
