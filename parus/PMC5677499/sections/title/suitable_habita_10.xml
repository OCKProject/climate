During the 6 years, we recorded a total of 110 geographic coordinates of different locations of territories due to the fluctuation of territory ranges. Using the centroid linkage, we clustered all these locations into 12 subgroups. The corresponding area of suitable habitats around these locations was divided into 12 subareas (Figure 
  <a rid="ece33405-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33405-fig-0002">2</a>). The mean area of the suitable habitats for the 12 subareas was 20.59 ± 10.51 ha. Correspondingly, the whole study population was broken into 12 subpopulations.
