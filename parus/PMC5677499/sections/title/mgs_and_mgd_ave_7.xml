 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MGS and MGD averaged for different time durations</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean group size and mean group density for the subpopulations in certain subareas were calculated by the data combined for each year or two to five consecutive years. The MGDs were calculated as the mean number of social groups divided by the total area of suitable habitats in each subarea. We marked the MGS as 
  <span class="italic">Gx</span> (G0, G2… and G23, G34…, etc. represented the MGS data of the year 2010, 2012… and 2012‐2013, 2013‐2014…, etc.), and MGD as 
  <span class="italic">Dx</span> (similarly, D0, D2… D23, D34 …D023456 to represent the MGD for corresponding time durations). Because the data in the year 2011 were not included, the data of 2010 were only used to calculate G0, D0 for 1 year, but G023456 and D023456 were used for all 6 years in this study.
