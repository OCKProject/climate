 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using MGD as independent variables and MGS as the dependent variable, the response curves of MGS to MGD are fitted by a quadratic function and modeled by quadratic regression. First, we explore the correlations between 
  <span class="italic">Gx</span> and D023456 to show how MGS varied with long‐term MGD. Second, we explore the correlation between 
  <span class="italic">Gx</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Dx</span> with same time durations (
  <span class="italic">x</span>) and try to find a lower limit of years for the stable correlation that can be tested. Finally, we made a 
  <span class="italic">p</span>‐value matrix for the correlations between 
  <span class="italic">Gx</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Dx</span> (related combination by changing the time duration (
  <span class="italic">x</span>) for both parameters) to show how MGS varied with MGD. When the correlations between MGS and MGD for all combinations of a certain time duration (from one to six years) were significant, the correlation was considered to be stable, and the time duration was considered that required for a stable correlation that can be tested. The smallest of these time durations is considered to be the lower limit of the time duration for the “long term.”
