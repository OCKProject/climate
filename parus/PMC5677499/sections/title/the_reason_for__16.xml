 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reason for a quadratic correlation</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Masked laughingthrushes, when MGS is averaged for more than 2 years and MGD for more than 3 years, long‐term MGS is correlated with long‐term MGD in a reverse quadratic shape. This suggests that the long‐term MGS varied with the gradient of long‐term habitat quality as the smallest in the best or worst habitats but highest in the moderate state. The question then arises as to the reason for the quadratic relationship.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that there are three prerequisites: (1) In the wild population, individuals will pursue independent reproduction to maximize the reproductive benefits in their lives to the greatest degree possible (Both &amp; Visser, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0004">2000</a>); (2) Wild populations have a higher survival rate under better habitat quality and a lower survival rate in worse habitats; (3) Mortality is different between sexes (Newton, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0050">1998</a>; Sinclair, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0062">1989</a>). Females usually have higher mortality than males under extreme harshness (Ke, 
  <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>), but it may be the inverse in some cases. Then, the quadratic correlation can be explained by deduction from the conditions given above for three different situations. (1) When a population lives under conditions of extreme lower habitat quality, (a) the competition among adults would be intensified; (b) higher mortality for both males and females in the whole population; while, (c) females have the lower survival than males. Under such a state, the population has less number of groups with the smallest MGS. (2) When a population lives under the best habitat quality, (a) the competition among individuals is alleviated; (b) the mortality is lower for both males and females; and (c) the sex ratio is close to 0.5. Under such a situation, all individuals try their best to breed independently, and the population will have larger number of groups with the smallest MGS. (3) When a population lives under moderate habitat qualities, (a) competitions among individuals are moderate; (b) mortality is higher in females than that in males; and (c) the sex ratio of the population is highly skewed toward males. In such a situation, the population has a larger MGS. In short, more pairs would breed independently in the better condition, while there would be limited number of pairs can breed independently in the worst conditions; in moderate conditions, skewed sex ration would lead to larger group sizes.
