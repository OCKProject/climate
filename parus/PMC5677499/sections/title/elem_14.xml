  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The volatility and stability of population dynamics</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown with the Seychelles warblers, the populations fluctuated across years but remained stable at an average level of approximately 120 groups and 300 individuals, when it reached the upper limit of carrying capacity (Komdeur, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0037">1992</a>), similar patterns were found in other populations (Komdeur et al., 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0038">2016</a>). These populations showed us the effects of both volatility year by year and stability averaged by certain time durations. Previous studies tried to explore how the group size varied with ecological gradients, while both parameters for the populations were measured for just one certain season or year (Emlen, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0019">1982</a>; Ke, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>; Komdeur, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0037">1992</a>). The inconsistent results in the above studies might be attributed to the effects of volatility across years (Reyer, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0056">1980</a>). In this study, the effects of both volatility and stability are explored. When the MGS is averaged for &lt;3 years and the MGD for &lt;4 years in populations of Masked laughingthrushes, the quadratic association between MGS and MGD is unstable, although it is occasionally significant (Table 
   <a rid="ece33405-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33405-tbl-0002">2</a>). The correlations were shown to be positive, negative, or quadratic as short‐term effects in different situations according to different time durations. Correspondingly, they are similar to those studies as simply positive (Komdeur, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0037">1992</a>; Rubenstein, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0058">2016</a>) or negative correlation (Emlen, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0019">1982</a>; Ke, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>). In contrast, when MGS is averaged for more than 2 years and MGD for more than 3 years, a reverse quadratic correlation between long‐term MGS and MGD becomes more constant (Table 
   <a rid="ece33405-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33405-tbl-0002">2</a>, Figure 
   <a rid="ece33405-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33405-fig-0004">4</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The external ecological factors may play important roles in the social structure and group dynamics, but their effect can be delayed. The current population state may be determined by ecological factors in the past; as shown in Tibetan ground tits, the current extreme drought led to intensified cooperation in the next year (Ke, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>). The transient group density is not just a result of current ecological conditions but a comprehensive result from ecological stresses experienced in at least several seasons or years (Batten &amp; Marchant, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0003">1977</a>; Marra &amp; Holmes, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0046">2001</a>). Due to the effects of the delayed ecological influences and the asynchrony of such influences among different populations, the volatility is understandable. However, when all the parameters are averaged for a sufficient elapsed time, it will show us the long‐term effects as stability. Such stability is sourced from the correlation between the population dynamic and long‐term habitat quality or the carrying capacity per unit area. A stable quadratic correlation between long‐term MGS and long‐term MGD in Masked laughingthrushes demonstrates this stability.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reason for a quadratic correlation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Masked laughingthrushes, when MGS is averaged for more than 2 years and MGD for more than 3 years, long‐term MGS is correlated with long‐term MGD in a reverse quadratic shape. This suggests that the long‐term MGS varied with the gradient of long‐term habitat quality as the smallest in the best or worst habitats but highest in the moderate state. The question then arises as to the reason for the quadratic relationship.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that there are three prerequisites: (1) In the wild population, individuals will pursue independent reproduction to maximize the reproductive benefits in their lives to the greatest degree possible (Both &amp; Visser, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0004">2000</a>); (2) Wild populations have a higher survival rate under better habitat quality and a lower survival rate in worse habitats; (3) Mortality is different between sexes (Newton, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0050">1998</a>; Sinclair, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0062">1989</a>). Females usually have higher mortality than males under extreme harshness (Ke, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>), but it may be the inverse in some cases. Then, the quadratic correlation can be explained by deduction from the conditions given above for three different situations. (1) When a population lives under conditions of extreme lower habitat quality, (a) the competition among adults would be intensified; (b) higher mortality for both males and females in the whole population; while, (c) females have the lower survival than males. Under such a state, the population has less number of groups with the smallest MGS. (2) When a population lives under the best habitat quality, (a) the competition among individuals is alleviated; (b) the mortality is lower for both males and females; and (c) the sex ratio is close to 0.5. Under such a situation, all individuals try their best to breed independently, and the population will have larger number of groups with the smallest MGS. (3) When a population lives under moderate habitat qualities, (a) competitions among individuals are moderate; (b) mortality is higher in females than that in males; and (c) the sex ratio of the population is highly skewed toward males. In such a situation, the population has a larger MGS. In short, more pairs would breed independently in the better condition, while there would be limited number of pairs can breed independently in the worst conditions; in moderate conditions, skewed sex ration would lead to larger group sizes.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Long‐term MGD: a better index for habitat quality</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is often difficult to find a good measure of habitat quality for most species or populations. Some researchers have used time budgets to reveal favored habitat types (Brown &amp; Balda, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0008">1977</a>), vegetation structure (Brown &amp; Brown, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0009">1981</a>), or a measure of the available food resources (Macroberts &amp; Macroberts, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0043">1976</a>; Trail, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0069">1980</a>) as potential indices of territory quality in different species. None of the above indices can be generally used to measure the habitat quality for all species. However, we can expect the long‐term MGD to be a better index for habitat quality in populations of territorial species, due to following reasons.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Long‐term MGD is the synthesized results of all ecological factors across years. Many studies suggested that long‐term mean territory size is inversely related to food abundance per unit area (Holmes, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0028">1970</a>; Myers et al., 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0048">1979</a>; Seastedt &amp; MacLean, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0060">1979</a>; Simon, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0061">1975</a>; Smith &amp; Shugart, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0065">1987</a>; Stenger, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0067">1958</a>), and thus, it is inversely related to long‐term MGD. Because the food abundance per unit area is one important indicator of habitat quality (Emlen, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0019">1982</a>), both long‐term mean territory size and long‐term MGD can also be used as indicators of habitat quality. And in fact, the long‐term MGD is a synthesized result of food distribution, forage investment, nest site selection, habitat saturation, and population dynamics in the wild populations of territorial species, which are the components of overall habitat quality (Franzblau &amp; Collins, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0021">1980</a>; Fretwell &amp; Lucas, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0022">1969</a>; Orians, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0052">1971</a>). Carrying capacity of certain area of habitats is affected by the abundance and distribution of resources and by how individuals compete for these limiting resources (Ayllon, Almodovar, Nicola, Parra, &amp; Elvira, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0002">2012</a>; Rees, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0055">1992</a>). The stable quadratic correlation between long‐term MGS and MGD in this study also supports the hypothesis that long‐term MGD can be used as an indicator of the long‐term habitat quality, and the period of the “long term” is a time duration of three or four years in Masked laughingthrushes. In addition, MGD is an indicator that is more easily to be recorded and estimated compared with other detailed ecological factors.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The long‐term MGD has reflected that the natural resources in certain area of suitable habitats are utilized together by all social groups and their generations. For one certain social group, all the members exclusively utilize the resources in their territory in certain seasons. For different social groups, neighboring ones may breed independently in summer but amalgamate in winter; new groups may bud from territories of their parents, and one group may expand their territory to neighboring territories after the original “owners” disappeared (Ke, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>). While those distant social groups have very limited influences on natural resources in the other's habitats. Hence, all the natural resources across years in the certain area of habitats were utilized together by those social groups and their generations living in the habitat. The long‐term MGD reflects the upper limit of carrying capacity at group level.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A theoretical consideration</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although cooperative breeding has engendered considerable interest among behavioral ecologists since Skutch (
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0063">1935</a>), we are far from understanding the evolution of cooperative breeding (Hatchwell, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0025">2009</a>; Koenig &amp; Dickinson, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0034">2004</a>, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0035">2016</a>), and conflicting conclusions are still presented in different studies (Ke &amp; Huang,

   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0054">2004</a>). The quadratic association between long‐term MGS and MGD brings us new insights into the evolution of cooperative breeding.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Firstly, it is long‐term habitat quality (MGD) determined long‐term MGS in certain habitats, as suggested in the population of masked laughingthrushes. In other words, the correlation between long‐term MGS and MGD sets no prerequisites regarding who the group members are and of which relationship they are. The majority of helpers were shown to be the close relatives of the breeders they helped in cooperative breeding systems (Emlen, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0020">1997</a>; Dickinson &amp; Hatchwell, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0014">2004</a>; Ke, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>), or some of them were nonkin (Cockburn, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0012">1998</a>; ,Clutton‐Brock, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0011">2002</a>; Nomano et al., 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0051">2015</a>) or even kidnapped members from nonkin (Ridley, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0057">2016</a>). If there was no prerequisite for helper identity and status, the formation of the social groups would be ecologically based, not causally determined by individuals themselves and their relationships.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Secondly, for certain population living in certain habitat, long‐term MGS is adapted to its corresponding long‐term habitat quality (MGD), although the group sizes fluctuated across years. If so, helper effects can be deduced for different situations. When the current group sizes are smaller than long‐term MGS, the helping can be tested to be beneficial to the social groups in both survival and reproduction. When the current group sizes are larger than long‐term MGS, a reverse tendency can be expected (Brouwer, Richardson, Eikenaar, &amp; Komdeur, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0006">2006</a>). However, long‐term effects may have the opposite tendency because increasing survival and reproduction will increase competition in the future, when the whole population reaches its upper limit of carrying capacity (Brouwer et al., 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0007">2009</a>). As shown in previous studies, the helper effect was positive (Brooker &amp; Rowley, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0005">1995</a>; Davies &amp; Hatchwell,

   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0070">2005</a>) and negative (Heinsohn &amp; Cockburn, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0026">1994</a>; Koenig, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0033">1990</a>), co‐existence of both positive and negative (Ke, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0029">2009</a>) or with no significant influences (Eguchi, Yamagishi, Asai, Nagata, &amp; Teruaki, 
   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0018">2002</a>; Legge,

   <a rid="ece33405-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33405-bib-0044">1997</a>). Such diversity in helper effects is easy to be understood.
