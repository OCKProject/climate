 <p>Both mean group size (
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGS</span>) and mean group density (
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGD</span>) are critical indices to characterize a population of cooperatively breeding birds. When a population reaches its carrying capacity, both long‐term 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGS</span> and long‐term 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGD</span> will remain relatively stable. However, there has been little study of how these two variables relate. The Masked laughingthrush 
  <span class="italic">Garrulax perspicillatus</span> is a cooperatively breeding bird living in fragmented habitats. During 2010 and 2012‐2016, we used song playback to observe and confirm the group sizes and territory ranges of the birds and the data of bird presence to determine habitat suitability. By grouping the nearest territories according to their geographical coordinates, we divided the whole study area into 12 subareas and the whole population into 12 subpopulations. Then, we calculated both 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGS</span> and 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGD</span> for different time durations for each subpopulation. Finally, using 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGD</span> as independent variable and 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGS</span> as the dependent variable, we explored the correlations between 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGS</span> and 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGD</span> by fitting quadratic functions and modeling quadratic regression. Both 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGS</span> and 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGD</span> were averaged for different time durations and were cross‐related. Our results show that the 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGS</span> for more than 2 years significantly correlated with 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGD</span> for more than 3 years in a reverse parabolic shape, differing from that of short‐term effects. Our findings suggest that long‐term 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGD</span> is a better predictor of long‐term habitat quality and that long‐term 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGS</span> is determined by long‐term habitat quality in Masked Laughingthrushes. Based on above findings, we can infer that: (1) Long‐term habitat quality determines the long‐term 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGS</span>, but it sets no prerequisite for the status and source of group members; (2) Long‐term 
  <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">MGS</span> in certain populations is adapted to the corresponding level of long‐term habitat quality, it facilitates us to predict the helper effects on current or future survival or reproduction in different situations. These findings and inferences are both helpful for us to understand the evolution of cooperative breeding.
