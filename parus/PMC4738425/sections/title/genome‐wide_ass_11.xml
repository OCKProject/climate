 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether individual SNPs explained significant variation in each of the traits, a genome‐wide association study was conducted. First, a univariate mixed model including all fixed and random effects but excluding additive genetic effects was fitted in 
  <span class="sc">asreml</span>, to give an expected phenotypic value, or EPV, for each individual (Ekine 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0016">2014</a>). EPVs for each trait were then standardized to mean 0 and variance 1. This approach was employed to reduce phenotypes to a single value for each individual (rather than repeated measures on each individual), and to account for other important fixed and random effects (Appendix S1, Supporting information), except for the genetic differences between individuals that might associate with the phenotype.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within each population, SNPs were tested for allelic association with each EPV (i.e. models did not include previously controlled for fixed and random effects from the model) using the ‘polygenic’ and ‘mmscore’ functions in 
  <span class="sc">genabel</span> (Aulchenko 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0004">2007b</a>), adjusting for population stratification due to the presence of related individuals by fitting the internally calculated genome‐wide kinship matrix as a random effect (Amin 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0002">2007</a>). The significance of association was assessed using 
  <span class="sc">genabel </span>
  <span class="italic">P</span> values, adjusted for multiple testing using a Bonferroni correction based on the effective number of independent tests. Taking into account LD between markers using the package Keffective (Moskvina &amp; Schmidt 
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0045">2008</a>), the panel of chromosome‐assigned SNPs was determined to yield 5573 effective tests, giving a genome‐wide significant threshold of

  <span class="sup">−6</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The between‐population correlation of absolute estimated SNP effect sizes from the GWAS analyses was calculated in 
  <span class="sc">r</span> (R Development Core Team 
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0052">2012</a>) for each trait. A significant correlation in SNP effect sizes between a NL and UK trait would indicate that many shared loci contribute to variation in the two populations. The significance of each correlation was tested by permuting effect sizes across SNPs 10 000 times.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, for each trait, standardized EPVs and genotypes from each population were merged to test for association across both data sets. SNP association was tested by running a ‘polygenic’ mixed model in 
  <span class="sc">genabel</span>, where the genome‐wide kinship matrix is fitted as a random effect, population fitted as a fixed effect and the first 10 principle components of the kinship matrix fitted as fixed effects to account for population‐level SNP relatedness differences. The significance of association was assessed from ‘mmscore’ 
  <span class="italic">P</span> values after Bonferroni correction.
