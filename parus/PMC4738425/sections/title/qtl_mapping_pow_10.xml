 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ability to draw conclusions from a linkage mapping analysis depends on the power to detect QTL of various effect sizes, and knowledge about potential bias in reported effect sizes (Slate

  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0054">2013</a>), a simulation approach was used to determine the power to detect QTL explaining 0% (i.e. false detection of QTL), 5%, 10%, 20% and 40% of the overall phenotypic variance for each trait in each population (Appendix S5, Supporting information). The simulations were also used to assess the amount of bias in reported effect sizes that may be expected at various significance thresholds in the two populations.
