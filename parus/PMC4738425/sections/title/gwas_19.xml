 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">None of the 5591 SNPs tested for association with any of the seven NL or eight UK traits reached genome‐wide significance after adjustment for multiple testing (Fig. S4a–h, Supporting information). There was no evidence for some chromosomes having more nominally significant SNPs than others (chi‐square test on the observed and expected counts of nominally significant SNPs per chromosome, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&gt;
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.05 for all traits).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The correlation between absolute estimated SNP effect sizes from the GWAS analysis was estimated between the NL and UK for each trait (Table 
  <a rid="mec13452-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#mec13452-tbl-0004">4</a>, Fig. S5, Supporting information). If many shared loci contribute to variation in the two populations and these loci are tagged by the genotyped SNPs, then the same SNPs will have similar effects in both populations, and a significant correlation between SNP effect sizes in the NL and UK would be expected. However, such correlations were not observed, suggesting that either the same SNP markers are not tagging the same causal variants in the two populations (either because there are different causal variants in each population, or perhaps due to differences in LD structure) or, perhaps more likely, that there is limited LD between genotyped SNPs and causal variants in both populations, and hence, SNP effect sizes are generally small and inaccurately estimated. In addition, no SNPs were significantly associated with any of the traits when UK and NL data sets were merged, suggesting that despite increased power, no SNPs had large enough effect across the two data sets to reach genome‐wide significance (Fig. S4a–h, Supporting information).
