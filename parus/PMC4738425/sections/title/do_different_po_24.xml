  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0009">2012</a>), it seems reasonable to ask whether the genetic architectures are shared to some degree between populations. The observation that additive genetic variances between traits are not significantly different between populations for all traits except fledgling weight (of individual) lends some support to this hypothesis. In addition, the number of SNPs estimated to contribute to variation for each trait was similar in the two populations. However, regions of the genome that appeared to explain variation in one population did not explain significant variation in the other population more often than expected by chance. There are several possible explanations. One is that neither population has sufficient power to identify causal loci nor to assign statistical significance to chromosomal contributions to variance. Therefore even if the same loci (or a subset of the causal loci) contribute to trait variation in both populations, the probability of detecting an overlap of significant results is low. Alternatively, different loci could contribute to trait variation in both populations; the data are not inconsistent with any given trait having a polygenic architecture caused by different loci in different populations, although given that allele frequencies are highly correlated between populations (van Bers

  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0009">2012</a>), we regard this as unlikely. Although alternative explanations are possible, we suggest that most of the traits studied here are highly polygenic, and it is likely they share, at least in part, a common genetic architecture.
