 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The architecture of maternal, morphological and behaviour traits in two natural populations of great tits was investigated using chromosome partitioning, QTL mapping, GWAS and by estimating the number of SNPs contributing to variation. All four approaches lend some support to the hypothesis that the quantitative traits studied here are influenced by many genes of small effect distributed throughout the genome.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although not all regressions were significant, it is notable that the relationship between chromosome size and variance explained was positive for all traits in both populations (Table 
  <a rid="mec13452-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#mec13452-tbl-0003">3</a>, Fig. 
  <a rid="mec13452-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#mec13452-fig-0001">1</a>), with no evidence in any trait that a gene of major effect contributes to a large proportion of trait variance (see simulations in Robinson

  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0053">2013</a>). The variation in the relationship between chromosome size and variance explained for each trait is likely to be a consequence of our marker density; more markers in stronger linkage disequilibrium with each other would better capture the true relatedness between individuals across a chromosome and would reduce the error on the estimates for the contribution of each chromosome. However, the chromosome partitioning results are generally consistent with the traits having a polygenic rather than oligogenic architecture; in every trait, more than a handful of chromosomes explain at least some variation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the majority of traits, the QTL analyses failed to detect any regions of the genome contributing significantly to trait variation. There was evidence that specific regions of the genome contributed significantly to variation in adult weight in the NL population; however, it is notable that there was no overall similarity in test statistics between the two populations, and there is no agreement between chromosome partitioning, GWAS and QTL analysis within the NL population. It should be noted, however, that the QTL analysis may be identifying QTL that are not in LD with any of the genotyped SNPs and hence not likely to show a signal for association; a higher SNP density in these regions of the genome may be able to dissect the true contribution of these loci to quantitative trait variation. Given the inevitable overestimation of QTL effect sizes (Beavis

  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0058">2013</a>), the estimates for the variation explained by each QTL peak (27%, 35% and 38% of the total heritability for peaks on chromosomes 11, 15 and 28, respectively, when all three are included in the same model) are unlikely to reflect the true contribution of these QTL to adult weight. Furthermore, the chromosome partitioning analysis lends no support for loci of large effect to be located on the chromosomes with significant QTL peaks; in the NL population, chromosomes 11, 15 and 28 contain significant QTL peaks, but only one of these, chromosome 11, explained significant variation in the chromosome partitioning analysis. There was no excess of nominally significant peaks from the NL GWAS analysis on the QTL‐significant chromosomes, and the estimates for the number of SNPs explaining variation were 163 and 288 SNPs for the NL and UK, respectively. Therefore, despite the results from the QTL linkage analysis, there appears to be little supporting evidence from partly independent analyses that loci of major effect contribute to adult weight variation in either population. In the absence of genome‐wide significant results, and a lack of support from the GWAS or chromosome partitioning analyses, we suggest that the QTL that are significant at the suggestive threshold are very likely to be overestimated and that some may represent false‐positive associations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, our results lend support to the hypothesis that quantitative trait architecture is likely to be determined by many loci of small effect distributed throughout the genome, agreeing with recent conclusions from studies in humans, livestock and model organisms (see, for example, Mackay
