 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The QTL power analysis (Appendix S5, Supporting information) suggests that for all NL traits, there was very little power to detect QTL of major effect, with less than 20% of QTL simulated to explain 
  <span class="italic">all</span> additive genetic variance detected at genome‐wide significance in the highest powered data sets (tarsus and wing length) and close to 0% detected in other traits. At the suggestive linkage threshold, the number of detected QTL that were simulated to explain all additive genetic variance ranged from 2% for exploratory behaviour to 54% for tarsus length. For the UK data set, close to 100% of QTL simulated to explain all additive genetic variance were detected at genome‐wide significance for adult weight, fledgling weight (of individual) and wing length, although very few were detected for fledgling weight (of offspring) and exploratory behaviour (0% and 3%, respectively). At the suggestive threshold, 21% and 26% of QTL explaining all additive genetic variance were detected in the fledgling weight (of offspring) and exploratory behaviour simulations. There is unlikely to be power to detect QTL of more reasonable effect sizes in either the NL or UK data sets; QTL simulated to explain 5% of phenotypic variation were never detected in the NL simulations and were rarely detected in the UK simulations. As expected, the estimated effect sizes for QTL detected in the simulations were highly inflated (Beavis

Thus, QTL mapping is only likely to detect loci of very large effect, and even then, interpretation of effect sizes is problematic.
