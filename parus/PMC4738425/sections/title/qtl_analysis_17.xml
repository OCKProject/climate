 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For six of the seven NL traits and all of the eight UK traits, no regions of the genome reached genome‐wide significance (Fig. S2a–h; Appendix S6, Supporting information). There were three genome‐wide significant peaks for NL adult weight, on chromosomes 11, 15 and 28 (Fig. S2d, Supporting information), accounting for 96%, 100% and 100% of the heritability, respectively, when estimated individually, clearly demonstrating the overestimation of effect sizes that reach significance. Fitting all three QTL in the same model accounted for 100% of total heritability, with chromosomes 11, 15 and 28 accounting for 27%, 35% and 38% of heritability, respectively. There were a relatively large number of suggestive peaks for NL and UK adult weight (peaks on 13 chromosomes in the NL and on four chromosomes in the UK) and for UK tarsus length (peaks on a total of six chromosomes, Fig. 
  <a rid="mec13452-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#mec13452-fig-0002">2</a>). One false‐positive genome‐wide suggestive peak is expected by chance every time a genome scan is performed, and hence, the excess of suggestive peaks in these traits suggests that while some are likely to be false positives, others may be true QTL that have failed to reach genome significance. All suggestive positions, along with their LOD scores and estimated effect sizes, are provided in Appendix S6 (Supporting information).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was no evidence of correspondence between the QTL test statistics for each trait obtained from the NL and UK QTL scans (including adult weight). Correlations of test statistics between the populations ranged from −0.083 to 0.175, with all but two negative, and none were significant when tested using the approach of Keightley &amp; Knott (
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0037">1999</a>) (Appendix S4 and Fig. S3a–g, Supporting information). A number of traits shared nominally significant QTL peaks; eleven genomic regions for adult weight were shared between the NL and UK, two regions were shared for fledgling weight (of individual), one region was shared for tarsus length, and two regions were shared for wing length (Appendix S7, Supporting information).
