 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The QTL mapping and GWAS approaches described above exploit different marker and phenotype information, with different numbers of individuals and markers used. QTL mapping relies on recombination events within families to define the ‘boundaries’ around a causal locus. In contrast, GWAS analysis exploits ancestral recombination events, which have broken down associations between markers and phenotype for all loci except those in close physical linkage to causal loci. Because the power to detect QTL by linkage or association is dependent on the QTL magnitude (Lynch &amp; Walsh

  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0056">2000</a>) and the power of GWAS is additionally dependent on the amount of LD between causal variants and the markers (Pritchard &amp; Przeworski 
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0050">2001</a>), QTL mapping and GWAS results may not necessarily be concordant. Genome‐wide significance of both QTL mapping and GWAS at the same region of the genome would give clear support for a QTL at that location. However, if both approaches do not reach genome‐wide significance but, for example, a position was nominally significant in GWAS (
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt;
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.05) and reached genome‐wide suggestive linkage in the QTL mapping (LOD &gt; 1.620, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt;
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.003), this would add some support for the presence of a QTL at that location.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within each population, the concordance between the (i) QTL mapping and GWAS analyses and (ii) QTL mapping and chromosome partitioning analysis was tested for each trait. First (i), the LOD score at the mapping position (in cM) of each SNP marker was predicted from a linear regression of the LOD scores of neighbouring QTL positions (e.g. LOD scores at 0 cM and 5 cM were used to predict the LOD score of a SNP mapped to 4.6 cM), and the 
  <span class="italic">P</span> value for each inferred LOD score was calculated and compared to the 
  <span class="italic">P</span> value from the GWAS. To determine whether the number of genome positions nominally significant in both analyses was greater than expected by chance, the observed and expected counts were compared with a chi‐square test. Second (ii), those chromosomes with nominally significant (
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt;
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.05) QTL mapping peaks were compared with the nominally significant chromosomes from the partitioning approach with a Fisher's exact test (i.e. with counts of nominal significance in both, one or neither approach). If a small number of loci of major effect contribute to the trait, it might be expected that all three approaches are concordant, especially if major genes are located on small chromosomes.
