  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0048">2014</a>), a total of 1407 NL and 2497 UK individuals of confirmed identity were included in further analyses. A subsample of related individuals from the UK population and a captive population derived from the NL population were used to construct two independent linkage maps (van Oers

  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0048">2014</a>). The linkage maps cover 32 of the 39 great tit chromosomes: 1–15, 17–24, 26–28, 1A, 4A, 25A, 25B, LGE22 and Z; a number of very small microchromosomes, including chromosome 16, could not be mapped as no SNPs on these chromosomes were genotyped. The maps were almost identical between the two populations; therefore in the subsequent analyses, the UK map distances were used. The different downstream analyses required linkage maps with different marker densities. For QTL mapping, a ‘framework without LD’ linkage map of 1524 markers was used, containing the majority of markers from the framework linkage map (Santure

  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0048">2014</a>). Markers on the framework map were placed at map positions where the best order was 1000 times more likely than any other order. Note that a small number of marker pairs with high linkage disequilibrium between them appeared to contribute to convergence problems during QTL mapping. Therefore, one of the two markers was excluded from the framework map before analysis to give the ‘framework without LD’ map, which covers 1.893 cM, with an average intermarker distance of 1.209 cM. For the genome‐wide association study (GWAS) and chromosome partitioning analyses, a set of 5591 ‘chromosome‐assigned’ markers was used. The chromosome‐assigned marker set included 4878 markers placed in a ‘parsimonious’ linkage map (where markers are added and the order with the highest likelihood is chosen) plus an additional 713 markers that were linked to markers in the parsimonious map and could be assigned a putative mapping position (in cM) based on comparative genomics with their predicted zebra finch genome location (Santure
