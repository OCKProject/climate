  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0059">2002</a>) was performed to map loci contributing to variance in the quantitative traits. Using the 1524 markers in the framework without LD map, the identical‐by‐descent (IBD) coefficients between all pairs of individuals in the two QTL pedigrees (see above) were derived at 5‐cM intervals across the genome using the software

The statistical significance of the QTL effects was then tested using a likelihood ratio test comparing the log likelihood of a polygenic model with the log likelihood of a polygenic plus QTL model, fitting full mixed models to account for the effects of important random and fixed effects on the raw phenotypes (see Appendix S1, Supporting information). QTL scans were performed in the two populations for each trait. To account for the multiple tests performed genome‐wide, the approach of Lander &amp; Kruglyak (
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0041">1995</a>) was used to adjust the significance thresholds based on the length of the linkage map (19.16 morgans) and number of mapped chromosomes (31). For these data sets, a logarithm of odds (LOD) score (where LOD = LRT/2
  <span class="italic">ln</span>(10)) of 1.620, corresponding to a nominal 
  <span class="italic">P</span> value (
  <span class="italic">P</span>) of 0.003, is expected to occur once by chance in every genome scan and is termed ‘genome‐wide suggestive linkage’, while a LOD score of 3.062 (

  <span class="italic"> </span>9 × 10
  <span class="sup">−5</span>) is expected with probability 0.05 every time a genome scan is performed and is termed ‘genome‐wide significant linkage’ (Lander &amp; Kruglyak

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether the same regions of the genome explain trait variation in the two populations, the correspondence between the genome‐wide test statistics across populations obtained from the QTL scans was tested using the permutation approach of Keightley &amp; Knott (
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0037">1999</a>) (Appendix S4, Supporting information). In brief, the approach first calculates the correlation in test statistics between two QTL scans. Test statistics are then permuted while maintaining the autocorrelation between linked test statistic values, that is whole chromosomes (rather than individual sites) from one QTL scan are permuted across the other QTL scan. The significance of the observed correlation is tested against the distribution of correlations from the permuted data sets. Regions of the genome that were nominally significant in both populations were also identified.
