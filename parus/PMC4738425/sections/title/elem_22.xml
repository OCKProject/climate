  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The architecture of maternal, morphological and behaviour traits in two natural populations of great tits was investigated using chromosome partitioning, QTL mapping, GWAS and by estimating the number of SNPs contributing to variation. All four approaches lend some support to the hypothesis that the quantitative traits studied here are influenced by many genes of small effect distributed throughout the genome.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although not all regressions were significant, it is notable that the relationship between chromosome size and variance explained was positive for all traits in both populations (Table 
   <a rid="mec13452-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#mec13452-tbl-0003">3</a>, Fig. 
   <a rid="mec13452-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#mec13452-fig-0001">1</a>), with no evidence in any trait that a gene of major effect contributes to a large proportion of trait variance (see simulations in Robinson 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="mec13452-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0053">2013</a>). The variation in the relationship between chromosome size and variance explained for each trait is likely to be a consequence of our marker density; more markers in stronger linkage disequilibrium with each other would better capture the true relatedness between individuals across a chromosome and would reduce the error on the estimates for the contribution of each chromosome. However, the chromosome partitioning results are generally consistent with the traits having a polygenic rather than oligogenic architecture; in every trait, more than a handful of chromosomes explain at least some variation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the majority of traits, the QTL analyses failed to detect any regions of the genome contributing significantly to trait variation. There was evidence that specific regions of the genome contributed significantly to variation in adult weight in the NL population; however, it is notable that there was no overall similarity in test statistics between the two populations, and there is no agreement between chromosome partitioning, GWAS and QTL analysis within the NL population. It should be noted, however, that the QTL analysis may be identifying QTL that are not in LD with any of the genotyped SNPs and hence not likely to show a signal for association; a higher SNP density in these regions of the genome may be able to dissect the true contribution of these loci to quantitative trait variation. Given the inevitable overestimation of QTL effect sizes (Beavis 
   <a rid="mec13452-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0006">1994</a>; Slate 
   <a rid="mec13452-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0058">2013</a>), the estimates for the variation explained by each QTL peak (27%, 35% and 38% of the total heritability for peaks on chromosomes 11, 15 and 28, respectively, when all three are included in the same model) are unlikely to reflect the true contribution of these QTL to adult weight. Furthermore, the chromosome partitioning analysis lends no support for loci of large effect to be located on the chromosomes with significant QTL peaks; in the NL population, chromosomes 11, 15 and 28 contain significant QTL peaks, but only one of these, chromosome 11, explained significant variation in the chromosome partitioning analysis. There was no excess of nominally significant peaks from the NL GWAS analysis on the QTL‐significant chromosomes, and the estimates for the number of SNPs explaining variation were 163 and 288 SNPs for the NL and UK, respectively. Therefore, despite the results from the QTL linkage analysis, there appears to be little supporting evidence from partly independent analyses that loci of major effect contribute to adult weight variation in either population. In the absence of genome‐wide significant results, and a lack of support from the GWAS or chromosome partitioning analyses, we suggest that the QTL that are significant at the suggestive threshold are very likely to be overestimated and that some may represent false‐positive associations.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, our results lend support to the hypothesis that quantitative trait architecture is likely to be determined by many loci of small effect distributed throughout the genome, agreeing with recent conclusions from studies in humans, livestock and model organisms (see, for example, Mackay

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Do different populations share a common genetic architecture?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that these traits appear to be influenced by a very large number of genes and that the two study populations have very little genetic differentiation (global 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>ST</sub> = 0.01; minor allele frequency correlation = 0.98, van Bers 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="mec13452-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0009">2012</a>), it seems reasonable to ask whether the genetic architectures are shared to some degree between populations. The observation that additive genetic variances between traits are not significantly different between populations for all traits except fledgling weight (of individual) lends some support to this hypothesis. In addition, the number of SNPs estimated to contribute to variation for each trait was similar in the two populations. However, regions of the genome that appeared to explain variation in one population did not explain significant variation in the other population more often than expected by chance. There are several possible explanations. One is that neither population has sufficient power to identify causal loci nor to assign statistical significance to chromosomal contributions to variance. Therefore even if the same loci (or a subset of the causal loci) contribute to trait variation in both populations, the probability of detecting an overlap of significant results is low. Alternatively, different loci could contribute to trait variation in both populations; the data are not inconsistent with any given trait having a polygenic architecture caused by different loci in different populations, although given that allele frequencies are highly correlated between populations (van Bers 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="mec13452-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0009">2012</a>), we regard this as unlikely. Although alternative explanations are possible, we suggest that most of the traits studied here are highly polygenic, and it is likely they share, at least in part, a common genetic architecture.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prospects for molecular quantitative genetics in wild populations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of four complementary approaches in two populations lend support to the hypothesis that all eight traits are polygenic. However, our efforts highlight the lack of power even a study of this size (within population, between 416 and 1949 phenotyped individuals genotyped at 5591 SNPs) may have to dissect the genetic architecture of quantitative traits. In particular, it is now becoming clear that a QTL linkage analysis approach suffers from very limited power in pedigreed wild populations (Santure 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="mec13452-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0054">2013</a>; Slate 
   <a rid="mec13452-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0058">2013</a>; and data presented in this manuscript) and will in most cases only allow the identification of genes of very large effect sizes. Our simulation results (Appendix S5, Supporting information) indicate that for most traits, it would be impossible to make robust conclusions about trait architectures from the QTL results alone. This low power is most strongly influenced by the limited numbers of phenotyped individuals available in such populations (as illustrated by the power analysis, Appendix S5, Supporting information), but is also likely to be affected by the structure of the pedigree. For example, short lifespans and high fledgling mortality in great tits mean that there are likely to be relatively few close relative pairs where IBD can be accurately inferred (compared to, for example, longer‐lived species where half‐ or full‐sib families are more common).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, although the data set currently represents one of the largest genomic data sets for a wild population, LD between the SNP markers is low (I. De Cauwer, A. W. Santure, K. van Oers, N. E. M. van Bers, R. P. M. A. Crooijmans, B. C. Sheldon, M. E. Visser, M. A. M. Groenen &amp; J. Slate, unpublished data), suggesting that the set of SNP markers provides insufficient power to detect causal variants using genome‐wide association scans. The fact that for many traits the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the SNPs is substantially lower than the heritability supports the hypothesis that the genome is not adequately tagged by the current set of SNPs. Identifying loci contributing to trait variation, and testing for shared genetic architectures in these populations, will therefore likely require many more markers. With that in mind, we would advise researchers to work towards the development of SNP data sets that will allow GWAS, chromosome partitioning and other molecular quantitative genetic analyses, which are likely to enable much finer‐scale dissection of genetic architectures and trade‐offs than will be possible from QTL mapping. SNP data sets of ~37 000 SNPs (after quality control) enabled the identification of a handful of loci influencing clutch size in collared flycatchers (Husby 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="mec13452-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0034">2015</a>) and leg length traits in Soay sheep (Bérénos 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="mec13452-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0008">2015</a>), although it should be noted that these loci explain a minor proportion of total heritability. Further, the use of genomic relatedness is likely to offer a promising approach for estimating heritabilities in wild populations when pedigrees may be incomplete or incorrect, and may also allow for more accurate estimation of maternal effects (Bérénos 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="mec13452-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0007">2014</a>). For some species such as great tits, which have a very large effective population size and correspondingly low levels of LD, describing the genetic architecture of polygenic traits likely means genotyping many hundreds of thousands of loci. Perhaps more soberingly, regardless of LD, accurate inferences about the genetic architecture of quantitative traits in wild populations may require phenotypic data from considerably larger numbers of individuals than will be possible to sample under most circumstances, and in many cases, the availability of phenotypic data for analysis will depend on decisions taken by investigators in the past.
