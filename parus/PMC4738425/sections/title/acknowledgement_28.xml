 <div class="title">Acknowledgements</div>
 <p>We thank the many people who have collected data from Hoge Veluwe, Westerheide and Wytham Woods great tit populations over the past decades and the many funding sources, too numerous to list here, that supported the collection of the data. We extend a special thanks to Conor Scott for his diligent work resolving the NL pedigree during an On CampUS Placement from the University of Sheffield, awarded to AWS. This work was funded by the European Research Council (ERC), project AvianEGG, number 202487, awarded to JS, a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) UK fellowship to MRR number NE/G013535/1, by Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC) and Marie Curie fellowships to JP and by the Netherlands Genomics Initiative (NGI‐HORIZON) to MAMG, MEV &amp; KvO and with an NWO‐VICI grant to MEV. Finally, we would like to acknowledge the very helpful comments from the three reviewers and the Editor Prof Staffan Bensch, which have substantially improved the manuscript.</p>
