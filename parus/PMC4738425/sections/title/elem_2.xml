   <a rid="mec13452-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0048">2014</a>), a total of 1407 NL and 2497 UK individuals of confirmed identity were included in further analyses. A subsample of related individuals from the UK population and a captive population derived from the NL population were used to construct two independent linkage maps (van Oers 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="mec13452-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0048">2014</a>). The linkage maps cover 32 of the 39 great tit chromosomes: 1–15, 17–24, 26–28, 1A, 4A, 25A, 25B, LGE22 and Z; a number of very small microchromosomes, including chromosome 16, could not be mapped as no SNPs on these chromosomes were genotyped. The maps were almost identical between the two populations; therefore in the subsequent analyses, the UK map distances were used. The different downstream analyses required linkage maps with different marker densities. For QTL mapping, a ‘framework without LD’ linkage map of 1524 markers was used, containing the majority of markers from the framework linkage map (Santure 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.

   <a rid="mec13452-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0048">2014</a>). Markers on the framework map were placed at map positions where the best order was 1000 times more likely than any other order. Note that a small number of marker pairs with high linkage disequilibrium between them appeared to contribute to convergence problems during QTL mapping. Therefore, one of the two markers was excluded from the framework map before analysis to give the ‘framework without LD’ map, which covers 1.893 cM, with an average intermarker distance of 1.209 cM. For the genome‐wide association study (GWAS) and chromosome partitioning analyses, a set of 5591 ‘chromosome‐assigned’ markers was used. The chromosome‐assigned marker set included 4878 markers placed in a ‘parsimonious’ linkage map (where markers are added and the order with the highest likelihood is chosen) plus an additional 713 markers that were linked to markers in the parsimonious map and could be assigned a putative mapping position (in cM) based on comparative genomics with their predicted zebra finch genome location (Santure

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trait heritabilities were determined by two approaches, first (i) using pedigree information from each population and second (ii) using the genomic marker relatedness between individuals. For each trait in each population, heritabilities were estimated using a linear mixed model (the ‘animal model’, Henderson 
    <a rid="mec13452-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0029">1984</a>; Kruuk 
    <a rid="mec13452-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0038">2004</a>), where the relatedness between individuals was estimated from the pedigree (A matrix; approach i) or where the relatedness between individuals was estimated from the marker data (G matrix; approach ii).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For (i), for consistency with the quantitative trait locus analysis (see below), the pedigree was restricted to genotyped related individuals. By including all first‐ to fourth‐degree family links, 666 NL individuals and 1733 UK individuals (Santure 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
    <a rid="mec13452-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0054">2013</a>) were included in a ‘QTL pedigree’ for the NL and UK, respectively. Variance components were estimated in a restricted maximum‐likelihood (REML) framework using 
    <span class="sc">asreml</span> v3 (Gilmour 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
    <a rid="mec13452-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0022">2009</a>), fitting random and fixed effects as described in Appendix S1 (Supporting information). The significance of the heritabilities was tested by comparing the log likelihood of a model where the heritability was set to zero (
    <span class="italic">L</span>
    <sub>0</sub>) to the log likelihood of the full model (
    <span class="italic">L</span>

    <span class="italic">L</span>
    <sub>1</sub>)
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the null hypothesis, the LRT follows a 50:50 distribution of a chi‐square with zero degrees of freedom and a chi‐square with one degree of freedom (Almasy &amp; Blangero 
    <a rid="mec13452-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0001">1998</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For (ii), the genomic relatedness between every pair of individuals within each population was calculated using an approach that scales by the actual variance in relatedness (approach 3; Robinson 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
    <a rid="mec13452-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0053">2013</a>). These genomic estimates of relatedness were then adjusted by the known pedigree relationships between individuals, weighting the marker‐derived relatedness values towards their expected pedigree‐based values. This approach reduces the sampling error around the expected relatedness values and gives more accurate additive genetic variance estimates (Robinson 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
    <a rid="mec13452-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0053">2013</a>). Variance components were estimated with 
    <span class="sc">asreml</span>, fitting random and fixed effects as described in Appendix S1 (Supporting information).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approach ii, in addition to allowing estimation of the population‐specific variances, also enables marker‐based additive genetic variances to be compared between the two populations. To do so, a global matrix of pairwise relatedness was calculated for all genotyped individuals across the two populations. Genotypes were first standardized by the allele frequencies within each population, and the relatedness between all individuals was then calculated following approach 3 in Robinson 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
    <a rid="mec13452-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0053">2013</a>). As above, genomic relatedness estimates were adjusted by known pedigree relationships within the two populations to reduce sampling error. To test whether, for each trait, additive genetic variances differed between the NL and UK, the likelihood of a model where additive genetic variances and the covariance were free to vary was tested against a model where the additive variances and covariance were free to vary but the variances were forced to be equal, with significance tested using a chi‐square with one degree of freedom. For each trait, only fixed and random effects that were measured in both populations were included in the model.

    <a rid="mec13452-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0053">2013</a>). A positive regression indicates a polygenic trait architecture, because if many genes contribute to variation, then larger chromosomes with more genes will tend to explain more variation than small chromosomes with fewer genes. In contrast, no relationship between variance explained and chromosome size suggests that the trait is either influenced by a small number of genes of large effect, or that loci having small to moderate effects are not randomly distributed throughout the genome (Robinson

In brief, the approach first calculates the correlation in test statistics between two QTL scans. Test statistics are then permuted while maintaining the autocorrelation between linked test statistic values, that is whole chromosomes (rather than individual sites) from one QTL scan are permuted across the other QTL scan. The significance of the observed correlation is tested against the distribution of correlations from the permuted data sets. Regions of the genome that were nominally significant in both populations were also identified.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether individual SNPs explained significant variation in each of the traits, a genome‐wide association study was conducted. First, a univariate mixed model including all fixed and random effects but excluding additive genetic effects was fitted in

This approach was employed to reduce phenotypes to a single value for each individual (rather than repeated measures on each individual), and to account for other important fixed and random effects (Appendix S1, Supporting information), except for the genetic differences between individuals that might associate with the phenotype.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The QTL mapping and GWAS approaches described above exploit different marker and phenotype information, with different numbers of individuals and markers used. QTL mapping relies on recombination events within families to define the ‘boundaries’ around a causal locus. In contrast, GWAS analysis exploits ancestral recombination events, which have broken down associations between markers and phenotype for all loci except those in close physical linkage to causal loci. Because the power to detect QTL by linkage or association is dependent on the QTL magnitude (Lynch &amp; Walsh

    <a rid="mec13452-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0050">2001</a>), QTL mapping and GWAS results may not necessarily be concordant. Genome‐wide significance of both QTL mapping and GWAS at the same region of the genome would give clear support for a QTL at that location. However, if both approaches do not reach genome‐wide significance but, for example, a position was nominally significant in GWAS (
    <span class="italic">P </span>&lt;
    <span class="italic"> </span>0.05) and reached genome‐wide suggestive linkage in the QTL mapping (LOD &gt; 1.620,

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within each population, the concordance between the (i) QTL mapping and GWAS analyses and (ii) QTL mapping and chromosome partitioning analysis was tested for each trait.

    <span class="italic">P</span> value for each inferred LOD score was calculated and compared to the 
    <span class="italic">P</span> value from the GWAS. To determine whether the number of genome positions nominally significant in both analyses was greater than expected by chance, the observed and expected counts were compared with a chi‐square test. Second (ii), those chromosomes with nominally significant (

If a small number of loci of major effect contribute to the trait, it might be expected that all three approaches are concordant, especially if major genes are located on small chromosomes.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">QTL mapping and GWAS aim to identify loci that make a large contribution to trait variation, but do not provide an estimate for the total number of loci contributing to phenotypic variation. The number of SNPs explaining trait variation and the overall phenotypic variance explained by the SNPs were estimated using a Bayesian variable selection regression model (Guan &amp; Stephens 
    <a rid="mec13452-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0025">2011</a>) implemented in the software

This approach fits a linear model where phenotype is determined by a subset of SNPs, each of which have an estimated effect size on the phenotype. In each iteration, SNPs may be kept, added or removed from the model, with SNPs with strongest associations with the phenotype added to the model with highest probability. The total number of SNPs contributing to the phenotype, and the total amount of variation explained by these SNPs, is calculated from the model at each iteration and defines the posterior distributions on these parameters. While this approach does not explicitly account for population stratification due to the presence of related individuals, the likelihood of false‐positive associations between SNPs and traits caused by this population structure is reduced by estimating SNP effect sizes after controlling for other SNPs in the model (some of which may already account for population structure) (Guan &amp; Stephens

For each trait, the model was run three times for 110 000 iterations, with parameter values recorded every 10th iteration after discarding the first 10 000 iterations. Results were similar across replicate runs; therefore, results (median values, mean values and 95% equal tail probability credible intervals) are presented across all three replicates for all but two traits, where poor convergence was observed in one replicate, and hence, results are presented for the remaining two replicates.
