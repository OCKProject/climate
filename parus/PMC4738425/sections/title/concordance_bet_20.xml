 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For all traits in both the UK and NL, there was no significant excess of positions in the genome that were nominally significant in both the QTL and GWAS analyses (chi‐square test on the observed and expected counts of SNPs being nominally significant in both, one or neither the GWAS nor QTL analysis, see Appendix S8, Supporting information for 
  <span class="italic">P</span> values). There was no evidence that chromosomes that contributed significantly to overall variance (measured as the significance of the LRT, see Appendix S3, Supporting information) were more likely to harbour nominally significant QTL peaks (detected from the QTL mapping approach), compared to chromosomes that did not contribute significantly to overall variance [two‐tailed Fisher's exact test, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&gt;
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.05 for all traits except UK clutch size 
  <span class="italic">P </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.046 (not significant after accounting for multiple testing)].
