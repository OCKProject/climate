 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chromosome partitioning is an approach to partition the additive genetic variance for complex traits across genomic regions such as individual chromosomes (Visscher 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0063">2007</a>) and has recently been adapted to data sets with complex pedigrees and close relatives (Robinson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0053">2013</a>). A regression of the total variation explained by each chromosome on chromosome size or gene content provides a test for the trait architecture (Robinson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0053">2013</a>). A positive regression indicates a polygenic trait architecture, because if many genes contribute to variation, then larger chromosomes with more genes will tend to explain more variation than small chromosomes with fewer genes. In contrast, no relationship between variance explained and chromosome size suggests that the trait is either influenced by a small number of genes of large effect, or that loci having small to moderate effects are not randomly distributed throughout the genome (Robinson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chromosome partitioning was performed as described in Robinson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0053">2013</a>) and Santure

  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0054">2013</a>). Given the small number of markers (&lt;60) on some chromosomes, the 5591 ‘chromosome‐assigned’ SNPs were assigned to a total of 22 chromosomes or chromosome sets; chromosomes 1–15, 17–20, 1A and 4A were considered individually (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 21), while a chromosome set was obtained by combining all markers from microchromosomes 21–28 and linkage group LGE22. The number of SNPs in the 22 sets ranged from 98 to 700 (Appendix S3, Supporting information). These regions contained a total of 14 722 genes, predicted from homology with the zebra finch genome (Santure 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.

  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0048">2014</a>). Genomic relatedness between every pair of individuals was calculated using an approach that scales by the actual variance in relatedness (approach 3; Robinson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0053">2013</a>). These genomic estimates of relatedness were then adjusted by the known pedigree relationships between individuals, reducing the sampling error around the expected relatedness values and giving more accurate additive genetic variance estimates (Robinson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="mec13452-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#mec13452-bib-0053">2013</a>). Variance components were estimated with 
  <span class="sc">asreml</span>, using the raw phenotypes and fitting random and fixed effects as described in Appendix S1 (Supporting information). For every chromosome, two mixed models were constructed:

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequently, a likelihood ratio test (LRT) was performed for each chromosome to test whether it explained significant variation in the trait, by comparing the log likelihood of the genome‐wide model with the log likelihood of the genome‐wide plus chromosome model.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, linear regressions were fitted between the variance explained by each chromosome and the number of genes they contained, to test whether traits were influenced by a large number of loci distributed throughout the genome.</p>
