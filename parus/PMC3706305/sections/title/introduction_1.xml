 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence that climate change influences many properties of wild populations of animals and plants is now ubiquitous 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Walther1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Walther1">[1]</a>–
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Dawson1">[4]</a>. As a consequence, there is widespread concern about the demographic and evolutionary effects of changing climate for the long-term viability of populations. A popular approach to study the impact of climate change on population viability is the use of “climate envelope models” or “niche models.” These models take environmental correlates of species presence, combined with climate change projections, to predict range shifts and extinction rates (e.g., 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Thomas1">[5]</a>–
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Cheung1">[7]</a>). However, such projections do not take a population's ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions into account 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Pulliam1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Pulliam1">[8]</a>–
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Jackson1">[10]</a>. Further, since habitat fragmentation potentially constrains range shifts to track the optimal environment, populations of many species will have to adapt 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> to a changing environment to avoid extinction. Such models may therefore not be ideally suited to predict sustainable rates of climate change for existing populations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, mechanistic population models focus specifically on those population attributes that underlie population persistence. By assessing how phenotypic traits that influence population growth rate are affected by environmental variables, predictions of the fate of populations under varying rates of environmental change can be made 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Lynch1">[11]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Burger1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Burger1">[12]</a>. Recently, Chevin et al. 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Chevin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Chevin1">[13]</a> proposed a mechanistic population model that predicts the critical rate of environmental change that allows long-term population persistence by local adaptation. The main novelty of the model lies in the fact that it allows local adaptation by both genetic change (i.e., micro-evolution) and phenotypic plasticity (the potential for a given genotype to be expressed differently in different environments 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Pigliucci1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Pigliucci1">[14]</a>). Since phenotypic plasticity is currently recognized as being responsible for the majority of adaptive phenotypic changes in response to climate change 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Gienapp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Gienapp1">[15]</a>–
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Anderson1">[18]</a>, this model is an important step forward in predicting effects of climate change on population persistence. The model combines demographic population properties (e.g., generation time, maximum intrinsic growth rate) with quantitative genetic measures (e.g., additive genetic variance, strength of stabilising selection on traits sensitive to climate change), and allows for phenotypic plasticity by incorporating the effect of the environment on the trait. Since the purpose of the model is to make predictions about the fate of wild populations, the required parameters should ideally also be estimated using data from those same populations. To do so may be challenging, as it requires long-term data describing responses to the environment, as well as extensive pedigree and fitness data, a combination of information typically only found in long-term studies of marked individuals

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A long-term population study on great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) breeding in Wytham Woods near Oxford (UK) offers a rare opportunity to parameterise the model of Chevin et al. 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Chevin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Chevin1">[13]</a> for a single population, and hence to investigate the projected effects of climate change on population viability allowing for plasticity and evolution. For many wild bird species—both marine and terrestrial species—reproduction is restricted to a short annual period, in which there is sufficient food available to meet the needs of offspring production. This period varies annually and is set by the responses of lower trophic levels to abiotic factors, which are ultimately shaped to maximise productivity 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Visser1">[20]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Visser2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Visser2">[21]</a>. Although timing of this period is sensitive to ambient temperature, there is no 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> expectation that different trophic levels respond similarly to change in temperature. Hence, climate change has the potential to upset synchrony between food availability and timing of reproduction in birds, which may have important consequences for population viability 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Visser1">[20]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Visser2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Visser2">[21]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Successful reproduction in great tits depends to a large extent on synchronization of offspring food demand with a brief annual peak in caterpillar abundance. This can be achieved by individual adjustment of laying date to early spring temperature, which predicts the timing of the peak in food availability 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a>. Repeated observation of females breeding in multiple years yields observations of individual laying dates under different spring temperatures, providing a measure of phenotypic plasticity, or the “reaction norm” to temperature 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Przybylo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Przybylo1">[23]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Nussey1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Nussey1">[24]</a>. In addition, long-term monitoring of the annual timing of peak abundance of caterpillars feeding on newly emerged pedunculate oak (
  <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>) leaves provides an estimate of how the optimal great tit laying date changes with temperature. An estimate of the optimum derived from an independent aspect of the environment is preferable to one derived from direct observations of birds, as it is unaffected by a potential constitutive cost of plasticity or differences in intrinsic individual quality of birds with different laying dates.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we parameterise Chevin et al.'s 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Chevin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Chevin1">[13]</a> model with estimates from the long-term study of Wytham Woods' great tits, and so calculate the maximum rate of sustained change in early spring temperature that allows long-term persistence of this population. We also use the model to explore the dependence of population persistence on currently observed phenotypic plasticity, and further to explore the interactions between life-history variation and plasticity as a key element in persistence of populations facing environmental change. Our aim was thus to use the model as an heuristic tool to understand the importance of phenotypic plasticity in adaptation to climate change.
