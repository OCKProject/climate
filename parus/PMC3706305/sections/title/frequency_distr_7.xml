 <p>The dashed vertical line represents the predicted rate of local temperature change, under the high emissions scenario 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Murphy1">[25]</a>. Note that the distribution is highly skewed, with the modal outcome being biased to lower values of 
  <span class="italic">η</span>
  <sub>c</sub> and a long tail of high values of 
  <span class="italic">η</span>
  <sub>c</sub> (for visual purposes the 
  <span class="italic">x</span>-axis was cut off at 
  <span class="italic">η</span>
  <sub>c</sub> = 1.0). This is because the difference between the reaction norm of great tit laying date in response to spring temperature (
  <span class="italic">b</span>) and the optimal reaction norm (
  <span class="italic">B</span>) is modelled in absolute terms while in the simulations 
  <span class="italic">b</span> often exceeds 
  <span class="italic">B</span>, causing the average outcome of |
  <span class="italic">B−b</span>| to be higher than the outcome for the point estimate. (b) Frequency distribution of

  <span class="italic">γ</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">T</span>, assuming there is no phenotypic plasticity (for this population, |
  <span class="italic">B−b</span>| = 5.30). The dashed vertical line represents the predicted rate of local temperature change, under the high emissions scenario 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Murphy1">[25]</a>. Note that the scale on the 
  <span class="italic">x</span>-axis differs between the two figures.
