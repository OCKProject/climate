 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a range of previously published estimates and new analyses to parameterise the model, all of them specific to the Wytham Woods study population. All parameter estimates are listed in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001605-t001" href="#pbio-1001605-t001">Table 1</a> and, for cases where we used previous estimates from this population, we refer to 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001605.s001" href="#pbio.1001605.s001">Figure S1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001605.s002" href="#pbio.1001605.s002">Text S1</a>, and the specific publication for exact methodological details. Some parameters have been estimated multiple times, and can vary because of different data inclusion criteria, different time spans, different assumptions, or different statistical estimation procedures. In such cases we used the most recent estimate of the respective parameter, as these generally used most data, and employed the most appropriate estimation procedures (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001605.s001" href="#pbio.1001605.s001">Figure S1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001605.s002" href="#pbio.1001605.s002">Text S1</a> for more discussion).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the strength of stabilising selection on laying date (
  <span class="italic">γ</span>) with the following equation: −(
  <span class="italic">ω</span>

  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Estes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Estes1">[53]</a>. The width of the fitness function (
  <span class="italic">ω</span>) for laying date was estimated by calculating year-centred laying dates (i.e., subtracting annual average laying date, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 8,646 laying dates in 51 y), categorising them in 10 equally spaced intervals, and calculating the average number of recruits per breeding attempt for each category. A Gaussian function (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001605.s001" href="#pbio.1001605.s001">Figure S1</a>) was fitted to these average numbers and 
  <span class="italic">ω</span> was estimated as the “standard deviation” of the function (
  <span class="italic">ω</span> = 11.62). Phenotypic variance (
  <span class="italic">σ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>) in laying date was estimated as the average of all annual values (
  <span class="italic">σ</span> = 5.39). Since the model by Chevin et al. 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Chevin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Chevin1">[13]</a> assumes that the population is initially well adapted, we set the strength of directional selection (
  <span class="italic">β</span>) at zero, and calculated 
  <span class="italic">γ</span> as −0.0061. The assumption of an initially well adapted population, and thus zero directional selection, is required by the model, yet depending on the match with the food peak there can be strong directional phenotypic selection on laying date observed 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a>. Since we have no indication that the population is currently poorly adapted, the observed phenotypic selection on laying date may be biased by phenotypic covariance between other aspects of individual quality and laying date (see also 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s3" href="#s3">Discussion</a>). Using a bootstrapping procedure we estimated the standard error of 
  <span class="italic">γ</span> as 0.0010. Note that we use the absolute value of 
  <span class="italic">γ</span> in the model.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent study by Husby et al. 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Husby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Husby1">[40]</a> showed that the average temperature between 15 February and 25 April (here referred to as “spring temperature”) is the best predictor of average annual laying date; we thus used the individual response in laying date to this environmental variable as an estimate of phenotypic plasticity, and the response in the date of standardised caterpillar abundance as an estimate of environmental sensitivity (see details below). A similar exercise to that of Husby et al. 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Husby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Husby1">[40]</a> had been performed earlier, but based on a longer time series and a slightly different environmental variable, i.e., “warmth sum” (the sum of the daily maximum temperatures between 1 March and 25 April, 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a>). We chose to conduct analyses with the average temperature, as used by Husby et al. 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Husby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Husby1">[40]</a>, to permit more straightforward comparison between the modelled critical rate of environmental change and predictions about future climate change; see 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a> for detailed information on how great tit laying date and peak caterpillar abundance date have changed over time.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the daily average of minimum and maximum temperatures (in °C) that were collected by the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford, 5 km east of Wytham Woods, for our measure of spring temperature. The date by which 50% of the seasonal total of winter moth caterpillars (
  <span class="italic">Operopthera brumata</span> larvae, the main source of food for great tit nestlings; 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Perrins1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Perrins1">[54]</a>–
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Wilkin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Wilkin1">[56]</a>) had descended from trees to pupate on the ground (here referred to as “caterpillar half-fall date”) was recorded in Wytham Woods in the majority of years from 1961 onwards (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 43), and gives a good indication of the timing of the peak in caterpillar biomass (see 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a> for more details). Given a fixed period between great tit laying date and peak offspring food demand, this serves as a proxy for the optimal response in laying date to spring temperature 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a>. Hence, environmental sensitivity of selection (
  <span class="italic">B</span>) was accordingly calculated as the slope of the linear function of caterpillar half-fall date in response to spring temperature.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenotypic plasticity, or the average within-individual response in laying date to changes in spring temperature, was calculated from a dataset restricted to females that bred at least twice (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 4,742 reproductive attempts of 1,874 females, in 51 y). The within-individual slope was calculated by using the difference between the spring temperature a female experienced before a specific reproductive attempt with the average of the spring temperatures a female experienced before all her reproductive attempts, as explanatory variable in a model on laying date (following 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-vandePol1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-vandePol1">[57]</a>). In the model we also included the average of the spring temperatures a female experienced before all her reproductive attempts as explanatory variable, to account for potential micro-evolution or selective (dis)appearance of individuals with higher, or lower, average spring temperature experience. Female identity, year, and sector of the wood (Wytham Woods consists of nine different sectors with different vegetation types and management regimes, see 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Minot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Minot1">[58]</a>) were included as random effects, to correct for an uneven distribution of repeated measures of individuals, inter-annual variation (not due to spring temperature) and environmental heterogeneity, respectively. Models were fitted with a normal error distribution and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation algorithm with 100,000 iterations, using MLwiN version 2.02 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Rasbash1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Rasbash1">[59]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Browne1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Browne1">[60]</a>. Significance of explanatory terms was determined using the Wald statistic, which approximates the χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> distribution.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used projections from the United Kingdom Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP09, 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Murphy1">[25]</a>) to compare our results against the predicted rate of average temperature change for the Wytham Woods area. To this end, we used the average temperature change predictions for the 25-km grid box that contained Wytham Woods (number 1,547) for the 2070–2099 time period, under the low, medium, and high emissions scenario, for the months February, March, and April. We weighted the predictions per month according to their number of days contained in our measure of spring temperature (see above). To calculate an annual rate of change we used the midpoint of 2070–2099 relative to the midpoint of the baseline period (1961–1990). This resulted in a predicted rate of increase of spring temperature of 0.021, 0.025, and 0.030°C y
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for the low, medium, and high emissions scenario, respectively.
