 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chevin et al.'s model 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Chevin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Chevin1">[13]</a> extends an earlier model by Lynch and Lande 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Lynch1">[11]</a>, by incorporating plasticity in a phenotypic trait (
  <span class="italic">z</span>, here first egg-laying date) that mediates adaptation to a changing continuous environmental parameter (
  <span class="italic">ε</span>, here temperature). It predicts the maximum rate with which 
  <span class="italic">ε</span> can change (at a constant rate in time) to allow long-term population persistence, referred to as the critical rate of environmental change (
  <span class="italic">η</span>
  <sub>c</sub>). In the original model 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Lynch1">[11]</a>
  <span class="italic">η</span>
  <sub>c</sub> depended only on the phenotypic variance (
  <span class="italic">σ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>) in 
  <span class="italic">z</span>, the heritability (
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>) of 
  <span class="italic">z</span> (together comprising the additive genetic variance for 
  <span class="italic">z</span>), the strength of stabilising selection (
  <span class="italic">γ</span>, 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Lande1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Lande1">[52]</a>) on 
  <span class="italic">z</span>, and the maximum intrinsic rate of population growth (
  <span class="italic">r
   <sub>max</sub>
  </span>). Note that 
  <span class="italic">γ</span> refers to selection on unstandardised phenotypic variation, assumes the absence of strong directional selection, and a positive value represents stabilising selection, rather than disruptive selection. The extended model also includes the species' generation time (
  <span class="italic">T</span>), with 
  <span class="italic">T</span> being expressed on the same units of time scale as 
  <span class="italic">η</span>
  <sub>c</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">r
   <sub>max</sub>
  </span> (here in years; 
  <span class="italic">r
   <sub>max</sub>
  </span> is measured in years
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). Furthermore, it includes the environmental sensitivity of selection (
  <span class="italic">B</span>), which reflects how the optimal value of 
  <span class="italic">z</span> (laying date) depends on 
  <span class="italic">ε</span> (temperature), and the degree of phenotypic plasticity or reaction norm (
  <span class="italic">b</span>), which quantifies the effect of 
  <span class="italic">ε</span> on 
  <span class="italic">z</span>, within individuals. Altogether the critical rate of change is modelled as:
