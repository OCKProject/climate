 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study we explored the viability of a well-studied wild bird population to changes in climate predicted to the end of this century, by parameterising a mechanistic model by Chevin et al. 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Chevin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Chevin1">[13]</a>. We further explored the dependence of population viability on phenotypic plasticity as a form of adaptation to the environment, and the extent to which these conclusions depend on life history, and on evolvability. Our general conclusions are that the importance of phenotypic plasticity in adaptation to climate change is strongly dependent on life history. Short-lived species, with high reproductive rates, are more resilient to expected rates of climate change even with relatively little phenotypic plasticity, and while phenotypic plasticity is likely to be an adaptive response to environmental uncertainty in such species, it is not the only potential form of adaptation to climate change unless generation time encompasses multiple years and the rate of reproduction is slow. While the parameters we fitted to the model were determined by the specific details of our study system, we discuss below the extent to which our conclusions can be generalised.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Like all models, the model by Chevin et al. 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Chevin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Chevin1">[13]</a> makes assumptions to simplify reality. For example, the model assumes no stochastic variation in optimal timing of reproduction. Stochastic variation occurring over time scales shorter than a species' generation time can only be countered with phenotypic plasticity, and as such the model may underestimate the importance of phenotypic plasticity. Our conclusions should therefore be interpreted with respect to long-term directional climate change only, assuming that population demography is buffered against environmental stochasticity. Such buffering, in the present system, may be accomplished by the fact that generations overlap and adult survival is largely independent of the match with the environment 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Garant1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Garant1">[29]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Reed1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Reed1">[30]</a>. This possibility is not accounted for by the model as it assumes non-overlapping generations. Further, if adult survival is independent of the match to the environment, any evolutionary response to directional change is likely to be retarded. Moreover, in applying the model we have assumed that both the response to environmental cues and the dependence of the environment on climate can be extrapolated outside the ranges currently observed. In the case of the three trophic levels studied here (oaks, caterpillars, and great tits) the possibility remains that they exhibit differential phenotypic responses or physiological tolerances to increased temperature. If so, it is questionable whether the degree of matching can be assumed to be fixed over time. In this respect it is noteworthy that the model also allows for overcompensation, which would be just as detrimental as under-compensation, and causes a modification of predictions when parameter error is incorporated, as this results in a skewed error distribution of |

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although we incorporated error in parameter estimates for our predictions of extinction probability, this does not exclude the possibility that certain parameters and associated errors are systematically over- or underestimated. Estimates of the additive genetic variance for laying date in birds have been derived in several ways, from different study species with a range of life histories (reviewed in 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Liedvogel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Liedvogel1">[31]</a>; see also 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001605.s002" href="#pbio.1001605.s002">Text S1</a> for further discussion). While there is considerable variability in the estimates, it is likely that many estimates are inflated by a failure to control effectively for common environmental effects between relatives, which can be expected to be considerable for a trait with a strong link to environmentally determined phenology (see also 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-vanderJeugd1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-vanderJeugd1">[32]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Stopher1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Stopher1">[33]</a>). In this study we used an estimate of 
  <span class="italic">σ
   <span class="sup">2</span>h
   <span class="sup">2</span>
  </span> derived from a very low heritability estimate (0.03) from an animal model controlling for several types of environmental variance 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Liedvogel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Liedvogel1">[31]</a>. We suspect that estimates of the additive genetic variance for time of breeding will be closer to this value than many previous estimates once appropriate environmental control is built into models. Sex-limited expression of traits will reduce the response to selection. While laying date is a phenotype only expressed by pairs of birds, in many, but not all, species it is primarily determined by the female 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Auld1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Auld1">[34]</a>. Hence, the predicted evolutionary response to selection can be over-estimated if sex-limitation is not considered. The strength of stabilising selection on timing of breeding used here (
  <span class="italic">γ</span>) is more likely to be an underestimate as this is based on observational data at the level of the population. Two likely additional sources of stabilising selection that are not considered by such data result from, first, the extent to which individuals optimise timing of breeding to the phenology of their local environment. If there are different optima for different locations, then birds in the tails of the population phenotypic distribution may be closer to their local optimum than assumed: hence phenotypes should be measured at the appropriate relative scale. A second effect that will underestimate stabilising selection is the extent to which apparent directional selection on laying date results from phenotypic covariance between other aspects of individual quality and breeding date 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Verhulst1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Verhulst1">[35]</a>. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001605-g003" href="#pbio-1001605-g003">Figure 3d</a> suggests that, if the match between organisms and the environment is poor, the outcomes of the model may be sensitive to variation in the strength of stabilising selection, or the additive genetic variance. However, the model assumes a fixed strength of stabilising selection, whereas it might be expected that as the match between a population and a changing environment became poorer, the strength of stabilising selection would increase. Lastly, the estimate of 
  <span class="italic">r
   <sub>max</sub>
  </span> (0.49) employed here may be an underestimate, as this does not include immigrants, which compensate for recruits that have dispersed from the population 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Niel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Niel1">[28]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-McCleery1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-McCleery1">[36]</a>. In summary, with the other parameters being relatively straightforward to estimate, any systematic bias in parameter estimates is most likely in the direction such that the potential for micro-evolutionary adjustment to climate change is underestimated.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extrapolating the model using parameters derived from a single great tit population to other bird species suggests that species at the faster end of the life-history continuum would have sufficient evolutionary potential to adapt phenology to a temperature change of the order of 0.030°C y

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001605-g003" href="#pbio-1001605-g003">Figures 3a, 3b</a>, and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001605-g004" href="#pbio-1001605-g004">4</a>). The predicted rates of change for the study area from United Kingdom Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP09) 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Murphy1">[25]</a> are broadly comparable to predicted rates of global temperature change, as IPCC 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-IPCC1">[37]</a> scenarios predict similar or less temperature change for this century. However, how representative are the parameter estimates derived from this single population for other species and populations? Current knowledge suggests that evolutionary potential of most bird species in terms of phenological adaptation should be broadly similar, since heritability for laying date is not likely to be much greater than the value used here 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Liedvogel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Liedvogel1">[31]</a>, and predictions are not very sensitive to values of

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001605-g003" href="#pbio-1001605-g003">Figures 3c</a>). While heritability may decrease under adverse environmental conditions

  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Wilson1">[39]</a> the opposite may also apply

  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Husby2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Husby2">[41]</a> and at present there is no evidence of climate-related dependence of the heritability of laying date in our study population

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimates of the optimal phenotypic response to changing environmental conditions (in the present study, the optimal response in laying date to temperature [
  <span class="italic">B</span>], as determined from the response of the timing of caterpillar peak abundance to temperature) are not widely available. An estimate of 
  <span class="italic">B</span> for another very well-studied Dutch population of great tits is lower than the one for our population (−4.01 versus −5.30; 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Visser3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Visser3">[43]</a>), and this is a population for which the phenotypic response of the birds is also lower (see 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Husby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Husby1">[40]</a> for a comparison), suggesting that |
  <span class="italic">B−b</span>| would be larger than in the Wytham population. To the best of our knowledge, there are few comparable estimates from other systems, though see 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Phillimore1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Phillimore1">[44]</a>. In general, one can expect that optimal responses are determined by the response of lower trophic levels in the food chain 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Visser2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Visser2">[21]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Both1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Both1">[45]</a>. In that respect, observations for 1,558 largely Northern hemisphere wild plant species suggesting an average advance in spring leafing and flowering of 5–6 d per °C 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Wolkovich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Wolkovich1">[46]</a>, suggest that our estimate of 
  <span class="italic">B</span> (which is also in units of days per °C) is quite representative of terrestrial systems in the Northern hemisphere. Rates of change in higher trophic levels (i.e., 
  <span class="italic">b</span>) may be more variable. A large-scale analysis of data from three decades across environments in the UK by Thackeray et al. 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Thackeray1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Thackeray1">[3]</a> suggested that while primary producers and consumers have shown broadly comparable rates of advance with climate change, secondary consumers have on average advanced at only about half the rate. Hence, the general expectation might be that 
  <span class="italic">B</span> and 
  <span class="italic">b</span> will not be very closely matched, and that a scenario intermediate to the two we modelled (close match between 
  <span class="italic">B</span> and 
  <span class="italic">b</span>; no plasticity at all) is most common. It should be noted that our conclusions are drawn from analysis of plasticity in phenology, and given considerable annual variability, phenological traits may have a very high degree of plasticity. Other traits, for instance thermal tolerance, or migration timing, might show less plasticity, but we are not aware of studies of other classes of trait that would support analysis in the framework used here.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently a similar approach to calculate the risk of extinction for a Dutch population of great tits yielded a more pessimistic outcome 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Gienapp2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Gienapp2">[47]</a>. This is predominantly caused by the combination of lower plasticity, weaker selection, and more extreme climate change scenarios (up to 0.067°C y
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Gienapp2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Gienapp2">[47]</a>. However, in contrast with our study population, where average offspring recruitment is lower in years with stronger selection on relative laying date 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a> and about 13% of annual population growth can be explained by the population's match with the food peak (unpublished data), population growth is hardly affected by the match with the food peak in the Dutch population 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Reed1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Reed1">[30]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Gienapp2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Gienapp2">[47]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Reed2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Reed2">[48]</a>. This illustrates that even when the match with the food peak is the single most important factor explaining relative fitness, other ecological processes that determine population growth or absolute fitness (e.g., density dependence)—the effects of which on population viability in response to climate change are less straightforward to estimate—can potentially mitigate adverse population effects

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to cases where there is a close tracking of the environment, inability to adjust phenotypically to a gradual shift in optimal timing caused by climate change suggests very high risks of population extinction in species with long generation times (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001605-g003" href="#pbio-1001605-g003">Figures 3b</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001605-g004" href="#pbio-1001605-g004">4</a>). Such risks could potentially be buffered with higher evolvability, but we are unaware of any evidence for a link between life history and genetic variance. The greater vulnerability of species with slower life histories contrasts with predictions of Morris et al. 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Morris1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Morris1">[49]</a> who suggested longevity should act as a buffer against climatic variability. This raises the question of whether longer-lived species will have already evolved a sufficiently plastic response in timing of reproduction, to variation in temperature, to cope with the relatively fast directional change that is predicted for the future. This is especially relevant as our results show that their long generation time limits their potential to respond with genetic adaptation to climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, parameterisation of Chevin et al.'s 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Chevin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Chevin1">[13]</a> model with conservative estimates from an extensively studied wild bird population suggests little risk of extinction of that population due to future change in temperature as predicted by climate models. By varying terms in the model we estimated that the absence of phenotypic plasticity would increase the likelihood of population extinction approximately 500-fold. For birds with longer generation times, vulnerability to extinction is considerably higher even for only moderate mismatches of phenotypic plasticity with the rate of environmental change, as they may exhibit insufficient evolutionary potential to adjust to relatively fast change. For those species, phenotypic plasticity in timing of reproduction is likely to be by far the most effective mechanism to cope with constantly increasing temperatures. However, relatively less is known about the determinants and limits on plasticity in such organisms, and increased focus on this area, as well as work on the link between phenotypic plasticity and life history would be very valuable.
