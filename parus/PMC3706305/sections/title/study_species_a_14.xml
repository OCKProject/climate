  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Gosler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Gosler1">[50]</a>. They are socially monogamous and breed in cavities, but readily accept nestboxes, if provided. Wytham Woods (Oxfordshire, UK, 51°46′ N 1°20′W) consists of 
  <span class="italic">ca</span> 385 ha mixed deciduous woodland with an excess of nestboxes (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,020) available since 1960. On average 217 nestboxes are occupied annually by great tits 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Bouwhuis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Bouwhuis1">[51]</a>, although population size has increased in recent decades. Second broods are rare (&lt;3%) and typically excluded from analyses (e.g., 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a>). Data collection in the breeding season (April–June) consists of weekly nestbox checks in the laying phase to record first egg date (here referred to as “laying date”) and clutch size. Occupied nestboxes are checked every 2 d around the anticipated hatching date to infer hatching date and allow ringing of nestlings (for future identification) at a standard age of 15 d. At least 5 d later, nestboxes are checked for successful fledging of nestlings. Parents are caught in the nestbox while feeding nestlings, and identified by their ring, or newly ringed if immigrant. Recruits to the natal population are defined as locally hatched birds that were caught as a parent in subsequent years. For analyses in this paper, we use data collected between 1960–2010, as field protocols were standardised over this period.
