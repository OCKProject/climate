  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Great tits are small (14–22 g) passerine birds, common in large parts of Europe, Asia, and Northern Africa 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Gosler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Gosler1">[50]</a>. They are socially monogamous and breed in cavities, but readily accept nestboxes, if provided. Wytham Woods (Oxfordshire, UK, 51°46′ N 1°20′W) consists of 
   <span class="italic">ca</span> 385 ha mixed deciduous woodland with an excess of nestboxes (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,020) available since 1960. On average 217 nestboxes are occupied annually by great tits 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Bouwhuis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Bouwhuis1">[51]</a>, although population size has increased in recent decades. Second broods are rare (&lt;3%) and typically excluded from analyses (e.g., 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a>). Data collection in the breeding season (April–June) consists of weekly nestbox checks in the laying phase to record first egg date (here referred to as “laying date”) and clutch size. Occupied nestboxes are checked every 2 d around the anticipated hatching date to infer hatching date and allow ringing of nestlings (for future identification) at a standard age of 15 d. At least 5 d later, nestboxes are checked for successful fledging of nestlings. Parents are caught in the nestbox while feeding nestlings, and identified by their ring, or newly ringed if immigrant. Recruits to the natal population are defined as locally hatched birds that were caught as a parent in subsequent years. For analyses in this paper, we use data collected between 1960–2010, as field protocols were standardised over this period.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Model</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chevin et al.'s model 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Chevin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Chevin1">[13]</a> extends an earlier model by Lynch and Lande 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Lynch1">[11]</a>, by incorporating plasticity in a phenotypic trait (
   <span class="italic">z</span>, here first egg-laying date) that mediates adaptation to a changing continuous environmental parameter (
   <span class="italic">ε</span>, here temperature). It predicts the maximum rate with which 
   <span class="italic">ε</span> can change (at a constant rate in time) to allow long-term population persistence, referred to as the critical rate of environmental change (
   <span class="italic">η</span>
   <sub>c</sub>). In the original model 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Lynch1">[11]</a>
   <span class="italic">η</span>
   <sub>c</sub> depended only on the phenotypic variance (
   <span class="italic">σ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>) in 
   <span class="italic">z</span>, the heritability (
   <span class="italic">h</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>) of 
   <span class="italic">z</span> (together comprising the additive genetic variance for 
   <span class="italic">z</span>), the strength of stabilising selection (
   <span class="italic">γ</span>, 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Lande1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Lande1">[52]</a>) on 
   <span class="italic">z</span>, and the maximum intrinsic rate of population growth (
   <span class="italic">r
    <sub>max</sub>
   </span>). Note that 
   <span class="italic">γ</span> refers to selection on unstandardised phenotypic variation, assumes the absence of strong directional selection, and a positive value represents stabilising selection, rather than disruptive selection. The extended model also includes the species' generation time (
   <span class="italic">T</span>), with 
   <span class="italic">T</span> being expressed on the same units of time scale as 
   <span class="italic">η</span>
   <sub>c</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">r

   </span> (here in years; 
   <span class="italic">r
    <sub>max</sub>
   </span> is measured in years
   <span class="sup">−1</span>). Furthermore, it includes the environmental sensitivity of selection (
   <span class="italic">B</span>), which reflects how the optimal value of 
   <span class="italic">z</span> (laying date) depends on 
   <span class="italic">ε</span> (temperature), and the degree of phenotypic plasticity or reaction norm (
   <span class="italic">b</span>), which quantifies the effect of 
   <span class="italic">ε</span> on 
   <span class="italic">z</span>, within individuals. Altogether the critical rate of change is modelled as:

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Parameterisation of the Model</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a range of previously published estimates and new analyses to parameterise the model, all of them specific to the Wytham Woods study population. All parameter estimates are listed in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001605-t001" href="#pbio-1001605-t001">Table 1</a> and, for cases where we used previous estimates from this population, we refer to 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001605.s001" href="#pbio.1001605.s001">Figure S1</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001605.s002" href="#pbio.1001605.s002">Text S1</a>, and the specific publication for exact methodological details. Some parameters have been estimated multiple times, and can vary because of different data inclusion criteria, different time spans, different assumptions, or different statistical estimation procedures. In such cases we used the most recent estimate of the respective parameter, as these generally used most data, and employed the most appropriate estimation procedures (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001605.s001" href="#pbio.1001605.s001">Figure S1</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001605.s002" href="#pbio.1001605.s002">Text S1</a> for more discussion).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the strength of stabilising selection on laying date (
   <span class="italic">γ</span>) with the following equation: −(
   <span class="italic">ω</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>+
   <span class="italic">σ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>)
   <span class="sup">−1</span> =

   <span class="sup">2</span>
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Estes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Estes1">[53]</a>. The width of the fitness function (
   <span class="italic">ω</span>) for laying date was estimated by calculating year-centred laying dates (i.e., subtracting annual average laying date, 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 8,646 laying dates in 51 y), categorising them in 10 equally spaced intervals, and calculating the average number of recruits per breeding attempt for each category. A Gaussian function (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001605.s001" href="#pbio.1001605.s001">Figure S1</a>) was fitted to these average numbers and 
   <span class="italic">ω</span> was estimated as the “standard deviation” of the function (
   <span class="italic">ω</span> = 11.62). Phenotypic variance (
   <span class="italic">σ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>) in laying date was estimated as the average of all annual values (
   <span class="italic">σ</span> = 5.39). Since the model by Chevin et al. 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Chevin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Chevin1">[13]</a> assumes that the population is initially well adapted, we set the strength of directional selection (
   <span class="italic">β</span>) at zero, and calculated 
   <span class="italic">γ</span> as −0.0061. The assumption of an initially well adapted population, and thus zero directional selection, is required by the model, yet depending on the match with the food peak there can be strong directional phenotypic selection on laying date observed 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a>. Since we have no indication that the population is currently poorly adapted, the observed phenotypic selection on laying date may be biased by phenotypic covariance between other aspects of individual quality and laying date (see also 
   <a ref-type="sec" rid="s3" href="#s3">Discussion</a>). Using a bootstrapping procedure we estimated the standard error of 
   <span class="italic">γ</span> as 0.0010. Note that we use the absolute value of 
   <span class="italic">γ</span> in the model.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent study by Husby et al. 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Husby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Husby1">[40]</a> showed that the average temperature between 15 February and 25 April (here referred to as “spring temperature”) is the best predictor of average annual laying date; we thus used the individual response in laying date to this environmental variable as an estimate of phenotypic plasticity, and the response in the date of standardised caterpillar abundance as an estimate of environmental sensitivity (see details below). A similar exercise to that of Husby et al. 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Husby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Husby1">[40]</a> had been performed earlier, but based on a longer time series and a slightly different environmental variable, i.e., “warmth sum” (the sum of the daily maximum temperatures between 1 March and 25 April, 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a>). We chose to conduct analyses with the average temperature, as used by Husby et al. 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Husby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Husby1">[40]</a>, to permit more straightforward comparison between the modelled critical rate of environmental change and predictions about future climate change; see 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a> for detailed information on how great tit laying date and peak caterpillar abundance date have changed over time.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the daily average of minimum and maximum temperatures (in °C) that were collected by the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford, 5 km east of Wytham Woods, for our measure of spring temperature. The date by which 50% of the seasonal total of winter moth caterpillars (
   <span class="italic">Operopthera brumata</span> larvae, the main source of food for great tit nestlings;

   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Wilkin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Wilkin1">[56]</a>) had descended from trees to pupate on the ground (here referred to as “caterpillar half-fall date”) was recorded in Wytham Woods in the majority of years from 1961 onwards (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 43), and gives a good indication of the timing of the peak in caterpillar biomass (see 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a> for more details). Given a fixed period between great tit laying date and peak offspring food demand, this serves as a proxy for the optimal response in laying date to spring temperature 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Charmantier1">[22]</a>. Hence, environmental sensitivity of selection (
   <span class="italic">B</span>) was accordingly calculated as the slope of the linear function of caterpillar half-fall date in response to spring temperature.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenotypic plasticity, or the average within-individual response in laying date to changes in spring temperature, was calculated from a dataset restricted to females that bred at least twice (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 4,742 reproductive attempts of 1,874 females, in 51 y). The within-individual slope was calculated by using the difference between the spring temperature a female experienced before a specific reproductive attempt with the average of the spring temperatures a female experienced before all her reproductive attempts, as explanatory variable in a model on laying date (following 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-vandePol1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-vandePol1">[57]</a>). In the model we also included the average of the spring temperatures a female experienced before all her reproductive attempts as explanatory variable, to account for potential micro-evolution or selective (dis)appearance of individuals with higher, or lower, average spring temperature experience. Female identity, year, and sector of the wood (Wytham Woods consists of nine different sectors with different vegetation types and management regimes, see 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Minot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Minot1">[58]</a>) were included as random effects, to correct for an uneven distribution of repeated measures of individuals, inter-annual variation (not due to spring temperature) and environmental heterogeneity, respectively. Models were fitted with a normal error distribution and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation algorithm with 100,000 iterations, using MLwiN version 2.02 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Rasbash1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Rasbash1">[59]</a>,
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Browne1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Browne1">[60]</a>. Significance of explanatory terms was determined using the Wald statistic, which approximates the χ
   <span class="sup">2</span> distribution.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used projections from the United Kingdom Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP09, 
   <a rid="pbio.1001605-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Murphy1">[25]</a>) to compare our results against the predicted rate of average temperature change for the Wytham Woods area. To this end, we used the average temperature change predictions for the 25-km grid box that contained Wytham Woods (number 1,547) for the 2070–2099 time period, under the low, medium, and high emissions scenario, for the months February, March, and April. We weighted the predictions per month according to their number of days contained in our measure of spring temperature (see above). To calculate an annual rate of change we used the midpoint of 2070–2099 relative to the midpoint of the baseline period (1961–1990). This resulted in a predicted rate of increase of spring temperature of 0.021, 0.025, and 0.030°C y
   <span class="sup">−1</span> for the low, medium, and high emissions scenario, respectively.
