 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Combining parameter estimates for Chevin et al.'s model (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001605-t001" href="#pbio-1001605-t001">Table 1</a>), the Wytham great tit population is predicted to be able to adapt to a maximum long-term rate of increase in spring temperature of 0.47°C y
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, i.e. &gt;15 times the rate of temperature change of 0.030°C y
  <span class="sup">−1</span> predicted under a high emissions scenario for this location and time in the annual cycle 
  <a rid="pbio.1001605-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Murphy1">[25]</a>. However, this estimate does not take uncertainty in parameter estimates into account. To calculate the probability that the modelled critical rate of change (
  <span class="italic">η</span>
  <sub>c</sub>) will fall below 0.030°C y
  <span class="sup">−1</span> while accounting for parameter uncertainty, we ran 100,000 simulations, with each simulation randomly sampling from a normal error distribution of parameters 
  <span class="italic">σ
   <span class="sup">2</span>h
   <span class="sup">2</span>
  </span>, 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>, 
  <span class="italic">T</span>, 
  <span class="italic">B</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">b</span>. This resulted in an estimated probability of 0.001 that 
  <span class="italic">η</span>
  <sub>c</sub> falls below 0.030°C y
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001605-g002" href="#pbio-1001605-g002">Figure 2a</a>), and hence again very little likelihood of extinction due to predicted temperature change. If we assume that there is no phenotypic plasticity in great tit laying date (hence: |
  <span class="italic">B−b</span>| = 5.30) the point estimate of 
  <span class="italic">η</span>
  <sub>c</sub> is 0.028°C y
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, with a 60% probability of population extinction (
  <span class="italic">η</span>
  <sub>c</sub>&lt;0.030) when the error around the parameter estimates of 
  <span class="italic">σ
   <span class="sup">2</span>h
   <span class="sup">2</span>
  </span>, 
  <span class="italic">γ</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">T</span> is taken into account (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001605-g002" href="#pbio-1001605-g002">Figure 2b</a>). Hence, the likelihood of population persistence in a changing environment depends heavily on the presence of phenotypic plasticity, as extinction risk is &gt;500-fold higher in the absence of phenotypic plasticity.

   <p>The dashed vertical line represents the predicted rate of local temperature change, under the high emissions scenario 
    <a rid="pbio.1001605-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001605-Murphy1">[25]</a>. Note that the distribution is highly skewed, with the modal outcome being biased to lower values of 
    <span class="italic">η</span>
    <sub>c</sub> and a long tail of high values of 
    <span class="italic">η</span>
    <sub>c</sub> (for visual purposes the 
    <span class="italic">x</span>-axis was cut off at 
    <span class="italic">η</span>
    <sub>c</sub> = 1.0). This is because the difference between the reaction norm of great tit laying date in response to spring temperature (
    <span class="italic">b</span>) and the optimal reaction norm (
    <span class="italic">B</span>) is modelled in absolute terms while in the simulations 
    <span class="italic">b</span> often exceeds 
    <span class="italic">B</span>, causing the average outcome of |
    <span class="italic">B−b</span>| to be higher than the outcome for the point estimate. (b) Frequency distribution of
