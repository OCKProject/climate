 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then explored the sensitivity of our conclusions to varying evolvability of populations while holding other quantities constant. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001605-g003" href="#pbio-1001605-g003">Figure 3c</a> shows that, with the observed life history and phenotypic plasticity in laying date, our conclusions about the ability of this great tit population to adjust to the high emissions scenario projected temperature change of 0.030°C y
  <span class="sup">−1</span> are quite robust to variation in the estimated genetic variance (
  <span class="italic">σ
   <span class="sup">2</span>h
   <span class="sup">2</span>
  </span>) in laying date and strength of stabilising selection (
  <span class="italic">γ</span>) on laying date. In the absence of phenotypic plasticity, the population is at the threshold at which the additive genetic variance (
  <span class="italic">σ
   <span class="sup">2</span>h
   <span class="sup">2</span>
  </span>) in laying date is insufficient for the population to remain viable (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001605-g003" href="#pbio-1001605-g003">Figure 3d</a>). Equally, if the strength of stabilising selection on the match with the environment were weaker, extinction risk would also be elevated. However, in general it appears that a relatively fast life history provides sufficient potential to considerably reduce the risk of population extinction due to climate change.
