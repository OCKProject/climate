 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We explored the sensitivity of the probability of population extinction for other species with different life histories, assuming similar rates of change in the environment (see

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is not plausible that great tit life history parameters such as generation time would evolve rapidly enough to the extent that the risk of population extinction would become substantial with the observed phenotypic plasticity. However, by setting phenotypic plasticity to zero (|
