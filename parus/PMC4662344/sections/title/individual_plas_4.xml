 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual plasticity in laying date was modelled including only two of three environmental variables that were significant in the population-level analysis (i.e. spring temperature, breeder density; see Results). Although latitude was significant at the population level (see Results), it was not an appropriate variable to assess individual plasticity because it has limited variation for a given individual over its lifetime. In fact, tree swallows can be considered philopatric to their breeding site in our study area as only 8.1% of our observations were indicative of females having dispersed between farms (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1015 observations on 397 females, among different breeding events; see Lagrange et al. 
  <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">2014</a>). All environmental variables were standardized (zero mean, unit variance; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Table A3</a>). Age was included as a covariate in our models because of its influence on laying date: older females reproduce earlier than younger ones (Stutchbury and Robertson 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">1988</a>; Bentz and Siefferman 
  <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">2013</a>; this study, see Results), and thus, females sampled in 2004 were excluded as we had no information about their age.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first assessed the relationship between the difference in laying dates (laying date year 2 – laying date year 1) and the difference in environmental conditions between years (environmental value year 2 – environmental value year 1) for all females breeding in two consecutive years. This analysis was conducted using a linear model and was repeated for three data sets: (i) females observed as SY on the first year (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 63, refer to as the SY dataset), (ii) females observed as ASY on both years (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 311, refer to as the ASY dataset) and (iii) all females with age class on the first year as fixed effect (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 349, refer to as the total dataset). For females breeding in more than two years, we included only the first two consecutive observations in these analyses.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then investigated individual plasticity and between-individual variation in plasticity (IxE) with a random regression analysis (Nussey et al. 
  <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2007</a>) on females that were observed in at least two years between 2005 and 2013 (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 935 observations on 370 females). We compared increasing structure complexity of random effects (year, farm, female identity) with LRTs, including random slopes with environmental variables (IxE). Furthermore, because not all individuals experienced the same set of environmental conditions, we used the within-subject centring technique for environmental variables to separate individual variation from population trend (Kreft et al. 
  <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">1995</a>; Snijders and Bosker 
  <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">1999</a>; van de Pol and Wright 
  <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2009</a>). Hence, each environmental variable (temperature and breeder density) was subdivided into a within-individual (
  <span class="italic">β</span>
  <sub>W</sub>) and a between-individual (
  <span class="italic">β</span>
  <sub>B</sub>) component. Briefly, for each female, we calculated a mean value of temperature and breeder density experienced (i.e. between-individual effect, reflecting the population trend), and for all observations, an individual deviation from these mean values (i.e. within-individual effect, reflecting individual plasticity). The full model included as fixed effects within-individual (
  <span class="italic">β</span>
  <sub>W</sub>) and between-individual (
  <span class="italic">β</span>
  <sub>B</sub>) components of both spring temperature and breeder density and also female age class and latitude to control for their effects. Best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) for each female (i.e. individual slope and elevation) were generated from the final model to graphically represent individual-specific plastic response.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All statistical analyses were conducted in the R statistical environment 3.0.2 (R Core Team 
  <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">2014</a>). Linear mixed model analyses were performed using the lme4 package (Bates et al. 
  <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2014</a>). Degrees of freedom (Satterhwaite’s approximation) and 
  <span class="italic">P</span>-values of mixed models were calculated using the lmerTest package (Kuznetsova et al. 
  <a rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" href="#b39">2013</a>). Final models were determined by sequentially removing the least significant term from the model based on its 
  <span class="italic">P</span>-value and comparing with a LRT this new model to the previous one, repeatedly until all remaining variables were significant (
  <span class="italic">α </span>= 0.05) (Crawley 
  <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2007</a>).
