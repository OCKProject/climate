 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we were interested in the multidimensional influence that environmental variation can have on phenological traits, even at a small spatial scale. Here, we have shown the importance of three environmental variables – latitude, spring temperature and breeder density – and found evidence of individual plasticity as a function of spring temperature but not of breeder density and no evidence of variation in individual slopes. Our results also suggested that females breeding on average in areas of lower individual densities were possibly constrained in their adjustment of laying date in response to spring temperature.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tree swallows in our population have advanced their annual mean laying date by about 0.42 day/year over the 10-year study period. This rate of advance is higher than the 0.28 day/year advance that was previously reported for this species throughout North America (study period: 1959 to 1991, Dunn and Winkler 
   <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>). This difference can be explained by either an increase in this rate in the last two decades or by geographic variation in effects and/or responses to climate change (e.g. Hussell 
   <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2003</a>; Dunn and Møller 
   <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2014</a>). However, these two potential explanations could only be distinguished by performing a new temporal trend analysis of tree swallow laying dates across their range. The observed advancement is also greater than the mean trend computed from several long-term studies on birds (mean advance of 0.13 day/year, 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 68 species, Dunn and Winkler 
   <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2010</a>), but is still comparable to observations from a few previous studies on migrant species (e.g. eurasian reed warblers (
   <span class="italic">Acrocephalus scirpaceus</span>): advance of 0.48 day/year, Crick and Sparks 
   <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">1999</a>; great reed warblers (
   <span class="italic">Acrocephalus arundinaceus</span>): advance of 0.55 day/year, Dyrcz and Halupka

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerous previous studies in birds reported within-species latitudinal variation in phenology, reflecting different readings of photoperiod (e.g. Sanz 
   <a rid="b68" ref-type="bibr" href="#b68">1998</a>; Dunn and Winkler 
   <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>; Gienapp et al. 
   <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2010</a>; reviewed in Dawson 
   <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">2013</a>). However, the latitudinal variation in laying date documented here is particularly striking given the small spatial scale involved (80-km span in latitude) compared to previous studies (e.g. North American continent, Dunn and Winkler 
   <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>; 700-km span in latitude, Gienapp et al. 
   <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2010</a>). Our result may be partly explained by larger day length variation in space than in time during the breeding season in this region. For instance, on May 20th (the mean laying date across all observations in our study; Julian day 140 in nonleap years), the difference in day length between the most distant sites in terms of latitude in our study system was of approximately 5 min, while the difference between two consecutive days was around 2 min (calculated with the NOAA solar calculator, 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gouv" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.esrl.noaa.gouv</span>). Considering that 30–60 min changes in day length over an entire year can be perceived as cues for breeding and moulting in bird species distributed near the Equator (Hau 
   <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2001</a>; Goymann et al. 
   <a rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32">2012</a>), it is plausible that the latitude effect on laying date documented here partly reflects a difference in day length captured by the circadian rhythm of individuals.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in density of breeders is rarely studied as a potential determinant of timing of breeding in birds, but it showed the largest effect size on mean laying date. The negative relationship we observed – later laying date at lower density – is similar to observations from other tree swallow populations (models using species abundance indices from the Breeding Bird Survey programme, Dunn and Winkler 
   <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>; Winkler et al. 
   <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2002</a>), but contrary to expectations under intraspecific resource competition (e.g. Wilkin et al. 
   <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2006</a>; Wilson et al. 
   <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">2007</a>; but see also Ahola et al. 
   <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2012</a> for a special case where intraspecific resource competition lead to earlier laying date). Dunn and Winkler (
   <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>) suggested that differences in habitat quality should lead to an aggregation of individuals in areas with more food, while areas with fewer resources should limit and constrain laying date (e.g. food availability, Shorrocks et al. 
   <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">1998</a>; Robb et al. 
   <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2008</a>). This is supported by the positive correlation usually observed between nest box occupancy rate and insect abundance (Hussell 
   <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">2012</a>), and by the negative correlation observed between timing of breeding and flying insect biomass during the laying period (Dunn et al. 
   <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2011</a>) in tree swallows. Tree swallows do not follow an ideal-free distribution in our study area as birds nesting in low-quality habitats have smaller clutch sizes and lower reproductive success (Ghilain and Bélisle 
   <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2008</a>; Lessard et al. 
   <a rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43">2014</a>). We could also speculate that the observed relationship is partly explained by the activity of the circadian system, where the density of breeders could act, similar to the effect of temperature, as an environmental cue (e.g. the presence of conspecific may be needed to initiate breeding events as in Caro et al. 
   <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2007</a>) regulating timing of breeding in females (Dawson 
   <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">2008</a>). Nevertheless, our detailed analyses of individual plasticity do not support this last hypothesis.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature is usually proposed to be the most important environmental variable determining laying date in birds (Visser et al. 
   <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2009</a>; Caro et al. 
   <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2013</a>). In our sliding window analysis, the temperature during the month preceding the laying period was providing the strongest correlation. This period is similar to what has been observed in other bird species (e.g. common gulls (
   <span class="italic">Larus canus</span>), Brommer et al. 
   <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">2008</a>; great tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), Husby et al. 
   <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">2010</a>; blue tits, Porlier et al. 
   <a rid="b59" ref-type="bibr" href="#b59">2012</a>) and corresponds to the period of increasing spring temperatures acting directly as a signal for the timing of breeding in birds (Visser et al. 
   <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2009</a>; Schaper et al. 
   <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">2012</a>). Indeed, a tendency for earlier timing of breeding at higher spring temperature has been observed in several bird species (Dunn and Winkler 
   <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2010</a>; Charmantier and Gienapp 
   <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2014</a>), including tree swallows (Dunn and Winkler 
   <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>; Winkler et al. 
   <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2002</a>; this study). The temperature–density interaction observed, with more negative laying date–spring temperature slope at higher breeder density, further supports the environment quality hypothesis, as at lower densities of breeders (lower quality habitats) it might be harder for individuals to respond to environmental cues and effectively adjust their laying date (see also discussion on individual plasticity below).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual plasticity and between-individual effect</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence of individual plasticity in laying date in response to spring temperature in both plasticity analyses suggests that this environmental variable may potentially act as a cue for timing of breeding in tree swallows. Our first observation that changes in temperature experienced by a female will lead to changes in its timing of breeding has been supported by the within-subject centring technique where individual plasticity (within-individual component, 
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>W</sub>) remained significant despite the heterogeneity observed in sampling (between-individual component, 
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>B</sub>). It is possible that different mechanisms drive the patterns observed at the population and individual levels even if the trends are similar in direction and magnitude. However, the similarity in coefficients for within- and between-individual spring temperature components potentially suggests that the population trend observed can be explained by individual phenotypic plasticity (see Brouwer et al. 
   <a rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13">2013</a> and Gienapp and Brommer 
   <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2014</a> for similar interpretations when 
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>W</sub> = 
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>B</sub>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Density of breeders in our study system is probably not a social cue for reproductive timing, but could instead reflect a variation in individual capacity to initiate breeding linked with habitat quality. Our first individual plasticity analysis has shown no effect of variation in breeder density on individual laying date adjustment, and this finding was further supported by our second analysis showing that the within-individual component (
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>W</sub>) was not different from zero (i.e. no individual plasticity). These results combined with the observed negative population trend (
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>B</sub>) in laying date in our data suggested that changes in density a female will experience across breeding seasons will not affect her plastic response (i.e. not act as an environmental cue for timing of breeding) and that all females living on average at higher densities laid their eggs earlier (and 
   <span class="italic">vice versa</span>). The possible constraint on plasticity for females at lower densities (lower quality habitats) suggested from the steeper laying date–spring temperature slope with increasing breeder density in the population-level analysis was further supported by the slightly stronger individual plastic response of laying date as function of temperature observed at high densities in our complementary analyses (Table B1–B3). Environmental constraints on phenotypic plasticity have also been described in song sparrows (
   <span class="italic">Melospiza melodia</span>) on Mandarte Island (British Columbia, Canada), where cohorts born in better environmental conditions showed higher plastic response in response to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (Wilson et al. 
   <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">2007</a>). While we believe that the pattern described here is likely to be nonadaptive, given that tree swallows breeding later show a reduced fitness in most years (Millet et al. 
   <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2015</a>), further investigations are needed to clearly conclude on the effects of reduced plasticity in lower density habitats (e.g. compare selection gradients between low and high breeder density farms).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variability in individual responses to the environment (IxE) is considered the raw material for phenotypic plasticity evolution (Nussey et al. 
   <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2007</a>). In birds, IxE for laying date in response to temperature has been observed in most populations studied (reviewed in Gienapp and Brommer 
   <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2014</a>). Here, the absence of IxE for spring temperature (i.e. no phenotypic variation in slopes), along with similar plastic responses at the population and individual levels, suggests that tree swallows can track temperature changes, probably as long as the observed variation is within the usual range of temperatures they are adapted to. The presence of IxE is usually tested by stepwise model building, where improvement in model likelihood when adding the IxE component is sufficient to suggest variation in the slope and thus individual variation in plasticity. Our results questioned this approach of assessing IxE. A first problem with this approach is the fact that an improvement to the model could be mainly due to the presence of a significant covariance between the slope and intercept rather than to a significant IxE interaction. Also, while we observed no variation in the slope for the spring temperature reaction norm, we observed individual variation in slope for breeder density (model 5, Table
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl3" href="#tbl3">3</a>), but no direction or pattern in the way individuals respond to variation in breeder density (i.e. 
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>W</sub>, individual plasticity). Previous studies argued that heterogeneity in residual variance could lead to an over-estimation of IxE (Brommer 
   <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2013</a>; Nicolaus et al. 
   <a rid="b52" ref-type="bibr" href="#b52">2013</a>), a phenomenon that cannot be discarded here. For all these reasons, the presence of a significant IxE interaction involving breeder density as random individual responses may not be representative of variability in phenotypic plasticity at the individual level.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Applications of our study</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenotypic plasticity in response to spring temperature can be an effective way for birds to keep adequate timing of life-history events in the face of climate change (reviewed in Charmantier and Gienapp 
   <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2014</a>). For example, Vedder et al. (
   <a rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" href="#b79">2013</a>) have shown with a population persistence model that the actual level of individual plasticity in timing of breeding observed in great tits of Wytham Woods (UK) lowers their extinction risk by about 500-fold. However, the success of a population response to climate change via phenotypic plasticity can depend on many other environmental components. For example, degradation of environmental conditions in a Finnish population of pied flycatchers (
   <span class="italic">Fiducela hypoleuca</span>) is suspected to be a cause for the observed mismatch between breeding time and phenology of the environment (Laaksonen et al. 
   <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2006</a>). Studying all potential factors influencing phenological traits is crucial for a more complete understanding of the potential of phenotypic plasticity to adequately track environmental changes. Here, our initial choice of environmental variables was based on factors previously shown to influence tree swallow laying date, but was also guided by data availability. Ideally, we should have used a measurement of habitat quality (e.g. food availability) rather than a proxy (i.e. breeder density) and also a finer measurement of climatic variables (e.g. temperature and rainfall for each farm). Yet, using the best proxy available is arguably a better option than not taking it into account when analysing plasticity.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental conditions have changed over the study period in our system, with both an increase in spring temperature and a diminution in breeder density (see also Rioux Paquette et al. 
   <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2014</a>). These changes influenced the phenological response to environmental cues in contrasting ways. While we found a phenotypically plastic response for changes in spring temperature, the more limited capacity to respond to temperature cues (i.e. reduced individual plasticity) that we suspect in lower density habitats is worrying for tree swallow populations in the context of concurrent climate change, population decline and reduced fitness for individuals breeding later (Millet et al. 
   <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2015</a>). Multiple environmental drivers of phenotypic changes can act in synergy and accelerate the rate of extinction (Brook et al. 
   <a rid="b12" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12">2008</a>). Unfortunately, models predicting species response to climate change rarely included phenotypic plasticity, population-level response and/or multidimensional environmental factors despite evidences of important bias caused by such omissions (Chevin et al. 
   <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2010</a>; Reed et al. 
   <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2011</a>; Bellard et al. 
   <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2012</a>; Valladares et al. 
   <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">2014</a>). If plastic responses are constrained in lower quality habitats, and that several human-driven changes are occurring simultaneously, the ability of species to respond to climate change may be jeopardized and lead to further biodiversity loss. Studies such as this one are still necessary to improve our knowledge of the effects of important environmental factors, to understand how they interact together and to assess, rather than assume, the importance of plastic responses underlying observed phenotypic changes. Altogether, our results enlighten the complexity of phenotypic plasticity as a way for populations to cope with current climate change.
