 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effects of current climate change are ubiquitous and severely affect environmental conditions in wild populations (McCarty 
  <a rid="b45" ref-type="bibr" href="#b45">2001</a>; Parmesan and Yohe 
  <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2003</a>; Walther 
  <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2010</a>). Phenological traits are particularly sensitive to these environmental modifications, and as a result, over the last decades, phenological changes have been observed in several taxa from plants to mammals (Root et al. 
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2003</a>; Menzel et al. 
  <a rid="b47" ref-type="bibr" href="#b47">2006</a>; Parmesan 
  <a rid="b54" ref-type="bibr" href="#b54">2006</a>; Thackeray et al. 
  <a rid="b77" ref-type="bibr" href="#b77">2010</a>; Poloczanska et al. 
  <a rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57">2013</a>). However, the processes underlying observed phenotypic changes remain largely unknown, mainly because the distinction between mechanisms such as genetic changes and phenotypic plasticity is often unclear (Gienapp et al. 
  <a rid="b30" ref-type="bibr" href="#b30">2008</a>; Gienapp and Brommer 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2014</a>; Merilä and Hendry 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2014</a>). Consequently, our predictions of species adaptations to the ongoing environmental modifications remain elusive.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenotypic plasticity – the variation in the expression of phenotypes by a genotype in response to the environment (Bradshaw 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">1965</a>; Stearns 
  <a rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" href="#b75">1989</a>) – is usually accepted as the main process to cope with environmental changes in the short term (Gienapp et al. 
  <a rid="b30" ref-type="bibr" href="#b30">2008</a>; Charmantier and Gienapp 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2014</a>; Gienapp and Brommer 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2014</a>; Merilä and Hendry 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2014</a>). However, studies have suggested that the importance and magnitude of phenotypic plasticity might be variable among populations (Husby et al. 
  <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">2010</a>; Porlier et al. 
  <a rid="b59" ref-type="bibr" href="#b59">2012</a>) and that the quality of its inference is relatively weak (Gienapp and Brommer 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2014</a>; Merilä and Hendry 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2014</a>). Importantly, multiple potential environmental drivers of the observed phenotypic changes are rarely studied exhaustively, despite the fact that more than one environmental factor may be affecting or constraining the plastic responses observed in wild populations (Merilä and Hendry 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2014</a>). Yet, by choosing 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> a single environmental driver, one can miss important causes of the observed phenotypic change (e.g. climate change versus habitat degradation) and predict inaccurate species response and/or suggest ineffective conservation actions to undertake (Charmantier and Gienapp 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2014</a>; Merilä and Hendry 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2014</a>). Finally, phenotypic plasticity can also be under selection and contribute to adaptive evolution, either directly through an underlying genetic basis or indirectly by allowing survival of populations in new environmental conditions and maintain them relatively close to new phenotypic optimum (Price et al. 
  <a rid="b60" ref-type="bibr" href="#b60">2003</a>; Brommer et al. 
  <a rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10">2005</a>; Ghalambor et al. 
  <a rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27">2007</a>; Nussey et al. 
  <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2007</a>; Merilä and Hendry 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2014</a>). For all these reasons, investigating the importance of phenotypic plasticity, in terms of assessing individual and population variations, its environmental drivers and its influence in observed phenotypic trends, is a critical first step to obtain a more complete understanding of evolutionary processes underlying phenotypic changes caused by current climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Different environmental and spatial drivers can affect plasticity of phenological traits, either directly by acting as cues of future environmental conditions or indirectly through population differentiation captured in space and/or by acting as constraints on plastic responses. Physiological regulation of phenological events in birds comes from the integration of diverse cues from which photoperiod is the most important because its perception allows an annual read of time passing (Sharp 
  <a rid="b71" ref-type="bibr" href="#b71">2005</a>; Bradshaw and Holzapfel 
  <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">2007</a>; Dawson 
  <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">2008</a>; Visser et al. 
  <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">2010</a>). Annual photoperiod variation increases with latitude and could explain most of within-species latitudinal variation in life-history events (Lambrechts et al. 
  <a rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" href="#b42">1997</a>; Bradshaw and Holzapfel 
  <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">2007</a>; Dawson 
  <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">2013</a>). Finer adjustments (i.e. plasticity) are allowed by the integration of other environmental signals from the physical and social environments (Ball and Ketterson 
  <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2008</a>; Dawson 
  <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">2008</a>). For instance, temperature is thought to be the main driver of timing of breeding in birds (Meijer et al. 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">1999</a>; Visser et al. 
  <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2009</a>; reviewed in Caro et al. 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2013</a>), but other factors such as rainfall, often a cue for food availability (Hau 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2001</a>; Saunders et al. 
  <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">2013</a>), and social interactions (Caro et al. 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2007</a>) have been reported to play a role in some populations. Knowledge of how these various cues are perceived by the circadian system is still scarce (Dawson 
  <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">2008</a>), as is appreciation of variation in the perception of these multidimensional cues among individuals (i.e. IxE) or populations (Lyon et al. 
  <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2008</a>; Visser 
  <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">2008</a>; Visser et al. 
  <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">2010</a>). These cues may also interact with other environmental components and constrain the levels of plastic responses displayed between and/or within-individuals (Wilson et al. 
  <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">2007</a>). However, very few studies have addressed these possible interactive effects.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we use 10 years of data from a tree swallow (
  <span class="italic">Tachycineta bicolor</span>) long-term study to investigate the role of multiple spatial (latitude, longitude and elevation) and environmental (spring temperature, rainfall and breeder density) determinants of laying date. We first assess the influence of potential factors and their interactions on laying date at the population level in our 10 200-km
  <span class="sup">2</span> study system. These factors were chosen based on previous knowledge of their potential influence on laying date in tree swallows and other bird species. We then examine the importance of these factors at both population (among-individuals) and individual (within-individuals) levels of plasticity. The tree swallow is a small migratory passerine, an aerial insectivorous, and it produces only one clutch per year, all characteristics of species more at risk under current climate changes (Both and Visser 
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">2001</a>; Møller et al. 
  <a rid="b50" ref-type="bibr" href="#b50">2008</a>; Dunn and Winkler 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2010</a>; Thackeray et al. 
  <a rid="b77" ref-type="bibr" href="#b77">2010</a>; Dunn and Møller 
  <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2014</a>). In fact, tree swallow populations are severely declining in the eastern part of their distribution (Nebel et al. 
  <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">2010</a>; Shutler et al. 
  <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2012</a>), including in our study area (Rioux Paquette et al. 
  <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2014</a>). However, the causes for these declines are still unknown despite some indications pointing at agricultural intensification in breeding areas (e.g. Ghilain and Bélisle 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2008</a>; Rioux Paquette et al. 
  <a rid="b64" ref-type="bibr" href="#b64">2013</a>) or at carry-over effects from nonbreeding areas (e.g. Rioux Paquette et al. 
  <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2014</a>; but see also Dunn et al. 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2011</a> and Dunn and Møller 
  <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean laying date of tree swallows has also advanced in most populations across the continent over the last five decades (Dunn and Winkler 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>, 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2010</a>; Rioux Paquette et al. 
  <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2014</a>; but see Hussell 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2003</a> for an exception). A previous analysis in our study system showed that selection favoured earlier laying date in this population but that patterns of selection fluctuated in strength and direction through time (Millet et al. 
  <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2015</a>). Also, the time lag observed in the studied area between spring arrival (eBird, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ebird.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://ebird.org/</span>) and reproduction suggests that further adjustments of laying date are possible. Latitude, spring temperature and breeder density (as a proxy of habitat quality) were suggested to influence tree swallow laying date at a large spatial scale (Dunn and Winkler 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>; Winkler et al. 
  <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2002</a>), but we have little knowledge of other potential environmental and spatial factors, their influences at a small spatial scale and their relative importance on population and individual levels of plasticity.
