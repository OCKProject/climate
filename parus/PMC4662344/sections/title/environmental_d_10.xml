 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerous previous studies in birds reported within-species latitudinal variation in phenology, reflecting different readings of photoperiod (e.g. Sanz 
  <a rid="b68" ref-type="bibr" href="#b68">1998</a>; Dunn and Winkler 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>; Gienapp et al. 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2010</a>; reviewed in Dawson 
  <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">2013</a>). However, the latitudinal variation in laying date documented here is particularly striking given the small spatial scale involved (80-km span in latitude) compared to previous studies (e.g. North American continent, Dunn and Winkler 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>; 700-km span in latitude, Gienapp et al. 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2010</a>). Our result may be partly explained by larger day length variation in space than in time during the breeding season in this region. For instance, on May 20th (the mean laying date across all observations in our study; Julian day 140 in nonleap years), the difference in day length between the most distant sites in terms of latitude in our study system was of approximately 5 min, while the difference between two consecutive days was around 2 min (calculated with the NOAA solar calculator, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gouv" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.esrl.noaa.gouv</span>). Considering that 30–60 min changes in day length over an entire year can be perceived as cues for breeding and moulting in bird species distributed near the Equator (Hau 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2001</a>; Goymann et al. 
  <a rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32">2012</a>), it is plausible that the latitude effect on laying date documented here partly reflects a difference in day length captured by the circadian rhythm of individuals.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in density of breeders is rarely studied as a potential determinant of timing of breeding in birds, but it showed the largest effect size on mean laying date. The negative relationship we observed – later laying date at lower density – is similar to observations from other tree swallow populations (models using species abundance indices from the Breeding Bird Survey programme, Dunn and Winkler 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>; Winkler et al. 
  <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2002</a>), but contrary to expectations under intraspecific resource competition (e.g. Wilkin et al. 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2006</a>; Wilson et al. 
  <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">2007</a>; but see also Ahola et al. 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2012</a> for a special case where intraspecific resource competition lead to earlier laying date). Dunn and Winkler (
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>) suggested that differences in habitat quality should lead to an aggregation of individuals in areas with more food, while areas with fewer resources should limit and constrain laying date (e.g. food availability, Shorrocks et al. 
  <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">1998</a>; Robb et al. 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2008</a>). This is supported by the positive correlation usually observed between nest box occupancy rate and insect abundance (Hussell 
  <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">2012</a>), and by the negative correlation observed between timing of breeding and flying insect biomass during the laying period (Dunn et al. 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2011</a>) in tree swallows. Tree swallows do not follow an ideal-free distribution in our study area as birds nesting in low-quality habitats have smaller clutch sizes and lower reproductive success (Ghilain and Bélisle 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2008</a>; Lessard et al. 
  <a rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43">2014</a>). We could also speculate that the observed relationship is partly explained by the activity of the circadian system, where the density of breeders could act, similar to the effect of temperature, as an environmental cue (e.g. the presence of conspecific may be needed to initiate breeding events as in Caro et al. 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2007</a>) regulating timing of breeding in females (Dawson 
  <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">2008</a>). Nevertheless, our detailed analyses of individual plasticity do not support this last hypothesis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature is usually proposed to be the most important environmental variable determining laying date in birds (Visser et al. 
  <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2009</a>; Caro et al. 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2013</a>). In our sliding window analysis, the temperature during the month preceding the laying period was providing the strongest correlation. This period is similar to what has been observed in other bird species (e.g. common gulls (
  <span class="italic">Larus canus</span>), Brommer et al. 
  <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">2008</a>; great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), Husby et al. 
  <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">2010</a>; blue tits, Porlier et al. 
  <a rid="b59" ref-type="bibr" href="#b59">2012</a>) and corresponds to the period of increasing spring temperatures acting directly as a signal for the timing of breeding in birds (Visser et al. 
  <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2009</a>; Schaper et al. 
  <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">2012</a>). Indeed, a tendency for earlier timing of breeding at higher spring temperature has been observed in several bird species (Dunn and Winkler 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2010</a>; Charmantier and Gienapp 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2014</a>), including tree swallows (Dunn and Winkler 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>; Winkler et al. 
  <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2002</a>; this study). The temperature–density interaction observed, with more negative laying date–spring temperature slope at higher breeder density, further supports the environment quality hypothesis, as at lower densities of breeders (lower quality habitats) it might be harder for individuals to respond to environmental cues and effectively adjust their laying date (see also discussion on individual plasticity below).
