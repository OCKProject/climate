 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tree swallows in our population have advanced their annual mean laying date by about 0.42 day/year over the 10-year study period. This rate of advance is higher than the 0.28 day/year advance that was previously reported for this species throughout North America (study period: 1959 to 1991, Dunn and Winkler 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1999</a>). This difference can be explained by either an increase in this rate in the last two decades or by geographic variation in effects and/or responses to climate change (e.g. Hussell 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2003</a>; Dunn and Møller 
  <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2014</a>). However, these two potential explanations could only be distinguished by performing a new temporal trend analysis of tree swallow laying dates across their range. The observed advancement is also greater than the mean trend computed from several long-term studies on birds (mean advance of 0.13 day/year, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 68 species, Dunn and Winkler 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2010</a>), but is still comparable to observations from a few previous studies on migrant species (e.g. eurasian reed warblers (
  <span class="italic">Acrocephalus scirpaceus</span>): advance of 0.48 day/year, Crick and Sparks 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">1999</a>; great reed warblers (
  <span class="italic">Acrocephalus arundinaceus</span>): advance of 0.55 day/year, Dyrcz and Halupka 
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2009</a>).
