 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 2004 and 2013, during the breeding season (April to August), we monitored 400 nest boxes within 40 farms (10 nest boxes per farm, separated by 50 m, thus covering similar areas on each site) in southern Québec, Canada (covering an area of 10 200 km²) (

  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2008</a> for more details on the study system). During this period, each nest box was visited every 2 days to record occupancy and laying date of the first egg (in Julian days; January 1 = Julian day 1). Females were captured during the incubation period, while males were caught during the nestlings’ food provisioning phase. All tree swallows were individually identified with an aluminium band (US Fish and Wildlife Service). Females were aged based on feather colour: brown females were assigned to second-year class (SY) and blue-green females to after second-year class (ASY) (Hussell 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">1983</a>). Since 2006, the sex of every individual was confirmed with a molecular technique following Lessard et al. (
  <a rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43">2014</a>). In our analysis, we only considered first clutches, that is first breeding event in a nest box of both female and male (if known) within a reproductive season (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Table A1</a> for details on yearly sample sizes). Second clutches are rare (12.7% of all clutches) and mostly result from first clutch failures.

   <p>Distribution of the 40 farms (grey circles) and 10 meteorological stations (white triangles) in the study system in southern Québec. Mean density of breeders on a farm (% of occupied nest boxes) between 2004 and 2013 is represented by different circle sizes (see legend). Forest patches (green), rivers and lakes (blue), other land uses (mostly agriculture; yellow), elevation (100-m black isolines), latitude and longitude (in decimal degrees; thin black lines) are also represented.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spring temperature (°C) and rainfall (mm) data were obtained in two steps, using information collected from meteorological stations located within the study area (obtained from Environment Canada,

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>). First, a sliding windows approach was used to determine the most relevant time period suitable for all farms for these two meteorological variables and to guard against potentially misguided 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> choices (see Brommer et al. 
  <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">2008</a> and Porlier et al. 
  <a rid="b59" ref-type="bibr" href="#b59">2012</a> for similar approaches). For this analysis, we used a unique climatic variable value obtained by averaging values from the three meteorological stations nearest from the centroid of our study system (centroid: 45.57°N, −72.64°W; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Table A2</a>). We tested windows varying from 5 to 91 days, from Julian days 60 to 151 (respectively, March 1 and May 31 in nonleap year) for a total of 3828 windows. Pearson’s correlations between annual mean of averaged daily value for each window and annual mean laying dates were used to determine the most relevant period for each environmental variable. The strongest correlation between mean temperature and mean laying date was found between Julian day 96 and 129 (April 6–May 9;

  <span class="italic"> </span>−0.750, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>=

  <span class="italic"> </span>−0.748, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.013). As a second step, we used these periods as our references for computing both annual mean temperatures and annual rainfalls (hereafter spring temperature and rainfall) from 10 meteorological stations near our farms (
