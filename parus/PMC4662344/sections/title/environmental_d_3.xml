 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the annual mean laying dates for each farm (

  <span class="italic">r </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.92 between annual mean and median laying dates) to assess both the temporal (interannual) trend in laying and the environmental determinants of laying date. For the temporal trend, we used a linear mixed model to estimate the annual change in mean laying date over the study period (10 years), with farm identity included as random effect. Then, we fitted a linear mixed model to quantify the effects of different environmental variables on mean laying date. The full model included spring temperature, rainfall, breeder density (% of the 10 nest boxes on each farm occupied), elevation (m) and latitude (decimal degree) and all two-way interactions as fixed effects (see also 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Table A3</a> for the range limit of each environmental component). We did not include longitude and distance from the St. Lawrence River as they were both highly correlated with elevation (

  <a rid="b58" ref-type="bibr" href="#b58">2009</a>). All explanatory variables were standardized (zero mean, unit variance; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Table A3</a>) to facilitate the interpretation of their relative influence on mean laying dates. Year and farm identity were tested as random effects using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs), but only year was significant and kept in analyses (but see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Table A4</a> for a model including both year and farm identity as random effects – the selected final model and its effect sizes were similar in both cases).
