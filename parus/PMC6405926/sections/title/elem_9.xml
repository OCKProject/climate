 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of 174 individuals captured and PIT‐tagged at our feeders, 70 birds returned and were detected by RFID data loggers (

  <span class="italic">n</span> = 45 individuals tagged during winter 2016/2017), resulting in 315,745 visits across our 160‐day study period. Tagged birds took an average of 11 days (
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 23.9, range = 0–118) to return to a feeder after their initial capture, and the average time it took birds to visit all feeders they ultimately used during the study was 37 days (
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 53.4, range = 0–151). Feeders were highly variable in the total number of times they were visited by tagged birds during the study, with an average of 15,035 visits (
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 9,678.2, range = 874–31,561). Similarly, the number of individual birds that used a particular feeder was also highly variable with an average of 11.5 birds (
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 3.9, range = 3–20). The maximum distance we detected tagged birds moving between feeders was 1,850 m.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 160 days that feeders were available to chickadees, individuals visited feeders an average of 103 days (
   <span class="italic">SD</span> = 47.7, range = 2–160) which equated to 66% of the study period. Over the course of the study, the number of visits to any single feeder by an individual bird ranged from 1 to 15,512, and individuals averaged 4–9,831 visits per feeder (mean = 1,454, 
   <span class="italic">SD</span> = 1,269). We found substantial variability in total daily visits among individual chickadees, with an average of 44 visits/day (
   <span class="italic">SD</span> = 46.3, range = 1–406 visits/day; Figure 
   <a rid="ece34902-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34902-fig-0002">2</a>). Of note, the variation in total daily visits among birds was 70x greater than the variation within birds, indicating large, consistent differences in the extent that individual chickadees used feeders. Individual birds were also variable in the number of feeders they used. Of the 21 feeders that were available during our study, individual birds used an average of 4.5 feeders (
   <span class="italic">SD</span> = 2.2, range = 1–9 feeders).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approximately 93% of the tagged individuals that returned to feeders eventually visited the feeder at which they were captured, and 50 of our tagged birds (71%) visited only 2–4 feeders during the entire study period (Figure 
   <a rid="ece34902-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34902-fig-0003">3</a>). No matter how many feeders were visited by individuals across the season, the average proportion of visits to the feeder visited most often was always greater than what would be expected if birds evenly distributed their visits across the feeders they used (Figure 
   <a rid="ece34902-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34902-fig-0003">3</a>); thus, individuals appeared to favor some feeders over others. Although individuals varied markedly in body mass at initial capture (9.1–12.5 g), size‐adjusted body mass (i.e., with tarsus length fitted as a covariate) was unrelated to either average total daily visits (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found strong support for an effect of the hour since sunrise on total hourly visits compared to the null model (∆AIC = 490.8). Total hourly visits rapidly increased after sunrise, peaked during 3–5 hr after sunrise, and then gradually decreased until sunset (Figure 
   <a rid="ece34902-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34902-fig-0005">5</a>). We detected an effect of photoperiod on mean total daily visits such that they differed between the pre‐ and postsolstice periods (Table 
   <a rid="ece34902-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34902-tbl-0001">1</a>). In particular, estimated mean total daily visits decreased by 1.4 visits (95% CI: 1.0, 1.9) as photoperiod decreased from the start of our study to the winter solstice, and mean total daily visits decreased by 1.5 visits (95% CI: 1.1, 2.0) as photoperiod increased after the solstice until the end of our study (Figure 
   <a rid="ece34902-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34902-fig-0006">6</a>). Thus, mean daily visits continued to decline over time during our study despite the reversal in photoperiod after the winter solstice. The estimated mean total daily visits prior to the solstice decreased by 18% (95% CI: −21, 2) for every 1 hr of decrease in photoperiod up until the winter solstice, after which estimated mean total daily visits decreased by 9% (95% CI: −16, 2) for every 1 hr of increase in photoperiod. In contrast to an effect of photoperiod, we found no support for an influence of 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>min</sub>, wind speed, or precipitation on total hourly visits, or for weather variables occurring in combination (Table 
   <a rid="ece34902-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34902-tbl-0001">1</a>); 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>min</sub>, wind speed, and precipitation were each estimated to change the estimated mean daily feeder visits by a factor of 1.0 (95% CI: [0.99, 1.00] for all 3 variables). Thus, we found no evidence that weather variables were linked to our measure of daily feeder use. During our study average daily 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>min</sub> was 2.1°C, average daily wind speed was 8.7 km/hr, and average daily precipitation was 6.6 mm, all of which were similar to 30 years averages (i.e., 1.9°C, 7.4 km/hr, and 5.2 mm, respectively).
