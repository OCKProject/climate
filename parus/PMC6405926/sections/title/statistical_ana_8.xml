 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To address the relationship between feeder use and our focal variables, we computed two response variables for each PIT‐tagged bird. For the first response variable, we calculated the number of visits made to all feeders on each day that an individual visited at least one feeder during the study period (October 23, 2016–March 31, 2017), hereafter termed “total daily visits.” We used this metric to assess how feeder use varied between individual chickadees and quantify the extent to which it was linked to weather variables. To quantify individual‐level variation in feeder use, we summarized the distribution of total daily visits for each bird and the number of feeders visited across the season for each bird, using variance estimates of random effects to quantify the ratio of among‐bird variation to within‐bird variation from our statistical model.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess how weather variables were linked to feeder use, we undertook a modeling approach to assess how mean total daily visits were associated with 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>min</sub>, wind speed, precipitation, and photoperiod. Exploratory analysis of data prior to modeling found that the general pattern of response was similar among individual birds; however, the magnitude of the response exhibited large variation, so we included a random effect for each bird in all models. Because total daily visits were measured on multiple days for each bird, we graphically assessed the temporal autocorrelation function of residuals in each of our single‐variable models and found that a first‐order autoregressive model had the best fit for the temporal autocorrelation among total daily visits. We found that mean total daily visits were best modeled with a negative binomial distribution allowing for overdispersion. In addition, our initial graphical assessment of total daily visits relative to weather variables found that mean total daily visits varied differently before and after the winter solstice. Thus, we investigated whether effects of environmental variables differed between the pre‐solstice period when photoperiod was decreasing, and the postsolstice period when photoperiod was increasing. We fit generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) using the glmmTMB package (Magnusson et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0048">2017</a>) in R version 3.4.0 (R Core Team, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0061">2017</a>), and we used Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) statistics to rank the degree of support for each regression model. We calculated AIC weights and evidence ratios for our models of mean total daily visits (Burnham, Anderson, &amp; Huyvaert, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0012">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We regressed total daily visits on 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>min</sub>, wind speed, precipitation, photoperiod, and an indicator variable for the postsolstice period. In an effort to evaluate a small but meaningful set of potential models (Burnham et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0012">2011</a>), we fit three models for each weather variable. We fit a model that contained only the weather variable, a second model that contained the weather variable and the interaction of the weather variable and the postsolstice indicator, and a third model that contained the weather variable, the interaction of the weather variable and our postsolstice indicator, and all remaining weather variables. We also fit a null model that contained no weather variables.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a two‐step process to evaluate the influence of weather variables. First, we compared the first and second model to the null model to evaluate the association between the weather variable and the response variable, and whether the slope of the association differed before and after the solstice. We concluded that the relationship differed before and after the solstice if the AIC for the 2nd model was two or more units less than the AIC for the first model and the null model. If the AIC for the first model was two or more units less than the AIC for the second model and for the null model, we concluded that the relationship was similar before and after the solstice. We concluded that there was no support for the weather variable if the AIC for the null model was two or more units less than the AIC for the first and second models, or if the AIC for the null model was within 2 AIC units of the model with the lowest AIC. In step two, we compared the third model to the model with the smallest AIC in the first step to evaluate whether the weather variables, in combination with each other, were associated with the response variable. We concluded that weather variables were needed in combination if the AIC from model three was 2 or more AIC units less than the AIC from the best‐supported model in step 1.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For our second response variable, we summed the number of visits made to all feeders during each hour since sunrise for each day from November 9, 2016 through January 31, 2017, hereafter termed “total hourly visits.” We restricted this analysis to this period because day length during this period varied minimally (8.8–9.8 hr) and resulted in the shortest foraging days for chickadees during our study. As above, we used a Poisson GLMM with the glmmTMB package (Magnusson et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0048">2017</a>) in R version 3.4.0 (R Core Team, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0061">2017</a>) to quantify the relationship between the mean total hourly visits and hour since sunrise. We included the number of days each bird visited any feeder within each hour since sunrise as an offset in the model to adjust for the varying number of days an individual bird visited during each hour of the day. We graphically assessed the autocorrelation function of residuals and used AIC statistics to identify the best‐supported autocorrelation structure. We found the relationship between total hourly visits and time since sunrise was concave but asymmetrical, suggesting that a linear or quadratic relationship between mean total hourly visits and time since sunrise would have been a poor fit, and a cubic relationship with multiple changes of slope did not occur. Therefore, we treated hour since sunrise as a categorical variable in the regression model and used AIC as a measure of the support for this variable.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For analyses pertaining to individual variation, we report averages and their associated standard deviations (SDs); for analyses pertaining to variation due to time (time since sunrise, photoperiod) or weather (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>min</sub>, wind speed, precipitation), we report the rate at which the mean total daily visits changed with changes in time or weather (slope) and the associated 95% confidence interval. The sample size for all analyses is
