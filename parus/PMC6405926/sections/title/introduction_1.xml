 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wild animals can be provided with anthropogenic food incidentally, through waste generated by population centers, food production facilities, or agricultural production, or purposefully through direct provisioning of food resources (reviewed by Oro, Genovart, Tavecchia, Fowler, &amp; Martínez‐Abraín, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0055">2013</a>). In many parts of the world, purposeful provisioning of food to wild animals is a widespread and growing activity that has given rise to a global wildlife feeding industry (Galbraith et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0030">2014</a>; Jones &amp; Reynolds, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0038">2008</a>). In the United States alone, for example, more than 53 million people report feeding wildlife around their homes with the great majority (95%) providing food for wild birds. This results in approximately US $5 billion per year spent on bird seed and bird feeding accessories, which represents a doubling in just the last two decades (USFWS, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0072">1991</a>, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0073">2011</a>). More broadly, up to 75% of households in industrialized nations are thought to regularly feed wild animals (Cowie &amp; Hinsley, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0017">1988</a>; Davies, Fuller, Dallimer, Loram, &amp; Gaston, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0021">2012</a>; Galbraith et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0030">2014</a>), making food supplementation of wildlife, particularly birds, a widespread and global phenomenon.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the scale at which it occurs, purposeful feeding of wild animals has the potential for widespread consequences for natural populations. It is well known that food resources underlie many demographic processes (Fischer &amp; Miller, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0028">2015</a>; Robb, McDonald, Chamberlain, &amp; Bearhop, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0062">2008</a>), and that populations can increase when natural diets are supplemented with regular, predictable anthropogenic food sources (Oro et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0055">2013</a>). Empirical studies have found that supplemental feeding of wild bird populations can alter foraging effort, territoriality, and the phenology of reproductive behaviors (Robb, McDonald, Chamberlain, Reynolds et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0063">2008</a>), and supplemental food has also been linked to increases in individual survival (Brittingham &amp; Temple, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0008">1988</a>; Jansson, Ekman, &amp; Bromssen, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0036">1981</a>; Orell, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0054">1989</a>) and improved condition (Desrochers &amp; Turcotte, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0024">2008</a>; Grubb &amp; Cimprich, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0033">1990</a>; Wilcoxen et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0075">2015</a>). Conversely, supplemental feeding can exert negative effects on populations that include increased disease transmission rates (Adelman, Moyers, Farine, &amp; Hawley, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0001">2015</a>; Becker, Streicker, &amp; Altizer, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0002">2015</a>), promotion of feeder dependency (Robb, McDonald, Chamberlain, &amp; Bearhop, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0062">2008</a>), and a reduction in health via provisioning of nutrient‐poor foods (Jones &amp; Reynolds, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0038">2008</a>). Furthermore, supplemental feeding has also been linked to evolutionary changes in morphology (Bosse et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0007">2017</a>; Rolshausen, Segelbacher, Hobson, &amp; Schaefer, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0064">2009</a>) and seasonal migration patterns (Plummer, Siriwardena, Conway, Risely, &amp; Tomas, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0057">2015</a>), highlighting how intentionally provisioned food can lead to pronounced evolutionary changes in wild populations. Therefore, it is clear that intentional feeding of wildlife has the potential to influence wild populations in myriad ways, with both positive and negative consequences.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the potential for intentional feeding to impact demographic and evolutionary processes, investigations that assess use of supplemental feeders by songbirds—the group most commonly targeted for intentional feeding—are surprisingly rare. For those studies that have quantified use of supplemental food, the great majority have been conducted in regions with continental climates that are characterized by cold winters with extensive snow cover and temperatures below freezing (Bonter, Zuckerberg, Sedgwick, &amp; Hochachka, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0006">2013</a>; Cooper &amp; Sonsthagen, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0016">2007</a>; Kessel, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0040">1976</a>; Lima, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0046">1985</a>; Wilson, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0076">2001</a>). Several studies have found that feeder use by songbirds in midwinter, when ambient temperatures reach seasonal lows and foraging time is constrained by short photoperiods, generally increased throughout the day until sharply declining as sunset approached and individuals moved to roost sites (Bonter et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0006">2013</a>; Monus &amp; Barta, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0050">2016</a>). Feeder use by songbirds in continental climates has also been found to increase with decreasing ambient temperature (Bonter et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0006">2013</a>; Chaplin, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0015">1976</a>; Zuckerberg et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0080">2011</a>), and decrease with increasing wind speed (Kessel, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0040">1976</a>; Kubota &amp; Nakamura, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0043">2000</a>), with both patterns thought to be driven by the energetic needs of birds in winter (Bednekoff &amp; Houston, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0003">1994</a>; McNamara, Houston, &amp; Lima, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0049">1994</a>). Although these findings have help establish our understanding of how wild birds make use of supplemental food, it is important to note that recreational bird feeding is not restricted to regions with continental climates but is instead practiced over a much broader area. For example, bird feeding is popular in many areas of the United States that are snow‐free and experience milder, nonfreezing temperatures during the winter (Horn &amp; Johansen, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0034">2013</a>; Horn, Johansen, &amp; Wilcoxen, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0035">2014</a>; 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://feederwatch.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://feederwatch.org/</span>). Given the strong influence of local environmental conditions on feeder use demonstrated by previous investigations, particularly weather (Bonter et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0006">2013</a>; Grubb, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0032">1978</a>; Kessel, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0040">1976</a>; Tryjanowski et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0071">2015</a>), the findings from studies conducted in continental climates may generalize poorly to regions with warmer climates. Therefore, new studies are needed that evaluate recreational feeder use under different environmental conditions experienced by songbirds during the winter season.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, our goal was to quantify patterns of supplemental feeder use by wild, free‐ranging Black‐capped Chickadees (
  <span class="italic">Poecile atricapillus</span>, hereafter chickadee) during winter in a Mediterranean climate. Such climates are characterized by mild, rainy winters with no regular snow cover and temperatures above freezing (Kottek, Grieser, Beck, Rudolf, &amp; Rubel, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0042">2006</a>) and therefore offer a strong contrast to the winter conditions typical of continental climates. In particular, evaluating supplemental feeder use in Mediterranean climates allows for winter conditions in which to test theoretical predictions that stem from the starvation–predation trade‐off. Small birds, such as the chickadee we studied (10–14 g, Foote, Mennill, Ratcliffe, &amp; Smith, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0029">2010</a>), experience energetically challenging conditions that require them to maintain adequate energetic reserves to survive long, cold nights in winter, yet carrying additional reserves bears a cost because greater reserves can reduce maneuverability when escaping from predators (Bednekoff &amp; Houston, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0003">1994</a>; Lima, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0047">1986</a>; McNamara et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0049">1994</a>). This means that individuals must maintain energetic reserves that prevent starvation, but they must also balance the risk of starvation against the risk of being captured by predators. When both conditions are important for winter survival, the daily foraging pattern is expected to be bimodal, with greater foraging activity early in the day (to recover reserves used overnight) and late in the day prior to roosting (to build reserves for the subsequent night); lower levels of feeding are expected during the remaining daylight hours (Bednekoff &amp; Houston, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0003">1994</a>; McNamara et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0049">1994</a>). To date, empirical tests of this idea have been largely intractable because obtaining extensive, fine‐scale foraging records of individuals has been impossible. However, recent advances in animal tagging, namely the use of uniquely numbered passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags coupled with bird feeders equipped with radio frequency identification (RFID) data loggers that record visits of individual birds, have allowed researchers to quantify individual feeder use to a degree that was not possible in the past (Brittingham &amp; Temple, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0010">1992</a>; Van Buskirk &amp; Smith, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0074">1989</a>). These new techniques provide an especially valuable opportunity to evaluate relationships between feeder use and local environmental conditions throughout winter, including testing theoretical predictions regarding starvation–predation trade‐offs in wild, free‐ranging birds (e.g., Bonter et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0006">2013</a>; Pitera, Branch, Bridge, &amp; Pravosudov, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0056">2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we attached PIT tags to individual chickadees and monitored their use of bird feeders equipped RFID data loggers to assess how feeder use varied in three distinct ways. First, we quantified the extent to which individuals differed in feeder use across the winter season, as how often individuals make use of supplemental food likely reflects individual variation in behavior and physiology. Differences in behavioral and physiological traits of individuals are widespread in nature (Biro &amp; Stamps, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0004">2010</a>; Careau &amp; Garland, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0013">2012</a>; Careau, Thomas, Humphries, &amp; Reale, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0014">2008</a>; Koolhaas et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0041">1999</a>; Sih, Cote, Evans, Fogarty, &amp; Pruitt, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0069">2012</a>) and can drive population‐level changes (Wolf &amp; Weissing, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0077">2012</a>), yet we have only a limited understanding of individual‐level use of supplemental feeders during winter when food resources and foraging time are expected to be most limiting. Second, we quantified how patterns of feeder use varied temporally on both short (i.e., hourly) and long (i.e., seasonal) timescales. Following theoretical work, we predicted that feeder use would be bimodal with visitation peaks concentrated early in the morning and late in the day, with reduced feeding rates throughout the rest of daylight hours (Bednekoff &amp; Houston, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0003">1994</a>; McNamara et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0049">1994</a>). We also predicted that individuals would increase feeder use as photoperiod decreased until the point of the winter solstice (i.e., shortest day of the year with respect to light), and would then decrease as day length increased (Bonter et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0006">2013</a>). Third, we examined whether several environmental variables known to influence feeder use in colder climates were linked to feeder use in our study system. We examined minimum daily ambient temperature because birds require more food at lower temperatures to maintain homeostasis (Grossman &amp; West, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0031">1977</a>; Kessel, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0040">1976</a>; Sharbaugh, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0067">2001</a>) and because feeder use generally increases as ambient temperature decreases (Bonter et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0006">2013</a>); here, we predicted that birds would increase feeder use as daily minimum ambient temperatures decreased (Bonter et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0006">2013</a>). Chickadees are known to seek shelter and delay their first appearance to feeders under windy conditions in some climates (Kessel, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0040">1976</a>), so we also quantified the effects of maximum daily wind speeds on feeder use, predicting that individuals would decrease feeder use within increasing wind speeds (Grubb, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0032">1978</a>; Kessel, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0040">1976</a>). Finally, we assessed feeder use relative to precipitation, predicting that birds would decrease use of feeders as precipitation increased following previous work (Zuckerberg et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0080">2011</a>).
