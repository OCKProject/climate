 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study found that chickadees exhibited extensive variation in their use of bird feeders across the nonbreeding season. It is well known that individual organisms typically vary in their individual behavior (Koolhaas et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0041">1999</a>; Sih et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0069">2012</a>), and therefore, behaviorally mediated differences are likely to underlie the patterns we observed in our study. For example, individuals that are bolder in their exploration of their environment are also more likely to engage in high‐risk activities (Koolhaas et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0041">1999</a>; Sih et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0069">2012</a>). Such individuals may frequent bird feeders more often, which could be considered risky environments given that feeders concentrate songbird feeding activities and can serve to attract predators (Lima, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0046">1985</a>; Dunn &amp; Tessaglia, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0025">1994</a>; but see Roth, Vetter, &amp; Lima, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0066">2008</a>). Additionally, individual variation in physiology, particularly energetic expenditure (Biro &amp; Stamps, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0004">2010</a>; Careau &amp; Garland, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0013">2012</a>; Careau et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0014">2008</a>), could also have underlain the substantial individual‐level variation in feeder use we detected. Thus, the pronounced individual differences in feeder use we observed may not be particularly surprising; however, the magnitude of the variation was rather unexpected, considering that some individual chickadees limited their use of feeders to a few visits each day, whereas others visited feeders several hundred times in a given day. Such stark differences in individual use of feeders are consistent with recent work on chickadees (Latimer et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0045">2018</a>) as well two closely related species, the Great Tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) and Blue Tit (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>; Crates et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0019">2016</a>). That this pattern was detected across three closely related species (Johansson et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0037">2013</a>) leads us to suspect that such variation might be typical of members of the Paridae, and that additional studies of more distantly related species using PIT‐tagged individuals and RFID‐equipped feeders will show this pattern of feeder use is prevalent in other groups. Given our study is one of the first to provide quantitative estimates of months‐long individual variation in use of feeders by wild songbirds during winter, future studies should build upon this work by using an experimental approach to evaluate putative mechanisms that may explain why individuals differed in their feeder use patterns, including the fitness consequences of such differences (see Crates et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0019">2016</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis of the fat content of sunflower seeds indicated that an individual chickadee would require approximately 70 feeder visits each day to meet all of its daily energy requirements, assuming that chickadees acquire a single sunflower seed during each feeder visit (Ficken et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0027">1990</a>; Smith, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0070">1991</a>). This is a conservative estimate, so it was surprising that approximately 10% of our tagged birds averaged &gt;70 feeder visits per day when evaluated across our entire study period, with a substantial number of individuals at times visiting feeders &gt;200 times per day! In addition, we found that daily feeder use decreased across the winter season (i.e., both before and after the winter solstice), and was not solely driven by daylength. Both of these results are consistent with prior work that has found that chickadees cache food, and that caching behavior is most pronounced in the fall and decreases as winter progresses (Brodin, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0011">2005</a>; Sherry &amp; Hoshooley, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0068">2007</a>; Smith, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0070">1991</a>). In a natural setting (i.e., without provisioning of supplemental food), this pattern may be due to a reduction in seeds produced during the growing season that typify the food items that are cached by chickadees (Brodin, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0011">2005</a>; Foote et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0029">2010</a>), or simply to an adequate number of caches prepared by birds in fall for future use. Our finding of what appears to be surplus feeder visits being maintained in a Mediterranean climate offers a notable contrast to the idea that energetically demanding environments result in stronger selection pressure for caching behavior (Croston et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0020">2016</a>; Pravosudov &amp; Roth, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0059">2013</a>; Pravosudov, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0060">2007</a>). These findings also suggest that control over food‐caching may operate independently of local environmental conditions, and they indicate that more work on this topic is needed, especially around understanding the drivers of food‐caching during conditions when predictable, supplemental food is available (Pitera et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0056">2018</a>; Pravosudov, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0060">2007</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the pronounced individual variation in feeder use in our study, we did not detect a strong relationship between feeder visitation by chickadees and several weather‐related variables (i.e., minimum daily ambient temperature, wind speed, and precipitation) that has been found in previous studies within continental climates. Our findings regarding temperature are concordant with results from use of feeders by chickadees in Maine, USA (45°N), where feeder use was found to be unaffected by ambient temperature despite markedly colder conditions than those in our study area (i.e., lows to −18°C; Wilson, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0076">2001</a>). In contrast, chickadees in Wisconsin, USA (43°N; Latimer et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0045">2018</a>) and interior Alaska, USA (64°N; Kessel, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0040">1976</a>) increased their use of feeders with decreasing ambient temperatures. Given that ambient temperature is expected to have a strong influence on chickadee metabolic rate (Olson, Cooper, Swanson, Braun, &amp; Williams, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0053">2010</a>) and, in turn, the extent to which supplemental food is used, some factor(s) other than temperature appears to be driving the previously identified relationships between feeder use and temperature. Characteristics of the areas where birds were sampled may be one such factor which could relate to alternative food resources, predator populations, or the quality of local habitats (Latimer et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0045">2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chickadees in our study followed a distinct pattern of daily feeder use during the shortest days of the year, increasing their use of feeders sharply after sunrise, with a plateau around mid‐day, followed by a gradual decrease until sunset. Theoretical models of optimal foraging posit that small birds should feed in a bimodal pattern, with heavy bouts of foraging in the morning and late in the day prior to roosting, with lower levels throughout the rest of the day (Bednekoff &amp; Houston, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0003">1994</a>; McNamara et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0049">1994</a>). We predicted that would be the case with chickadees, but this was not supported by the daily pattern of feeder use by birds in our study system. One explanation is that weather conditions experienced by chickadees in our study area were insufficient to impose strong energetic challenges that would lead to predicted patterns of feeder visits. For example, work in a continental climate (Wisconsin, USA) found the lowest number of chickadees visiting feeders in the morning, and the highest feeding rates as sunset approached, with the latter possibly allowing birds to maximize energetic intake before nighttime roosting (Brittingham &amp; Temple, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0010">1992</a>). Feeder use for chickadees gradually increased throughout the day in another continental climate (New York, USA), with an increase two hours prior to sunset and a sharp decrease in the hour before sunset (Bonter et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0006">2013</a>). These winter climates are markedly different from our system, where milder overnight temperatures would not require individuals to build up as extensive energy reserves for surviving the night. Thus, birds in our system may postpone body mass gain until later in the day to minimize predation risk while also reducing the energetic costs associated with carrying extra fat reserves for overnight survival (Farine &amp; Lang, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0026">2013</a>; Lima, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0047">1986</a>; McNamara et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0049">1994</a>; Polo, Carrascal, &amp; Metcalfe, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0058">2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shorter nights in lower latitude Mediterranean climates could increase the amount of time in a day available for foraging, such that birds may be able to distribute feeder use throughout the day differently than birds in higher latitude regions with continental climates. However, that did not appear to be the case in our study, as the latitude of our study site was generally comparable to several previous studies in continental climates and thus photoperiods should have been similar. This instead suggests that differences in energetic costs may be more important in driving patterns of feeder use. Regardless of the underlying mechanism(s), variation in the diurnal pattern of feeder use across regions suggests that small birds regulate their energy intake based on local conditions. In line with this, recent work in the closely related Mountain Chickadee (
  <span class="italic">P. gambeli</span>) found differences in visitation patterns to supplemental feeders whereby more visits were made early in the day when environmental conditions were harsher at higher elevation sites relative to lower elevation sites where visits were spread more evenly across daylight hours (Pitera et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0056">2018</a>). This pattern was thought to be due to a greater risk of starvation at sites with more severe winter weather such that individuals at those locations would benefit from foraging more frequently throughout the day with activity periods concentrated shortly after sunrise and prior to sunset (Roth &amp; Pravosudov, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0065">2009</a>). Of note, the low elevation sites studied by Pitera et al. (
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0056">2018</a>) presented more challenging weather conditions that those in our study, yet the daily pattern of foraging was similar to what we observed. Thus, there may be a point at which feeding activity throughout the diurnal cycle shifts from an inverted U‐shaped distribution under less challenging conditions—as observed in this study—to a bimodal distribution under more challenging environmental conditions (Bednekoff &amp; Houston, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0003">1994</a>; McNamara et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0049">1994</a>). If true, this helps to reconcile theoretical predictions with the observations we recorded in Oregon for chickadees relative to other parts of their range (New York; Bonter et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0006">2013</a>; Wisconsin: Brittingham &amp; Temple, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0010">1992</a>), as well as the differences reported for Mountain Chickadee populations that experienced different environmental conditions during winter (Pitera et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0056">2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted our work in a setting where recreational bird feeders (i.e., feeders that were not part of our study) may have been used by our PIT‐tagged birds; however, we find that this possibility, if true, was unlikely to exert a strong influence on our results. First, all of our study feeders were placed on agricultural lands owned by Oregon State University, and therefore, few of our feeders were placed near residential homes; instead, the closest buildings were university‐owned buildings that had a low likelihood of harboring recreational feeders. Second, we found no relationship between the number of visits that birds made to our feeders and the distance to the nearest building. If recreational feeders were present at nearby buildings and reduced feeder visits by tagged birds in our study, we would have expected a relationship where the number of feeder visits would decline as distance to building decreased. That we found no evidence of such a relationship suggests that nearby buildings—assuming that they harbored recreational feeders—did not serve to influence birds visiting our feeders. Finally, all of our study feeders were located within 3.2 km of one another, and chickadees displaced from winter flocks can move up to 2.8 km in a single 24‐hr period (Odum, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0052">1941</a>). Moreover, winter flocks of chickadees can exhibit extensive overlap of wintering foraging areas (Desrochers &amp; Hannon, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0023">1989</a>), so tagged chickadees in our study theoretically could have traversed much of our study area during the 5‐month period when we monitored feeder visits. If true, all tagged birds would have likely been exposed to the same pool of recreational feeders such that any influence of recreational feeders would be extended to all tagged birds. This means that visits to recreational feeders by tagged birds would not have introduced any systematic bias into our study but instead would have resulted in more conservative estimates of feeder use. Based on these points, we conclude that recreational feeders were unlikely to have a strong effect on our results, if they were indeed present and used by our tagged chickadees.
