 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the amount of potential energy that chickadees acquired from feeders, we had extraction analysis performed by the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University on a haphazardly selected sample (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 20) of hulled black oil sunflower seeds taken from the pool of seeds used in feeders in our study. Initially, the sample was separated into two equal groups (i.e., 10 seeds) and analysis took place on a 0.2 g sample of dried and ground sunflower seeds from each group. Next, samples were combined with 4 ml 50% MeOH:H
  <sub>2</sub>O with 1% HCl, and 450 µl 17:1 of FFA IS2, an internal standard added to all samples to aid with quantitation. After 10 min of vortexing and sonication, 4 ml of chloroform was added, followed by a second 10‐min vortex and sonicate session, and then centrifuged 10 min at 1,000 G. After saving the lower layer, the upper layer was re‐extracted in the same manner as above. The lower layer was then combined with the re‐extracted upper layer, and a 3 ml 0.88% KCl solution was added, followed by 5 min of vortexing and sonication, then centrifuged 10 min at 2,000 G to achieve phase separation. The upper layer was removed and discarded, chloroform:MeOH 2:1 was added, the sample was dried under N
  <sub>2</sub>, and then the extracted lipids were weighed. The lipid extraction yielded an average of 0.26 kcal of fat per seed.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify how many black oil sunflower seeds a chickadee would require to fulfill its daily energy requirements, we assumed that chickadees required 65.5 kJ of energy/day (Karasov, Brittingham, &amp; Temple, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0039">1992</a>), that the rate of metabolizable energy from a sunflower seed was 0.865 (Wu, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0078">2018</a>), that lipids were the primary energy source individuals obtained from sunflower seeds, and that individuals only consumed sunflower seeds to obtain energy. Using our empirical estimates of fat content, we determined that an individual chickadee required approximately 70 sunflower seeds/day to cover its entire daily energy expenditure (DEE). Given that chickadees do not subsist on seeds alone in the winter (Smith, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0070">1991</a>) and that previous estimates of energy use were taken from locations with lower ambient temperatures than those of our study site (Karasov et al., 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0039">1992</a>), our estimate of 70 seeds/day is likely to be an upper limit of what an individual bird in our study population would need to consume in a single day during the course of our study.
