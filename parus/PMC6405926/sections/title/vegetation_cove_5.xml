To do this, we established a 20‐m radius circle that was centered at each feeder, and within each circle, we visually estimated the proportion that was covered by vegetation in the tree layer (&gt;3 m above the ground), shrub layer (0.5–3.0 m), and herbaceous layer (&lt;0.5 m). When multiple vegetation layers occurred, we measured vegetation closest to the ground first and then calculated the percentage for the next higher layer by subtracting the lower layer's measurement from the percent of ground surface covered by this next vertical layer. We used these data to identify differential use of feeders due to the presence of escape cover; however, we found no relationship between the extent of feeder use and vegetation cover (
