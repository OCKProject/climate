 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 160 days that feeders were available to chickadees, individuals visited feeders an average of 103 days (
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 47.7, range = 2–160) which equated to 66% of the study period. Over the course of the study, the number of visits to any single feeder by an individual bird ranged from 1 to 15,512, and individuals averaged 4–9,831 visits per feeder (mean = 1,454, 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 1,269). We found substantial variability in total daily visits among individual chickadees, with an average of 44 visits/day (
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 46.3, range = 1–406 visits/day; Figure 
  <a rid="ece34902-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34902-fig-0002">2</a>). Of note, the variation in total daily visits among birds was 70x greater than the variation within birds, indicating large, consistent differences in the extent that individual chickadees used feeders. Individual birds were also variable in the number of feeders they used. Of the 21 feeders that were available during our study, individual birds used an average of 4.5 feeders (
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 2.2, range = 1–9 feeders).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approximately 93% of the tagged individuals that returned to feeders eventually visited the feeder at which they were captured, and 50 of our tagged birds (71%) visited only 2–4 feeders during the entire study period (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34902-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34902-fig-0003">3</a>). No matter how many feeders were visited by individuals across the season, the average proportion of visits to the feeder visited most often was always greater than what would be expected if birds evenly distributed their visits across the feeders they used (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34902-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34902-fig-0003">3</a>); thus, individuals appeared to favor some feeders over others. Although individuals varied markedly in body mass at initial capture (9.1–12.5 g), size‐adjusted body mass (i.e., with tarsus length fitted as a covariate) was unrelated to either average total daily visits (

   <p>Average proportion of visits to the most‐visited, second‐most‐visited, and third‐most‐visited feeders for chickadees visiting multiple feeders during our study; sample sizes for each group are listed above each bar. Black horizontal lines within each bar indicate the expected proportion of visits if birds used all feeders equally. Because the proportions in each vertical bar are averages taken over birds, the sum of all proportions within each bar does not equal 100% for groups with 4–9 feeders used. The light gray portion of each bar indicates the largest observed proportion of feeder visits for each group</p>
