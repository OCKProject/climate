 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained weather data recorded at the Corvallis Municipal Airport in Corvallis, OR (44°33′N, 123°15′W) by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NCEI, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0051">2017</a>) for each day during which we quantified chickadee feeder use. The weather station was located within 9 km of all feeders, and we assumed it to be representative of local conditions experienced at those feeder locations. We selected variables known to influence feeder use from prior studies which included: minimum daily ambient temperature (°C, hereafter

  <sub>min</sub>), average daily wind speed (km/hr, hereafter wind speed), and total daily precipitation (mm, hereafter precipitation). In addition, we obtained sunrise and sunset times for the location of the weather station from the Astronomical Applications Department of the U.S. Naval Observatory (Department of Defense, 
  <a rid="ece34902-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34902-bib-0022">2011</a>) and calculated photoperiod length by subtracting sunrise time from sunset time for each day during which we quantified chickadee feeder use (hereafter photoperiod). For analysis, we binned photoperiod into 1‐hr blocks across the daylight period. When a feeder visit occurred in the hour before sunrise, we assigned it to 0 with respect to the hour from sunrise; when a feeder visit occurred ≥1 hr from sunrise, we considered the hour since sunrise to be 1, with the same approach taken for successive hour increments.
