  <p>Estimated mean total daily feeder visits (solid line, left vertical axis) by PIT‐tagged Black‐capped Chickadees as a function of photoperiod based on a generalized linear mixed model. Solid vertical line denotes winter solstice. Dashed line is length of photoperiod in hours (right vertical axis). Prior to the solstice, feeder use rates decreased as photoperiod decreased, and feeder use continued to decrease after the solstice as photoperiod increased</p>
