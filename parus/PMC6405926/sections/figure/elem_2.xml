  <p>Average proportion of visits to the most‐visited, second‐most‐visited, and third‐most‐visited feeders for chickadees visiting multiple feeders during our study; sample sizes for each group are listed above each bar. Black horizontal lines within each bar indicate the expected proportion of visits if birds used all feeders equally. Because the proportions in each vertical bar are averages taken over birds, the sum of all proportions within each bar does not equal 100% for groups with 4–9 feeders used. The light gray portion of each bar indicates the largest observed proportion of feeder visits for each group</p>
