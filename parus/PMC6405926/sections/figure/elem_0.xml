  <p>Example of a supplemental feeder used in this study to quantify feeder use by Black‚Äêcapped Chickadees in a Mediterranean climate in Corvallis, Oregon, USA. The light blue PIT tag is evident on the chickadee's left leg, but the aluminum leg band and colored plastic leg band on the bird's right leg is out of sight in this image. Note that the wire mesh trap attached to the feeder for capturing birds has been removed in this photograph for clarity</p>
