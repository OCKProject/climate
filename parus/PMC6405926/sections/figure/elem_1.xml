  <p>(a) Boxplots of total daily feeder visits for each Black‐capped Chickadee (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 70) in our study from October 23, 2016–March 31, 2017 ranked from lowest number of total daily feeder visits to highest number of total daily feeder visits. The vertical dashed line represents the approximate number of visits required if an individual obtained all its daily energy from our feeders. (b) Summed total daily feeder visits for each chickadee. Vertical ordering of chickadees is the same as panel (a). The vertical dashed line represents the approximate number of seeds required if an individual received all its daily energy from feeders for the entire length of the study
