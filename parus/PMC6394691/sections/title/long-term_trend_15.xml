 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amount of reserves (BM
  <sub>std</sub>) in blue tits increased over the study years, in contrast to the other two species. Blue tits may be more sensitive to a changing climate. Because they are subdominant in heterospecific flocks, they may now, with warmer winters, be able to reach higher levels of fat reserves. Furthermore, there was a long-term trend among all three species in BMR
  <sub>std</sub>. However, while the BMR intensity in great tits increased over the studied period, it decreased in blue and willow tits. A long-term decrease in BMR intensity may reflect a selective disadvantage of having a high metabolic rate when winters become increasingly warmer, particularly for subdominant species, as previously shown in blue tits (Nilsson and Nilsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2016</a>). Nevertheless, interpreting sources for inter-annual variation is complicated since several factors may impinge on the individual condition during other life-history episodes that will affect future winter performance as carry-over effects (Harrison et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2011</a>). Particularly, when considering pronounced physiological adjustments as those involved in changing BMR
  <sub>abs</sub> and BMR
  <sub>std</sub>, carry-over effects are likely to be more substantial, e.g., oxidative damage and telomere shortening (Monaghan and Haussmann 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2006</a>; Isaksson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2011</a>) than those derived from internal reserve adjustments (BM
  <sub>std</sub>) (Harrison et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2011</a>).
