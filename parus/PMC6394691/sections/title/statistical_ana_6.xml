 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used general linear mixed models to explain the seasonal variation in BM and BMR in the three species of titmice. Great tits and blue tits originated from two distinct populations differing in winter environmental conditions (Broggi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2004</a>). Hence, locality (Lund or Oulu) was included as a fixed factor in analyses involving great and blue tits. We first tested differences between populations in the relation between BM and BMR. Afterwards, we incorporated individual variables such as sex as a categorical predictor, and age (1 = 1st winter; 2 = older than 1st winter; 3 = 2nd winter, etc.) and body size (tarsus length) as continuous predictors (Senar and Pascual 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">1997</a>). The environmental variables included were year of study (winter 1999–2000 = 1), date (October 1st = 1), average minimum temperature of previous month, week and day of capture (°C) (hereafter month, week and day MT). First-order interactions between locality, sex and the other variables were included in the full models. Additionally, date squared was included as a predictor variable to test for non-linear effects of season i.e., date.

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two sets of models were fitted for each dependent variable: BM and BMR. First, full models were analyzed singly, without considering BMR and BM as covariates (hereafter BM
  <sub>abs</sub> and BMR
  <sub>abs</sub>). Second, the same full models were fitted with the incorporation of BMR as covariate in the BM model, and BM in the BMR model (hereafter BM
  <sub>std</sub> and BMR
  <sub>std,</sub> respectively). Models were estimated by REML and individual was included as a random factor. We used the autoregressive covariance structure and estimated DF by the Satterthwhite method. The full model was reduced in a backward step-wise manner according to the highest 
  <span class="italic">p</span> value starting with the interactions, and AIC (Akaike’s information criterion) was used to choose when to stop the step-wise elimination process. Sequential reintroduction of each eliminated main effect back into the final model never improved the fit (as determined by AIC). Final models are presented in tables together with the corresponding AIC values, and the 
  <span class="italic">F</span> values, DF and 
  <span class="italic">p</span> values corresponding to each predictor. Parameter estimates ± SE are provided for continuous predictors. Full models and parameters removed are presented with the corresponding values when removed from the model (ESM). All 
  <span class="italic">p</span> values are two-tailed. All continuous variables fulfilled the requirements of normality.
