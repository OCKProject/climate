 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed BM and BMR in 660 individuals belonging to three titmice species from two different populations, Oulu (Finland) (65°N, 25°30′E) and Lund (Sweden) (55°40′N, 13°25′E). BMR from all individuals was measured throughout the night and the next morning they were released at the point of capture. Many individuals were captured more than once and re-measured (up to six times both within and among winters) totaling 822 measurements. Free living great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) and willow tits (
  <span class="italic">Poecile montanus</span>) were captured and measured near Oulu from winter 1999–2000 until winter 2005–2006. Birds were captured at dusk during the non-breeding season by baited funnel traps in Oulu (182 great tits, 29 blue tits and 35 willow tit individuals). Free living great and blue tits from Lund were captured after dusk while roosting in nestboxes from winter 1999–2000 until winter 2006–2007 (159 great tits and 255 blue tit individuals). All birds were captured within 2 h before and after sunset. Willow tits are absent from the Lund region and, therefore, could not be included in the regional comparison. On first capture, birds from all three species were sexed, aged and measured for biometrical variables by standard methods (Koivula and Orell

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2004</a>). The different capturing methods used in the two populations have been proven innocuous and did not bias the samples obtained as shown by a subsample of individuals trapped with the alternate capture methods in each location (Broggi 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2006</a>).

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Great and blue tits are temperate deciduous forest species that remain resident on their breeding grounds during winter in the southern study area (Lund). In contrast, great and blue tits in northern Finland are close to their northernmost distribution range, an area that has been colonized in historic times, and spend the winter in loose flocks near human settlements (Valkama et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2011</a>). Willow tit is a boreal forest species that is well adapted to survive boreal winters without the need of human-provided food, being a highly resident forest species that hoards food within their territory that can buffer winter food shortage.
