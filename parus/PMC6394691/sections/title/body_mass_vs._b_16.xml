 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential for birds to manage energy expenditure according to a predation-starvation trade-off has been explored only on a theoretical basis and the focus has been on the use of facultative hypothermia (Brodin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2007</a>) but see (Smit and McKechnie 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2010</a>). However, birds may also optimize BMR to reduce overall energy costs or to support higher energetic capacity simultaneously with management of energy reserves, albeit at different time scales (Piersma and Lindström 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">1997</a>). The idea that organ-masses and energy budgets become co-optimized through natural selection is not novel (Diamond 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">1993</a>). It is possible that while BM regulation may operate on a short-term scale (hours–days), by acquiring and storing of internal reserves, regulation of BMR may operate on a slightly longer time scale (days–weeks) (Piersma and Lindström 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">1997</a>; Dubois et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2016</a>), making it possible to increase workload capacity when food is plentiful (Nilsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2002</a>), or reducing overall metabolic costs under a closed energy budget (Deerenberg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1998</a>; Wiersma et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2005</a>; Smit and McKechnie 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2010</a>). This variation in body composition may be due to physiological constraints (Jehl and Henry 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2013</a>) or an adaptive adjustment as found in several migratory species (Piersma and Lindström 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">1997</a>).

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wintering boreal bird species are often confronted with occasional extreme food scarcity and it seems plausible that individuals can reorganize their mass accumulation strategies and energy budgets in response to new conditions. Therefore, seasonal energy management in small wintering passerines may extend beyond reserve level modulation and involve other energetic aspects as the cost of maintenance (which should reduce BMR) or support of thermogenic performance (which should increase BMR).</p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecological energetics is becoming a widely recognized field of study with relevant implications on climate-related, life-history and evolutionary studies. Although we still do not fully understand the ecological implications of changes in winter BMR, which is among the most intensively studied physiological traits (Tomlinson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">2014</a>), our study suggests that it may play a prominent role in small birds’ seasonal energy management. Our results further indicate that winter fattening may not be as common a strategy in sedentary passerines at high latitudes as previously thought (Broggi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2003</a>; Cooper 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2007</a>). Therefore, when considering the response of birds to the starvation-predation trade-off over periods in where metabolic switches can take place, studies on conditions altering optimal levels of BM and BMR and how these two traits influence each other could yield fruitful outcomes.
