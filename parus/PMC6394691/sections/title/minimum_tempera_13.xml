  <sub>std</sub> were found in all three species and in both localities following weekly or monthly decreasing trends in minimum temperature as commonly observed in endotherms (Alexander 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1999</a>; Blem 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2000</a>). Particularly willow tits adjusted BM
  <sub>abs</sub> and BM
  <sub>std</sub> in relation to perceived environmental factors, in this case monthly minimum temperatures. Similarly, blue tits were also affected by minimum temperatures, although on a more immediate time scale by increasing their BM the lower the minimum temperature on the preceding day. However, great tits did not adjust BM or BM
  <sub>std</sub> according to the minimum temperatures, in contrast to previous studies (Gosler 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2002</a>; Krams et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2009</a>; but see Krams et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2013</a>). Thus, only the willow tit responded to decreasing minimum temperatures by increasing BM
  <sub>std</sub> that could be ascribed to a change in fat reserves, whereas all three species increased BMR
  <sub>std</sub> when the environment got colder. Interestingly, previous studies identified ambient temperatures as an ultimate rather than proximate factor explaining winter fattening, a pattern recalling the one observed in BMR (Dawson and Marsh 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">1986</a>; Gosler 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2002</a>). This indicates that overall, the tits are very flexible in adjusting their metabolic phenotype to prevailing conditions, and at least on a long-time scale (months), these flexible phenotypes emphasize metabolic rather than BM adjustments. These results are in line with an increase in maximal metabolic rate and BMR (Cort√©s et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2015</a>), as well as an increase in metabolic intensity (Liknes et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2014</a>) found in black-capped chickadees (
  <span class="italic">Poecile atricapillus</span>) as a response to harsher environmental conditions.
