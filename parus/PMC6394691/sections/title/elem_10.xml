 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonal variation in BM and BMR differs between populations and among species, and most interestingly these patterns change when BM and BMR are reciprocally standardized. BM
  <sub>std</sub> showed a complex interactive pattern involving location, season and BMR in blue and great tits, which was not the case for BM
  <sub>abs</sub>. Analyses of BMR
  <sub>std</sub> also resulted in interactive patterns between population, season and BM in these two species, which were not found for BMR
  <sub>abs</sub>. These results indicate altogether that sensitivity to environmental conditions and seasonality differs between standardized and absolute BM and BMR and that energy management strategies differ substantially among species.

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both absolute BM
   <sub>abs</sub> and BMR
   <sub>abs</sub> were higher in Oulu than in Lund for great and blue tits. This is a commonly observed latitudinal trend, in where birds exposed to colder and harsher environments react by increasing both in size and in the metabolic machinery to raise their thermogenic output (Kendeigh and Blem 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">1974</a>). Furthermore, both species had higher metabolic intensity (BMR
   <sub>std</sub>) and presumably carried larger reserves (BM
   <sub>std</sub>) in Oulu than in Lund, suggesting differences in tissue proportions (lean vs. fat) and/or mitochondrial activity per gram between populations (Rønning et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">2008</a>; Salin et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">2015</a>). It should be noted that great tits and blue tits have recently colonized the Oulu region (particularly blue tits) (Valkama et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2011</a>) and, during winter, rely on human-provided food sources (Orell 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">1989</a>). Our results suggest that these species have adapted to withstand environmental stochasticity in energy requirements found in Oulu (Broggi et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2004</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2009</a>), a strategy that may be adaptive whenever food is not limiting.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sex and size</div>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Males in all three species were heavier than females, both in absolute terms and when standardized for BMR, suggesting that males were not only larger but also fatter (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). This might be due to males in all three species being dominant over females (Pravosudov and Grubb 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">1997</a>). Having priority of access to food, males may be able to secure more resources daily, entering the night with bigger reserves than females. Thus, we would predict a higher over-night survival in males than in females (but see Nilsson and Nilsson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2016</a>). Although BMR
   <sub>std</sub> did not differ between the sexes in either of the species, blue tit males had higher BMR
   <sub>abs</sub> than females (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). This difference probably stems from the more pronounced sex differences in BM and reserve levels in this species (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), particularly in Oulu. The fact that the species has recently colonized the region (Valkama et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2011</a>) and necessarily competes over very patchy (feeding tables) winter resources with the more dominant great tits could potentially explain this interpopulation pattern that certainly deserves further studies.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Minimum temperature</div>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increases in BMR
   <sub>std</sub> were found in all three species and in both localities following weekly or monthly decreasing trends in minimum temperature as commonly observed in endotherms (Alexander 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1999</a>; Blem 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2000</a>). Particularly willow tits adjusted BM
   <sub>abs</sub> and BM
   <sub>std</sub> in relation to perceived environmental factors, in this case monthly minimum temperatures. Similarly, blue tits were also affected by minimum temperatures, although on a more immediate time scale by increasing their BM the lower the minimum temperature on the preceding day. However, great tits did not adjust BM or BM
   <sub>std</sub> according to the minimum temperatures, in contrast to previous studies (Gosler 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2002</a>; Krams et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2009</a>; but see Krams et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2013</a>). Thus, only the willow tit responded to decreasing minimum temperatures by increasing BM
   <sub>std</sub> that could be ascribed to a change in fat reserves, whereas all three species increased BMR
   <sub>std</sub> when the environment got colder. Interestingly, previous studies identified ambient temperatures as an ultimate rather than proximate factor explaining winter fattening, a pattern recalling the one observed in BMR (Dawson and Marsh 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">1986</a>; Gosler 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2002</a>). This indicates that overall, the tits are very flexible in adjusting their metabolic phenotype to prevailing conditions, and at least on a long-time scale (months), these flexible phenotypes emphasize metabolic rather than BM adjustments. These results are in line with an increase in maximal metabolic rate and BMR (Cortés et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2015</a>), as well as an increase in metabolic intensity (Liknes et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2014</a>) found in black-capped chickadees (
   <span class="italic">Poecile atricapillus</span>) as a response to harsher environmental conditions.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonal pattern</div>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides the response to prevailing conditions, the tits also followed a seasonal pattern in both BM and BMR. The great tit, which is the largest of the three species studied, was the only one exhibiting a non-linear pattern in BM with a peak in midwinter that would be in line with what is known as “true winter fattening” (Lehikoinen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">1987</a>; Rogers and Rogers 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">1990</a>). Both BM
   <sub>abs</sub> and BM
   <sub>std</sub> followed a similar non-linear pattern, somehow more pronounced in birds from Oulu as compared to Lund. Blue tits, on the other hand, exhibited a linear decrease in BM
   <sub>abs</sub> and BM
   <sub>std</sub> during the season. As blue tits are subdominant in heterospecific flocks (Pravosudov and Grubb 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">1997</a>), they might not be able to afford a seasonal BM strategy and may have to rely on other reserve-saving mechanisms, e.g., facultative hypothermia. Finally, willow tits did not exhibit any seasonal trend in BM at all, highlighting the fact that this boreal specialist species may have alternative wintering strategies than “winter fattening”, such as hoarding behavior (Broggi et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2003</a>) and facultative nocturnal hypothermia (Reinertsen and Haftorn 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">1986</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">BMR
   <sub>abs</sub> exhibited a non-linear pattern of seasonal change in all three-species studied, albeit the willow tit decreased BMR
   <sub>abs</sub> towards midwinter, opposite to the pattern found in the blue and great tits that peaked in midwinter. The same pattern was also reflected in seasonal changes in BMR
   <sub>std</sub>. Thus, BMR
   <sub>std</sub> peaked during midwinter in great and blue tits with a more pronounced peak in Oulu than in Lund birds. Furthermore, willow tits decreased their BMR
   <sub>std</sub> during midwinter. Thus, seasonality seems to play a more prominent role in BMR than BM variation in the three studied species. Great and blue tits respond to longer winter nights by an increased BMR
   <sub>abs</sub> and BMR
   <sub>std</sub>, in line with common observations of increased BMR in winter (Broggi et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2007</a>; Swanson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">2010</a>). Interestingly willow tits appear to engage in an opposite strategy, instead of rising expenditure to cope with increasing demands they reduce maintenance costs. Contrary to great and blue tits, this well-adapted boreal species seems to rely on hoarding behavior (Broggi 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2006</a> and references therein), and a regular use of nighttime facultative hypothermia (Reinertsen and Haftorn 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">1986</a>; Broggi et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2017</a>) to withstand winter conditions at high latitudes. Thus, willow tits reduce maintenance costs and increase food predictability to cope with increasing energy demands and reduced food supply encountered during winter. Interestingly, the ecologically similar black-capped chickadee has a contrasting seasonal pattern of energy management, with midwinter peaks in both BM and BMR (Petit et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2013</a>; Petit and Vézina 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2014</a>; Petit et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2014</a>). This highlights the diverse energy management strategies in apparently identical ecological contexts, underlining the need for further studies to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these differences.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Long-term trends</div>
  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amount of reserves (BM
   <sub>std</sub>) in blue tits increased over the study years, in contrast to the other two species. Blue tits may be more sensitive to a changing climate. Because they are subdominant in heterospecific flocks, they may now, with warmer winters, be able to reach higher levels of fat reserves. Furthermore, there was a long-term trend among all three species in BMR
   <sub>std</sub>. However, while the BMR intensity in great tits increased over the studied period, it decreased in blue and willow tits. A long-term decrease in BMR intensity may reflect a selective disadvantage of having a high metabolic rate when winters become increasingly warmer, particularly for subdominant species, as previously shown in blue tits (Nilsson and Nilsson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2016</a>). Nevertheless, interpreting sources for inter-annual variation is complicated since several factors may impinge on the individual condition during other life-history episodes that will affect future winter performance as carry-over effects (Harrison et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2011</a>). Particularly, when considering pronounced physiological adjustments as those involved in changing BMR
   <sub>abs</sub> and BMR
   <sub>std</sub>, carry-over effects are likely to be more substantial, e.g., oxidative damage and telomere shortening (Monaghan and Haussmann 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2006</a>; Isaksson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2011</a>) than those derived from internal reserve adjustments (BM
   <sub>std</sub>) (Harrison et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2011</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body mass vs. BMR</div>
  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential for birds to manage energy expenditure according to a predation-starvation trade-off has been explored only on a theoretical basis and the focus has been on the use of facultative hypothermia (Brodin 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2007</a>) but see (Smit and McKechnie 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2010</a>). However, birds may also optimize BMR to reduce overall energy costs or to support higher energetic capacity simultaneously with management of energy reserves, albeit at different time scales (Piersma and Lindström 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">1997</a>). The idea that organ-masses and energy budgets become co-optimized through natural selection is not novel (Diamond 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">1993</a>). It is possible that while BM regulation may operate on a short-term scale (hours–days), by acquiring and storing of internal reserves, regulation of BMR may operate on a slightly longer time scale (days–weeks) (Piersma and Lindström 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">1997</a>; Dubois et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2016</a>), making it possible to increase workload capacity when food is plentiful (Nilsson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2002</a>), or reducing overall metabolic costs under a closed energy budget (Deerenberg et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1998</a>; Wiersma et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2005</a>; Smit and McKechnie 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2010</a>). This variation in body composition may be due to physiological constraints (Jehl and Henry 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2013</a>) or an adaptive adjustment as found in several migratory species (Piersma and Lindström 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">1997</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wintering boreal bird species are often confronted with occasional extreme food scarcity and it seems plausible that individuals can reorganize their mass accumulation strategies and energy budgets in response to new conditions. Therefore, seasonal energy management in small wintering passerines may extend beyond reserve level modulation and involve other energetic aspects as the cost of maintenance (which should reduce BMR) or support of thermogenic performance (which should increase BMR).</p>
  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecological energetics is becoming a widely recognized field of study with relevant implications on climate-related, life-history and evolutionary studies. Although we still do not fully understand the ecological implications of changes in winter BMR, which is among the most intensively studied physiological traits (Tomlinson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">2014</a>), our study suggests that it may play a prominent role in small birds’ seasonal energy management. Our results further indicate that winter fattening may not be as common a strategy in sedentary passerines at high latitudes as previously thought (Broggi et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2003</a>; Cooper 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2007</a>). Therefore, when considering the response of birds to the starvation-predation trade-off over periods in where metabolic switches can take place, studies on conditions altering optimal levels of BM and BMR and how these two traits influence each other could yield fruitful outcomes.
