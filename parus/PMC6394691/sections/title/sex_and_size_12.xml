 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Males in all three species were heavier than females, both in absolute terms and when standardized for BMR, suggesting that males were not only larger but also fatter (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). This might be due to males in all three species being dominant over females (Pravosudov and Grubb 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">1997</a>). Having priority of access to food, males may be able to secure more resources daily, entering the night with bigger reserves than females. Thus, we would predict a higher over-night survival in males than in females (but see Nilsson and Nilsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2016</a>). Although BMR
  <sub>std</sub> did not differ between the sexes in either of the species, blue tit males had higher BMR
  <sub>abs</sub> than females (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). This difference probably stems from the more pronounced sex differences in BM and reserve levels in this species (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), particularly in Oulu. The fact that the species has recently colonized the region (Valkama et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2011</a>) and necessarily competes over very patchy (feeding tables) winter resources with the more dominant great tits could potentially explain this interpopulation pattern that certainly deserves further studies.
