 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">BMR is defined as the average minimal oxygen consumption under post-absorptive digestive conditions during the resting phase of the daily cycle of non-growing, non-reproductive animals at thermoneutrality (McNab 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">1997</a>). Thus, BMR was measured as oxygen consumption during the night in an open-circuit respirometer in a dark climate chamber at a constant temperature of 25 °C, well within the thermoneutral zone for winter-acclimatized tits (own unpublished data). Outdoor air was pushed through mass-flow controllers [Oulu: initially Bronkhorst Hi-Tec F201C (Netherlands) and later FMA-A2407, Omega Engineering, Inc. (USA); Lund: Bronkhorst Hi-Tec F201C (The Netherlands)] at 300 ml/min into the metabolic chambers containing each individual. Outcoming air was scrubbed for CO
  <sub>2</sub> and H
  <sub>2</sub>O before being directed through a multiplexer in turns of 5–10 min (depending on the respirometer) to the Oxygen analyzer [Oulu: first Servomex 1440 (UK) and later S-3A Ametek (USA); Lund: Servomex 4100 (UK)]. Each cycle lasted an hour and included reference air to control for the analyzer bias. Details on each respirometer configuration, data extraction procedures and potential sources of bias between Oulu and Lund have been described in detail elsewhere (Broggi 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2006</a>). Birds were weighed after capture at the closest 0.1 g. After the measurement night, birds were released at the point of capture.
