  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed BM and BMR in 660 individuals belonging to three titmice species from two different populations, Oulu (Finland) (65°N, 25°30′E) and Lund (Sweden) (55°40′N, 13°25′E). BMR from all individuals was measured throughout the night and the next morning they were released at the point of capture. Many individuals were captured more than once and re-measured (up to six times both within and among winters) totaling 822 measurements. Free living great tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), blue tits (
   <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) and willow tits (
   <span class="italic">Poecile montanus</span>) were captured and measured near Oulu from winter 1999–2000 until winter 2005–2006. Birds were captured at dusk during the non-breeding season by baited funnel traps in Oulu (182 great tits, 29 blue tits and 35 willow tit individuals). Free living great and blue tits from Lund were captured after dusk while roosting in nestboxes from winter 1999–2000 until winter 2006–2007 (159 great tits and 255 blue tit individuals). All birds were captured within 2 h before and after sunset. Willow tits are absent from the Lund region and, therefore, could not be included in the regional comparison. On first capture, birds from all three species were sexed, aged and measured for biometrical variables by standard methods (Koivula and Orell 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">1988</a>, Broggi et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2004</a>). The different capturing methods used in the two populations have been proven innocuous and did not bias the samples obtained as shown by a subsample of individuals trapped with the alternate capture methods in each location (Broggi 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2006</a>).

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Great and blue tits are temperate deciduous forest species that remain resident on their breeding grounds during winter in the southern study area (Lund). In contrast, great and blue tits in northern Finland are close to their northernmost distribution range, an area that has been colonized in historic times, and spend the winter in loose flocks near human settlements (Valkama et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2011</a>). Willow tit is a boreal forest species that is well adapted to survive boreal winters without the need of human-provided food, being a highly resident forest species that hoards food within their territory that can buffer winter food shortage.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body mass and metabolic measurements</div>
  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">BMR is defined as the average minimal oxygen consumption under post-absorptive digestive conditions during the resting phase of the daily cycle of non-growing, non-reproductive animals at thermoneutrality (McNab 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">1997</a>). Thus, BMR was measured as oxygen consumption during the night in an open-circuit respirometer in a dark climate chamber at a constant temperature of 25 °C, well within the thermoneutral zone for winter-acclimatized tits (own unpublished data). Outdoor air was pushed through mass-flow controllers [Oulu: initially Bronkhorst Hi-Tec F201C (Netherlands) and later FMA-A2407, Omega Engineering, Inc. (USA); Lund: Bronkhorst Hi-Tec F201C (The Netherlands)] at 300 ml/min into the metabolic chambers containing each individual. Outcoming air was scrubbed for CO
   <sub>2</sub> and H
   <sub>2</sub>O before being directed through a multiplexer in turns of 5–10 min (depending on the respirometer) to the Oxygen analyzer [Oulu: first Servomex 1440 (UK) and later S-3A Ametek (USA); Lund: Servomex 4100 (UK)]. Each cycle lasted an hour and included reference air to control for the analyzer bias. Details on each respirometer configuration, data extraction procedures and potential sources of bias between Oulu and Lund have been described in detail elsewhere (Broggi 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2006</a>). Birds were weighed after capture at the closest 0.1 g. After the measurement night, birds were released at the point of capture.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analyses</div>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used general linear mixed models to explain the seasonal variation in BM and BMR in the three species of titmice. Great tits and blue tits originated from two distinct populations differing in winter environmental conditions (Broggi et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2004</a>). Hence, locality (Lund or Oulu) was included as a fixed factor in analyses involving great and blue tits. We first tested differences between populations in the relation between BM and BMR. Afterwards, we incorporated individual variables such as sex as a categorical predictor, and age (1 = 1st winter; 2 = older than 1st winter; 3 = 2nd winter, etc.) and body size (tarsus length) as continuous predictors (Senar and Pascual 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">1997</a>). The environmental variables included were year of study (winter 1999–2000 = 1), date (October 1st = 1), average minimum temperature of previous month, week and day of capture (°C) (hereafter month, week and day MT). First-order interactions between locality, sex and the other variables were included in the full models. Additionally, date squared was included as a predictor variable to test for non-linear effects of season i.e., date.
  </p>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two sets of models were fitted for each dependent variable: BM and BMR. First, full models were analyzed singly, without considering BMR and BM as covariates (hereafter BM
   <sub>abs</sub> and BMR
   <sub>abs</sub>). Second, the same full models were fitted with the incorporation of BMR as covariate in the BM model, and BM in the BMR model (hereafter BM
   <sub>std</sub> and BMR
   <sub>std,</sub> respectively). Models were estimated by REML and individual was included as a random factor. We used the autoregressive covariance structure and estimated DF by the Satterthwhite method. The full model was reduced in a backward step-wise manner according to the highest 
   <span class="italic">p</span> value starting with the interactions, and AIC (Akaike’s information criterion) was used to choose when to stop the step-wise elimination process. Sequential reintroduction of each eliminated main effect back into the final model never improved the fit (as determined by AIC). Final models are presented in tables together with the corresponding AIC values, and the 
   <span class="italic">F</span> values, DF and 
   <span class="italic">p</span> values corresponding to each predictor. Parameter estimates ± SE are provided for continuous predictors. Full models and parameters removed are presented with the corresponding values when removed from the model (ESM). All 
   <span class="italic">p</span> values are two-tailed. All continuous variables fulfilled the requirements of normality.
