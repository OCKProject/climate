 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both absolute BM
  <sub>abs</sub> and BMR
  <sub>abs</sub> were higher in Oulu than in Lund for great and blue tits. This is a commonly observed latitudinal trend, in where birds exposed to colder and harsher environments react by increasing both in size and in the metabolic machinery to raise their thermogenic output (Kendeigh and Blem 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">1974</a>). Furthermore, both species had higher metabolic intensity (BMR
  <sub>std</sub>) and presumably carried larger reserves (BM
  <sub>std</sub>) in Oulu than in Lund, suggesting differences in tissue proportions (lean vs. fat) and/or mitochondrial activity per gram between populations (RÃ¸nning et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">2008</a>; Salin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">2015</a>). It should be noted that great tits and blue tits have recently colonized the Oulu region (particularly blue tits) (Valkama et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2011</a>) and, during winter, rely on human-provided food sources (Orell 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">1989</a>). Our results suggest that these species have adapted to withstand environmental stochasticity in energy requirements found in Oulu (Broggi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2004</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2009</a>), a strategy that may be adaptive whenever food is not limiting.
