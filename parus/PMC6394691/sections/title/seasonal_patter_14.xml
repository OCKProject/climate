 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides the response to prevailing conditions, the tits also followed a seasonal pattern in both BM and BMR. The great tit, which is the largest of the three species studied, was the only one exhibiting a non-linear pattern in BM with a peak in midwinter that would be in line with what is known as “true winter fattening” (Lehikoinen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">1987</a>; Rogers and Rogers 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">1990</a>). Both BM
  <sub>abs</sub> and BM
  <sub>std</sub> followed a similar non-linear pattern, somehow more pronounced in birds from Oulu as compared to Lund. Blue tits, on the other hand, exhibited a linear decrease in BM
  <sub>abs</sub> and BM
  <sub>std</sub> during the season. As blue tits are subdominant in heterospecific flocks (Pravosudov and Grubb 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">1997</a>), they might not be able to afford a seasonal BM strategy and may have to rely on other reserve-saving mechanisms, e.g., facultative hypothermia. Finally, willow tits did not exhibit any seasonal trend in BM at all, highlighting the fact that this boreal specialist species may have alternative wintering strategies than “winter fattening”, such as hoarding behavior (Broggi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2003</a>) and facultative nocturnal hypothermia (Reinertsen and Haftorn 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">1986</a>).

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">BMR
  <sub>abs</sub> exhibited a non-linear pattern of seasonal change in all three-species studied, albeit the willow tit decreased BMR
  <sub>abs</sub> towards midwinter, opposite to the pattern found in the blue and great tits that peaked in midwinter. The same pattern was also reflected in seasonal changes in BMR
  <sub>std</sub>. Thus, BMR
  <sub>std</sub> peaked during midwinter in great and blue tits with a more pronounced peak in Oulu than in Lund birds. Furthermore, willow tits decreased their BMR
  <sub>std</sub> during midwinter. Thus, seasonality seems to play a more prominent role in BMR than BM variation in the three studied species. Great and blue tits respond to longer winter nights by an increased BMR
  <sub>abs</sub> and BMR
  <sub>std</sub>, in line with common observations of increased BMR in winter (Broggi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2007</a>; Swanson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">2010</a>). Interestingly willow tits appear to engage in an opposite strategy, instead of rising expenditure to cope with increasing demands they reduce maintenance costs. Contrary to great and blue tits, this well-adapted boreal species seems to rely on hoarding behavior (Broggi 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2006</a> and references therein), and a regular use of nighttime facultative hypothermia (Reinertsen and Haftorn 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">1986</a>; Broggi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2017</a>) to withstand winter conditions at high latitudes. Thus, willow tits reduce maintenance costs and increase food predictability to cope with increasing energy demands and reduced food supply encountered during winter. Interestingly, the ecologically similar black-capped chickadee has a contrasting seasonal pattern of energy management, with midwinter peaks in both BM and BMR (Petit et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2013</a>; Petit and Vézina 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2014</a>; Petit et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2014</a>). This highlights the diverse energy management strategies in apparently identical ecological contexts, underlining the need for further studies to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these differences.
