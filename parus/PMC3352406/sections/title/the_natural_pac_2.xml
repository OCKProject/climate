 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The natural pace of environmental change</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A physical factor changes on all time scales, and at any given time scale varies by some characteristic amount. The rate of increase in environmental variance over time provides a quantitative measure of variability. This is often adequately described by a power law, 
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>E</sub> = 
  <span class="italic">at</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">z</span>
  </span>, where the exponent 
  <span class="italic">z</span> expresses the rate of increase of variance over time. This means that the log difference in physical conditions at a site increases with log elapsed time at a rate 
  <span class="italic">z</span>/2. For example, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">Koscielny-Bunde et al. (1998)</a> analysed deviations of daily maximum temperature from their seasonal average values, estimated with very voluminous and exact data taken at weather stations around the world over a period of more than a century. They found that plots of log 
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>E</sub> on log elapsed time are almost perfectly linear with slope 
  <span class="italic">z</span> = 0.65. Pelletier (1997) obtained 
  <span class="italic">z</span> = 0.75 for ice-core samples for periods between 1 month and 2000 years. This environmental variability may drive changes in the growth and abundance of populations. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">Pimm and Redfearn (1988)</a> showed that ln abundance 
  <span class="italic">N</span> of animals also follows a power law, and since the ln variance of ln 
  <span class="italic">N</span> is equivalent to ln [
  <span class="italic">N</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span> + 1)/
  <span class="italic">N</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>)] this implies that the variance of realized growth rate increases indefinitely over time, apparently with exponent 0.36 (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">Inchausti and Halley 2002</a>). Spatial variation also increases with distance according to a power law, typically with smaller exponents of 
  <span class="italic">z</span> = 0.1â€“0.2 (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">Bell et al. 1993</a>). Hence, as a lineage is extended through time the conditions that its members experience will grow steadily more variable.
