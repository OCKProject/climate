  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is widely believed that most populations, most of the time, should have become well adapted to their conditions of life through the past operation of natural selection. Mutation is generally deleterious, at least in natural conditions (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">Keightley and Lynch 2003</a>). Environmental change tends to move the average phenotype of well-adapted populations further from its optimal value and thereby to reduce mean fitness. Moreover, enemies such as pathogens and predators are likely to be selected to exploit the most frequent types in their target populations, driving a continuous reduction in mean fitness (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b93" href="#b93">Van Valen 1973</a>). Consequently, either genetic or environmental change will be perceived by most individuals as harmful.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The natural pace of environmental change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A physical factor changes on all time scales, and at any given time scale varies by some characteristic amount. The rate of increase in environmental variance over time provides a quantitative measure of variability. This is often adequately described by a power law, 
   <span class="italic">V</span>
   <sub>E</sub> = 
   <span class="italic">at</span>
   <span class="sup">
    <span class="italic">z</span>
   </span>, where the exponent 
   <span class="italic">z</span> expresses the rate of increase of variance over time. This means that the log difference in physical conditions at a site increases with log elapsed time at a rate 
   <span class="italic">z</span>/2. For example, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">Koscielny-Bunde et al. (1998)</a> analysed deviations of daily maximum temperature from their seasonal average values, estimated with very voluminous and exact data taken at weather stations around the world over a period of more than a century. They found that plots of log 
   <span class="italic">V</span>
   <sub>E</sub> on log elapsed time are almost perfectly linear with slope 
   <span class="italic">z</span> = 0.65. Pelletier (1997) obtained 
   <span class="italic">z</span> = 0.75 for ice-core samples for periods between 1 month and 2000 years. This environmental variability may drive changes in the growth and abundance of populations. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">Pimm and Redfearn (1988)</a> showed that ln abundance 
   <span class="italic">N</span> of animals also follows a power law, and since the ln variance of ln 
   <span class="italic">N</span> is equivalent to ln [
   <span class="italic">N</span>(
   <span class="italic">t</span> + 1)/
   <span class="italic">N</span>(
   <span class="italic">t</span>)] this implies that the variance of realized growth rate increases indefinitely over time, apparently with exponent 0.36 (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">Inchausti and Halley 2002</a>). Spatial variation also increases with distance according to a power law, typically with smaller exponents of 
   <span class="italic">z</span> = 0.1–0.2 (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">Bell et al. 1993</a>). Hence, as a lineage is extended through time the conditions that its members experience will grow steadily more variable.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variable and fluctuating selection</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental variability will cause the strength and direction of selection to change over time. Studies of natural populations have shown that selection is often strong (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">Hereford et al. 2004</a>) and that heritability is often high (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" href="#b67">Mousseau and Roff 1987</a>). One explanation of these apparently contradictory generalizations is that selection often changes direction, because offspring grow up in a different place and at a different time from their parents. The variability of selection among isozyme genotypes in 
   <span class="italic">Daphnia</span> populations was documented by 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">Lynch (1987)</a>, who found that the standard deviation of the selection coefficient over time was at least 0.1. There are many detailed case studies of selection that varies widely in time (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">Grant and Grant 2002</a>) or space (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b86" href="#b86">Snaydon and Davies 1982</a>), even in within a few square metres of natural environment (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b88" href="#b88">Stewart and Schoen 1987</a>). Hence, populations might often be rather imprecisely adapted to local conditions of growth. This can be evaluated by measuring the selection gradient (partial regression of fitness on character state) and calculating the distance between the optimal phenotype and the population mean, in units of phenotypic standard deviations. For the studies of stabilizing selection collated by 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">Kingsolver et al. (2001)</a> this distance is exponentially distributed with mean 3.9; that is, the population was further than one phenotypic standard deviation from the optimum in about one-half of all cases, and further than 2 SD in one-third. It can also be evaluated by reciprocal transplant experiments. Where these involve clearly distinct ecotypes or species they usually show that residents are markedly superior to incomers (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b81" href="#b81">Schluter 2000</a>; Table 5.1). When morphologically undifferentiated populations are transplanted, however, there is little tendency for residents to be superior except at very large distances or between clearly distinct habitats (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">Bell 2008</a>, Table 5). These facts are consistent with the view that conditions often vary widely in time and space, generating strong but fluctuating selection.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rescue from extinction by adaptation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most individuals are sufficiently versatile to accommodate the mundane level of variability experienced within a lifetime. Offspring will encounter conditions different from their parents but will adjust to them through phenotypic plasticity. The perpetual increase of environmental variance, however, may eventually lead to a change in conditions too great for individuals to survive or reproduce successfully, so that the population begins to decline. Lineages can still persist by migrating or dispersing to new sites. If neither plasticity nor dispersal will serve, however, they must either adapt or die out. Natural selection may succeed in restoring adaptedness if types capable of growing in the new conditions exist in the population or arise before it becomes extinct. It is most likely to do so when the change is modest and the amount of genetic variance (or the mutation supply rate) is high. Although this notion dates back at least to the ‘lag load’ of 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">Stenseth and Maynard Smith (1984)</a> it seems not to have been explored very thoroughly (but see 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">Martin and Lenormand 2006</a>, whose parameter 
   <span class="italic">s</span>
   <sub>o</sub> is a lag load), with the exceptions that we discuss below. Although selection lines in the laboratory sometimes die out through excessive stress or high levels of inbreeding, this is normally regarded as a nuisance, and we are unaware of any experimental literature demonstrating the conditions in which evolutionary rescue does and does not occur. The closest approach to experimental evidence was described by 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">Bradshaw (1991)</a>, who pointed out that some species of plant consistently adapt to heavy metal pollution whereas others do not, and attributed the failures to ‘genostasis’, the chronic and insuperable lack of appropriate genetic variation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pace of current global change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There has been very marked environmental change during the Cenozoic, including (for example) extensive glaciations within the last million years alone. Many organisms have become extinct during this time, in many cases, no doubt, because of these changes. Overall diversity has not altered much in most groups, however, showing that selection and speciation are effective in buffering the global biota against extinction or impoverishment. We have emphasized that strong, fluctuating selection is probably commonplace in contemporary populations. The optimistic view is therefore that selection will continue to be equally effective in rescuing populations that experience high levels of stress, so that extinction rates will not exceed long-term averages except, perhaps, when extinction is willfully pursued, for example through pest eradication or overfishing. A more pessimistic view is that some important environmental factors are currently changing at unprecedented rates as the result of human activities. The most prominent is atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub>, which has risen from preindustrial levels of 280–380 ppm at present and is forecast to attain 700–1000 ppm in the next 100 years (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b95" href="#b95">Watson et al. 2001</a>). This is likely to entrain secondary effects such as substantially higher temperatures, acidification and a greater frequency of extreme events. Human activities are also responsible for high levels of pollution by synthetic chemicals, extensive changes in landscape structure and the release of many species from dispersal limitation. In many cases these changes manifestly exceed the capacity of individuals to accommodate to them, or of populations to avoid them by migration or dispersal. It is of great interest, therefore, to ask whether adaptation can be expected to rescue populations threatened with extinction, and, more broadly, how natural populations and communities will evolve in response to global change.
