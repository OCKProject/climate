 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The immediate response to selection in most animals and plants will depend on the level of standing genetic variation in the population. Inbred lines of 
  <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> respond only slowly to artificial selection, at about 10% of the rate of outbred lines. Outbred lines successfully adapted to much higher concentrations of salt than lines in which variation was restricted by inbreeding or bottlenecking (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b1001" href="#b1001">Frankham et al. (1999)</a>. The average heritability of characters measured in outbred natural populations is about 0.5 (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" href="#b67">Mousseau and Roff 1987</a>). Detailed analyses of exceptionally well-studied populations give a lower but still substantial average of 0.28 (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">Kruuk 2004</a>). As most characters have substantial phenotypic variation, this implies that additive genetic variance may often be sufficient to support adaptation to rapid environmental change. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">Hendry et al. (2007)</a> showed that phenotypic changes induced by human activities often exceed those associated with natural environmental variation, but concluded that this was attributable in large part to phenotypic plasticity. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b74" href="#b74">Réale et al. (2003)</a> found that the parturition date of red squirrels in northern Canada advanced by 3.7 days per generation between 1989 and 1998, with adaptation contributing 0.8 days and plasticity the remainder. In short, natural populations often have the potential to adapt to global change, and have been documented to do so.

  </div> by the fundamental theorem (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">Fisher 1930</a>), and on a few occasions this has been measured in natural populations. In the annual plant 
  <span class="italic">Impatiens pallida</span> the corresponding phenotypic variance SV
  <sub>P</sub> was 15.8 in natural conditions of growth, a very high value largely attributable to the majority of individuals that fail to reproduce at all; when these are neglected SV
  <sub>P</sub> falls to 1.1 (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">Bell et al. 1991</a>). Only a very small fraction of this was genetic, however, with SV
  <sub>A</sub> = 0.03 (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b82" href="#b82">Schoen et al. 1994</a>). In the great tit 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> long-term observations of marked individuals yielded estimates of SV
  <sub>P</sub> = 1.9 and SV
  <sub>A</sub> = 0.014 (averaged over males and females) (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">McCleery et al. 2004</a>). Similar work with another small bird, the collared flycatcher 
  <span class="italic">Ficedula albicollis</span>, gave SV
  <sub>P</sub> = 0.4 and sex-averaged SV
  <sub>A</sub> = 0.057 (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" href="#b64">Merilä and Sheldon 2000</a>). Although detailed field studies are scarce, the similarity of estimates from birds and plants suggests that SV
  <sub>A</sub> might often lie between 0.01 and 0.05. Although not directly equivalent to the selective response to environmental change, this indicates that natural populations routinely cope with fitness degradation of a few per cent per generation.
