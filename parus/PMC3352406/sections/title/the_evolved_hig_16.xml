 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carbon uptake in model phytoplankton species is relatively well understood (see 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b72" href="#b72">Raven 1991</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">Beardall et al. 1998</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" href="#b76">Riebesell 2004</a> for reviews). Progress continues to be made in documenting carbon uptake and growth in other species that are thought to play an important role in marine carbon fixation (for example 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">Fu et al. 2007</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">Hutchins et al. 2007</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">de Castro Araújo and Garcia 2005</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">Bidigare 2002</a>). Most recent studies, including those just cited, tend to report responses to changes in carbon availability coupled with other environmental change (see for example 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b80" href="#b80">Schippers et al. 2004</a>). While detailed physiological work can tell us a great deal about how phytoplankton respond to short-term increases in carbon availability, either alone or as part of a more complex environmental change, there is ample evidence that these responses are not reliably maintained over longer timescales (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">Polle et al. 2001</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">Collins and Bell 2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most ecological and evolutionary theory is framed in terms of adapting to scarcity or stress. In contrast, contemporary global change is characterized by nutrient enrichment. Marine phytoplankton are not typically CO
  <sub>2</sub> limited for growth, in part because most actively transport carbon into the cell using an inducible carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">Badger et al. 1998</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">Sültemeyer 1998</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">Badger and Spalding 2000</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">Coleman et al. 2002</a>). The CCM tends to be tightly regulated such that it is downregulated when CO
  <sub>2</sub> is abundant (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">Bozzo and Coleman 2000</a>). Information about the presence and affinities of CCMs is vital to determining how much carbon algal populations take up under a given CO
  <sub>2</sub> regime. Here, experimental evolution can help to understand whether CCMs will continue to be maintained in their current state, and from this, how stable we expect the CO
  <sub>2</sub> affinity and rate of carbon uptake of phytoplankton to be over long timescales. This directly addresses the question of how closely we expect future phytoplankton populations to resemble contemporary ones.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify the long-term response to elevated CO
  <sub>2,</sub>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">Collins and Bell (2004)</a> cultured the unicellular alga 
  <span class="italic">Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</span> for 1000 generations at concentrations of CO
  <sub>2</sub> that gradually increased from ambient values to 1000 ppm.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that the lines evolved a syndrome characterized by increased photosynthesis without increased growth or insensitivity of both growth and photosynthesis to elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">Collins and Bell 2004</a>). Microalgae isolated from the soil around naturally occurring CO
  <sub>2</sub> springs expressed a similar phenotype (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">Collins and Bell 2006</a>), strengthening the case that the laboratory selection experiment could be used to predict the response of natural populations. The evolved syndrome is contrary to the short-term response of 
  <span class="italic">C. reinhardtii</span> to elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub>, which involves an increase in both photosynthesis and growth. Hence, the evolutionary responses differed in both direction and magnitude from physiological responses. It follows that the predicted net CO
  <sub>2</sub> uptake of future phytoplankton communities is 38% less than the value expected from contemporary populations held under the same elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> conditions, when the evolutionary response is taken into account (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">Collins et al. 2006</a>) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5</a>). Moreover, there was significant divergence between initially similar replicates, showing that physiological responses are unlikely to remain constant or to scale up predictably over hundreds of generations. The statement that short-term responses may not scale up predictably to longer timescales is hardly surprising or novel, and studies such as these highlight the need for experimental tests of evolutionary responses to elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> in marine phytoplankton. Long-term selection experiments with diatoms, coccolithophores and cyanobacteria are feasible, although more cumbersome than those with 
  <span class="italic">Chlamydomonas</span>, which grows faster and reaches greater densities.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main outcome of selection at elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> in our experimental lines of 
  <span class="italic">Chlamydomonas</span> was the degeneration of a regulated CCM (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">Collins et al. 2006</a>). There was neither a fitness cost nor a benefit to the degeneration of the CCM, nor to the loss of its regulation at high CO
  <sub>2</sub>, suggesting that the pathway simply deteriorated through the accumulation of conditionally neutral mutations. Studies of pathway degeneration in yeast (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b85" href="#b85">Sliwa and Korona 2005</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">Maclean 2007</a>) are consistent with unused or unnecessary pathways being lost by mutation accumulation, although there is also ample evidence that unused pathways are often maintained, perhaps because they are tightly regulated and do not incur a metabolic cost when they are not in use (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">Maclean 2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding how CCMs might change in response to elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> is further complicated by the biology of marine phytoplankton growth. As marine phytoplankton form blooms that may locally deplete CO
  <sub>2</sub> supplies, the loss of a regulated CCM may be deleterious in natural populations even if global levels of CO
  <sub>2</sub> rise. In this case, the CCM might be maintained by periodic strong selection, even though experiments done at constant high CO
  <sub>2</sub> predict its degradation. To make an educated guess on whether carbon uptake will be maintained in its current form by purifying selection, more realistic experiments incorporating nutrient fluctuations seen in bloom-bust growth cycles are needed.
