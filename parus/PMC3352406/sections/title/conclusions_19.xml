 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We draw two main conclusions from this brief overview of the likely consequences of global change. The first is that evolutionary rescue is an onerous concept. Theory leads us to expect that it might be quite common, but the crucial parameter, the rate of rescue mutations, is almost completely unknown, and the fact that large populations can succumb to severe stress suggests that it may often be very low. The second is that evolutionary response to the coming increase in CO
  <sub>2</sub> seems to involve primarily a degradation of existing regulatory mechanisms rather than specific adaptation that increases productivity. This implies that future populations will be less efficient rather than more productive. We regret that the tone of our essay is therefore somewhat sombre, but we emphasize that the experimental program to investigate the long-term effects of global change on populations and communities is still in its infancy. As more and more effort is drawn into this program, the outlines of the future will become sharper. We hope that they will also become more realistic, and more benevolent.
