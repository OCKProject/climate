 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rate of mutation to beneficial alleles depends both on the fundamental mutation rate and on the degree of adaptation of the population, and so cannot be estimated without knowing both the state of the environment and the state of the population. The actual frequency of beneficial mutations is poorly known, although it is usually thought to be very low (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2007</a>). This is not necessarily the case: 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b83" href="#b83">Shaw et al. (2000)</a> claimed that roughly half of all mutations in 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span> are beneficial. This claim was vigorously rebutted by 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">Keightley and Lynch (2003)</a>, but at least 40% of all viable loss-of-function mutations in yeast are neutral or mildly beneficial under laboratory conditions (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">Bell 2008</a>). This may explain why the decline of isolate lines where mutations are periodically trapped in bottlenecked populations is often very slow (e.g. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b94" href="#b94">Vassilieva et al. 1999</a>), as beneficial as well as deleterious mutations are liable to be trapped. For example, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">Joseph and Hall (2004)</a> found that about 5% of mutations in yeast mutation-accumulation lines were beneficial. The most precise estimate of the beneficial mutation rate at a nucleotide level is the study of an RNA virus by 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b78" href="#b78">Sanjuan et al. (2004)</a>, who found 2/29 viable single-nucleotide mutations were beneficial. They used a chimaeric ancestral sequence that had not been cultured long under laboratory conditions and may well have been poorly adapted. Other virus experiments yield much lower estimates: the initial probability that a random mutation will increase fitness is about 0.0034 for phage ϕX174 adapting to high temperature and about 0.0009 for RNA VSV adapting to a new host cell type . 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">Kassen and Bataillon (2006)</a> trapped beneficial mutations in laboratory population of 
  <span class="italic">Pseudomonas</span> and estimated that they arose at a frequency of 7.6 × 10
  <span class="sup">−11</span> per gene per replication, equivalent in their system to Φ = 0.031. It is quite possible that mutations are more strongly deleterious in natural conditions than in the laboratory, but in that case laboratory estimates of the effect of mutation are difficult to interpret.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rate of mutation to rescue alleles is even less well known. It could be estimated by adapt-or-die experiments in which a dilution series of a test organism is exposed to a stress severe enough to cause population decline, but we do not know of any published estimates except those involving resistance to a lethal stress, usually a toxin such as an antibiotic. Moreover, even the rate of mutation to antibiotic resistance is far from being a simple parameter with a single value, but rather depends on the underlying physiology and genetics of the organism, its previous conditions of growth and the physical structure of the environment (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">Martinez and Baquero 2000</a>). Resistance to quinolones, for example, may involve mutations in seven or eight genes, in each of which several nucleotide substitutions may be responsible (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">Hooper 1999</a>), so that estimates of the rescue mutation rate can vary over four orders of magnitude, from 1 × 10
  <span class="sup">−6</span> to 4 × 10
  <span class="sup">−10</span> per genome per replication (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">Kohler et al. 1997</a>).
