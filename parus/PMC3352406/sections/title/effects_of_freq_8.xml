 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Suppose that conditions are unchanged for a period 
  <span class="italic">E</span>, after which fitness is abruptly reduced by an amount proportional to Δ
  <sub>1</sub>. The overall rate of deterioration then has two components, the rate and the severity of deterioration. These combine to lower the fitness of alleles, but at the same time expose a longer series of potentially beneficial alleles and thereby increase the mutation supply rate. At some point the supply of mutations is sufficient to allow selection to restore adaptation, and the population comes into a dynamic equilibrium with its continually worsening environment. Long-term mean fitness depends on the frequency of change but not on its severity (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>). Although a more severe change will produce a steeper decline in mean fitness, adaptation will be restored more effectively because selection will be more intense. The depression of mean fitness can be expressed relative to a comparable population whose environment does not change. Numerical simulation of a mutational landscape model suggests that mean fitness 
  <span class="italic">w</span>
  <sub>s</sub> = 
  <span class="italic">w</span>
  <sub>0</sub>–
  <span class="italic">b</span> ln(1/
  <span class="italic">E</span>), where 
  <span class="italic">b</span> ≍ 0.1 and 
  <span class="italic">w</span>
  <sub>0</sub> depends on the mutation supply rate (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>). This result does not seem to depend on the details of the model: a fixed allelic series, or even a model with fitness increments of equal size, yields similar results. It suggests that populations may be able to adapt to quite rapid deterioration, provided that the mutation supply rate is fairly large.
