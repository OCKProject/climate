 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is widely believed that most populations, most of the time, should have become well adapted to their conditions of life through the past operation of natural selection. Mutation is generally deleterious, at least in natural conditions (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">Keightley and Lynch 2003</a>). Environmental change tends to move the average phenotype of well-adapted populations further from its optimal value and thereby to reduce mean fitness. Moreover, enemies such as pathogens and predators are likely to be selected to exploit the most frequent types in their target populations, driving a continuous reduction in mean fitness (
