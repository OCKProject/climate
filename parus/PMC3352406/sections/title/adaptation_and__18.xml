 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the studies we have described, experimental evolution overlaps with shorter-term studies involving phytoplankton responses to global change. There are, however, some noteworthy issues that experimental evolution is uniquely equipped to study. One of the most obvious features of contemporary global change is that the increase in CO
  <sub>2</sub> is much more rapid than in the geological past. While it seems clear that rates of environmental change should have a systematic effect on evolutionary outcomes, there is little explicit discussion of how this may occur. Both short-term (physiology) and long-term (evolution) experiments typically begin by suddenly placing a population in a stressful environment. The population is then allowed to either acclimate (reach some sort of steady-state physiological response) or adapt (reach some sort of steady-state evolutionary response). By contrast, global change is occurring gradually, so that populations will experience a continuous range of intermediate environments. A few simulation studies have made testable predictions about the effect of constantly changing environments on adaptive outcomes, in particular that lower rates of environmental change affect the dynamics of adaptive walks by reducing the fitness effect of fixed beneficial mutations, and increasing the range of time where the substitutions of largest effect are likely to occur. In addition, adaptation to slower rates of environmental change results in fewer possible outcomes relative to lineages that adapt to a sudden change (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">Kopp and Hermisson 2007</a>). These simulations are in good agreement with mathematical models quantifying the lag with which a population is able to track a changing environment (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">Broom et al. 2003</a>). At present, there are no published experimental tests of these hypotheses. Understanding how rates of environmental change affect evolutionary outcomes will help interpret laboratory experiments, where environments must be changed much faster than natural environments, and to use historical data more effectively, where rates of global change were many orders of magnitude slower than contemporary climate change.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the above studies, how can experimental evolution help us to make predictions, or at least educated guesses, about future populations of phytoplankton and how much carbon they may sink? Based on the sparse experimental data, it is likely that phytoplankton will evolve in response to elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub>. The direct evolutionary response may not be adaptive, however, and may instead result in populations that are less productive than their ancestors. It is likely that rising CO
  <sub>2</sub> will also cause changes in phytoplankton community composition. Although there are predictions as to what these changes might be (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b77" href="#b77">Rost et al. 2003</a>), they have yet to be tested using assemblages that have had the opportunity to undergo both ecological interactions and evolutionary change. At present, we are not in a position to make an informed guess about the composition of future phytoplankton communities, nor do we know how competitive interactions may alter the evolutionary response to elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main practical limitation to understand microalgal evolutionary responses to global change is simply the lack of published studies. There is no basis for determining how much variation in evolutionary responses is likely to exist within or between taxa. Work in terrestrial systems near CO
  <sub>2</sub> springs suggests that long-term responses vary idiosyncratically within or between taxa (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">Bettarini et al. 1999</a>), whereas in microalgal communities at the same springs different genera responded in much the same way (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">Collins and Bell 2006</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although detailed natural history information is needed to understand how the biology of particular taxa may change, there are also aspects of general evolutionary theory relevant to understanding the likely effects of global change on phytoplankton populations. As one of the important effects is likely to be a shift in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton communities, it will be necessary to understand how ecological processes such as competition and predation affect evolutionary outcomes. This research program is well-advanced, and general patterns are already beginning to emerge (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">Brockhurst 2007</a>). A second area where advances in general theory will help is in expanding our understanding of adaptation to accommodate more complex environmental change, such as constantly changing environments or scenarios where several aspects of the environment change simultaneously. Our current basis for understanding adaptation is most useful when a large, well-adapted population is subjected to a sudden change, and then allowed to adapt to a stable environment. While this is often a useful and sufficient simplification, it does not allow us to learn as much as possible from historical data or laboratory experiments that investigate responses to global change.
