 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonal timing of life-cycle events like reproduction, migration, hibernation, and molt has major fitness consequences. In a given environment, the timing of the optimal periods for each of these stages varies from year to year, which leads to strong interannual variation in timing of the life-cycle stages in many species. While day length (photoperiod) influences seasonal timing

  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Rowan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Rowan1">[2]</a>, it cannot account for interannual variation. Ambient temperature is the environmental variable that often best correlates with this variation in timing: many species flower, breed, or end hibernation earlier in warmer years

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonal timing is correlated to temperatures, which have increased at an unprecedented rate over the past decades because of global warming. These increases have in turn led to changes in seasonal timing, and many species, including humans, are currently shifting their seasonal behaviors 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Buckley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Buckley1">[7]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Parmesan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Parmesan1">[8]</a>. However, plants, insects, and vertebrates shift their timing differently, possibly because the relevant temperatures for these groups change at different rates, or because (the nonchanging) photoperiod plays a more important role in timing in some groups than in others. As a consequence, many organisms become progressively mismatched to their food supply 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Thackeray1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Thackeray1">[9]</a>. This increasing mismatch in timing can affect population viability and lead to natural selection on the mechanisms underlying timing, especially on the intensity with which ambient temperature affects timing. The key question is whether species will be able to adapt fast enough to keep up with their changing world

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A large body of literature, using excellent phenological time-series and large spatiotemporal datasets, demonstrates a correlation between temperature and timing 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Crick1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Crick1">[3]</a>–
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Inouye1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Inouye1">[6]</a>. However, the temperature ranges as well as the seasonal temperature patterns under which these long-term datasets were collected have changed and will continue to change due to global warming. Therefore, historical data will not accurately predict how organisms will respond to these new conditions 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Visser1">[10]</a>, highlighting the need for a more mechanistic understanding of how temperature affects seasonal timing 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Chown1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Chown1">[11]</a>–
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Sultan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Sultan1">[13]</a>. We know that seasonal timing in animals is orchestrated by underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms, but for most taxa we don't understand how these mechanisms are affected by ambient temperature—a critical piece of the puzzle needed to predict how organisms might be constrained in their ability to change their timing under global warming 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Chevin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Chevin1">[14]</a>–

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Endotherms have evolved a unique system for maintaining a relatively constant body temperature under a large range of ambient temperatures. Nonetheless, most endothermic species living outside the tropics are still truly seasonal, with the most energy-demanding stages of their life cycles restricted to periods when temperature is mild, or when food (also often temperature-restricted) is plentiful 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Visser2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Visser2">[18]</a>. While it is easy to conceive that temperature should affect seasonal timing in ectotherms, as ambient temperature directly limits enzymatic activities in these species, metabolism can function independently of ambient temperature in birds and mammals. This raises the central question: what physiological mechanisms operate in endotherms that allow ambient temperature to influence seasonal timing? We combine a mechanistic approach of temperature perception with insights from both natural observations and experimental studies about causal temperature effects on seasonal timing in endotherms to provide an integrated research road map to address this mystery.
