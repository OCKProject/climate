 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elevated prolactin (PRL) concentrations, which are associated with gonadal growth, incubation, lactation, and onset of molt, have been suggested as a possible mediator of temperature on seasonality (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001517-g001" href="#pbio-1001517-g001">Figure 1B</a>). However, depending on experimental approaches and species studied, high temperatures have been shown to elevate, have no effect on, or even decrease PRL concentrations

  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Visser3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Visser3">[54]</a>. For example, in sparrows high temperature is associated with both elevated PRL titers and gonadal growth 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Maney1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Maney1">[55]</a>, while in starlings high temperature is associated with a decrease in PRL and gonadal size and an earlier onset of molt 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Dawson3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Dawson3">[52]</a>. More studies on the relationship between temperature, PRL, and seasonality are therefore needed.
