 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In mammals and birds, the same brain areas that receive information about internal and external temperatures also express various neuropeptides that control aspects of seasonality. For example, the cell bodies of the GnRH-I neuronal system that controls reproduction in most vertebrates are present in the POA and adjacent septum

  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Muske1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Muske1">[64]</a>, the same brain regions that integrate information from internal and external temperature (see above). The neuron populations that sense and integrate temperature information within the POA could thus be directly connected to the neuronal systems that control the activation of the reproductive organs, without any intermediate mechanism (
