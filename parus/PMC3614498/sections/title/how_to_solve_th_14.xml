 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand how ambient temperature is causally involved in seasonal timing in endotherms, we need to link the many physiological studies of temperature perception, mostly in a context of thermoregulation (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001517-g001" href="#pbio-1001517-g001">Figure 1A</a>), with studies of the mechanisms underlying seasonal timing, mostly in response to photoperiod (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001517-g001" href="#pbio-1001517-g001">Figure 1B</a>). Ecologists studying seasonal timing may play a decisive role in establishing this link, since the temperature ranges that matter in a context of seasonal timing are probably very different from those in thermoregulation, and ambient temperature acts on seasonal timing in a much more subtle way than photoperiod does 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Visser2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Visser2">[18]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Wingfield3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Wingfield3">[65]</a>. In addition, temperature should be viewed as an environmental signal (i.e., cue) that predicts future environmental conditions, and not only as a factor that constrains homeostasis by posing energetic challenges to the animal. As a consequence, ecologists must provide physiologists with a number of appropriate model systems: experimental set-ups with specific species kept under two specific temperature patterns, leading to a clear difference in timing between the two experimental groups.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Choosing species with appropriate ecologies is the first key task for ecologists. Avian species such as zebra finches (
  <span class="italic">Taeniopygia guttata</span>) are not appropriate as they use other cues (e.g., rain fall) for orchestrating their seasonal timing 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Zann1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Zann1">[66]</a>. In mammals, where there are still few clear examples of an effect of temperature on timing, the choice of appropriate species may be more challenging. The first step might thus be to collect more data on the causal relationship between ambient temperature and seasonal timing, though the ecology of some mammalian species rules them out as potential candidates. Species with long gestation lengths are unlikely to use temperature cues for the timing of their mating as environmental conditions at the time of follicle fertilization are unlikely to predict environmental conditions months later, when the young are raised. Since species vary in their ecology, drawing general conclusions about the potential effects of a warming climate on endotherms will require the description of the relationships between temperature and phenology in a variety of model species. Within species, individuals might also differ in how they perceive, interpret, and translate temperature information into effector pathways, which has to be taken into account. For example, primates of different ages (including humans) vary in their temperature perception and thermoregulatory capacities 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Aujard1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Aujard1">[67]</a>–
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Sato1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Sato1">[69]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecologists also need to provide physiologists with “reference experiments" in which temperature treatments are known to induce substantial differences in timing between experimental groups. We have highlighted some life-cycle stages and studies that exemplify such reference experiments (an increasing temperature affects timing of reproduction in great tits, the absolute temperature value influences molting patterns in different mammalian and bird species, etc.). Crucially, at any time it must be clear how far off animals are from their seasonal timing event so that when measurements are made it is clear which group is closer to the average timing event and which is further away. Preferably these are set-ups in which ambient temperature acts directly rather than indirectly (e.g., via food abundance) or as a constraint (e.g., low temperatures with food-deprived animals). Keeping animals exposed to artificial temperature patterns in controlled laboratory conditions fed ad libitum fulfills those requirements.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecologists and physiologists then need to join forces to identify the appropriate seasonal timing outputs that will be measured. A key question is whether we need to directly measure the phenotypic trait of interest (parturition date, onset of hibernation, etc.), or if we can rely on physiological proxies (e.g., hormonal concentrations, gonadal size, fat stores, etc.; see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001517-g001" href="#pbio-1001517-g001">Figure 1</a>). Using proxies has clear experimental advantages as they are usually easier to quantify than the phenotypic trait itself 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Huey1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Huey1">[70]</a>. However, in birds, for example, the validity of the most commonly used proxies for breeding have recently been questioned 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Schaper1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Schaper1">[71]</a>, so should be used with care.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once appropriate species and reference experiments have been defined, physiologists need to identify the pathways through which ambient temperature cues are integrated and translated into effector mechanisms modulating seasonal timing. How ambient temperature is perceived and integrated at the brain level has mostly been elucidated in mammals by scientists working on thermoregulation and nociception. The effector mechanisms that modulate seasonal timing have been mostly studied in birds by environmental endocrinologists and neurobiologists. Insight could also come from research conducted in very different models, even plants. Photoperiodic control of flowering in 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span>, for example, was successfully unraveled by taking the influence of the circadian system as a starting point, leading to the discovery of crucial proteins that link circadian photoperiodism with temperature influences (e.g., 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Henderson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Henderson1">[72]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Pieiro1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Pieiro1">[73]</a>). In vertebrates, we are currently at an earlier stage of discovery, but recently developed knowledge on mammalian circadian mechanisms in photoperiodism could be an excellent starting point, paralleling the discovery process in plant phenology. In any case, these different fields should now unite their efforts to describe the missing pieces of the puzzle. We provided four hypothetical pathways through which integrated temperature cues could mediate seasonal timing that could be tested using the reference experiments defined above.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have argued that the link between ambient temperature perception and the effector mechanisms resides in the brain, while others have suggested that some environmental cues might affect only pathways downstream of the central nervous system, at the level of the gonads, for example 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-Williams1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Williams1">[74]</a>. If that were the case, the question of how ambient temperature regulates seasonal timing would represent an even greater mystery.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The unsolved mystery of the causal effect of temperature on seasonal timing is a major obstacle to the understanding of the biological consequences of climate change. The European Commission aims to limit the global average temperature rise to 2°C compared to the preindustrial period 
  <a rid="pbio.1001517-European1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-European1">[75]</a>. However, without a full understanding of how endotherms perceive and use seasonal temperature cues, the biological relevance of this 2°C upper limit cannot be properly assessed. Most of the resources and techniques necessary for revealing the link between environmental temperature and seasonal timing are already in place. Now we need to organize our diverse disciplines around common goals to solve this mystery together.
