 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How the temperature information that reaches the brain is translated into physiological responses related to seasonal timing is probably the most important missing piece of the puzzle. In an attempt to stimulate research, we identified four pathways that we consider worthy of investigation (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(1) Thyroid hormones</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thyroid hormones are essential intermediates in the photoperiodic organization of seasonality in endotherms 
   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Hanon1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Hanon1">[41]</a>,
   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Nakao1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Nakao1">[42]</a>. For example, long day lengths upregulate the enzyme (Dio2) that catalyzes the deiodination of thyroxine (T
   <sub>4</sub>) into its metabolic active form, triiodothyronine (T
   <sub>3</sub>), within the hypothalamus. T
   <sub>3</sub> in turn stimulates reproduction by promoting the release of GnRH from neurons that originate in the POA and hypothalamus in birds 
   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Yamamura1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Yamamura1">[43]</a> and mammals 
   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Hut1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Hut1">[44]</a>. In several bird species, ambient temperature simultaneously affects the plasma concentrations of thyroid hormones and gonad size

   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Wingfield2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Wingfield2">[46]</a>, and early breeding sparrows were shown to have higher basal metabolic rates and titers of T
   <sub>3</sub>
   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Chastel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Chastel1">[47]</a>. In mammalian brown adipose tissue (BAT), adrenergic signaling through sympathetic innervation upregulates Dio2 expression, which in turn increases local T
   <sub>3</sub> levels and activates BAT cells to produce heat in response to low ambient temperatures

   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Silva1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Silva1">[51]</a>. Thus, thyroid hormones could influence timing directly or indirectly via their effects on metabolism (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elevated prolactin (PRL) concentrations, which are associated with gonadal growth, incubation, lactation, and onset of molt, have been suggested as a possible mediator of temperature on seasonality (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001517-g001" href="#pbio-1001517-g001">Figure 1B</a>). However, depending on experimental approaches and species studied, high temperatures have been shown to elevate, have no effect on, or even decrease PRL concentrations 
   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Dawson3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Dawson3">[52]</a>–
   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Visser3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Visser3">[54]</a>. For example, in sparrows high temperature is associated with both elevated PRL titers and gonadal growth 
   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Maney1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Maney1">[55]</a>, while in starlings high temperature is associated with a decrease in PRL and gonadal size and an earlier onset of molt 
   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Dawson3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Dawson3">[52]</a>. More studies on the relationship between temperature, PRL, and seasonality are therefore needed.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Melatonin (MEL), produced by the pineal gland at night, is seen as the internal mirror representation of day length and is critical in coordinating seasonal timing in mammals

   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Ono1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Ono1">[57]</a>. Birds, however, do not need MEL for responding to long day lengths (because of direct hypothalamic photosensitivity 
   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Sharp1">[58]</a>). Nonetheless, MEL has been proposed to modulate sensitivity to environmental cues, and recent studies have shown that MEL influences the onset of laying and its underlying mechanisms

   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Gwinner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Gwinner1">[61]</a>. MEL has been mostly studied in relation to photoperiod, but there is some evidence that temperature can affect both MEL fluctuations and the associated circadian rhythmicity (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In mammals and birds, the same brain areas that receive information about internal and external temperatures also express various neuropeptides that control aspects of seasonality. For example, the cell bodies of the GnRH-I neuronal system that controls reproduction in most vertebrates are present in the POA and adjacent septum

   <a rid="pbio.1001517-Muske1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1001517-Muske1">[64]</a>, the same brain regions that integrate information from internal and external temperature (see above). The neuron populations that sense and integrate temperature information within the POA could thus be directly connected to the neuronal systems that control the activation of the reproductive organs, without any intermediate mechanism (
