 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual heterogeneity in life histories shape ecological and evolutionary processes, but is often ignored in models applied to study eco-evolutionary dynamics. We propose that separating static and dynamic traits provides a conceptual general framework for individual heterogeneity. The framework is complementary to ageâ€“stage-structured models, but specifically includes individual-level properties and requires only one estimate for heritability of each static trait. Demographic models are powerful tools to study the underlying mechanisms of eco-evolutionary dynamics and other processes. The perspective introduced here can provide a useful extension to these approaches, and we hope that future applications may answer some of the many interesting questions that require a detailed knowledge of the mechanisms shaping eco-evolutionary processes.</p>
