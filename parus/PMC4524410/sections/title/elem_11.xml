 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this section, we discuss another potential application of the conceptual model framework, to study eco-evolutionary dynamics. It is now widely recognised that evolutionary changes can happen also over shorter time scales that are relevant to ecological processes (Schoener, 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2011</a>). Ecological and evolutionary processes interact to determine the dynamics of a population, through simultaneous changes in the underlying genetic and demographic structure (Pelletier 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2009</a>; Smallegange &amp; Coulson 
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2013</a>). Thus, both processes should be considered when aiming to understand and predict population responses to external impacts, such as harvesting or climate change. The topic of eco-evolutionary dynamics is wide, and a number of different approaches are available, some of which also consider structured populations (Hairston 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2005</a>; Pelletier 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2009</a>; Ellner 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2011</a>; Schoener, 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2011</a>). Here, we focus on demographic approaches (IPMs and matrix models) and how the model framework introduced here can provide a useful step towards more realistic descriptions of eco-evolutionary dynamics in these models.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The term eco-evolutionary dynamics has also been used differently in the literature. Smallegange &amp; Coulson (
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2013</a>) define it as simultaneous changes in parameters of interest to ecologists, such as population size, and in parameters of interest to evolutionary biologists, such as strength of selection. Others have used more restrictive definitions requiring a change in the genetic composition in response to selection as well as in population dynamical properties (Pelletier 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2009</a>; Schoener, 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2011</a>). Studying simultaneous responses in multiple life-history parameters, as advocated by Smallegange &amp; Coulson (
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2013</a>), provides a more detailed picture than the responses of 
  <span class="italic">λ</span> (average fitness) alone. But demographic models such as matrix models have been applied to study such simultaneous changes for a long time without using the term eco-evolutionary dynamics (Caswell, 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2001</a>). Changes can occur in parameters that are 
  <span class="italic">important</span> to evolution (e.g. age-specific selection differentials), without necessarily leading to an evolutionary change in the underlying genetic composition (which also requires available genetic variation for selection to act upon). To emphasise this point, we therefore prefer the more narrow definition assuming changes in the genetic composition, even though it can be challenging to detect such changes empirically. Note that this definition does not preclude models or analyses based on the phenotypic level.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since IPMs incorporate continuous traits as well as potential heritability (i.e. part of the variation in a static trait that is genetically transmitted to offspring; Danchin, 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2013</a>) through the offspring trait distribution, they provide a good starting point for modelling eco-evolutionary dynamics (Smallegange &amp; Coulson 
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2013</a>). However, so far many applications have been based on one trait, usually a measure of body size (but see e.g. Plard 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b54" ref-type="bibr" href="#b54">2015</a>). Taking body size as an example, we highlight three limitations to such a model in describing evolutionary dynamics. First, if heritability is modelled through a positive correlation between parent and offspring size, then genetic effects are confounded with ontogeny since individuals tend to grow over life. Then, older parents will also tend to have larger offspring than younger parents, regardless of their own size as offspring. Second, initial differences in offspring size will tend to become weaker over age in such a model, since latent individual differences in growth will be included as random variation instead. Thus, if somatic growth has a genetic component causing some individuals to grow consistently faster than others, this would not be sufficiently captured by a model based on size alone. Third, any potential non-linear effects of genotype (static trait) on growth rate as well as on other vital rates, are ignored, as are potential correlations between vital rates (such as trade-offs) induced by the genotype. These issues apply to all models that include only a dynamic trait and aim to consider eco-evolutionary dynamics, but can largely be mitigated by including a static trait representing individual effects.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an interesting recent study of hunted bighorn sheep (
  <span class="italic">Ovis canadensis</span>) Traill 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">2014</a>) used a size-structured two-sex IPM to evaluate the causes of changes in the body size distribution, including heritability of body size. The results of this model suggested that effects of heritability were small compared to other causes, i.e. that evolution was less important than demography. Our model framework could be applied to this system, for instance using offspring size as a static trait (as for pike in the above model). This would provide a robustness check of these results by separating genetic effects from ontogenetic development, and by allowing for lasting individual effects of offspring size through the life history.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both dynamic and static traits will in most applications to natural populations be phenotypic traits, as the underlying genetics are typically not observed. Continuous traits can often be treated as quantitative genetic traits (assumed to be determined by many genes of small effect), decomposing variation into an additive genetic and an environmental component (Coulson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2010</a>). Heritability should ideally be estimated from genetic data, but could also be estimated from the slope of the parent–offspring regression of observed phenotypes (Coulson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2010</a>). Discrete traits are sometimes determined by just a few alleles on one locus, and in a few cases the underlying mechanisms of genetic inheritance can be explicitly modelled. The wolf model employed by Coulson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2011</a>) provides a nice example, where coat colour (black or grey) is determined by two alleles on a locus. In 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S4</a>, we provide another example based on the model of red and green individuals in example 1. In these cases, the dynamics of the model become frequency dependent, and will also depend on assumptions regarding the mating system.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another demographic approach to modelling eco-evolutionary dynamics is that of age–stage-structured models (Coulson &amp; Tuljapurkar 
  <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2008</a>). This is a flexible framework where individual variation in life histories can be included through various combinations of ages and stages. The model with static and dynamic traits can in principle be converted to an age–stage-structured model, as individuals always have an age, regardless of whether it is measured (Caswell, 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2001</a>). It is conceptually different by focusing on separating dynamic and static traits (note that the dynamic trait can be age, but is not limited to this), and the static trait is always constant over the lifetime of an individual. In age–stage-structured models, age is always included, and the stage may also change over the lifetime (e.g. size). The frameworks also differ in how heritability is included. Because the static trait is constant over the lifetime, only one heritability estimate is required for this framework (i.e. one for each static trait) as genetic effects can be modelled in this trait. An age–stage-structured model generally requires one heritability estimate for each age. The two frameworks, age–stage-structured models and the framework discussed here, thus represent different and complementary ways of thinking about eco-evolutionary dynamics in structured populations. We believe that the new perspective provided by separating static and dynamic traits will be a useful addition to the expanding toolkit of demographic models, in particular for applications to eco-evolutionary dynamics.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Example 3 Effects of temperature on demographic outputs in pike:</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an example of how conclusions can be affected by changing heritability of the static trait, we again consider the pike model introduced in the previous section (example 2). Here, the static trait 
   <span class="italic">y</span> is length at age 1 and the dynamic trait 
   <span class="italic">x</span> is length. In addition, the model includes temperature effects on each vital rate (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S3</a>; Vindenes 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" href="#b75">2014</a>). We now ask how the various demographic outputs depend on temperature, and compare the results for two scenarios: one with zero heritability of 
   <span class="italic">y</span> (as in example 2), and one with a heritability of 0.6 (slope of relationship between parent and offspring values of 
   <span class="italic">y</span>; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>). Note that this heritability is not estimated from data, as we do not have the pedigree, and is here assumed to represent additive genetic effects. The model is female-only, thus we implicitly assume that males and females have the same life history in this example. In the model with a 0.6 heritability, the intercept of the mean offspring length was adjusted and variance in offspring length was reduced, so that the offspring length distribution would be the same for the two scenarios in the mean environment (temperature

   </div>C). In this example, we assume a negative effect of 
   <span class="italic">y</span> on survival (
   <span class="italic">α</span> = −0.05) in addition to the estimated effects on somatic growth as shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>.

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the relative individual advantage of a large or small 
   <span class="italic">y</span>, we considered the reproductive value, measuring the (expected) contribution of an individual with a certain trait combination to future population growth, relative to other individuals (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>). Note that this is not a measure of fitness in the sense that it predicts the increase of individuals of a certain 
   <span class="italic">y</span> value (having a genetic component) relative to others, as for a given environment (temperature) all trait combinations will eventually grow with the same rate 
   <span class="italic">λ</span> (Caswell, 
   <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2001</a>). However, it does tell us which individuals and trait combinations are the main drivers of the population dynamics within each environment and heritability scenario. In the model including heritability, individuals of large 
   <span class="italic">y</span> (and 
   <span class="italic">x</span>) have the highest reproductive value, while the pattern is opposite when the heritability of 
   <span class="italic">y</span> is zero (shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a> for the average temperature; these patterns are not qualitatively affected by temperature changes).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>) also revealed a large effect of heritability on the temperature effect on all demographic outputs, even reversing the effect in many cases. The underlying mechanisms are complex because temperature has different effects on each vital rate across body length. In short, with no heritability of 
   <span class="italic">y</span> any effect of this trait on fitness occurs through survival and growth. Since the reproductive value is smaller for individuals of large 
   <span class="italic">y</span> in this case, the positive effects of increased somatic growth do not outweigh the negative effects on later survival. In the model including heritability, however, 
   <span class="italic">y</span> can also affect fitness through reproduction. Here, 
   <span class="italic">y</span> will have a positive effect through offspring length since larger offspring tend to have a higher survival than smaller ones. Together, the positive effects of 
   <span class="italic">y</span> on reproduction (through offspring size) and growth are in this case outweighing the negative effects on survival. This example highlights the potentially large role of heritability in eco-evolutionary dynamics.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we considered the changes in the stable trait distribution of 
   <span class="italic">x</span> and 
   <span class="italic">y</span> between two temperatures (cold and warm), for the two heritability scenarios (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>). In both cases, the distributions are changing with temperature, demonstrating that even in a model without heritability the trait distribution will shift. However, the effects are larger for the model including heritability, as in this case the net effect of temperature works in the same direction as the response to selection on body size (because large 
   <span class="italic">y</span> individuals are at an advantage in the model including inheritance, the stable distribution is shifted towards higher mean 
   <span class="italic">y</span>). In other cases, however, it is possible at least over shorter time periods that environmental plastic changes acts in opposite direction to the effects of selection, resulting in an apparently unchanging phenotypic trait distribution even if the genotypic composition is altered (Hairston 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.
