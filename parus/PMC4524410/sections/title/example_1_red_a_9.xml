 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate the results for a simple case where the ‘true’ population structure is known, we developed a theoretical example of a size-structured population with red and green individuals (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>, supplementary R code). Here, each vital rate depends on size as well as colour, and each colour represents a different life-history strategy. For the purpose of illustration, we assume that this population is studied by three biologists, where the first recognises both size and colour and includes them in the model. The second biologist is colour-blind (incidentally, this is the case for one of the authors of this study) and only includes the size differences. The third is in a hurry and does not account for either size or colour, modelling all individuals as equal. How different would their conclusions on the various demographic outputs be, assuming there are no other sources of error than the model choice?

   <p>An example of a size-structured population of red and green individuals. Depending on whether colour and size is recognised, the vital rates will look different to the observer, as illustrated for survival and fecundity in panels (a–c) (for transition rates, see the provided R code). As a result, with the exception of 
    <span class="italic">λ</span> estimates of demographic outputs will be biased in models b and c. Consequences of underlying heterogeneity on estimates of extinction risk (through demographic and environmental variance) are provided in the supplementary R code.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Figure 2</a> compares the demographic outputs obtained from each case. With the exception of 
  <span class="italic">λ</span>, all parameters are biased in the models ignoring colour and/or size, and the model ignoring both traits is generally doing the worst job, as expected. The demographic variance stands out from the general pattern, as the model ignoring only colour underestimates it while the unstructured model overestimates it.
