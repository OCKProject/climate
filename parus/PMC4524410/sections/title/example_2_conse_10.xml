 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an empirical example, we consider the demography and dynamics of a population of pike (
  <span class="italic">Esox lucius</span>) from Windermere, UK, for which unique long-term individual-based data are available (Le Cren, 
  <a rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" href="#b39">2001</a>). A length- and temperature-dependent IPM was recently developed for this population (Vindenes 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" href="#b75">2014</a>). In 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S3</a>, we extend this model to also include individual effects through length at age 1 (
  <span class="italic">y</span>, static trait), reflecting early growth differences. Note that in this example, the static and dynamic traits are the same (and therefore perfectly correlated) in offspring. The exact underlying mechanisms of early growth differences are not known, but likely arise from a combination of genetic and environmental effects. From other studies, we know that temperature and food availability during the first year are key determinants of somatic growth (Casselman, 
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">1996</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Figure 3</a> shows the vital rates as functions of the static and dynamic trait. Size ranks among individuals are largely maintained over the lifetime, so that initially large pike tend to grow persistently faster over their lifetime and reach a larger final size than those starting out small. These growth differences lead to lifelong fitness consequences through the indirect effects of 
  <span class="italic">y</span> on survival and fecundity, as larger individuals tend to have higher values of these rates (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). In addition, we included a direct effect of 
  <span class="italic">y</span> on survival, measured by the constant 
  <span class="italic">α</span> (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S3</a>). Negative values of 
  <span class="italic">α</span> correspond to a survival trade-off associated with rapid early growth, while positive values correspond to a case where rapid growth is also associated with higher survival (‘quality’ differences). The data were not sufficient to quantify this effect, but indicated it would be negative (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S3</a>). We therefore evaluated the results for a range of values of 
  <span class="italic">α</span>.

   <p>A length- and temperature-based model for pike, including length at age 1 as a static trait 
    <span class="italic">y</span> in addition to length 
    <span class="italic">x</span> and temperature 
    <span class="italic">T</span>. Vital rates (A–D) are shown here for the mean temperature (in this example

    </div> for offspring), for values in other temperatures see 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S3</a>. The parameter 
    <span class="italic">α</span> measures the effect of 
    <span class="italic">y</span> on survival, negative values correspond to a negative effect and thus a trade-off with growth. Positive values correspond to positive effects representing ‘quality’ differences among individuals. Panels (E and F) show the resulting bias in various demographic outputs in a model that ignores 
    <span class="italic">y</span>, as a function of 
    <span class="italic">α</span>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results show that the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity in 
  <span class="italic">y</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>) are smallest when 
  <span class="italic">y</span> only affects growth (
  <span class="italic">α</span> = 0). The growth model ignoring heterogeneity was in this case able to capture the average growth quite accurately, and the main error arising from ignoring heterogeneity is that the systematic individual variation is treated as random variation, with limited consequences for most demographic outputs. In addition, since 
  <span class="italic">y</span> is approximately lognormally distributed, the amount of heterogeneity is not extremely large in this model. However, when 
  <span class="italic">y</span> is also affecting survival, either through a positive or a negative effect, the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity become more severe for all the demographic outputs (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This example demonstrates the potential importance of life-history trade-offs also for the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity. Although life-history theory suggests that trade-offs between vital rates should be common (Roff, 
  <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">1996</a>), identifying them in empirical systems can be difficult (van Noordwijk &amp; de Jong 
  <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">1986</a>). A potential explanation could be that individual differences in resource acquisition affect the expression of the trade-offs so that they are stronger for individuals with low resources (Reznick 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">2000</a>). Here, the initially small pike increases their growth rate much at first, almost catching up with the larger ones, but then the growth rate declines and they tend to stop growing at a smaller final size (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). This pattern could potentially result from a stronger trade-off between growth and fecundity in these small individuals (being expressed when they start reproducing).
