 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intraspecific variation in properties affecting fitness is ubiquitous in natural populations, including morphological traits, behavioural traits and impacts of environmental factors like spatial location (Kendall &amp; Fox 
  <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">2002</a>; Vindenes 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2008</a>; Bolnick 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2011</a>). Such variation is an essential part of evolutionary theory, whereas in population ecology it is often ignored as the focus is typically on population-level (average) processes. Recently, however, the role of individual variation in shaping such ecological processes has received increasing interest (Wilson &amp; Nussey 
  <a rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" href="#b79">2010</a>; Bolnick 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2011</a>; de Valpine 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">2014</a>), and studies on eco-evolutionary dynamics have emphasised the link between ecological and evolutionary processes on a contemporary time scale (Schoener, 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2011</a>; Smallegange &amp; Coulson 
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2013</a>). An increased understanding of the underlying mechanisms of eco-evolutionary dynamics is essential to answer many of the currently important questions in biology, such as how fast species will adapt to environmental impacts (Pelletier 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b52" ref-type="bibr" href="#b52">2007</a>; Smallegange &amp; Coulson 
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Demographic population models like matrix models (Leslie, 
  <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">1945</a>; Lefkovitch, 
  <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">1965</a>; Caswell, 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2001</a>) and integral projection models (IPM; Easterling 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">2000</a>; Ellner &amp; Rees 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">2006</a>) connect individual-level processes like survival and reproduction, and population-level parameters describing the dynamics and average life history (Caswell &amp; John 
  <a rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10">1992</a>). However, the majority of applications of these models assume that individuals follow the same life-history trajectory, ignoring underlying individual differences. Classical theory for age structured populations provide useful descriptions of the average life history of a species, and have been successfully applied to explain interspecific differences (Fisher, 
  <a rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27">1930</a>; Charlesworth, 
  <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">1994</a>; Roff, 
  <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">1996</a>). Nonetheless, the average life history does not necessarily provide a good description of individual life histories.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A well-known example that a population-level average may not represent individual properties is the so-called ‘frailty effect’, referring to an apparent effect of reduced mortality over age that is actually caused by individual heterogeneity in survival (Vaupel 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">1979</a>). Thus, at the individual level, mortality may not be changing with age but the average mortality is. This effect of individual heterogeneity has important implications for our understanding of senescence (Vaupel &amp; Yashin 
  <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">1985</a>; Loison 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43">1999</a>; Caswell, 
  <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2014</a>). Similar mechanisms can shape any parameter of interest calculated for the average life history. For instance, in a study of monocarpic plants Rees 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="b59" ref-type="bibr" href="#b59">2000</a>) showed that the optimum flowering size as predicted from the average life history is not a good predictor of the optimum size in individual plants.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another important consequence of heterogeneity is that demographic outputs characterising population dynamics and life history (e.g. population growth rates, net reproductive rate, generation time and extinction risk) can be biased if the heterogeneity is not recognised and accounted for. Studies exploring such effects of unobserved heterogeneity have so far mainly focused on the effects on demographic stochasticity (arising from inherent randomness in demographic processes of individuals) and corresponding extinction risk (Conner &amp; White 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">1999</a>; Jager, 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2001</a>; Kendall &amp; Fox 
  <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">2002</a>; Vindenes 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2008</a>). We are not aware of studies considering consequences for any of the other demographic outputs mentioned above.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual heterogeneity can arise from additive genetic inheritance in fitness-related traits. Such traits can be quantitative genetic traits such as height or body mass, or discrete traits determined by few alleles (Coulson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2011</a>). Because they apply to continuous traits, IPMs have recently been proposed as a useful tool to model eco-evolutionary dynamics (Coulson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2010</a>; Smallegange &amp; Coulson 
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2013</a>). As they belong to the same general model class as matrix models they have the same analytical advantages (Ellner &amp; Rees 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2007</a>). However, so far a majority of applications have been based on one trait (usually some measure of body size), assuming all individuals have the same life history. Individual heterogeneity is sometimes accounted for in the estimation of parameters through random effects in the intercepts and/or slopes (Ellner &amp; Rees 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2007</a>; Coulson, 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2012</a>), but the final IPM is usually constructed for the mean life history, omitting these effects. Moreover, individual-level properties such as genotypes can affect the life history in complex ways that are difficult to capture through random effects. In a model based on just one trait, it can also be challenging to define heritability, in particular if the focal trait is one that develops over the lifetime (such as size). The so-called age–stage-structured models (Coulson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2010</a>) resolve some of these issues, but require one heritability measure for each age, and individual traits are not explicitly included.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we propose a conceptual demographic framework including individual heterogeneity in life histories, that can apply to both continuous (quantitative genetic) and discrete traits. We define the model in a general way that allows for several mechanisms of inheritance to be considered, both genetic and non-genetic (Danchin, 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2013</a>). This framework represents a complementary approach to age–stage-structured models that include individual-specific traits and that only requires one heritability estimate, rather than one for each age. We apply the framework to evaluate consequences of ignoring heterogeneity for a range of population dynamical and life-history parameters, extending and synthesising our knowledge of such effects. Second, we discuss how the framework can help advance demographic approaches to model eco-evolutionary dynamics and population responses to environmental impacts.
