 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an example of how conclusions can be affected by changing heritability of the static trait, we again consider the pike model introduced in the previous section (example 2). Here, the static trait 
  <span class="italic">y</span> is length at age 1 and the dynamic trait 
  <span class="italic">x</span> is length. In addition, the model includes temperature effects on each vital rate (

  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" href="#b75">2014</a>). We now ask how the various demographic outputs depend on temperature, and compare the results for two scenarios: one with zero heritability of 
  <span class="italic">y</span> (as in example 2), and one with a heritability of 0.6 (slope of relationship between parent and offspring values of 
  <span class="italic">y</span>; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>). Note that this heritability is not estimated from data, as we do not have the pedigree, and is here assumed to represent additive genetic effects. The model is female-only, thus we implicitly assume that males and females have the same life history in this example. In the model with a 0.6 heritability, the intercept of the mean offspring length was adjusted and variance in offspring length was reduced, so that the offspring length distribution would be the same for the two scenarios in the mean environment (temperature

  </div>C). In this example, we assume a negative effect of 
  <span class="italic">y</span> on survival (
  <span class="italic">α</span> = −0.05) in addition to the estimated effects on somatic growth as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the relative individual advantage of a large or small 
  <span class="italic">y</span>, we considered the reproductive value, measuring the (expected) contribution of an individual with a certain trait combination to future population growth, relative to other individuals (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>). Note that this is not a measure of fitness in the sense that it predicts the increase of individuals of a certain 
  <span class="italic">y</span> value (having a genetic component) relative to others, as for a given environment (temperature) all trait combinations will eventually grow with the same rate 
  <span class="italic">λ</span> (Caswell, 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2001</a>). However, it does tell us which individuals and trait combinations are the main drivers of the population dynamics within each environment and heritability scenario. In the model including heritability, individuals of large 
  <span class="italic">y</span> (and 
  <span class="italic">x</span>) have the highest reproductive value, while the pattern is opposite when the heritability of 
  <span class="italic">y</span> is zero (shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a> for the average temperature; these patterns are not qualitatively affected by temperature changes).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>) also revealed a large effect of heritability on the temperature effect on all demographic outputs, even reversing the effect in many cases. The underlying mechanisms are complex because temperature has different effects on each vital rate across body length. In short, with no heritability of 
  <span class="italic">y</span> any effect of this trait on fitness occurs through survival and growth. Since the reproductive value is smaller for individuals of large 
  <span class="italic">y</span> in this case, the positive effects of increased somatic growth do not outweigh the negative effects on later survival. In the model including heritability, however, 
  <span class="italic">y</span> can also affect fitness through reproduction. Here, 
  <span class="italic">y</span> will have a positive effect through offspring length since larger offspring tend to have a higher survival than smaller ones. Together, the positive effects of 
  <span class="italic">y</span> on reproduction (through offspring size) and growth are in this case outweighing the negative effects on survival. This example highlights the potentially large role of heritability in eco-evolutionary dynamics.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we considered the changes in the stable trait distribution of 
  <span class="italic">x</span> and 
  <span class="italic">y</span> between two temperatures (cold and warm), for the two heritability scenarios (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>). In both cases, the distributions are changing with temperature, demonstrating that even in a model without heritability the trait distribution will shift. However, the effects are larger for the model including heritability, as in this case the net effect of temperature works in the same direction as the response to selection on body size (because large 
  <span class="italic">y</span> individuals are at an advantage in the model including inheritance, the stable distribution is shifted towards higher mean 
  <span class="italic">y</span>). In other cases, however, it is possible at least over shorter time periods that environmental plastic changes acts in opposite direction to the effects of selection, resulting in an apparently unchanging phenotypic trait distribution even if the genotypic composition is altered (Hairston 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
