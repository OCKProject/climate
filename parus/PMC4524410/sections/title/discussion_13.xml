 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual heterogeneity in life histories plays an important role in both ecological and evolutionary processes, but can be challenging to incorporate in models (Metcalf &amp; Pavard 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2007</a>; Smallegange &amp; Coulson 
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2013</a>). We have introduced a conceptual framework of IPMs/matrix models separating static and dynamic traits, providing a flexible model for effects of heterogeneity. We now discuss some challenges and future opportunities for applications of such a framework.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The framework represents a complementary approach to age–stage-structured models, where individual effects are more explicitly included through the static trait. Instead of measuring a heritability at each age, only one measure is required. In the parameterisation of IPMs, individual heterogeneity is often accounted for in the statistical estimation of vital rates, by including individual random effects in mixed models (Ellner &amp; Rees 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2007</a>; Coulson, 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2012</a>). Using the framework presented here, the random intercept (or slopes) from such regressions could be used to define a static trait representing individual ‘quality’, an approach that could be particularly useful when the cause of individual heterogeneity is unknown (note that this approach can also be used to expand age/stage structured models to include individual heterogeneity). However, potential non-linear effects of the individual trait on the vital rates as well as interactions with the dynamic trait and environmental variables are then more difficult to include.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By separating static and dynamic traits effects of ontogeny can be separated from genetic effects in IPMs. It is likely that effects of heritability then become stronger than in IPMs based on just one (dynamic) trait. For instance, in our pike example, we found strong potential effects of heritability on the estimated population responses to temperature (example 3, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>). The study of Traill 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">2014</a>) based on a model with one dynamic trait did not find a strong effect, but applies to a species with a very different life history than pike. Future applications of the framework presented here could explore in more detail under which circumstances evolution is expected to explain more of the observed phenotypic changes, and for which species. It can also be used to compare the results of models that include a static and dynamic trait with models that include only the dynamic trait.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Application of the framework with empirical data is challenging as with all demographic models, as the data requirements are high. Ideally there should be individual-based information on all vital rates and traits considered (age, morphological measures, location, etc). In addition, heritability measures require at least a pedigree, and ideally genetic information. Finally, environmental data on key variables are needed to model and project consequences of environmental change. Depending on the study system and area, environmental data are often readily available, as are climatic models providing scenarios for future changes (Collins 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13">2013</a>). Despite these challenges, the valuable insights provided by demographic models into underlying mechanisms make the effort worthwhile (Clutton-Brock &amp; Sheldon 
  <a rid="b12" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12">2010</a>). We provided one example here based on a pike population, but even these unique long-term data were not sufficient to estimate all parts of the model. In place of empirical estimates, we made biologically realistic assumptions and tested the effects of varying these (survival effects through 
  <span class="italic">α</span> and presence or absence of heritability of size at age 1).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since obtaining such detailed data on individual traits can be highly expensive and difficult, it is important to know the potential consequences of ignoring heterogeneity for parameters of interest. We have demonstrated that besides the population growth rate 
  <span class="italic">λ</span>, a range of parameters (net reproductive rate, two measures of generation time, demographic variance, environmental variance) can be biased when underlying heterogeneity is ignored, and provided a general method for evaluating these consequences in specific cases. Our theoretical example shows that these biases are generally more severe when all of the structure is ignored, as expected, than if only part of the heterogeneity is ignored. The empirical example for pike demonstrated that the bias can increase with the number of vital rates affected by the static trait, and with the strength of the effect.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whether or not a biased parameter is a problem, and how much bias can be tolerated, will depend on the specific study goals and on how much other results and conclusions rely on the estimate. Generation time, for instance is an important measure used by, e.g., the IUCN Red List (IUCN, 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2014</a>) as one element in categorising the conservation status of a species, including as a scaling factor for other measures. Thus, in the worst case, the assigned conservation status of a species could be wrong if the generation time estimate is biased by ignoring heterogeneity. For cases where conclusions are sensitive to demographic outputs like generation time, extra effort to reveal hidden heterogeneity may therefore be warranted. The direction of the bias in each parameter depends on the underlying heterogeneity as well on as how much of it is ignored. The methods presented here provide a general tool for evaluating consequences of ignoring heterogeneity, also for other parameters than those considered here. The key to this approach is to define an unconditional model with respect to the trait that is ignored.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have also highlighted different uses of the terms heterogeneity and eco-evolutionary dynamics in the literature, and pointed out the importance of using the same definitions when results of different studies are compared. The conceptual framework introduced here can be used both to evaluate consequences of ignoring heterogeneity, as we have done in this study, and to study consequences of changes in the underlying population, for instance with respect to heterogeneity. In the latter case, it can be challenging to identify the relevant comparison population (i.e. the uniform population to which the heterogeneous population is compared). If the comparison population is defined by having the same average vital rates as in the heterogeneous population, our results regarding consequences of ignoring heterogeneity can also be interpreted as effects of changing heterogeneity. However, this may not always be the relevant comparison. An interesting question regarding changing heterogeneity is whether heterogeneity itself represents an adaptive property of a life history and under which conditions this can evolve (Kendall 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2011</a>). In this case, the relevant homogeneous comparison population would be that from which heterogeneity evolved. But is this a population where individuals had vital rates equal to the vital rates at birth in the heterogeneous population, or where the vital rates were equal to the average vital rates of the heterogeneous population, or something else? Separating adaptive from non-adaptive heterogeneity will also be a major challenge in such studies. Many different life histories can result in the same optimum fitness (Roff, 
  <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">1996</a>), that may also display different levels of heterogeneity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although it may seem obvious, we must also keep in mind that individual members of a population tend to have much in common, as after all they belong to the same species. Demographic models ignoring heterogeneity often do a good job of describing the population dynamics, at least for the deterministic case in a constant environment (Caswell, 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2001</a>). The extent to which individual life histories will differ from the population average may also be restricted by phylogenetic constraints. An elephant, for instance, cannot suddenly display a ‘mouse’ life history where many offspring are produced in one event. In most species, all individuals undergo substantial changes over their lifetime due to ontogenetic development and growth, and they often gain more experience as well. However, we do not yet have a detailed empirical understanding of how individual heterogeneity varies across the tree of life (Metcalf &amp; Pavard 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2007</a>), although some differences are apparent. In species of indeterminate growth, in particular, individual heterogeneity due to different growth rates can be substantial (Zuidema 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">2009</a>; de Valpine 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">2014</a>). Recently, Jones 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2014</a>) published patterns of age-specific mortality and fecundity for a range of species across different taxa, revealing large differences that we are only beginning to understand. Underlying heterogeneity can shape such patterns (Vaupel 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">1979</a>; Caswell, 
  <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2014</a>), but may be more or less important for different species. An interesting but challenging task would be to investigate patterns of individual heterogeneity in life history across species, as well as between different populations within species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several other applications of the framework are possible. In particular, it could be a powerful tool for investigating eco-evolutionary responses to climatic changes, as illustrated with our pike example. The framework allows key environmental drivers to affect all of the vital rates in different ways, and to interact with the dynamic and static traits. Moreover, consequences of changing environmental variability can be considered as well as changes in the mean. This is particularly relevant in cases where the environmental driver has differing and non-linear effects on the vital rates and population growth rate, which is likely common (García-Carreras &amp; Reuman 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2013</a>). Another potential application of the framework is to study the spread of invasive species, for instance to evaluate whether they are able to cross barriers and how fast this may happen. Finally, an interesting topic for future research would be to evaluate impacts of mating system in structured two-sex models (Schindler 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2013</a>) under varying levels of individual heterogeneity.
