  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consequences of ignoring heterogeneity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For most natural populations, we will never know all sources of heterogeneity, or be able to include them all in a model. Even if this were possible, obtaining the required data can be costly and time consuming, and the extra effort may not necessarily lead to a large difference in the results of interest. Thus, it is important to evaluate the potential consequences of ignoring heterogeneity, not the least whether certain parameters are more robust than others. In this section, we describe a general method for how this can be done, both for the case where the heterogeneity is completely ignored and the case where it is only partly ignored (that is, ignoring the static trait 
   <span class="italic">y</span> and/or the dynamic trait 
   <span class="italic">x</span>). In 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S2</a>, we derive results for a range of demographic outputs, and a summary is provided in Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" href="#tbl2">2</a>.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The term ‘heterogeneity’ has been used differently in the biological literature, which is important to keep in mind. In many cases, for instance studies on statistical estimation of vital rates (e.g. Burnham &amp; Rexstad 
   <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">1993</a>), heterogeneity is implicitly assumed to mean hidden and unobserved individual differences. This is also the interpretation in studies of effects of heterogeneity on patterns of ageing (Vaupel 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">1979</a>). When the goal is to evaluate consequences of ignoring such hidden heterogeneity, the problem is one of modelling error, as the underlying population is the same. Other studies consider effects of changing heterogeneity in the underlying population, for instance on the distribution of lifetime reproductive success (Tuljapurkar 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b71" ref-type="bibr" href="#b71">2009</a>; Caswell, 
   <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">2011</a>) and on the long-term population growth rate (Kendall 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2011</a>). This problem is one of comparing different underlying populations rather than models.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both of these general questions are interesting, but it is important to be aware of their differences, in particular when results of different studies are compared. For instance, Kendall 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
   <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2011</a>) found that heterogeneity affects the expected growth rate 
   <span class="italic">λ</span>, comparing a population where vital rates change over age with a uniform population starting with the same vital rates at birth that remain constant over age. Since these populations are different, this study did not evaluate consequences of ignoring heterogeneity, but rather effects of specific changes in the underlying population. Based on this result Kendall 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
   <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2011</a>) suggested that failure to recognise this effect on 
   <span class="italic">λ</span> had affected results of other studies, including a study of Vindenes 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
   <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2008</a>) on demographic stochasticity. However, the focus of Vindenes 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
   <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2008</a>) was to evaluate consequences of ignoring heterogeneity (comparing models, not populations) so there was by definition no effect on 
   <span class="italic">λ</span> in their model (a known demographic result that we demonstrate analytically for this model in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S2</a>). In the following, we will consider effects of ignoring heterogeneity, but in general the presented framework can also be used to explore consequences of changes in the underlying population.
  </p>

 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General approach</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the potential consequences of ignoring heterogeneity, we compare demographic outputs calculated from a model including heterogeneity (in this case, defined by a model with a static and a dynamic trait) to the corresponding parameters from models that partly or completely ignores the heterogeneity, i.e. ignoring either the static trait or both the static and dynamic trait. To derive the vital rates of these comparison models, we use the stable trait distribution (see details in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S2</a>). The model where both traits are ignored corresponds to an unstructured model of a uniform population, in which only the estimates of survival and fecundity are required to describe the dynamics. The case where only the static trait is ignored is slightly more complex, because transition functions of the dynamic trait must be derived as well. Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" href="#tbl2">2</a> summarises the resulting expressions for the vital rates for the underlying heterogeneous model and the two comparison models, as well as the resulting expressions for all the demographic outputs considered. A main conclusion from this analysis is that except for 
   <span class="italic">λ</span>, all parameters are generally affected by ignoring heterogeneity.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amount and direction of the bias in the models ignoring heterogeneity depend on the particular case being considered, that is the general life history, which vital rates are impacted by heterogeneity, and the amount of heterogeneity. While it is difficult to make predictions on the direction and amount of bias for the general case, the methods and results presented here provide a useful tool for evaluating consequences of heterogeneity in specific situations (to which the supplemented R code should be easily adapted). Two examples are provided below, one theoretical and one empirical, where some of these issues are discussed in more detail.</p>
  <sec class="sec">
   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Example 1 Red and green size-structured population:</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate the results for a simple case where the ‘true’ population structure is known, we developed a theoretical example of a size-structured population with red and green individuals (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>, supplementary R code). Here, each vital rate depends on size as well as colour, and each colour represents a different life-history strategy. For the purpose of illustration, we assume that this population is studied by three biologists, where the first recognises both size and colour and includes them in the model. The second biologist is colour-blind (incidentally, this is the case for one of the authors of this study) and only includes the size differences. The third is in a hurry and does not account for either size or colour, modelling all individuals as equal. How different would their conclusions on the various demographic outputs be, assuming there are no other sources of error than the model choice?

     <p>An example of a size-structured population of red and green individuals. Depending on whether colour and size is recognised, the vital rates will look different to the observer, as illustrated for survival and fecundity in panels (a–c) (for transition rates, see the provided R code). As a result, with the exception of 
      <span class="italic">λ</span> estimates of demographic outputs will be biased in models b and c. Consequences of underlying heterogeneity on estimates of extinction risk (through demographic and environmental variance) are provided in the supplementary R code.

The demographic variance stands out from the general pattern, as the model ignoring only colour underestimates it while the unstructured model overestimates it.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Example 2 Consequences of early growth differences in pike:</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an empirical example, we consider the demography and dynamics of a population of pike (
    <span class="italic">Esox lucius</span>) from Windermere, UK, for which unique long-term individual-based data are available (Le Cren, 
    <a rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" href="#b39">2001</a>). A length- and temperature-dependent IPM was recently developed for this population (Vindenes 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
    <a rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" href="#b75">2014</a>). In 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S3</a>, we extend this model to also include individual effects through length at age 1 (
    <span class="italic">y</span>, static trait), reflecting early growth differences. Note that in this example, the static and dynamic traits are the same (and therefore perfectly correlated) in offspring. The exact underlying mechanisms of early growth differences are not known, but likely arise from a combination of genetic and environmental effects. From other studies, we know that temperature and food availability during the first year are key determinants of somatic growth (Casselman, 
    <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">1996</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Figure 3</a> shows the vital rates as functions of the static and dynamic trait. Size ranks among individuals are largely maintained over the lifetime, so that initially large pike tend to grow persistently faster over their lifetime and reach a larger final size than those starting out small. These growth differences lead to lifelong fitness consequences through the indirect effects of 
    <span class="italic">y</span> on survival and fecundity, as larger individuals tend to have higher values of these rates (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). In addition, we included a direct effect of 
    <span class="italic">y</span> on survival, measured by the constant 
    <span class="italic">α</span> (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S3</a>). Negative values of 
    <span class="italic">α</span> correspond to a survival trade-off associated with rapid early growth, while positive values correspond to a case where rapid growth is also associated with higher survival (‘quality’ differences). The data were not sufficient to quantify this effect, but indicated it would be negative (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S3</a>). We therefore evaluated the results for a range of values of 
    <span class="italic">α</span>.

Positive values correspond to positive effects representing ‘quality’ differences among individuals. Panels (E and F) show the resulting bias in various demographic outputs in a model that ignores

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results show that the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity in 
    <span class="italic">y</span> (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>) are smallest when 
    <span class="italic">y</span> only affects growth (
    <span class="italic">α</span> = 0). The growth model ignoring heterogeneity was in this case able to capture the average growth quite accurately, and the main error arising from ignoring heterogeneity is that the systematic individual variation is treated as random variation, with limited consequences for most demographic outputs. In addition, since 
    <span class="italic">y</span> is approximately lognormally distributed, the amount of heterogeneity is not extremely large in this model. However, when 
    <span class="italic">y</span> is also affecting survival, either through a positive or a negative effect, the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity become more severe for all the demographic outputs (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This example demonstrates the potential importance of life-history trade-offs also for the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity. Although life-history theory suggests that trade-offs between vital rates should be common (Roff, 
    <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">1996</a>), identifying them in empirical systems can be difficult (van Noordwijk &amp; de Jong 
    <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">1986</a>). A potential explanation could be that individual differences in resource acquisition affect the expression of the trade-offs so that they are stronger for individuals with low resources (Reznick 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
    <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">2000</a>). Here, the initially small pike increases their growth rate much at first, almost catching up with the larger ones, but then the growth rate declines and they tend to stop growing at a smaller final size (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). This pattern could potentially result from a stronger trade-off between growth and fecundity in these small individuals (being expressed when they start reproducing).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eco-evolutionary dynamics</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this section, we discuss another potential application of the conceptual model framework, to study eco-evolutionary dynamics. It is now widely recognised that evolutionary changes can happen also over shorter time scales that are relevant to ecological processes (Schoener, 
   <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2011</a>). Ecological and evolutionary processes interact to determine the dynamics of a population, through simultaneous changes in the underlying genetic and demographic structure (Pelletier 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2009</a>; Smallegange &amp; Coulson 
   <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2013</a>). Thus, both processes should be considered when aiming to understand and predict population responses to external impacts, such as harvesting or climate change. The topic of eco-evolutionary dynamics is wide, and a number of different approaches are available, some of which also consider structured populations (Hairston 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2005</a>; Pelletier 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2009</a>; Ellner 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2011</a>; Schoener, 
   <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2011</a>). Here, we focus on demographic approaches (IPMs and matrix models) and how the model framework introduced here can provide a useful step towards more realistic descriptions of eco-evolutionary dynamics in these models.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The term eco-evolutionary dynamics has also been used differently in the literature. Smallegange &amp; Coulson (
   <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2013</a>) define it as simultaneous changes in parameters of interest to ecologists, such as population size, and in parameters of interest to evolutionary biologists, such as strength of selection. Others have used more restrictive definitions requiring a change in the genetic composition in response to selection as well as in population dynamical properties (Pelletier 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2009</a>; Schoener, 
   <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2011</a>). Studying simultaneous responses in multiple life-history parameters, as advocated by Smallegange &amp; Coulson (
   <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2013</a>), provides a more detailed picture than the responses of 
   <span class="italic">λ</span> (average fitness) alone. But demographic models such as matrix models have been applied to study such simultaneous changes for a long time without using the term eco-evolutionary dynamics (Caswell, 
   <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2001</a>). Changes can occur in parameters that are 
   <span class="italic">important</span> to evolution (e.g. age-specific selection differentials), without necessarily leading to an evolutionary change in the underlying genetic composition (which also requires available genetic variation for selection to act upon). To emphasise this point, we therefore prefer the more narrow definition assuming changes in the genetic composition, even though it can be challenging to detect such changes empirically. Note that this definition does not preclude models or analyses based on the phenotypic level.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since IPMs incorporate continuous traits as well as potential heritability (i.e. part of the variation in a static trait that is genetically transmitted to offspring; Danchin, 
   <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2013</a>) through the offspring trait distribution, they provide a good starting point for modelling eco-evolutionary dynamics (Smallegange &amp; Coulson 
   <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2013</a>). However, so far many applications have been based on one trait, usually a measure of body size (but see e.g. Plard 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b54" ref-type="bibr" href="#b54">2015</a>). Taking body size as an example, we highlight three limitations to such a model in describing evolutionary dynamics. First, if heritability is modelled through a positive correlation between parent and offspring size, then genetic effects are confounded with ontogeny since individuals tend to grow over life. Then, older parents will also tend to have larger offspring than younger parents, regardless of their own size as offspring. Second, initial differences in offspring size will tend to become weaker over age in such a model, since latent individual differences in growth will be included as random variation instead. Thus, if somatic growth has a genetic component causing some individuals to grow consistently faster than others, this would not be sufficiently captured by a model based on size alone. Third, any potential non-linear effects of genotype (static trait) on growth rate as well as on other vital rates, are ignored, as are potential correlations between vital rates (such as trade-offs) induced by the genotype. These issues apply to all models that include only a dynamic trait and aim to consider eco-evolutionary dynamics, but can largely be mitigated by including a static trait representing individual effects.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an interesting recent study of hunted bighorn sheep (
   <span class="italic">Ovis canadensis</span>) Traill 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
   <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">2014</a>) used a size-structured two-sex IPM to evaluate the causes of changes in the body size distribution, including heritability of body size. The results of this model suggested that effects of heritability were small compared to other causes, i.e. that evolution was less important than demography. Our model framework could be applied to this system, for instance using offspring size as a static trait (as for pike in the above model). This would provide a robustness check of these results by separating genetic effects from ontogenetic development, and by allowing for lasting individual effects of offspring size through the life history.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both dynamic and static traits will in most applications to natural populations be phenotypic traits, as the underlying genetics are typically not observed. Continuous traits can often be treated as quantitative genetic traits (assumed to be determined by many genes of small effect), decomposing variation into an additive genetic and an environmental component (Coulson 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2010</a>). Heritability should ideally be estimated from genetic data, but could also be estimated from the slope of the parent–offspring regression of observed phenotypes (Coulson 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2010</a>). Discrete traits are sometimes determined by just a few alleles on one locus, and in a few cases the underlying mechanisms of genetic inheritance can be explicitly modelled. The wolf model employed by Coulson 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
   <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2011</a>) provides a nice example, where coat colour (black or grey) is determined by two alleles on a locus. In 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S4</a>, we provide another example based on the model of red and green individuals in example 1. In these cases, the dynamics of the model become frequency dependent, and will also depend on assumptions regarding the mating system.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another demographic approach to modelling eco-evolutionary dynamics is that of age–stage-structured models (Coulson &amp; Tuljapurkar 
   <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2008</a>). This is a flexible framework where individual variation in life histories can be included through various combinations of ages and stages. The model with static and dynamic traits can in principle be converted to an age–stage-structured model, as individuals always have an age, regardless of whether it is measured (Caswell, 
   <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2001</a>). It is conceptually different by focusing on separating dynamic and static traits (note that the dynamic trait can be age, but is not limited to this), and the static trait is always constant over the lifetime of an individual. In age–stage-structured models, age is always included, and the stage may also change over the lifetime (e.g. size). The frameworks also differ in how heritability is included. Because the static trait is constant over the lifetime, only one heritability estimate is required for this framework (i.e. one for each static trait) as genetic effects can be modelled in this trait. An age–stage-structured model generally requires one heritability estimate for each age. The two frameworks, age–stage-structured models and the framework discussed here, thus represent different and complementary ways of thinking about eco-evolutionary dynamics in structured populations. We believe that the new perspective provided by separating static and dynamic traits will be a useful addition to the expanding toolkit of demographic models, in particular for applications to eco-evolutionary dynamics.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Example 3 Effects of temperature on demographic outputs in pike:</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an example of how conclusions can be affected by changing heritability of the static trait, we again consider the pike model introduced in the previous section (example 2). Here, the static trait 
    <span class="italic">y</span> is length at age 1 and the dynamic trait 
    <span class="italic">x</span> is length. In addition, the model includes temperature effects on each vital rate (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S3</a>; Vindenes 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
    <a rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" href="#b75">2014</a>). We now ask how the various demographic outputs depend on temperature, and compare the results for two scenarios: one with zero heritability of 
    <span class="italic">y</span> (as in example 2), and one with a heritability of 0.6 (slope of relationship between parent and offspring values of 
    <span class="italic">y</span>; 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>). Note that this heritability is not estimated from data, as we do not have the pedigree, and is here assumed to represent additive genetic effects. The model is female-only, thus we implicitly assume that males and females have the same life history in this example. In the model with a 0.6 heritability, the intercept of the mean offspring length was adjusted and variance in offspring length was reduced, so that the offspring length distribution would be the same for the two scenarios in the mean environment (temperature

    <span class="italic">y</span> on survival (
    <span class="italic">α</span> = −0.05) in addition to the estimated effects on somatic growth as shown in

   </div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the relative individual advantage of a large or small 
    <span class="italic">y</span>, we considered the reproductive value, measuring the (expected) contribution of an individual with a certain trait combination to future population growth, relative to other individuals (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>). Note that this is not a measure of fitness in the sense that it predicts the increase of individuals of a certain 
    <span class="italic">y</span> value (having a genetic component) relative to others, as for a given environment (temperature) all trait combinations will eventually grow with the same rate 
    <span class="italic">λ</span> (Caswell, 
    <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2001</a>). However, it does tell us which individuals and trait combinations are the main drivers of the population dynamics within each environment and heritability scenario. In the model including heritability, individuals of large 
    <span class="italic">y</span> (and 
    <span class="italic">x</span>) have the highest reproductive value, while the pattern is opposite when the heritability of 
    <span class="italic">y</span> is zero (shown in 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a> for the average temperature; these patterns are not qualitatively affected by temperature changes).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>) also revealed a large effect of heritability on the temperature effect on all demographic outputs, even reversing the effect in many cases. The underlying mechanisms are complex because temperature has different effects on each vital rate across body length. In short, with no heritability of 
    <span class="italic">y</span> any effect of this trait on fitness occurs through survival and growth. Since the reproductive value is smaller for individuals of large 
    <span class="italic">y</span> in this case, the positive effects of increased somatic growth do not outweigh the negative effects on later survival. In the model including heritability, however, 
    <span class="italic">y</span> can also affect fitness through reproduction. Here, 
    <span class="italic">y</span> will have a positive effect through offspring length since larger offspring tend to have a higher survival than smaller ones. Together, the positive effects of 
    <span class="italic">y</span> on reproduction (through offspring size) and growth are in this case outweighing the negative effects on survival. This example highlights the potentially large role of heritability in eco-evolutionary dynamics.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we considered the changes in the stable trait distribution of 
    <span class="italic">x</span> and 
    <span class="italic">y</span> between two temperatures (cold and warm), for the two heritability scenarios (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>). In both cases, the distributions are changing with temperature, demonstrating that even in a model without heritability the trait distribution will shift. However, the effects are larger for the model including heritability, as in this case the net effect of temperature works in the same direction as the response to selection on body size (because large 
    <span class="italic">y</span> individuals are at an advantage in the model including inheritance, the stable distribution is shifted towards higher mean 
    <span class="italic">y</span>). In other cases, however, it is possible at least over shorter time periods that environmental plastic changes acts in opposite direction to the effects of selection, resulting in an apparently unchanging phenotypic trait distribution even if the genotypic composition is altered (Hairston 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>.
