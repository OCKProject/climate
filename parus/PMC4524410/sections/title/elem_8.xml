 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the potential consequences of ignoring heterogeneity, we compare demographic outputs calculated from a model including heterogeneity (in this case, defined by a model with a static and a dynamic trait) to the corresponding parameters from models that partly or completely ignores the heterogeneity, i.e. ignoring either the static trait or both the static and dynamic trait. To derive the vital rates of these comparison models, we use the stable trait distribution (see details in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S2</a>). The model where both traits are ignored corresponds to an unstructured model of a uniform population, in which only the estimates of survival and fecundity are required to describe the dynamics. The case where only the static trait is ignored is slightly more complex, because transition functions of the dynamic trait must be derived as well. Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" href="#tbl2">2</a> summarises the resulting expressions for the vital rates for the underlying heterogeneous model and the two comparison models, as well as the resulting expressions for all the demographic outputs considered. A main conclusion from this analysis is that except for 
  <span class="italic">λ</span>, all parameters are generally affected by ignoring heterogeneity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amount and direction of the bias in the models ignoring heterogeneity depend on the particular case being considered, that is the general life history, which vital rates are impacted by heterogeneity, and the amount of heterogeneity. While it is difficult to make predictions on the direction and amount of bias for the general case, the methods and results presented here provide a useful tool for evaluating consequences of heterogeneity in specific situations (to which the supplemented R code should be easily adapted). Two examples are provided below, one theoretical and one empirical, where some of these issues are discussed in more detail.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Example 1 Red and green size-structured population:</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate the results for a simple case where the ‘true’ population structure is known, we developed a theoretical example of a size-structured population with red and green individuals (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>, supplementary R code). Here, each vital rate depends on size as well as colour, and each colour represents a different life-history strategy. For the purpose of illustration, we assume that this population is studied by three biologists, where the first recognises both size and colour and includes them in the model. The second biologist is colour-blind (incidentally, this is the case for one of the authors of this study) and only includes the size differences. The third is in a hurry and does not account for either size or colour, modelling all individuals as equal. How different would their conclusions on the various demographic outputs be, assuming there are no other sources of error than the model choice?

    <p>An example of a size-structured population of red and green individuals. Depending on whether colour and size is recognised, the vital rates will look different to the observer, as illustrated for survival and fecundity in panels (a–c) (for transition rates, see the provided R code). As a result, with the exception of 
     <span class="italic">λ</span> estimates of demographic outputs will be biased in models b and c. Consequences of underlying heterogeneity on estimates of extinction risk (through demographic and environmental variance) are provided in the supplementary R code.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Figure 2</a> compares the demographic outputs obtained from each case. With the exception of 
   <span class="italic">λ</span>, all parameters are biased in the models ignoring colour and/or size, and the model ignoring both traits is generally doing the worst job, as expected. The demographic variance stands out from the general pattern, as the model ignoring only colour underestimates it while the unstructured model overestimates it.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Example 2 Consequences of early growth differences in pike:</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an empirical example, we consider the demography and dynamics of a population of pike (
   <span class="italic">Esox lucius</span>) from Windermere, UK, for which unique long-term individual-based data are available (Le Cren, 
   <a rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" href="#b39">2001</a>). A length- and temperature-dependent IPM was recently developed for this population (Vindenes 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" href="#b75">2014</a>). In 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S3</a>, we extend this model to also include individual effects through length at age 1 (
   <span class="italic">y</span>, static trait), reflecting early growth differences. Note that in this example, the static and dynamic traits are the same (and therefore perfectly correlated) in offspring. The exact underlying mechanisms of early growth differences are not known, but likely arise from a combination of genetic and environmental effects. From other studies, we know that temperature and food availability during the first year are key determinants of somatic growth (Casselman, 
   <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">1996</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Figure 3</a> shows the vital rates as functions of the static and dynamic trait. Size ranks among individuals are largely maintained over the lifetime, so that initially large pike tend to grow persistently faster over their lifetime and reach a larger final size than those starting out small. These growth differences lead to lifelong fitness consequences through the indirect effects of 
   <span class="italic">y</span> on survival and fecundity, as larger individuals tend to have higher values of these rates (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). In addition, we included a direct effect of 
   <span class="italic">y</span> on survival, measured by the constant 
   <span class="italic">α</span> (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S3</a>). Negative values of 
   <span class="italic">α</span> correspond to a survival trade-off associated with rapid early growth, while positive values correspond to a case where rapid growth is also associated with higher survival (‘quality’ differences). The data were not sufficient to quantify this effect, but indicated it would be negative (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S3</a>). We therefore evaluated the results for a range of values of 
   <span class="italic">α</span>.

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results show that the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity in 
   <span class="italic">y</span> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>) are smallest when 
   <span class="italic">y</span> only affects growth (
   <span class="italic">α</span> = 0). The growth model ignoring heterogeneity was in this case able to capture the average growth quite accurately, and the main error arising from ignoring heterogeneity is that the systematic individual variation is treated as random variation, with limited consequences for most demographic outputs. In addition, since 
   <span class="italic">y</span> is approximately lognormally distributed, the amount of heterogeneity is not extremely large in this model. However, when 
   <span class="italic">y</span> is also affecting survival, either through a positive or a negative effect, the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity become more severe for all the demographic outputs (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This example demonstrates the potential importance of life-history trade-offs also for the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity. Although life-history theory suggests that trade-offs between vital rates should be common (Roff, 
   <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">1996</a>), identifying them in empirical systems can be difficult (van Noordwijk &amp; de Jong 
   <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">1986</a>). A potential explanation could be that individual differences in resource acquisition affect the expression of the trade-offs so that they are stronger for individuals with low resources (Reznick 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">2000</a>). Here, the initially small pike increases their growth rate much at first, almost catching up with the larger ones, but then the growth rate declines and they tend to stop growing at a smaller final size (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). This pattern could potentially result from a stronger trade-off between growth and fecundity in these small individuals (being expressed when they start reproducing).
