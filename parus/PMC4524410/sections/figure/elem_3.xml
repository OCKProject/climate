  <p>An example of eco-evolutionary dynamics in the pike model including length at age 1 as a static trait 
   <span class="italic">y</span>, in addition to length 
   <span class="italic">x</span> and temperature 
   <span class="italic">T</span> (details in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S3</a>). A model with zero heritability of 
   <span class="italic">y</span> (model 1) is compared to a model with a heritability of 0.6 (model 2), as shown in the upper left panels. The resulting reproductive value functions for the two models are shown for the mean temperature. The lower left panel shows effects of temperature on various demographic outputs in the two models, while the lower right panel shows the marginal stable trait distributions of 
   <span class="italic">y</span> and 
   <span class="italic">x</span> for two temperatures, in the two models.
