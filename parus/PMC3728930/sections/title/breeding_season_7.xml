 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breeding season length index</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated two indices of breeding season length. The first was the interval between the median initiation date and termination index for each year, which were not correlated with each other (
  <span class="italic">rp</span>
  <sub>13</sub> = 0.16, 
  <span class="italic">P &gt;</span> 0.1); the second was the interval between the 10th and 90th percentile of all known first egg dates within each year. These two indices were strongly correlated with each other (
  <span class="italic">rp</span>
  <sub>13</sub> = 0.83, 
  <span class="italic">P &lt;</span> 0.001) and we used the latter in subsequent analyses because it is more routinely used (e.g., Evans et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">2010</a>).
