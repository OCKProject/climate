 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although spring mean monthly temperature and precipitation variables within the study region varied substantially between years, temporal trends within the study period (1995–2011, excluding 2001) were limited. The exception was April temperature which increased linearly (+0.12°C per year,
