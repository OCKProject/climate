 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenology plays a key role in regulating species interactions that can determine population dynamics (Miller-Rushing et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">2010</a>). Recent climate change has brought about phenological shifts in a wide range of species (Walther et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">2002</a>; Thackeray et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">2010</a>), with a particularly well-studied example being the earlier onset of breeding in temperate bird populations in years with warmer spring conditions (Thomas et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">2001</a>; Charmantier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">2008</a>; Both et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">2009</a>). Species exhibiting larger phenological shifts are typically more resilient to the negative impacts of climate change than those exhibiting more limited phenological advance (Møller et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">2008</a>; Jones and Cresswell 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">2010</a>), and predicting future phenological trends would therefore facilitate assessment of species' sensitivity to climate change (Diez et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">2012</a>). Predictive capacity could be limited by non-linearity in climatic responses, local adaptation, and variation in the capacity to exhibit plastic phenological responses (Primack et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">2009</a>; Perfito et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">2012</a>; Porlier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">2012</a>), but empirical assessments of the ability of phenological models to predict responses at different spatial or temporal scales are very rare (but see Hodgson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">2011</a>) and urgently needed (Diez et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">2012</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of the assumptions underlying the use of phenological indices in the assessment of species' vulnerability to climate change also warrant more detailed empirical testing. Many phenological indices in frequent use are calculated as the mean timing of an event across the focal population. These ‘population mean indices’ are certainly preferable to indices of the timing of first events (Miller-Rushing et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">2008</a>), which only capture responses of a very limited proportion of the focal population. However, indices of a population's mean timing assume that climate change does not alter the distribution of events within a season. This is not always true; for instance, the mean timing of avian breeding is sensitive to climatic influences on the frequency of second broods (Visser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">2003</a>; Husby et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">2009</a>). There has, however, been insufficient exploration of how climate change alters the distribution of breeding attempts in single-brooded species, and the consequences of this for using phenological indices as indicators of species' sensitivity to climate change. If climate change has equivalent impacts on the timing of breeding initiation and termination then phenological indices of the mean timing of reproduction are robust (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a>A). Different months of the breeding season can, however, exhibit divergent climatic trends that may result in different impacts on initiation and termination (Houghton et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">2001</a>; Halupka et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2008</a>). Consequently, an advance in the population mean lay date could be observed even if the onset of reproduction has not advanced, due to earlier termination of breeding attempts (Dawson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">2005</a>; Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a>B). In contrast, mean breeding date will not advance, even if onset of breeding has advanced, if the end of the breeding season is delayed by a similar amount (Fig 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a>C); such lengthening of the breeding season could arise if longer growing seasons (Menzel and Fabian 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">1999</a>) increase food availability both early and late in the season. Finally, a shift in predation regime could alter the proportion of pairs building repeat nests, thus driving a change in a population's mean lay date that is unrelated to climate change; for example, an increase in nest predation rates is likely to generate more replacement nests later in the season, thus delaying mean breeding dates (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>D).

   <p>Hypothetical distributions of population lay dates prior to (solid line) and following (dotted line) climate change, showing resultant changes in mean lay date. Numerous responses are possible, but this subset illustrates the problem with using population mean breeding date as a phenological indicator of species' responses to climate change. Mean breeding date can advance when populations: (A) start and end breeding earlier or (B) start at the same time, but end breeding earlier. Mean breeding date may also (C) exhibit no advance when breeding commences earlier if breeding continues for longer, and (D) exhibit changes that are unrelated to climate change, such as a later mean breeding date due to increased predation rates that increase the proportion of renests.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we extend previous work that has determined how climate change alters the distribution of breeding attempts in multiple-brooded species by focusing on a single-brooded species. We assess whether population average lay date is a reliable indicator of the distribution of breeding events, and hence of phenological shifts and sensitivity to climate change. We use high-resolution data from an intensive 17-year study of the long-tailed tit 
  <span class="italic">Aegithalos caudatus</span> in central England, and extensive national scale data collected over a 43-year period. This single-brooded species provides an ideal case study as it exhibits one of the most rapid advances in mean annual lay date among British birds (Baillie et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2012</a>). Moreover, in contrast to almost all other avian species subject to intensive phenological studies, the long-tailed tit does not use nest boxes, and thus experiences high rates of nest predation (˜70%), resulting in renests accounting for approximately 40% of nesting attempts per year (Hatchwell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">1999</a>). This allows us to determine the nature of associations between the timing and intensity of predation regimes, and phenological indices of the timing of reproduction. We also provide the first empirical assessment of whether locally derived models of avian phenology can be scaled up to predict phenological trends at larger spatial scales and in different time periods. This is an essential first step toward predicting phenological trends under future climate change scenarios.
