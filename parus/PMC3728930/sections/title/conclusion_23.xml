 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we have shown that climatic models of phenological responses derived from intensive local studies can scale-up to predict responses at much larger spatial and temporal scales. We show that current patterns of climate change promote earlier termination of breeding (which is associated with earlier declines in food availability), despite little change in the timing of breeding initiation. This results in potential reproductive capacity being significantly reduced. These trends are not detected by the routinely used phenological indicator of population mean lay date, demonstrating that the choice of phenological metric can bias estimates of species' sensitivity to climate change. The observed phenological shifts appear to have arisen primarily from phenotypic plasticity rather than microevolutionary change. Developing predictive phenological models using indices that capture a more complete spectrum of phenological shifts is of fundamental importance to develop mechanistic models of species' vulnerability to future climatic change.</p>
