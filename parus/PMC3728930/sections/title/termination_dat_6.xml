 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The time when pairs cease to initiate renests following nesting failure provides an index of the end of the breeding season. In each year we modeled the probability of a failed pair renesting rather than terminating breeding activity, as a function of failure date, using a series of generalized linear models with logit link function and binomial error structure. Data were excluded from nests in which: (a) pair bonds were disrupted by divorce or mortality; (b) failure date was before the median lay date of first attempts; and (c) the failed attempt was located close to the field site boundary and pairs were suspected to be renesting outside the study area. All of these annual models of termination date had high explanatory power (mean McFadden's

Within each year, we used the predicted date at which 75% of breeding pairs did not renest as an index of annual termination date as this reflected the time when a large proportion of birds had stopped breeding and was robust to the inclusion of very late-terminating outliers, which only occur in some years. The 75% threshold termination date (henceforth ‘termination index’) was strongly correlated with the alternative termination thresholds of 50% (
