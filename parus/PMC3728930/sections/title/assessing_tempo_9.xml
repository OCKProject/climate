 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All statistical analyses were conducted in R, version 2.11.1 (R Development Core Team 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">2010</a>). We first assessed trends in local mean monthly spring temperature and precipitation, using year as a predictor (both linear and squared terms); trends were assessed over two time periods: 1995–2011, that is, the duration of the focal study, and 1968–2010, that is, the period over which long-tailed tit phenology was analyzed at the national scale. We then investigated temporal trends in breeding events and predation, again using the linear and squared year terms as predictors and regressing them against each separate phenological index (initiation date, renesting date, average lay date, termination date index, and breeding season length index) and against each predation index (predation timing and predation intensity).
