  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We studied a population of 25–72 pairs (mean 46 pairs) of long-tailed tits in the Rivelin Valley, Sheffield, U.K. (53°23′N, 1°34′W). Long-tailed tits are single brooded, but nest predation rates are high and pairs that fail frequently initiate a second or third renest attempt if there is sufficient time to raise a brood. Renests thus account for around 32% of nests per year (range = 0.26–0.40), and the proportion of renesting showed no temporal trend over the course of the study (

   <span class="sup">2</span>
   <sub>1,13</sub> = 0.05, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.43). The long-tailed tit is a facultative cooperative breeder and some failed breeders help other pairs rather than renesting themselves, particularly if they fail later in the season (MacColl and Hatchwell 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">2002</a>; Hatchwell et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">2004</a>). At least 95% of adult birds in the study site are uniquely marked with color-rings each breeding season and all pairs within the study site are monitored and their nests located by observation. A very small proportion (estimated to be &lt;5%) of nesting attempts are not found each year, but through monitoring parental activity it is known that the vast majority of these are short-lived attempts that rapidly fail (Sharp et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">2008</a>). Nests are monitored approximately every 2 days. In the case of nest failure, the study site is searched intensively for renesting attempts. The date on which the first egg of each clutch is laid (hereafter referred to as first egg date) is recorded so that day 1 corresponds to 1 March, and is accurate to within 1 day for all accessible nests. Inaccessible nests comprise approximately 10% of the data, and their first egg date is estimated by observing the time at which parents stop lining nests, which typically occurs when laying starts, and/or by recording the date when females commence incubation (the last day of egg laying) and assuming a clutch of 10 eggs (the modal clutch size in the study population; Hatchwell et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">2004</a>). Observations of nestling provisioning and fledging dates suggest that these lay dates for inaccessible nests are generally accurate to ± 2 days.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Datasets</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected from the local Rivelin population of long-tailed tits during 1995–2011, including first egg dates for 824 nests (559 first nesting attempts and 265 renests) and failure dates for 590 nests (410 first attempts and 180 renests). Data from 2001 were omitted from all analyses because access to the field site was limited by an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, and data from 2003 were excluded in analyses regarding the timing of renesting and termination of breeding due to limited search effort for renests at the very end of the field season in that year. Weather data were obtained for the period 1968–2011 from the Weston Park Meteorological Station, located 5 km from the center of the Rivelin study site. Monthly mean temperature and monthly total precipitation were calculated. These data were very strongly correlated with UK Climate Projections (UKCP) interpolated data (available until 2006, Jenkins et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">2008</a>) for the 5 km × 5 km grid cell containing the study site (Pearson's correlations with 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 11; May precipitation: 
   <span class="italic">rp</span> = 0.84; all other comparisons: 
   <span class="italic">rp</span> &gt; 0.96). Food abundance data were also collected at four locations, from a total of 16 trees, within the Rivelin study site by collecting caterpillar frass samples throughout the spring for the period 2009–2012, as caterpillars are the primary food source of long-tailed tits provisioning nestlings. We hence calculated the annual date of peak caterpillar abundance, and assessed the association between peak date and spring weather variables to test the hypothesis that food abundance declines earlier in years with warmer spring temperatures (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S1</a> for full methods).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">National data were obtained for the period 1968–2010 from the British Trust for Ornithology's (BTO) Nest Record Scheme (NRS; Crick et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">2003</a>). These nest records include an unknown proportion of first nesting attempts and renests, from various locations throughout the U.K. (mainly England) excluding the Rivelin Valley area. The mean annual lay date was calculated across all records within each year (mean annual sample size = 50; range = 18–123). For weather data, we used Central England Temperature from the HadCET database (Parker et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">1992</a>), as used in previous analyses of climatic influences on lay dates using nest record card data (Crick et al.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of first egg dates within each year deviated from a normal distribution so we used median first egg dates as a phenological indicator, although there was a strong correlation between mean and median first egg dates (all attempts: 
    <span class="italic">rp</span>

Within each year, initiation date was the median of first egg dates from first attempts; renesting date was the median of first egg dates from renesting attempts; average lay date was the median of first egg dates from all attempts – thus corresponding to the standard phenological index used in most studies.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Termination date index</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The time when pairs cease to initiate renests following nesting failure provides an index of the end of the breeding season. In each year we modeled the probability of a failed pair renesting rather than terminating breeding activity, as a function of failure date, using a series of generalized linear models with logit link function and binomial error structure. Data were excluded from nests in which: (a) pair bonds were disrupted by divorce or mortality; (b) failure date was before the median lay date of first attempts; and (c) the failed attempt was located close to the field site boundary and pairs were suspected to be renesting outside the study area. All of these annual models of termination date had high explanatory power (mean McFadden's 
    <span class="italic">r</span>
    <span class="sup">
     <span class="italic">2</span>
    </span> = 59%) and were statistically significant (

    <span class="sup">2</span> = 85% (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S1</a>). Within each year, we used the predicted date at which 75% of breeding pairs did not renest as an index of annual termination date as this reflected the time when a large proportion of birds had stopped breeding and was robust to the inclusion of very late-terminating outliers, which only occur in some years. The 75% threshold termination date (henceforth ‘termination index’) was strongly correlated with the alternative termination thresholds of 50% (

    <sub>13</sub> = 0.16, 
    <span class="italic">P &gt;</span> 0.1); the second was the interval between the 10th and 90th percentile of all known first egg dates within each year. These two indices were strongly correlated with each other (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predation indices</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The timing and intensity of nest predation may influence the timing of renesting and termination, and consequently breeding season length (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>D). We therefore calculated two measures of predation timing to test for trends in predation patterns: (i) the annual time of predation, as the median date of all nest predation events; (ii) the annual time of predation of first nesting attempts, as the median date of predation events of first nesting attempts; these two indices of predation timing were highly correlated (
   <span class="italic">rp</span>
   <sub>14</sub> = 0.96, 
   <span class="italic">P &lt;</span> 0.0001) and we used the former index in subsequent analyses as it offered a more complete picture of predation timing. We also calculated two indices of predation intensity: (i) annual proportion of nests predated, which was the annual proportion of nests predated among nests known to have been predated or fledged; (ii) annual Mayfield predation estimate, which was the annual Mayfield estimate of predation risk throughout the nesting cycle; these two indices of predation intensity were highly correlated (
   <span class="italic">rp</span>
   <sub>14</sub> = 0.98, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.0001) and we used the latter in subsequent analyses because it offers a more comprehensive measure of predation rates (Mayfield 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">1975</a>). Annual Mayfield estimates were calculated via a three-part process: (i) we calculated daily nest survival rates at the egg laying, incubation, and chick-rearing stages using the Mayfield method (Mayfield 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">1975</a>); (ii) we used these daily survival rates to calculate the probability of a nest surviving the entire duration of each stage by raising the daily rates to the power of the stage duration in days, assuming stage durations of 9 days for egg laying, 15 days for incubation, and 16 days for chick rearing (the typical durations of these stages in the focal population; Hatchwell et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">2004</a>); (iii) we calculated annual nest predation risk as the product of the three annual stage-specific survival probabilities, subtracted from one.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assessing temporal trends</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All statistical analyses were conducted in R, version 2.11.1 (R Development Core Team 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">2010</a>). We first assessed trends in local mean monthly spring temperature and precipitation, using year as a predictor (both linear and squared terms); trends were assessed over two time periods: 1995–2011, that is, the duration of the focal study, and 1968–2010, that is, the period over which long-tailed tit phenology was analyzed at the national scale. We then investigated temporal trends in breeding events and predation, again using the linear and squared year terms as predictors and regressing them against each separate phenological index (initiation date, renesting date, average lay date, termination date index, and breeding season length index) and against each predation index (predation timing and predation intensity).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mechanisms of phenological change: climate, predation, food, adaptation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the study site, long-tailed tit pairs typically start nest-building in February/March and egg laying in March/April; renesting attempts occur between March and May and pairs finish breeding by early June (MacColl and Hatchwell 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">2002</a>). Therefore, to investigate the effects of climate on reproductive phenology we modeled: (a) initiation date in response to temperature and precipitation during February, March, and April; (b) renesting date in response to temperature and precipitation during March, April, and May, and the timing and intensity of predation; (c) termination index in response to temperature and precipitation during March, April, and May, and the timing and intensity of predation; and (d) breeding season length in response to temperature and precipitation during February, March, April, and May, and the timing and intensity of predation. We constructed multiple linear regression models with normal error structure (Shapiro–Wilk normality tests: 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.3 for all response variables). We used an information-theoretic approach to model selection in which all possible models were constructed given the set of predictors; model fit was assessed using Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc) and model averaging was conducted over the 95% confidence set of models (Burnham and Anderson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" href="#b4">2002</a>). Collinearity between climatic predictors was within the tolerance levels to which Information Theoretic methods are robust (Variance Inflation Factor &lt;3.9 for all variables; Freckleton 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2010</a>; 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S2</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to test the hypothesis that the timing of breeding termination is influenced by the seasonal decline in caterpillar availability, we estimated the timing of peak caterpillar abundance in the Rivelin study site for the period 2009–2012, and determined the correlation between annual peak date and mean temperature during March and April. Full methods are described in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Appendix S1</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we tested the hypothesis that local genetic adaptation may contribute to the observed changes in breeding phenology in the study population, because selection may act on the focal phenological traits (initiation and termination). Following the results of the climatic analysis, we modeled initiation date in response to March temperature and termination index in response to April temperature, comparing models in which year was included as an additive or interactive effect, in order to assess whether the observed temperature-phenology reaction norms have changed significantly over time. Such a temporal change in reaction norms would be compatible with the hypothesis that selection is driving evolutionary change in the form of phenological responses.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predicting phenology at larger spatial and temporal scales</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparisons between local (i.e., Rivelin Valley) and national (i.e., U.K.) phenological responses could only be conducted using population average lay date calculated across all attempts, as other phenological indices are unavailable at the national scale. We first compared climatic models of long-tailed tit average lay date at the national and local scales, using data from 1995 to 2010, that is, the duration over which both local and national data were available. Second, we used the local climatic model of phenology to predict phenology at the national scale across a much larger time scale, that is, from 1968 to 2010, and regressed these predicted national annual lay dates against the national annual mean lay dates observed in the BTO dataset. If local climatic models of avian phenological responses can be scaled up to larger spatial and temporal scales we predict that the slope of this relationship will approximate unity. We assessed whether the performance of the model deteriorates further back in time, by calculating the square of the difference between predicted and observed values and regressing this against year (linear and quadratic terms; Piñeiro et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">2008</a>). We also assessed the performance of the locally derived model over years entirely outside the temporal span of the locally derived model (i.e., 1968–1994). In order to conduct a conservative test, March temperature was the only climatic variable used in these analyses as all other climatic variables had little influence on the average lay date of the Rivelin population (see Results).
