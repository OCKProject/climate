  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of first egg dates within each year deviated from a normal distribution so we used median first egg dates as a phenological indicator, although there was a strong correlation between mean and median first egg dates (all attempts: 
   <span class="italic">rp</span>
   <sub>14</sub> = 0.944, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; first attempts: 
   <span class="italic">rp</span>
   <sub>14</sub> = 0.996, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; renests: 
   <span class="italic">rp</span>
   <sub>13</sub> = 0.921, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001). Within each year, initiation date was the median of first egg dates from first attempts; renesting date was the median of first egg dates from renesting attempts; average lay date was the median of first egg dates from all attempts – thus corresponding to the standard phenological index used in most studies.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Termination date index</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The time when pairs cease to initiate renests following nesting failure provides an index of the end of the breeding season. In each year we modeled the probability of a failed pair renesting rather than terminating breeding activity, as a function of failure date, using a series of generalized linear models with logit link function and binomial error structure. Data were excluded from nests in which: (a) pair bonds were disrupted by divorce or mortality; (b) failure date was before the median lay date of first attempts; and (c) the failed attempt was located close to the field site boundary and pairs were suspected to be renesting outside the study area. All of these annual models of termination date had high explanatory power (mean McFadden's 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <span class="sup">
    <span class="italic">2</span>
   </span> = 59%) and were statistically significant (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05) in all but 1 year in which 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 85% (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S1</a>). Within each year, we used the predicted date at which 75% of breeding pairs did not renest as an index of annual termination date as this reflected the time when a large proportion of birds had stopped breeding and was robust to the inclusion of very late-terminating outliers, which only occur in some years. The 75% threshold termination date (henceforth ‘termination index’) was strongly correlated with the alternative termination thresholds of 50% (
   <span class="italic">rp</span>
   <sub>13</sub> = 0.860, 
   <span class="italic">P &lt;</span> 0.001) and 90% (
   <span class="italic">rp</span>
   <sub>13</sub> = 0.957, 
   <span class="italic">P &lt;</span> 0.001).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breeding season length index</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated two indices of breeding season length. The first was the interval between the median initiation date and termination index for each year, which were not correlated with each other (
   <span class="italic">rp</span>
   <sub>13</sub> = 0.16, 
   <span class="italic">P &gt;</span> 0.1); the second was the interval between the 10th and 90th percentile of all known first egg dates within each year. These two indices were strongly correlated with each other (
   <span class="italic">rp</span>
   <sub>13</sub> = 0.83, 
   <span class="italic">P &lt;</span> 0.001) and we used the latter in subsequent analyses because it is more routinely used (e.g., Evans et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">2005</a>; Møller et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">2010</a>).
