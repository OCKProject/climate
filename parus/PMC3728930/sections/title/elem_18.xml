 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study shows that the standard phenological index of mean population lay date does not pick up key phenological responses that could have important demographic impacts, such as the 33% reduction in breeding season length observed here. More positively, we show that local phenological models can be successfully applied at larger spatial and temporal scales. This ability to scale up from local phenological models has rarely been demonstrated previously (but see Hodgson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">2011</a>), and we are not aware of any such avian studies. We thus offer novel insight into an approach through which detailed information from intensive local studies can be used to develop broader scale predictive models of climate change impacts.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The local and national models of lay date as a function of March temperature are statistically indistinguishable, and the locally derived phenology model performs reasonably well in predicting previous mean lay dates at the national scale. We thereby show that intensive local studies that capture a broad range of phenological responses can provide useful inference at much larger spatial scales. Such spatial extrapolation is likely to be crucial for developing broad-scale predictive capacity in the face of climate change, because the inherent patchiness of phenological data at national and regional scales mean that such broad-scale data offer limited ability to detect patterns such as the divergent trends in breeding initiation and termination. It is important to note that there are inevitably limits to such spatial extrapolations, particularly in species with broad geographic ranges, such as the long-tailed tit. Applying local models to areas experiencing markedly different annual weather regimes would clearly be inappropriate, and multiple local studies in areas of contrasting climates are thus required in order to develop predictions across the species' large geographic range. However, this study shows that local studies can be used to develop accurate phenological predictions at much broader spatial scales within regions experiencing similar climatic regimes. Given the key role of phenology in determining species' responses to climate change (Miller-Rushing et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">2010</a>), this is an essential first step towards the goal of developing mechanistic models of species' responses to future climate change (Diez et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the local model's predictive capacity was upheld when applied to a much longer and non-overlapping time period than that used to construct the model, and predictive capacity did not decrease further back in time or at higher temperatures. This indicates that temporal extrapolation from relatively short-term studies (17 years in this case) is possible. Much caution is needed when make predictions outside the range of climatic conditions experienced during the reference study. This is not a major issue in our study, however, as the range of climatic conditions used in the local model encompasses most of the predicted range of future climatic conditions across the U.K. over the next 60 years under a high carbon emissions scenario (March: used in model 3.8–8.6°C, predicted 6–9°C; April: used in model 7.7–12.3°C, predicted 7–12°C; Jenkins et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">2008</a>). Although the increasing discrepancy between historic and future climatic variables further into the future will make longer-term predictions tricky, our analysis strongly suggests that data from intensive local studies can be used to predict future phenological shifts over time scales of several decades.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The standard phenological index of mean population lay date did not detect key phenological responses that could have important demographic impacts. The local population's mean lay date and initiation date showed no temporal trend, but timing of renesting and breeding termination have advanced significantly. This has led to an 8-day contraction of the breeding season length index, which equates to a 33% loss of the average reproductive window. This change may have little effect if late broods are unproductive, but in long-tailed tits, fledglings from late broods are as likely to recruit into the breeding population as those from broods raised earlier in the season (Sharp et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">2008</a>), perhaps partly because later broods are more likely to gain benefits from helpers in this cooperatively breeding species (MacColl and Hatchwell 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2004</a>). In many non-cooperatively breeding species, late broods have greater fitness in some years (e.g., guillemots 
   <span class="italic">Uria aalge</span>: Harris et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">1992</a>; great tits 
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>: Monrós et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">2002</a>), or are typically essential for maintaining positive population growth rates (Green 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">1988</a>; Farnsworth and Simons 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">2001</a>; Grzybowski and Pease 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2005</a>; Podolsky et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">2007</a>; Wright et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">2009</a>). A decline in breeding season length over recent years has been observed in several single-brooded species across Denmark, despite increases in the duration of breeding seasons in several multi-brooded species (Møller et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">2010</a>). This suggests that single-brooded species may experience stronger environmental constraints on breeding season length than multi-brooded species, at least in populations at the lower end of their thermal optimum. Given the recent observed decline in the incidence of double brooding in Dutch great tits (Husby et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">2009</a>), and the results of this study, it seems likely though that breeding season durations in both single and multi-brooded species may become climatically constrained in the future.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed discrepancy between rates of advance in initiation and termination in the local study probably also explains the observation that in recent years (1995–2011) national mean lay dates have advanced more than predicted from March temperature alone (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">5</a>). The observed national advance is likely to be due partly to an advance in termination date due to warmer Aprils, rather than solely to advancing initiation due to warmer March temperatures; indeed, between 1995 and 2010 April temperatures increased nationally, whereas March temperatures showed no significant change (HadCET, Parker et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">1992</a>). Given that such an advance in timing of termination at the national scale could have drastic demographic consequences, we show that assessments of species' sensitivity to climate change based on average population lay date are inadequate. In addition to the scaling-up approach described above, we suggest that assessments based on broad-scale phenological data should incorporate information on the variance in timing of breeding, as well as simply the average timing. Such practice is currently rare, but would be straightforward even with existing data from national nest monitoring schemes (as demonstrated in North American tree swallows 
   <span class="italic">Tachycineta bicolor</span>, Winkler et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">2002</a>). This study showed the 10th–90th percentile of first egg dates to be a good indicator of breeding season length; although national monitoring data is inevitably less comprehensive than the data presented here, we suggest that the use of a similar metric at the national scale would add an important dimension to phenological monitoring that could enable earlier detection of future ecological problems arising from climate change.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microevolution versus phenotypic plasticity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was no change in the form of the reaction norms between temperature and phenology (initiation and termination) in the Rivelin population over the 17 years of our study. This suggests that the majority of observed phenological change was due to phenotypic plasticity rather than selection pressure resulting in genetic adaptation. Lay date is a heritable trait, with passerine heritability estimates typically in the range of 0.16–0.45 (Sheldon et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">2003</a>), and selection pressures can generate divergence in breeding time reaction norms across conspecific populations (Caro et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">2009</a>; Gienapp et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">2010</a>). Evidence for microevolutionary change in breeding data is, however, very rare (Gienapp et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2008</a>); indeed, it is often lacking even in studies that have clearly demonstrated heritability of lay dates (Sheldon et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">2003</a>; Gienapp et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">2006</a>). Local adaptation of breeding time in response to climate may, however, be more prevalent than currently believed (Gienapp et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2008</a>). This could limit the predictive capacity of local phenological models at broader spatial scales, given that populations can experience different selection pressures (Visser et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">2003</a>; Caro et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">2009</a>; Gienapp et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">2010</a>). Further work is required to quantify the extent to which microevolutionary change contributes to phenological shifts, but we provide initial evidence that phenotypic plasticity is more important than genetic change in our focal long-tailed tit population.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mechanisms of phenological change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climatic model of local long-tailed tit phenology explains the majority (65%) of the temporal variation in the population's mean lay date, with March temperature being the most important driver. Earlier breeding in years with warm March temperatures is likely to be driven largely by the alleviation of energetic and resource constraints; this topic has received copious attention in the literature and we therefore do not discuss it further here (e.g., Crick and Sparks 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">1999</a>; Visser et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">2002</a>; Schaper et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">2011</a>; Vatka et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">2011</a>). We have also presented rare evidence that the termination of breeding is highly sensitive to temperature, with breeding ending earlier in years with warm April temperatures (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">3</a>C). One plausible mechanism for this is an influence of April temperature on food availability. Caterpillars are the dominant component of long-tailed tit chick diets (Cramp and Perrins 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">1993</a>; P. Gullett, pers. obs.) and the optimum nestling food source in terms of nutrition and energetic value (Visser et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">2006</a>; García-Navas and Sanz 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">2011</a>). Given that temporally matching breeding with the peak in caterpillar abundance benefits productivity and survival in ecologically similar species (van Noordwijk et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">1995</a>; Thomas et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">2001</a>), we hypothesized that the timing of the seasonal decline in caterpillar availability may be an important determinant of the timing of breeding termination. Our limited data suggest that caterpillar abundance at the study site peaked earlier in years with warmer April temperature, but showed no relationship with March temperature. April temperature thus seems to have a similar influence on the timing of peak caterpillar abundance at our study site to that reported in other UK woodlands, in which peak frass biomass advances by 8.5 days per 1°C increase in spring temperature (Smith et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">2011</a>). Applying this relationship with our study site, in which April temperatures have increased by 1.9°C over the course of this study, indicates that if long-tailed tits track caterpillar phenology there should be a 17-day advance in breeding termination. This predicted advance in termination date is remarkably close to the observed advance of 16 days. It thus seems likely that earlier peaks in caterpillar abundance in years with warm Aprils contribute to the earlier termination of long-tailed tit breeding in these years. Earlier seasonal decline in caterpillar availability in warm years is thought to contribute to a decline in double brooding of great tits (Husby et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">2009</a>), and earlier gonadal regression in warmer years caused earlier cessation of breeding in an aviary study of starlings 
   <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span> (Dawson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">2005</a>). There is thus mounting evidence that climate change is driving an advance in the timing of breeding termination in numerous species, and further study into the mechanisms behind this should be a priority for research.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate explained half the variation in breeding season length in our study population, primarily due to increased duration in years with warm February and March temperatures and shortening in years with warm Aprils. The effect of February temperature was unexpected given that February temperature was not closely associated with the timing of first breeding attempts. This pattern could partly arise because February and March temperatures are positively correlated, but the tolerance levels were sufficiently low to justify including both variables in the analysis. We consider it likely that warmer conditions in the prebreeding period may enhance parental body condition through reducing energetic expenditure for thermoregulation and food acquisition (e.g., Crick and Sparks 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">1999</a>; Visser et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">2002</a>; Schaper et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">2011</a>; Vatka et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">2011</a>), enabling prolonged investment in energetically demanding reproductive behavior.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we found no evidence for a trend in the timing or intensity of nest predation in this species, and the breeding phenology was not associated with either predation parameter. In this study predation patterns are not a primary driver of breeding phenology, but species in different ecosystems or locations could be more susceptible to changing predation patterns (Adamik and Král 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" href="#b1">2008</a>) and predation effects should therefore be taken into account in phenological monitoring schemes.
