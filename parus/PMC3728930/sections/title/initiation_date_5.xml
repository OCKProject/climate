 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of first egg dates within each year deviated from a normal distribution so we used median first egg dates as a phenological indicator, although there was a strong correlation between mean and median first egg dates (all attempts: 
  <span class="italic">rp</span>
  <sub>14</sub> = 0.944, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; first attempts: 
  <span class="italic">rp</span>
  <sub>14</sub> = 0.996, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; renests: 
  <span class="italic">rp</span>
  <sub>13</sub> = 0.921, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001). Within each year, initiation date was the median of first egg dates from first attempts; renesting date was the median of first egg dates from renesting attempts; average lay date was the median of first egg dates from all attempts â€“ thus corresponding to the standard phenological index used in most studies.
