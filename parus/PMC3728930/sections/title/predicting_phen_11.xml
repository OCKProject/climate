 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparisons between local (i.e., Rivelin Valley) and national (i.e., U.K.) phenological responses could only be conducted using population average lay date calculated across all attempts, as other phenological indices are unavailable at the national scale. We first compared climatic models of long-tailed tit average lay date at the national and local scales, using data from 1995 to 2010, that is, the duration over which both local and national data were available. Second, we used the local climatic model of phenology to predict phenology at the national scale across a much larger time scale, that is, from 1968 to 2010, and regressed these predicted national annual lay dates against the national annual mean lay dates observed in the BTO dataset. If local climatic models of avian phenological responses can be scaled up to larger spatial and temporal scales we predict that the slope of this relationship will approximate unity. We assessed whether the performance of the model deteriorates further back in time, by calculating the square of the difference between predicted and observed values and regressing this against year (linear and quadratic terms; Piñeiro et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">2008</a>). We also assessed the performance of the locally derived model over years entirely outside the temporal span of the locally derived model (i.e., 1968–1994). In order to conduct a conservative test, March temperature was the only climatic variable used in these analyses as all other climatic variables had little influence on the average lay date of the Rivelin population (see Results).
