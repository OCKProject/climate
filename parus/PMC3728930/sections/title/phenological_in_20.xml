 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The standard phenological index of mean population lay date did not detect key phenological responses that could have important demographic impacts. The local population's mean lay date and initiation date showed no temporal trend, but timing of renesting and breeding termination have advanced significantly. This has led to an 8-day contraction of the breeding season length index, which equates to a 33% loss of the average reproductive window. This change may have little effect if late broods are unproductive, but in long-tailed tits, fledglings from late broods are as likely to recruit into the breeding population as those from broods raised earlier in the season (Sharp et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">2008</a>), perhaps partly because later broods are more likely to gain benefits from helpers in this cooperatively breeding species (MacColl and Hatchwell 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2004</a>). In many non-cooperatively breeding species, late broods have greater fitness in some years (e.g., guillemots 
  <span class="italic">Uria aalge</span>: Harris et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">1992</a>; great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>: Monrós et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">2002</a>), or are typically essential for maintaining positive population growth rates (Green 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">1988</a>; Farnsworth and Simons 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">2001</a>; Grzybowski and Pease 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2005</a>; Podolsky et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">2007</a>; Wright et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">2009</a>). A decline in breeding season length over recent years has been observed in several single-brooded species across Denmark, despite increases in the duration of breeding seasons in several multi-brooded species (Møller et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">2010</a>). This suggests that single-brooded species may experience stronger environmental constraints on breeding season length than multi-brooded species, at least in populations at the lower end of their thermal optimum. Given the recent observed decline in the incidence of double brooding in Dutch great tits (Husby et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">2009</a>), and the results of this study, it seems likely though that breeding season durations in both single and multi-brooded species may become climatically constrained in the future.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed discrepancy between rates of advance in initiation and termination in the local study probably also explains the observation that in recent years (1995–2011) national mean lay dates have advanced more than predicted from March temperature alone (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">5</a>). The observed national advance is likely to be due partly to an advance in termination date due to warmer Aprils, rather than solely to advancing initiation due to warmer March temperatures; indeed, between 1995 and 2010 April temperatures increased nationally, whereas March temperatures showed no significant change (HadCET, Parker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">1992</a>). Given that such an advance in timing of termination at the national scale could have drastic demographic consequences, we show that assessments of species' sensitivity to climate change based on average population lay date are inadequate. In addition to the scaling-up approach described above, we suggest that assessments based on broad-scale phenological data should incorporate information on the variance in timing of breeding, as well as simply the average timing. Such practice is currently rare, but would be straightforward even with existing data from national nest monitoring schemes (as demonstrated in North American tree swallows 
  <span class="italic">Tachycineta bicolor</span>, Winkler et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">2002</a>). This study showed the 10th–90th percentile of first egg dates to be a good indicator of breeding season length; although national monitoring data is inevitably less comprehensive than the data presented here, we suggest that the use of a similar metric at the national scale would add an important dimension to phenological monitoring that could enable earlier detection of future ecological problems arising from climate change.
