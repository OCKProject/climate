 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was no change in the form of the reaction norms between temperature and phenology (initiation and termination) in the Rivelin population over the 17 years of our study. This suggests that the majority of observed phenological change was due to phenotypic plasticity rather than selection pressure resulting in genetic adaptation. Lay date is a heritable trait, with passerine heritability estimates typically in the range of 0.16â€“0.45 (Sheldon et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">2003</a>), and selection pressures can generate divergence in breeding time reaction norms across conspecific populations (Caro et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">2009</a>; Gienapp et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">2010</a>). Evidence for microevolutionary change in breeding data is, however, very rare (Gienapp et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2008</a>); indeed, it is often lacking even in studies that have clearly demonstrated heritability of lay dates (Sheldon et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">2003</a>; Gienapp et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">2006</a>). Local adaptation of breeding time in response to climate may, however, be more prevalent than currently believed (Gienapp et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2008</a>). This could limit the predictive capacity of local phenological models at broader spatial scales, given that populations can experience different selection pressures (Visser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">2003</a>; Caro et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">2009</a>; Gienapp et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">2010</a>). Further work is required to quantify the extent to which microevolutionary change contributes to phenological shifts, but we provide initial evidence that phenotypic plasticity is more important than genetic change in our focal long-tailed tit population.
