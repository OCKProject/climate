  <p>Predictions of national average lay date derived from the local climatic model (average lay date in response to March temperature), compared with observed national average lay dates, 1968–2010 (filled circles: 1968–1994; open circles: 1995–2010). Observed and predicted dates are strongly correlated (solid line: 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>40</sub> = 0.68; 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001), and the slope of this relationship is close to unity (1.17 ± 0.20); dashed lines represent 95% confidence intervals. Predictive capacity is similar when restricting prediction to those years that were not represented in the local model (i.e., 1968–1994; filled circles; 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>25</sub> = 0.63; 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001). Day one represents 1 March.
