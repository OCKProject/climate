  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Samples were collected from two lacertid lizard species, 
   <span class="italic">P. bocagei</span> and 
   <span class="italic">P. hispanica</span>, from a single location in Gerês, Northern Portugal (41.782340, -8.145140), in July 2011. Capture permits were issued by the ICNB (Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade, I.P.), license numbers 67-75/2011/CAPT. These hosts are small, diurnal, insectivorous lizards, with adult snout-vent length (SVL) of 45–65 mm and 37–70, respectively. A total of 87 adult individuals were sampled (51 
   <span class="italic">P. bocagei</span> and 36 
   <span class="italic">P. hispanica</span>, see 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095010-t001" href="#pone-0095010-t001">Table 1</a>). Each individual was handled by experienced herpetologists, a small piece of the tail-tip was collected and, when enough blood was obtained, a blood drop was stored in Whatman filter paper and the rest was used to make a blood smear. No animals were sacrificed. SVL was measured using a vernier caliper, animals were photographed and sex was determined based on the existence of enlarged femoral pores. After processing, animals were released at the site of capture. This protocol has been approved by the ethical committee of the University of Porto. Tissue samples were preserved in 96% ethanol and stored at room temperature and blood drops stored at −20°C. Blood smears were air-dried, fixed with methanol on the day of collection and stained with diluted Giemsa (1∶9 of distilled water) for 55 minutes within a week of collection.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the total number of samples (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 87), DNA was extracted from blood using the Speedtools tissue DNA extraction kit (Biotools, Madrid). In a subset of 47 individuals, in which we compared various methodological approaches, DNA was extracted from two biological sources: blood drops stored in Whatman filter paper (approximately 3 mm by 3 mm) and tail-tip muscle tissue (approximately 2 mm by 2 mm with skin removed). On these samples we used two extraction protocols: the Speedtools commercial kit following manufacturer's instructions, and the standard saline protocol 
   <a rid="pone.0095010-Sambrook1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Sambrook1">[67]</a>. Briefly, the saline method used consisted of adding 600 µl of lysis buffer (0.5 M tris; 0.1 M EDTA; 2% SDS; pH 8.0) and 10 µl of proteinase K (25 mg/ml) to the cut material, which was incubated at 56°C overnight. After incubation, 300 µl of ammonium acetate (5 M; pH 8.0) was added and centrifuged for 15 min at 14000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatant was carefully transferred to new eppendorf tubes, 600 µl of ice-cold isopropanol was added and samples were frozen between 3 h to overnight. After incubation, samples were centrifuged for 25 min at 14000 rpm at 4°C, and the supernatant was carefully discarded. Then, 1000 µl of ice-cold ethanol (70%) was added and centrifuged for 15 min at 14000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatant was carefully discarded and samples were left to evaporate at room temperature. When completely evaporated, 50 µl of ultra-pure water was added and samples were left to hydrate at ambient temperature in an agitator for 2 h. For qPCR analyses, samples were diluted to 10 ng/µl with nuclease-free water (QIAGEN) using an ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.). Quality of DNA for all samples was verified with the nm wavelength within the excepted range for pure DNA according to the manufacturer's manual (260 nm/280 nm ratio mean was 1.98, and the 260 nm/230 nm ratio mean was 2.1). This standardization procedure allows to control for the amount of host DNA, which can interfere with amplification of parasite DNA

Two negatives (one blank and one known

The alignment consisted of 75 taxa and was 641 bp long. Two different phylogenetic analyses (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference) were conducted. Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis with random sequence addition (100 replicate heuristic searches) was used to assess evolutionary relationships, using the software PhyML 3.0

We first tested the former protocol in reptile-infected samples, and we obtained a double dissociation peak in the Melting Curve Analysis (MCA). Therefore we designed a qPCR assay targeting the 18 S rRNA gene of hemogregarine species in reptiles taking into account the variation previously reported in 
   <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> and other apicomplexans (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095010.s001" href="#pone.0095010.s001">Fig. S1</a>). For this purpose we designed Hemogregarine specific primers JM4_F (
   <div content-type="gene" class="named-content">5′-ACTCACCAGGTCCAGACATAGA-3′</div>) and JM5_R (
   <div content-type="gene" class="named-content">5′-CTCAAACTTCCTTGCGTTAGAC-3′</div>) using Primer3Plus 
   <a rid="pone.0095010-Rozen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Rozen1">[75]</a>. We constructed a reference plasmid containing the target 
   <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> 18 S rDNA fragment (171 bp) amplified from a positive 
   <span class="italic">P. hispanica</span> individual (JX531917) that we used as amplification standard for the qPCR assay. The PCR product was cloned to a plasmid using the TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen, California) following the manufacturer's instructions. One Shot TOP10 Competent Cells were used for transformation and we used the Purelink Quick Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Invitrogen, California) to isolate the plasmid (aliquots are available upon request). Successful plasmid integration of the 
   <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> gene fragment was assessed using M13 primers following manufacturer's instructions. Serial 10-fold dilutions containing from 500,000 to 5 copies of plasmid were performed to produce a standard curve for 
   <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> quantification that was included in each qPCR plate. A MyiQ qPCR machine (Applied Biosystems) was used with the following protocol: 95°C 10 min, 95°C 10 s, 63°C 20 s, 72°C 25 s (with melting), 95°C 1 min, 63°C 30 s, melting from 63–95°C by increments of 0.2°C every 10 s. Reactions contained iQ SYBR Green supermix at 0.5x, each primer at 0.5 mM, 2 µl of 10 ng/µl genomic DNA, in a total volume mix of 20 µl. To estimate the number of copies in unknown samples, raw qPCR results were exported using the program iQ5 R&amp;D version 2.1 (Biorad) and the baseline threshold was determined individually for each plate using the algorithm implemented in LinRegPCR 
   <a rid="pone.0095010-Ruijter1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Ruijter1">[76]</a>. Validation was performed by direct sequencing on a total of 33 qPCR positive individuals. These included qPCR positives displaying a single peak (negatives and positives for 
   <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> from microscopy and PCR) and all those displaying mixed infection peaks. These sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KJ189434-KJ189463. For this experiment, samples with all threshold cycles (CTs) higher than 35 were considered negative because repeatability decreased significantly after cycle 35, with most replicates differing by more than one Ct. Mixed infection intensity estimates (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 6) were discarded from subsequent analyses.

For this analysis, body size was the response variable and host species and sexes (and their interaction) were treated as fixed factors. We then tested for inter- and intra-specific associations between body size and intensity of infection using the Spearman correlation coefficient. A positive correlation was found and body size was used as a covariate in all subsequent analyses. Then, using qPCR estimates as a proxy, we investigated differences in infection parameters between the two

    <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> infection between host species, between sexes within each species and between the same sexes of both species (
