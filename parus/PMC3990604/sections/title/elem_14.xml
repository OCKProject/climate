 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 56 sequences were obtained from PCR sequencing with the Hep primers. Of these, 51 BLASTed with previously published GenBank sequences of 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> spp. (Apicomplexa: Adeleorina), 4 with 
  <span class="italic">Schellackia</span> spp. and 1 with 
  <span class="italic">Lankesterella</span> spp. (Apicomplexa: Eimeriorina). These were considered positive for PCR prevalence (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095010-t001" href="#pone-0095010-t001">Table 1</a>). In mixed infections, these conventional PCR primers preferentially amplified Eimeriorina parasites so they resulted in single electropherograms by sequencing analysis. The 47 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> sequences (4 were discarded from further analyses due to poor quality) resulted in 3 unique haplotypes (and heterozygous individuals for these haplotypes, see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095010.s003" href="#pone.0095010.s003">Table S1</a>) that differed in 15 polymorphic segregating sites. These haplotypes clustered within a previously identified 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> lineage obtained from Western Mediterranean and North African reptiles (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095010-g002" href="#pone-0095010-g002">Fig. 2</a>). The melting curve analysis (MCA) was able to differentiate between different Apicomplexa genera in mixed infections (see above). But we did not find differences in melting temperatures between the three closely related 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> haplotypes, which are identical for the targeted fragment in the qPCR assay (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095010.s001" href="#pone.0095010.s001">Fig. S1</a>). Two haplotypes of 
  <span class="italic">Schellackia</span> sp. were obtained, one haplotype from a single individual of 
  <span class="italic">P. bocagei</span> was identical to 
  <span class="italic">Schellackia</span> sp. from 
  <span class="italic">P. hispanica</span> (JQ762306 and JX984676), and the other haplotype (two sequences from 
  <span class="italic">P. hispanica</span> and one from 
  <span class="italic">P. bocagei</span>) was closely related with two haplotypes from 
  <span class="italic">Lacerta schreiberi</span> (JX984674 and JX984675) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095010-g002" href="#pone-0095010-g002">Fig. 2</a>). Finally, the single 
  <span class="italic">Lankesterella</span> sp. sequence obtained in this study is related with 
  <span class="italic">Lankesterella minima</span> from the American bullfrog 
  <span class="italic">Lithobates (Rana) catesbeianus</span> (AF080611) and 
  <span class="italic">Lankesterella valsainensis</span> from the blue tit 
  <span class="italic">Parus caeruleus</span> (DQ390207) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095010-g002" href="#pone-0095010-g002">Fig. 2</a>).
