 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on qPCR estimates (from blood-kit DNA extraction) we investigated 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> infection parameters in two 
  <span class="italic">Podarcis</span> sympatric species. Our results show high levels of prevalence with no significant differences between host species and sexes within each species. Prevalence can be determined by the rate at which parasites encounter suitable hosts 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Simberloff1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Simberloff1">[9]</a>, environmental factors 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Wood1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Wood1">[87]</a> and by the distribution of suitable vectors 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Eisen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Eisen1">[88]</a>. Thus, the observed pattern may arise because these hosts' species share the same habitat and are exposed to the same parasites and vectors, both being suitable hosts for hemogregarine parasites. This finding differs however with results from a previous study showing differences in prevalence in these two host species from different locations in the Iberian Peninsula 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Maia1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Maia1">[50]</a>. These contrasting patterns may be the result of the differences between method detection accuracy, as shown in this study, or due to the influence of temporal, ecological, evolutionary and behavioural factors in hemoparasite infection 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Knowles1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Knowles1">[6]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Poulin6" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Poulin6">[44]</a>. Interestingly, we found three haplotypes and heterozygous individuals, consistent with what has been previously reported by other studies 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Maia1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Maia1">[50]</a>. The importance of this variation should be further studied as the co-occurrence of various parasite species and lineages within a host may contribute increasing parasite and/or host diversity and speciation 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-PrezTris1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-PrezTris1">[89]</a> and parasite clonal diversity can maintain high parasite diversity in host populations 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Vardo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Vardo1">[90]</a>. Clearly, integrative studies that involve all these variables are needed in wild reptiles.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> intensity of infection, we found that it was positively associated with body size within each host species, which seems to be a common pattern among short-lived reptile species (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Iberolacerta monticola</span>
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Amo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Amo2">[43]</a>, 
  <span class="italic">P. lilfordi</span>
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Garrido2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Garrido2">[51]</a> and 
  <span class="italic">Lacerta viridis</span>
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Molnr1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Molnr1">[91]</a>). Body size has been used as an estimator of age in reptiles 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Halliday1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Halliday1">[92]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Pough1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Pough1">[93]</a>, with older individuals of the same species usually being larger in size. It is assumed that intensity of infection may increase with longevity due to more encounters with parasites, more time to develop infections and less immunocompetence in older animals 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Amo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Amo1">[37]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Poulin5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Poulin5">[42]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Palacios1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Palacios1">[94]</a>. However, this pattern is not linear among hemogregarine infections, especially when considering long-lived reptile species. Studies conducted on snakes 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Madsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Madsen1">[35]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Brown1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Brown1">[36]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Madsen2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Madsen2">[95]</a> and tuataras 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Godfrey1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Godfrey1">[96]</a> have found an inverse association to that reported here, with larger individuals having lower intensities. These contrasting infestation patterns may be related to differences in the pathogenesis of hemogregarine infections between short- and long-lived reptiles. In short-lived species, such as lizards, hemogregarine infections are often regarded as non-detrimental to host condition 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Amo3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Amo3">[97]</a>, while in long-lived species hemogregarine infection appears linked to detrimental effects on life-history traits, including growth rate, juvenile survival and female reproductive output 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Madsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Madsen1">[35]</a>. These contrasting effects may be due to the continued parasite acquisition through time in larger, and older, individuals, in the case of non-detrimental infections 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Thomas2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Thomas2">[26]</a>, while in detrimental infections only those individuals that manage to reduce or clear infection can have longer lifespans and reach larger sizes 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Simberloff1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Simberloff1">[9]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Madsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Madsen1">[35]</a>. Given the strong relationship of host longevity and body size on parasite infection in reptiles in nature, it would be interesting to investigate hemogregarine infection patterns in species with intermediate size and longevity to determine if such an intermediate parasite infection pattern is found.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When comparing intensity levels between the two species, the smaller sized species (
  <span class="italic">P. hispanica</span>) harboured significantly higher intensity levels of 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> parasites. The association between body size and intensity of infection differed for the two species, being more pronounced in 
  <span class="italic">P. bocagei</span>, for which a lower proportion of smaller animals and a higher proportion of bigger animals, are infected. Also, males had higher intensities than females. Several factors may explain these patterns including: host immunocompetence and susceptibility to infection 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-SchmidHempel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-SchmidHempel1">[41]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Telfer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Telfer1">[98]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Brunham1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Brunham1">[99]</a>, parasite specialization to both the intermediate 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Poulin6" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Poulin6">[44]</a> and definitive hosts 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-MartnezdelaPuente1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-MartnezdelaPuente1">[100]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Hellgren1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Hellgren1">[102]</a>, host microhabitat preference 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Eisen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Eisen1">[88]</a>, abundance of suitable vectors 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Ishtiaq1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Ishtiaq1">[101]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Perkins2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Perkins2">[103]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Reardon1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Reardon1">[104]</a>, and behaviour heterogeneity of host species and sexes 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Simberloff1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Simberloff1">[9]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Fenner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Fenner1">[40]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Lee1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Lee1">[105]</a>. In our system, the smaller-sized species, 
  <span class="italic">P. hispanica</span>, and males within each species, can be more susceptible to infection and/or can differ immunologically/hormonally, and thus harbour higher hemogregarine intensity levels. Differences in leukocyte counts have been reported between 
  <span class="italic">Podarcis</span> species 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Sacchi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Sacchi1">[106]</a>, which can result in differential immune responses. Associations between individual- and species- specific immune responses and parasitemia levels for various blood parasite groups have been widely reported in birds 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Figuerola1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Figuerola1">[107]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Westerdahl1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Westerdahl1">[110]</a>, and, to a lesser extent, in reptiles 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Madsen2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Madsen2">[95]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Ujvari2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Ujvari2">[111]</a>. Likewise, a male-biased pattern is commonly observed in hemoparasite infections, which is often attributed to hormonal and immunocompetence differences between sexes 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Salkeld1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Salkeld1">[112]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Restif1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Restif1">[114]</a>. Future studies should now look for an association between immunological variables and hemogregarine infection in sympatric species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hemoparasite infection parameters can vary temporally and spatially, which is especially important in complex parasite systems that have heteroxenous lifecycles and are vector-borne, such as 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span>. For instance, a cross-sectional study of two malaria parasite species has shown parasite-specific variation in the spatial patterns of disease risk in two closely related sympatric bird species, with consistency between years 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Lachish1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Lachish1">[115]</a>. Seasonal variations (or environmental variations due to climate change 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Mller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Mller1">[116]</a>) can not only affect vector abundance 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Ferraguti1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Ferraguti1">[117]</a> and influence rates of parasite development in these vectors 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Altizer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Altizer1">[118]</a>, but also influence vertebrate host behaviour 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Uchii1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Uchii1">[119]</a> and host immune condition 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Huyghe1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Huyghe1">[120]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Mller2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Mller2">[121]</a>. So studies on various populations and/or across different seasons and years should be conducted in these sympatric species, provided that this system presents a good host-parasite interaction assessment for comparing differences between species and sexes. Finally, a fundamental question on the biology of these parasites that remains, is to identify and compare host-specificity and competence of the definitive invertebrate host(s) for reptile hemogregarines which is fundamental to better understand the evolutionary ecology and transmission dynamics of these parasites.
