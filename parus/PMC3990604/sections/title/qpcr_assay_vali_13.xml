  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.001), with qPCR being much more sensitive and detecting as few as 5 copies of parasite DNA. Mean threshold cycle (Ct) standard deviation (SD) was 0.16, mean efficiency 81.1% (SD±2.6) and mean R

Mean SD values for intra-assay repeatability for sample replicates was 0.198 (SD±0.147) and 0.192 for plasmid dilution replicates (SD±0.166). Melting Curve Analysis of plasmid dilutions displayed a single peak at 81.4°C and amplification charts were S-shaped. Sequences retrieved from qPCR amplifications were BLASTed on GenBank. Those samples displaying a single melting peak curve all matched 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> spp. sequences, while the ones displaying two distinct peaks (range from 82.6–83.8°C) presented a mixed electropherogram in the sequencing analyses. These mixed infections detected by qPCR matched those detected by conventional PCR sequencing.
