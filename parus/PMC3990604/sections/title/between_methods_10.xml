 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first investigated the correlation between 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> intensity levels detected by microscopy and qPCR using the Spearman correlation coefficient (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 66, out of 72 blood smears after excluding 6 mixed infections). We used McNemar's test to compare sensitivity of the three detection methods (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 87) and the four extraction protocols (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 47) in estimating 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> prevalence. Then, to compare 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> intensity among biological sources and extraction protocols (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 41, out of the subset of 47 samples after excluding 6 mixed infections) we fitted a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GZLMM), as recommended for unbalanced data with repeated measures (random effects) 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Bolker1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Bolker1">[77]</a>, with normal distribution and log link function. The full model included copy number as the target variable, the biological source, extraction protocol and their interaction as fixed factors, and subject individuals as random effect. Pairwise LSD mean contrasts for each factor were included in the model.
