 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ANOVA analyses showed significant differences in body size between host species (F = 11.991, df = 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.001), 
  <span class="italic">P. bocagei</span> being bigger, and sexes (F = 5.023, df = 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.028), males being bigger in size. Given that qPCR and blood-kit DNA extraction provided good estimates of infection parameters for the methodological subset comparison, we used this protocol for investigating the relationship between host-factors and infection patterns. Prevalence was higher in 
  <span class="italic">P. hispanica</span> females (89%) than in 
  <span class="italic">P. bocagei</span> females (59%) (X
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 4.409, df = 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.036), but there were no significant differences between species (X
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 3.434, df = 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.064), or sexes (
  <span class="italic">P. bocagei</span>: X
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 3.519, df = 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.061; 
  <span class="italic">P. hispanica</span>: X
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0, df = 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 1) (see 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095010-t001" href="#pone-0095010-t001">Table 1</a>). In terms of intensity of infection, intensity was significantly related with body size for both host species (
  <span class="italic">P. bocagei</span>, ρ = 0.521, 
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.001, and 
  <span class="italic">P. hispanica</span>, ρ = 0.417, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.014) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095010-g004" href="#pone-0095010-g004">Fig. 4</a>). The GZLM analysis showed a significant effect of host species (Wald X
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 8.407, df = 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.004) and sexes (Wald X
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 7.208, df = 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.007), on 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> intensity levels, and confirmed a significant effect of the covariate factor body size (Wald X
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 4.254, df = 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.039). The interaction between body size and host species was also significant (Wald X
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 4.571, df = 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.033), which indicates that the effect of host species on the intensity of infection is body-size dependent (
