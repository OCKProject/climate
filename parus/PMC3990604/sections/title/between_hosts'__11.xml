 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have found various associations between infection parameters and body size

  <a rid="pone.0095010-Garrido2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Garrido2">[51]</a>, and therefore prior to building the models we first examined variation in body size between host species and sexes using ANOVA with Type I sums of squares (SS). For this analysis, body size was the response variable and host species and sexes (and their interaction) were treated as fixed factors. We then tested for inter- and intra-specific associations between body size and intensity of infection using the Spearman correlation coefficient. A positive correlation was found and body size was used as a covariate in all subsequent analyses. Then, using qPCR estimates as a proxy, we investigated differences in infection parameters between the two 
  <span class="italic">Podarcis</span> host species and between sexes within each species. Prevalence of 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> infection between host species, between sexes within each species and between the same sexes of both species (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 87) was compared using a Chi-square test (

  <span class="italic">n</span> = 81, out of 87 samples after excluding 6 mixed infections), while accounting for the effects of body size, we used a Generalized Linear Model (GZLM) with normal distribution and log link function using Type I SS. The full model included body size, host species and sexes (and their interactions) as fixed factors.
