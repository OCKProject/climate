 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Parasites can be major drivers of host ecology and evolution and play key roles in ecosystem functioning and structure. Parasitism can for example alter host life-history traits and fitness 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Agnew1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Agnew1">[1]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Thomas1">[2]</a>, as well as influence predator-prey or competitive interactions between and within species 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Poulin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Poulin1">[3]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Hatcher1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Hatcher1">[5]</a>. However, the ecological niche in which both host and parasite occur is complex and multifaceted, and there is considerably variation in patterns of parasitism in natural populations at multiple spatial and temporal scales 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Knowles1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Knowles1">[6]</a>, from individual to community levels 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Poulin2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Poulin2">[7]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Tompkins1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Tompkins1">[8]</a>. Natural variation in infection parameters can be due to differences in the environmental exposure to parasites 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Simberloff1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Simberloff1">[9]</a>, or to variation in the susceptibility or resistance to infection 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Klein1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Klein1">[10]</a>. Investigating the underlying patterns can contribute to a better understanding of the impact and evolution of parasitism 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Combes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Combes1">[11]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Folstad1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Folstad1">[13]</a>, while also providing valuable epidemiological and conservation information.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importantly, the estimation of biological relevant and realistic infection patterns is constrained by differences in the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of the detection and quantification protocols used 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Banoo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Banoo1">[14]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Espy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Espy1">[15]</a>. The use of less accurate protocols may lead to erroneous ecological and epidemiological inferences, which is particularly critical in host-parasite systems with low intensity levels or with mixed parasite infections. In recent years, quantitative PCR (qPCR) has been used in parasitological studies as it allows the simultaneous detection and quantification of parasite DNA from various biological sources, such as host and vector blood and tissues 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-GmezDaz1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-GmezDaz1">[16]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Li1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Li1">[20]</a>. Compared to more traditional approaches, such as microscopy or conventional PCR (PCR), qPCR has increased accuracy and sensitivity of detection 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Perandin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Perandin1">[21]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Mangold1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Mangold1">[22]</a>. Despite the advantages, the use of this quantitative method in parasitology has been primarily used for clinical samples and/or pathogens of human-health and veterinary importance 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Kelly1">[17]</a>. Although this technique is now routinely applied for clinical studies in domestic animals 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Perandin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Perandin1">[21]</a>, its applications in wild animal populations, is just beginning to emerge 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Knowles1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Knowles1">[6]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Alvarez1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Alvarez1">[19]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Grodio1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Grodio1">[23]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Njabo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Njabo1">[25]</a>. More importantly, studies comparing the performance of the different methods under various experimental conditions are generally lacking (but see 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Espy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Espy1">[15]</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sympatric and closely related species represent natural model systems and an ideal opportunity where to investigate between-host differences in infection parameters 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Thomas2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Thomas2">[26]</a>. Closely related species are likely to be susceptible to the same or similar parasite species due to common ancestry, and the same can happen with sympatric host species due to common ecological determinants 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Poulin3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Poulin3">[27]</a>. In these systems, differences in infection may arise due to inter- and intra-host variation in susceptibility and/or tolerance to infection, while controlling for general environmental differences in exposure. Reptiles have become model organisms for parasitological studies, in part due to their low dispersal potential, and the occurrence of sympatric speciation 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Camargo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Camargo1">[28]</a>. Despite the growing number of studies addressing infection variation in animal populations 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Beldomenico1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Beldomenico1">[29]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Allen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Allen1">[32]</a>, these remain largely enigmatic in the case of wild reptiles. In reptiles, body size and weight have been commonly used as a proxy measure to explain individual as well as population and species differences in susceptibility and/or tolerance to parasite infection 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-GarcaRamrez1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-GarcaRamrez1">[33]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Amo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Amo1">[37]</a>, because it is often positively correlated with host life-history traits such as longevity, survival and fecundity, which relate to fitness 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Agnew2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Agnew2">[38]</a>. Other factors that might drive variation in parasite infection include host behaviour and morphology 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Poulin4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Poulin4">[39]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Fenner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Fenner1">[40]</a>, immunity

  <a rid="pone.0095010-SchmidHempel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-SchmidHempel1">[41]</a> and ecology 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Poulin3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Poulin3">[27]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Poulin5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Poulin5">[42]</a>. However, previous studies have shown contrasting patterns of association with those factors 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Garrido1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Garrido1">[34]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Brown1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Brown1">[36]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Amo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Amo2">[43]</a>, which may be in part due to the effects of sampling and methodological bias, and/or confounding phylogenetic or environmental factors 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Poulin5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Poulin5">[42]</a>,

  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> (Apicomplexa: Adeleorina), is a highly diverse genus of intracellular hemogregarine parasites with more than 300 species described 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Smith1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Smith1">[46]</a>, and the most common and widely distributed hemoparasites found in reptiles 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Telford1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Telford1">[47]</a>. Yet few studies to date have examined prevalence and intensity of infection in wild reptile populations (but see 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Madsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Madsen1">[35]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Amo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Amo1">[37]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Roca1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Roca1">[48]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Garrido2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Garrido2">[51]</a>). Arthropod vectors, such as mites, ticks and mosquitoes, are the definitive hosts in a complex heteroxenous lifecycle that includes a wide range of vertebrates as intermediate hosts 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Smith1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Smith1">[46]</a>. Pathogenesis caused by 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> infections in reptiles is unclear, with studies reporting from apparently non-detrimental infections in natural hosts 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Brown1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Brown1">[36]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Wozniak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Wozniak1">[52]</a>, to severe and life-threatening illness in unnatural hosts 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Wozniak2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Wozniak2">[53]</a>. This has been mostly studied in domestic animals, for which the most common symptoms include anaemia, lethargy, weight loss, weakness and cachexia 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Allen2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Allen2">[54]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Baneth1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Baneth1">[55]</a>, while the pathogenic effects on wildlife are mostly unknown. In addition, other apicomplexans, such as 
  <span class="italic">Schellackia</span> sp. (Apicomplexa: Eimeriorina), are often found at lower prevalence and intensities in wild reptile hosts, and mixed infections with 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> can also occur 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-MegaPalma1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-MegaPalma1">[56]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Harris1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Harris1">[57]</a>. In this study, we investigate 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> infection parameters in two sympatric closely related lacertid species, 
  <span class="italic">Podarcis bocagei</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. hispanica</span>. These two host species present an attractive system because: first, they live in sympatry and, despite having similar ecological requirements, there are apparent preferences for microhabitat: 
  <span class="italic">P. hispanica</span> is frequently found on rocks (saxicolous), while 
  <span class="italic">P. bocagei</span> is mainly ground­dwelling 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-SSousa1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-SSousa1">[58]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-SSousa2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-SSousa2">[59]</a>; second, despite being genetically closely related 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Pinho1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Pinho1">[60]</a>, they present considerable morphological differences, with 
  <span class="italic">P. bocagei</span> being generally larger 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Harris2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Harris2">[61]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Kaliontzopoulou1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Kaliontzopoulou1">[62]</a>; third, size sexual dimorphism has been reported for both species, with adult males being larger than females 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Kaliontzopoulou1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Kaliontzopoulou1">[62]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Kaliontzopoulou2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Kaliontzopoulou2">[63]</a>; and fourth, recent studies report high prevalence of 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> and low prevalence of 
  <span class="italic">Schellackia</span> infections for these species in the Iberian Peninsula 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-Maia1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Maia1">[50]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0095010-MegaPalma1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-MegaPalma1">[56]</a>. Therefore, this model system provides an ideal scenario for investigating between host-species, sex and inter-individual differences in patterns of 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> infection, while controlling for confounding factors such as ecology and host and parasite phylogeny.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The objectives of this study are: i) to evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of different detection methods (microscopy, PCR and qPCR) and protocols (biological source and DNA extraction protocol) for detecting and quantifying hemogregarine parasites in reptile samples, as well as the occurrence of mixed infections, and ii) apply the most sensitive approach, i.e. qPCR, to determine prevalence and intensity of 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> infection in two sympatric closely related lacertid species, 
  <span class="italic">P. bocagei</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. hispanica</span>, and assess the relative role of inter-individual (intra-species) and between-species factors on these parameters.
