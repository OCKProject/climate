 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we present a qPCR assay to detect and quantify hemogregarine hemoparasites in reptiles, which can also differentiate mixed infections by different apicomplexan genera. We then tested the performance of the qPCR approach in natural settings and compared infection patterns in a pair of lizard species. Our study illustrates that closely related sympatric hosts, for which factors like behaviour, morphology and habitat preferences are well-known, represent a good model for studying among-host variation in infection. Future studies are needed to assess the influence of other intrinsic factors, such as physiological and immunological traits, as well as to investigate the evolutionary and ecological significance of mixed infections. Overall, this study illustrates the importance of using accurate detection and quantification methods for estimating infection parameters, and the need of considering methodological aspects when comparing parasitological data within and between studies. We also advocate that, due to differences in performance between detection methodologies and extraction protocols, preliminary studies should be carried out prior to choosing the most appropriate approach in a case-study basis to avoid erroneous inferences.</p>
