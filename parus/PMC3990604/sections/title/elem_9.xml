 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Normality tests were performed using Shapiro-Wilk and homogeneity of variances tested using Levene's non-parametric test. To approach normality, infection estimates obtained from qPCR (
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> copy number) were log-transformed using the formula 
  <span class="italic">log (x+1)</span>. Fitness of the models was tested by Normal Q-Q plots of the Pearson residuals from the model analysis.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first investigated the correlation between 
   <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> intensity levels detected by microscopy and qPCR using the Spearman correlation coefficient (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 66, out of 72 blood smears after excluding 6 mixed infections). We used McNemar's test to compare sensitivity of the three detection methods (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 87) and the four extraction protocols (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 47) in estimating 
   <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> prevalence. Then, to compare 
   <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> intensity among biological sources and extraction protocols (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 41, out of the subset of 47 samples after excluding 6 mixed infections) we fitted a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GZLMM), as recommended for unbalanced data with repeated measures (random effects) 
   <a rid="pone.0095010-Bolker1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Bolker1">[77]</a>, with normal distribution and log link function. The full model included copy number as the target variable, the biological source, extraction protocol and their interaction as fixed factors, and subject individuals as random effect. Pairwise LSD mean contrasts for each factor were included in the model.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have found various associations between infection parameters and body size 
   <a rid="pone.0095010-Amo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Amo2">[43]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0095010-Garrido2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0095010-Garrido2">[51]</a>, and therefore prior to building the models we first examined variation in body size between host species and sexes using ANOVA with Type I sums of squares (SS). For this analysis, body size was the response variable and host species and sexes (and their interaction) were treated as fixed factors. We then tested for inter- and intra-specific associations between body size and intensity of infection using the Spearman correlation coefficient. A positive correlation was found and body size was used as a covariate in all subsequent analyses. Then, using qPCR estimates as a proxy, we investigated differences in infection parameters between the two 
   <span class="italic">Podarcis</span> host species and between sexes within each species. Prevalence of 
   <span class="italic">Hepatozoon</span> infection between host species, between sexes within each species and between the same sexes of both species (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 87) was compared using a Chi-square test (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.quantpsy.org/chisq/chisq.htm" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.quantpsy.org/chisq/chisq.htm</span>). For intensity comparisons between host species and sexes (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 81, out of 87 samples after excluding 6 mixed infections), while accounting for the effects of body size, we used a Generalized Linear Model (GZLM) with normal distribution and log link function using Type I SS. The full model included body size, host species and sexes (and their interactions) as fixed factors.
