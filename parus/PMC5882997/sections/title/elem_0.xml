  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With habitat loss, degradation and progressive urbanization, there is increased focus on the value that domestic gardens provide for wild birds. Supplementary feeding of garden birds is practised by millions of people across Europe, North America and Australasia [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C1">1</a>]. Wild bird feeding is postulated to be one of the most common forms of human–wildlife interaction in the Western world [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C2">2</a>] and an estimated 48% of households in Great Britain (GB) provide supplementary food [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C3">3</a>]. Since the 1970s, there has been a shift from winter-only to year-round feeding, supported by the argument that nutritional demands vary across the year and are not limited to periods of harsh weather. Concurrently, diversification in commercially available products, notably seed mixes, suet-based products and insectivorous diets, has occurred. This has been coupled with an increased variety of food presentation, from table and ground feeding options to numerous designs and sizes of suspended feeders.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supplementary feeding may affect wild birds in many ways, including changes to body condition, reproductive success, survival, community structure and migration behaviour [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C4">4</a>–
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C7">7</a>]. In GB, supplementary feeding has been linked to increases in population size of wild bird species making use of this resource [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C8">8</a>]. It is also important to recognize that there is a human well-being perspective to the feeding of wild birds. Contact with wildlife in peri-domestic habitats offers an opportunity to address the growing disconnect with nature that has accompanied progressive urbanization. Feeding birds has been shown to promote human health and well-being and may enhance public interest in wildlife welfare and conservation [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C9">9</a>,
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C10">10</a>], although it risks assuaging guilt over wider detrimental environmental change and habitat losses through the act of ‘doing good’ in one's immediate vicinity. While supplementary feeding has the potential to offset some losses resulting from reduced natural food supplies [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C11">11</a>], the benefits largely seem to accrue to already urban-adapted species that frequently use feeding stations [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are risks associated with feeding birds, which include the possibility that wild birds may become reliant on artificial food sources, or be subject to increased predation at feeding stations (e.g. [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C13">13</a>,
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C14">14</a>]). Supplementary feeding also may increase opportunities for pathogen exposure and transmission, with risks associated with (i) congregation at high density for prolonged periods of time and repeatedly over long periods; (ii) opportunities for interspecific mixing unlikely to occur in natural habitats; and (iii) poor hygiene levels leading to pathogen contamination of the feeding station [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C15">15</a>,
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C16">16</a>]. Also, supplementary food may pose a risk if it is of poor nutritional value or contaminated with toxins that influence host condition or immunity [

   <a rid="RSTB20170091C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C17">17</a>]. Finally, crowding and competition at feeding stations may lead to stress and secondary immunosuppression, with resources partitioned through dominance hierarchies [

   <a rid="RSTB20170091C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C18">18</a>]. Furthermore, the zoonotic potential of some wild bird pathogens is well known, and the close human–wildlife proximity at feeding stations may increase the risks to public health [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Citizen science offers a cost-effective means to undertake large-scale, year-round, longitudinal disease surveillance in conjunction with the monitoring of wildlife populations, their distributions and abundances [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C20">20</a>]. This approach lends itself to monitoring species, such as songbirds, that use peri-domestic habitats and are positively perceived by the public [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C21">21</a>]. In GB, national wild bird disease surveillance has been achieved over a 25-year period through public reporting of observed morbidity and mortality. The methods used have evolved over this period in several ways, most notably involving a shift from opportunistic reports only (1992–2004) to an integrated system of independent opportunistic and systematic surveillance approaches (2005–present) [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C22">22</a>], which has been greatly facilitated by expansion of an already existing national citizen science scheme [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C23">23</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Briefly, volunteers in the British Trust for Ornithology's (BTO) Garden BirdWatch (GBW) scheme submit weekly reports throughout the calendar year, providing measures of occurrence and abundance of wild birds using their gardens. Expansion of this scheme to include the recording of observation of disease now provides a structured and systematic dataset that can be used to control for the spatial and temporal biases seen in opportunistic reporting approaches. Post-mortem examinations are conducted from a subset of incidents, including those reported by both GBW participants and opportunistic recorders. Standardized examination protocols, supported by ancillary diagnostic tests, are conducted, and set case and incident definitions are employed (see the electronic supplementary material). A collaborative approach, bringing together veterinary diagnostic laboratories, conservation and animal welfare organizations, government, the wild bird care industry and academia, underpinned by public contributions, has been adopted to maximize awareness and impact across invested communities.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of review</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Appraisal of disease transmission risk associated with supplementary feeding relies on a combination of observation and experimental data. There are a few large-scale and long-term field datasets for disease surveillance of wild birds that frequent garden feeding stations. For small passerines in North America, the investigation of the spread of house finch conjunctivitis is perhaps the best-studied example. This has combined examination of field data, to provide information about spatio-temporal disease spread and house finch (
   <span class="italic">Haemorhous mexicanus</span>) population declines [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C24">24</a>], with experimental studies to elucidate factors (e.g. behaviour) influencing 
   <span class="italic">Mycoplasma gallisepticum</span> transmission (e.g. [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C25">25</a>,
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C26">26</a>]). This bacterial infection results in externally visible, characteristic signs of conjunctivitis; therefore, syndromic surveillance through public reporting of affected bird sightings can be used as a reliable proxy for disease occurrence. However, for most types of disease, clinical signs are rarely this identifiable or specific, so alternative approaches are required.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By combining large-scale surveillance with post-mortem examinations, we can differentiate between multiple diseases that result in non-specific clinical signs (e.g. lethargy and fluffed-up plumage) that could not be diagnosed through observation alone. We focus on three of the best-characterized and most frequently diagnosed infectious diseases, with contrasting modes of transmission, caused by a protozoal, a viral and a bacterial pathogen, each of which has been known to occur over the duration of the study period (1992–2016) but for which the epidemiology, prevalence and impact have changed markedly over the past decade.</p>
