 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Appraisal of disease transmission risk associated with supplementary feeding relies on a combination of observation and experimental data. There are a few large-scale and long-term field datasets for disease surveillance of wild birds that frequent garden feeding stations. For small passerines in North America, the investigation of the spread of house finch conjunctivitis is perhaps the best-studied example. This has combined examination of field data, to provide information about spatio-temporal disease spread and house finch (

  <span class="italic">Mycoplasma gallisepticum</span> transmission (e.g. [

  <a rid="RSTB20170091C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C26">26</a>]). This bacterial infection results in externally visible, characteristic signs of conjunctivitis; therefore, syndromic surveillance through public reporting of affected bird sightings can be used as a reliable proxy for disease occurrence. However, for most types of disease, clinical signs are rarely this identifiable or specific, so alternative approaches are required.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By combining large-scale surveillance with post-mortem examinations, we can differentiate between multiple diseases that result in non-specific clinical signs (e.g. lethargy and fluffed-up plumage) that could not be diagnosed through observation alone. We focus on three of the best-characterized and most frequently diagnosed infectious diseases, with contrasting modes of transmission, caused by a protozoal, a viral and a bacterial pathogen, each of which has been known to occur over the duration of the study period (1992â€“2016) but for which the epidemiology, prevalence and impact have changed markedly over the past decade.</p>
