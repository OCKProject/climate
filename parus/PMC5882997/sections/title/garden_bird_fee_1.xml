 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With habitat loss, degradation and progressive urbanization, there is increased focus on the value that domestic gardens provide for wild birds. Supplementary feeding of garden birds is practised by millions of people across Europe, North America and Australasia [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C1">1</a>]. Wild bird feeding is postulated to be one of the most common forms of human–wildlife interaction in the Western world [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C2">2</a>] and an estimated 48% of households in Great Britain (GB) provide supplementary food [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C3">3</a>]. Since the 1970s, there has been a shift from winter-only to year-round feeding, supported by the argument that nutritional demands vary across the year and are not limited to periods of harsh weather. Concurrently, diversification in commercially available products, notably seed mixes, suet-based products and insectivorous diets, has occurred. This has been coupled with an increased variety of food presentation, from table and ground feeding options to numerous designs and sizes of suspended feeders.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supplementary feeding may affect wild birds in many ways, including changes to body condition, reproductive success, survival, community structure and migration behaviour [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C4">4</a>–
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C7">7</a>]. In GB, supplementary feeding has been linked to increases in population size of wild bird species making use of this resource [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C8">8</a>]. It is also important to recognize that there is a human well-being perspective to the feeding of wild birds. Contact with wildlife in peri-domestic habitats offers an opportunity to address the growing disconnect with nature that has accompanied progressive urbanization. Feeding birds has been shown to promote human health and well-being and may enhance public interest in wildlife welfare and conservation [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C9">9</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C10">10</a>], although it risks assuaging guilt over wider detrimental environmental change and habitat losses through the act of ‘doing good’ in one's immediate vicinity. While supplementary feeding has the potential to offset some losses resulting from reduced natural food supplies [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C11">11</a>], the benefits largely seem to accrue to already urban-adapted species that frequently use feeding stations [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are risks associated with feeding birds, which include the possibility that wild birds may become reliant on artificial food sources, or be subject to increased predation at feeding stations (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C13">13</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C14">14</a>]). Supplementary feeding also may increase opportunities for pathogen exposure and transmission, with risks associated with (i) congregation at high density for prolonged periods of time and repeatedly over long periods; (ii) opportunities for interspecific mixing unlikely to occur in natural habitats; and (iii) poor hygiene levels leading to pathogen contamination of the feeding station [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C15">15</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C16">16</a>]. Also, supplementary food may pose a risk if it is of poor nutritional value or contaminated with toxins that influence host condition or immunity [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C16">16</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C17">17</a>]. Finally, crowding and competition at feeding stations may lead to stress and secondary immunosuppression, with resources partitioned through dominance hierarchies [

  <a rid="RSTB20170091C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C18">18</a>]. Furthermore, the zoonotic potential of some wild bird pathogens is well known, and the close human–wildlife proximity at feeding stations may increase the risks to public health [
