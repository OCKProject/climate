  <a rid="RSTB20170091C40" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C40">40</a>]. Avian pox most commonly presents as proliferative, and readily observable, skin lesions [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C41" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C41">41</a>]. Sporadic reports of disease, mostly of mild to moderate severity, have been confirmed in GB for decades and usually affect individual or small numbers of birds only. Avian poxvirus is resistant in the environment and can persist in a viable state for long periods, estimated to be from weeks to months. Virus transmission occurs via a combination of routes, including direct and indirect contact, perhaps facilitated by skin breach and invertebrate vectors such as biting mosquitoes [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pattern of occurrence of Paridae pox</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2006, a novel and severe form of avian pox affecting Paridae species, most frequently the great tit (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), was diagnosed in southeast England with multiple birds affected in the majority of reported incidents [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C42">42</a>]. Reports were received throughout the year, but with a pronounced seasonal peak in the post-breeding period (August/September), when population densities are at their highest following recruitment of naive juveniles, but also coincident with a seasonal peak in the abundance of mosquito vectors. Following the initial cases, there was a marked expansion in the disease range, consistent with epidemic spread from a point source introduction [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C42">42</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sequence analysis of the avian poxvirus strains affecting British garden bird species revealed that a single B1 clade virus was responsible for Paridae pox emergence, which was distinct from all other strains except that affecting dunnock, although these might be distinguished as separate strains at higher sequencing resolution [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C42">42</a>]. This severe form of pox has been known at an apparently low prevalence in Scandinavia since the 1950s, with incidents seen elsewhere in mainland Europe since 2005 [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C43" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C43">43</a>]. Analyses of the avipoxvirus 4b core protein gene showed identical DNA sequences to great tits in mainland Europe and GB [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C42">42</a>,
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C43" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C43">43</a>]. The spatio-temporal pattern of spread and the same virus strain emerging in great tits in GB and mainland Europe support a hypothesis of disease emergence subsequent to virus incursion, rather than emergence in GB as a result of a spillover event, e.g. from dunnock. As great tits in GB are relatively sedentary, the introduction is likely to have occurred as a result of invertebrate vector movement, perhaps via wind-borne spread or accidental transport [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C42">42</a>]. Great tits seem to be particularly susceptible to the disease because other tit species (such as the blue tit 
   <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) exposed to the same environment are affected much less frequently [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Paridae pox incident reports, which have continued to be received (to 2016), demonstrate that the disease has persisted in southeast England and has an expanding range northward and westward across England and Wales; only a few reports have been received from Scotland since the first report from there in 2015 (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population impact</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although reports of Paridae pox have been received over a similar time period to those of finch trichomonosis, the extent of any regional- and national-scale population impacts are unclear, but appear to have been small. This difference may be, in part, because Paridae pox appears to have a comparatively lower mortality rate than finch trichomonosis and possibly also a lower rate of transmission. While finch trichomonosis rapidly spread across the whole country, and beyond [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C30">30</a>], Paridae pox remained confined to the southeast of England for several years (2006–2009) following its initial emergence before reports started to be received from further afield [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C42">42</a>]. In the 10 years prior to 2005, populations of great tits were increasing, but they have recently decreased significantly in southern England, but not in northern England, or Scotland where Paridae pox is still scarce (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20170091F2" href="#RSTB20170091F2">figure 2</a>). While blue tit populations have also decreased since 2005, there was no difference between regions, in contrast to great tits (electronic supplementary material, table S1). These contrasting population trends are consistent with a disease-mediated decline of great tits in England, although the pattern of regional change in great tit population size does not match well with the expectation that population declines would be greatest in the southeast, where the disease has been present for the longest period. Thus, unlike with the greenfinch where finch trichomonosis is believed to be the major driver of population decline, factors other than infectious disease, such as winter weather, breeding season productivity or the frequency of tree masting, might be contributing to the changing population status of the great tit.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Capture–mark–recapture investigations of a population of great tits found a significant adverse effect of Paridae pox on fledging success and on host survival, especially in juveniles [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C45" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C45">45</a>]. However, an age-structured population model accounting for these effects determined that while Paridae pox could cause a population-level decline, this was not predicted at the observed field prevalence of 5%, but would only occur if the disease prevalence exceeded 8%. There is thus a need for regional sampling to determine the levels of prevalence in great tit populations to inform predictions for future effects of this disease on great tit populations.
