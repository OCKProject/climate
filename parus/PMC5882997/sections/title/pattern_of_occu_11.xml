 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the disease is considered to be endemic, with widespread occurrence, in GB, longitudinal studies have shown variation in the spatial distribution of the main phage types in England and Wales with succession of the predominant phage type over time, with shifts from DT160 to DT40 and then DT56(v) [

  <span class="italic">a</span>). The reason for the sharp decline in this endemic disease remains unknown, but we propose two potential hypotheses: first, that the decline in DT56(v) incidents reflects the development of herd immunity to this biotype and the populations are now vulnerable to emergence of a new variant; or, second, that passerine salmonellosis has density-dependent transmission, and the dramatic reduction in greenfinch numbers in garden habitats, due to finch trichomonosis, has had a secondary impact on occurrence of this bacterial disease. Serosurveys of wild bird populations may help elucidate these hypotheses.
