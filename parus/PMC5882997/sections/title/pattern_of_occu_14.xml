 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine whether garden feeding stations could act as a source of AF or OA in GB, a pilot study was conducted to screen for these mycotoxins in food residues collected from hanging feeders in use at feeding stations [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C59" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C59">59</a>]. Food residues collected from hanging feeders were submitted from seven gardens in southeast England in 2005 (see the electronic supplementary material). Detectable AF residues were found in all seven samples, two of which greatly exceeded the 20 µg kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span> maximum permitted limit for AFB
  <sub>1</sub> (for peanuts in livestock feed, including wild bird food) [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C60">60</a>] at values of 690 and 61 710 µg kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (electronic supplementary material, table S2). Detectable OA residues were found in two samples (1.0 and 2.6 µg kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), neither of which approached the 100 µg kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span> EU guidance limit for OA in poultry foodstuffs [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C61" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C61">61</a>]. Thus, garden birds may be exposed to AF residues in supplementary food at levels associated with acute and chronic toxic effects in captive birds. Experimental studies have found variation between species in apparent ability to discriminate against AF-contaminated food sources, suggesting that avoidance may not be possible [
