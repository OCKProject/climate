 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exposure to aflatoxins (AFs) and ochratoxin A (OA) can exert a range of adverse effects in birds, ranging from acute toxicosis to chronic subclinical impairment of growth, reproduction and immune function [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C54">54</a>]. Aflatoxins (B
  <sub>1</sub>, B
  <sub>2</sub>, G
  <sub>1</sub> and G
  <sub>2</sub>) and OA are secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi of the genera 
  <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Penicillium</span>, respectively, and have been shown to be produced in peanuts and other foodstuffs used in supplementary foods sold for garden bird consumption [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C55">55</a>]. Optimal conditions for AF production occur at high temperature and relative humidity, although Thompson and Henke [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C56" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C56">56</a>] demonstrated AF production under temperate climatic conditions; OA production also occurs in conditions found in GB [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C57" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C57">57</a>]. Furthermore, hepatic AF residues have been detected in house sparrows and greenfinches found dead in gardens in GB, confirming exposure of wild birds in peri-domestic habitats in this country [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pattern of occurrence of mycotoxin exposure</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine whether garden feeding stations could act as a source of AF or OA in GB, a pilot study was conducted to screen for these mycotoxins in food residues collected from hanging feeders in use at feeding stations [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C59" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C59">59</a>]. Food residues collected from hanging feeders were submitted from seven gardens in southeast England in 2005 (see the electronic supplementary material). Detectable AF residues were found in all seven samples, two of which greatly exceeded the 20 µg kg
   <span class="sup">−1</span> maximum permitted limit for AFB
   <sub>1</sub> (for peanuts in livestock feed, including wild bird food) [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C60">60</a>] at values of 690 and 61 710 µg kg
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (electronic supplementary material, table S2). Detectable OA residues were found in two samples (1.0 and 2.6 µg kg
   <span class="sup">−1</span>), neither of which approached the 100 µg kg
   <span class="sup">−1</span> EU guidance limit for OA in poultry foodstuffs [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C61" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C61">61</a>]. Thus, garden birds may be exposed to AF residues in supplementary food at levels associated with acute and chronic toxic effects in captive birds. Experimental studies have found variation between species in apparent ability to discriminate against AF-contaminated food sources, suggesting that avoidance may not be possible [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research on poultry species has shown marked interspecific variation in the effects of mycotoxins (e.g. [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C63" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C63">63</a>,
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C64">64</a>]), but no information is currently available on the susceptibility of wild bird species. While AF residues were detected in the liver of common British garden birds, no evidence of macroscopic hepatic abnormalities was detected on post-mortem examination of these birds; microscopic appraisal of tissues was not possible [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C58">58</a>]. The impacts of AF and OA exposure at both the individual and population level for wild birds are, therefore, currently unknown.
