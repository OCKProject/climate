 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although reports of Paridae pox have been received over a similar time period to those of finch trichomonosis, the extent of any regional- and national-scale population impacts are unclear, but appear to have been small. This difference may be, in part, because Paridae pox appears to have a comparatively lower mortality rate than finch trichomonosis and possibly also a lower rate of transmission. While finch trichomonosis rapidly spread across the whole country, and beyond [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C30">30</a>], Paridae pox remained confined to the southeast of England for several years (2006–2009) following its initial emergence before reports started to be received from further afield [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C42">42</a>]. In the 10 years prior to 2005, populations of great tits were increasing, but they have recently decreased significantly in southern England, but not in northern England, or Scotland where Paridae pox is still scarce (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20170091F2" href="#RSTB20170091F2">figure 2</a>). While blue tit populations have also decreased since 2005, there was no difference between regions, in contrast to great tits (electronic supplementary material, table S1). These contrasting population trends are consistent with a disease-mediated decline of great tits in England, although the pattern of regional change in great tit population size does not match well with the expectation that population declines would be greatest in the southeast, where the disease has been present for the longest period. Thus, unlike with the greenfinch where finch trichomonosis is believed to be the major driver of population decline, factors other than infectious disease, such as winter weather, breeding season productivity or the frequency of tree masting, might be contributing to the changing population status of the great tit.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Capture–mark–recapture investigations of a population of great tits found a significant adverse effect of Paridae pox on fledging success and on host survival, especially in juveniles [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C45" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C45">45</a>]. However, an age-structured population model accounting for these effects determined that while Paridae pox could cause a population-level decline, this was not predicted at the observed field prevalence of 5%, but would only occur if the disease prevalence exceeded 8%. There is thus a need for regional sampling to determine the levels of prevalence in great tit populations to inform predictions for future effects of this disease on great tit populations.
