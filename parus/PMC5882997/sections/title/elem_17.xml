  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Disease prevention</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Guidance for disease prevention can be tailored to address potential risk factors; for example, offering a variety of supplementary foods from accredited sources and feeding in moderation or only providing an amount of food at a time that will be consumed within a short period (1â€“2 days). Perhaps most challenging in this regard is the identification of ways to provide supplementary food while minimizing opportunities for interspecific contact that might not regularly occur in the wild. Currently, there is a move towards providing a variety of food types in close proximity, which is likely to increase opportunities for species mixing: for example, on single pole multipurpose feeding platforms that accommodate suspended feeders for seed and nuts, together with platform feeders and water bowls. Measures to reduce contamination at feeding stations, including regular cleaning and disinfection of bird feeders and tables, removal of food waste and faeces, and frequent replenishment and rotation of the locations of feeding stations are recommended. Feeder designs could be improved to reduce the chances of deterioration in food quality (e.g. prevent food becoming moist), avoid contamination of uneaten food and promote ease of cleaning. Food should also be stored appropriately and kept dry, with no rodent access.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As wildlife diseases are often highly seasonal, avoiding feeding during sensitive periods has been suggested as a measure to mitigate spread of diseases associated with population-level declines, such as during the house finch conjunctivitis peak in the autumn months [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C16">16</a>]. However, a study using large-scale surveys found that house finch declines following disease emergence were greatest where the density of bird feeding was reduced, which indicates that while supplementary food provision may contribute to pathogen transmission, there might have been some compensatory positive effect countering the level of disease-related mortality [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C84" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C84">84</a>]. Comparison of these findings with additional studies, focused on alternative infectious diseases with varying case fatality rates, would be useful to further appraise the evidence for beneficial effects of feeding versus detrimental effects of increased transmission opportunities. The potential benefit of food withdrawal to reduce opportunities for pathogen spillover to other wild bird species, which is a particular concern for the transmission of finch trichomonosis to other passerine species, requires similar evaluation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is worth noting that compliance with any request to cease feeding for disease prevention is likely to be ignored by a significant proportion of those people who feed wild birds. Motivations to feed are varied, including pleasure, environmental and philosophical preconceptions about wild bird care and responsibility [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C14">14</a>]. This suggests that efforts could more effectively be directed to moderating behaviour in other ways, perhaps by seeking to reduce or redistribute the volume or type of food resources made available, or by pursuing the adoption of optimal hygiene measures. Educating the general public about the typical signs of ill health in garden birds, raising awareness of the occurrence and impact of disease outbreaks and communicating the benefits of vigilance for early detection and diagnosis may all assist with public understanding and the acceptance of evidence-based, best-practice advice. Research into the public's perception of who is responsible for investigation and action during wildlife disease outbreaks and their opinions on available mitigation measures would be useful.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Disease control</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Control measures applicable to disease outbreaks in garden birds are limited. While requests from the public to medicate free-living birds are frequently received, this practice is not recommended for multiple reasons, including the inability to safely and effectively provide the correct dose to target free-living animals and the risk of promoting antimicrobial resistance. Treatment is only practicable if affected garden birds are taken into care; however, because small passerines usually can only be captured by hand at the end stage of disease, these casualties typically have a poor prognosis [
   <a rid="RSTB20170091C85" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C85">85</a>]. Where multiple birds are affected during a disease outbreak, temporary suspension of feeding to disperse birds, to reduce local population density and to reduce the risks of intra- and interspecific spread, is often advised. This recommendation may be influenced by the mode of transmission of the disease and how likely it is that the rate of transmission will be influenced by congregation at feeding stations. Suspension of bird feeding is also advocated where there is suspicion or confirmation of potentially zoonotic disease, such as passerine salmonellosis, to reduce the risk of public exposure through continuation of the activity.
