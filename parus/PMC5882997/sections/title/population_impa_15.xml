 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research on poultry species has shown marked interspecific variation in the effects of mycotoxins (e.g. [

  <a rid="RSTB20170091C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C64">64</a>]), but no information is currently available on the susceptibility of wild bird species. While AF residues were detected in the liver of common British garden birds, no evidence of macroscopic hepatic abnormalities was detected on post-mortem examination of these birds; microscopic appraisal of tissues was not possible [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C58">58</a>]. The impacts of AF and OA exposure at both the individual and population level for wild birds are, therefore, currently unknown.
