 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first year of epidemic mortality (2006), a marked decrease in the number of gardens reporting greenfinches and chaffinches was noted, which was contemporaneous with a late summer peak in reports of the disease [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C29">29</a>]. This resulted in a reduction in the breeding population of greenfinches (by 35%) and of chaffinches (by 20%) in the area with the highest frequency of disease reports, but no decrease in dunnock (
  <span class="italic">Prunella modularis</span>) numbers (which represents a rarely affected ‘control’ species [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C29">29</a>]). In the years preceding the initial outbreak, all three species were widespread, being reported in approximately 80% of gardens each spring (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20170091F1" href="#RSTB20170091F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">c</span>). In the years following the emergence of finch trichomonosis, dunnocks continued to be reported in a similar proportion of gardens to before, while the number of gardens reported to be visited by chaffinches decreased only slightly. Greenfinches, though, were seen in fewer than half (49%) the number of gardens in 2015/2016 relative to before the disease outbreak. At the same time, a large decrease in the number of greenfinches recorded at garden feeders was noted (from a mean of 5.6 average weekly maximum group size before 2006 to 1.6 in 2015/2016), with a smaller decrease for chaffinch (6.2 to 4.7) and no change was noted for the dunnock (mean = 1.5, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20170091F1" href="#RSTB20170091F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">b</span>). These changes are reflected at the national level, as the size of the greenfinch (but not chaffinch or dunnock) breeding population has continued to decline markedly (by 66%, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20170091F1" href="#RSTB20170091F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">a</span>), from a peak of approximately 4.3 million in 2006 (just before the onset of the epidemic) to approximately 1.5 million individuals in 2016 (i.e. an average reduction of approx. 280 000 individuals per annum). This represents the largest scale infectious disease impact on a European wild bird on record and has led to the inclusion of the British race of Greenfinch, 
  <span class="italic">C. chloris harrisoni</span> on the red list of Birds of Conservation Concern [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C38">38</a>]. Furthermore, recent assessment of extinction risk using the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red list guidelines classified the breeding greenfinch population in GB as endangered [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C39">39</a>]. It is unclear whether the more recent decline in chaffinch numbers since 2012 (
