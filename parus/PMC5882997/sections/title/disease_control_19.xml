 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Control measures applicable to disease outbreaks in garden birds are limited. While requests from the public to medicate free-living birds are frequently received, this practice is not recommended for multiple reasons, including the inability to safely and effectively provide the correct dose to target free-living animals and the risk of promoting antimicrobial resistance. Treatment is only practicable if affected garden birds are taken into care; however, because small passerines usually can only be captured by hand at the end stage of disease, these casualties typically have a poor prognosis [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C85" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C85">85</a>]. Where multiple birds are affected during a disease outbreak, temporary suspension of feeding to disperse birds, to reduce local population density and to reduce the risks of intra- and interspecific spread, is often advised. This recommendation may be influenced by the mode of transmission of the disease and how likely it is that the rate of transmission will be influenced by congregation at feeding stations. Suspension of bird feeding is also advocated where there is suspicion or confirmation of potentially zoonotic disease, such as passerine salmonellosis, to reduce the risk of public exposure through continuation of the activity.
