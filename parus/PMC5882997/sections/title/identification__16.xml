 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Provision of supplementary food, both intentional and unintentional, has occurred throughout human history and has shaped communities, food webs and ecosystems [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C65" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C65">65</a>]. More specifically, provision of food at garden bird feeding stations has the potential to influence bird populations over a larger area, both directly through the energy and nutrients provided, but also through the alteration of pathogen dynamics, including the transmission of disease to a wider population [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C2">2</a>]. It has been shown that the birds using garden feeding stations may be attracted from a much wider area, arriving to take advantage of supplementary food, especially when natural foods may be in short supply [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C8">8</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C23">23</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C66">66</a>]. The finch trichomonosis work reviewed here highlights the potential importance of garden feeding stations in facilitating disease transmission that can adversely impact populations, as well as wild bird welfare. However, there is much that is still unknown about the risk factors associated with supplementary feeding.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a need to characterize basic epidemiological parameters (such as incubation periods, transmission rates and infection probability) and variation in species' susceptibility, although this would require experimental challenge studies for specific pathogens. Such information would enable parameterization of models to assess the relative benefits provided by increased food availability and the costs of disease transmission, but also to predict the effect of mitigation measures and their concomitant population-scale impacts. While peri-domestic habitats can support a substantial proportion of the overall population of some bird species [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C67" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C67">67</a>], the extent of interchange of individuals between these and rural habitats is poorly known, and hence so is the extent to which diseases transmitted at feeders can infiltrate the wider population. Furthermore, reports of disease incidents observed in the vicinity of feeding stations may provide unrepresentative estimates of disease risk, because infected individuals frequently remain around feeding stations for long periods (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C68" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C68">68</a>]) and, therefore, are visible through to the end stage of disease [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C29">29</a>]. Surveillance of species in rural locations away from established feeding stations is likely to be required to gain a more complete picture of the infection landscape. This approach was adopted in a study of multiple bird species at forested sites in central Illinois, USA, which contrasted individual bird health at sites with and without supplementary food provision [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C69" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C69">69</a>]. Live bird capture in mist nets and sampling were employed with assessment of multiple parameters, appraising stress (i.e. heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), body condition (i.e. body fat score and body condition index), antioxidant capacity, total protein, haematocrit, feather quality, reproductive physiology (i.e. testosterone or oestradiol plasma concentration), immune function (i.e. microbial killing assays) and observation of clinical signs of disease (e.g. conjunctivitis, avian pox, fungal skin disease, cloacal infection). Both positive and negative impacts of wild bird feeding were detected. Results indicate that, in general, birds at sites with feeding stations were in better physiological condition and of greater overall health status; however, there was significantly greater observed disease prevalence than for birds at control sites. Similar studies in additional countries, with different wild bird species and infectious diseases, would be worthwhile and also could include pathogen screening and/or serosurveillance would be worthwhile.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A key unknown is exposure risk, both to pathogens and to toxins. While the impact of heavy metals and pesticides is often well studied (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C70" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C70">70</a>]), the role of mycotoxin contaminants in food supplies has largely been ignored. The occurrence of mycotoxin contamination is higher in warm, wet conditions, which are likely to become more frequent with climate change [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C71" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C71">71</a>]. The ability of pathogens to persist in the environment is poorly known, yet this is a key determinant of exposure risk. For example, experiments have determined that 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> can survive in moist seed (&lt;24 h), seed with organic material (less than 48 h) and distilled water with organic material (less than 16 h), but no survival was detected in dry seed [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C72" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C72">72</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C73" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C73">73</a>]. The method of food provision (e.g. ground, bird table or in a hanging feeder) will also influence the likelihood of exposure. For example, transmission of 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> may be facilitated by horizontal feeding surfaces, where saliva and regurgitated food from infected birds can easily contaminate fresh food. By contrast, hanging feeders may increase direct and indirect contact rates via perches or mesh and facilitate avian poxvirus transmission. The presence of tube style feeders was found to be significantly associated with the risk of house finch conjunctivitis, a disease transmitted via direct and indirect contact [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C74" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C74">74</a>]. Feeding may also lead to increased opportunities for interspecific mixing at close quarters, including of species that would not normally associate together, elevating the risk of pathogen transmission from one species to another. Observational studies of species using feeding stations, their community composition, behaviours, contact rates and dominance hierarchies may identify the species and/or individuals at greatest risk of pathogen exposure.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Provision of supplementary food can influence pathogen invasion and prevalence, and there is a need to explore interactions between host demography, contact behaviour and immune defence [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C75" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C75">75</a>]. Empirical studies to assess the nutritional composition of supplementary food, and how this resource affects host immunity, would help inform the trade-off between risks and benefits. Poor-quality or contaminated food can compromise immune function, further increasing the risk of disease transmission [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C16">16</a>]. Commercially available foods for garden birds are typically based on convenient, affordable and available seed resources, some of which are known to be nutritionally incomplete when they form the majority diet of captive birds (e.g. excess fat, deficient in vitamins A and D3 and calcium [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C76" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C76">76</a>]). While provision of artificial food sources in garden habitats is proposed as a supplement to natural diets (when a balanced nutritional composition may not be required), there is a need for further investigation to determine the proportion of the diet that it constitutes [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C14">14</a>]. While there have been a limited number of such studies with tit species which indicate that the proportion of supplementary food in the diet varies by site and individual (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C77" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C77">77</a>]), how this alters by species is unknown.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluation of the risk of mycotoxin exposure associated with supplementary feeding could be conducted by comparing toxins in various provisioned food types to levels in natural wild foods. Measuring mycotoxin levels in provisioned food at the point of sale, after storage and following exposure to British climatic conditions would provide information about the risk of mycotoxin exposure, but this would also need a better understanding of how wild birds react to and consume foods with differing levels of mycotoxin. Identifying the impacts of mycotoxins on wild birds and how they vary by species would require studies involving experimental exposure to the toxins of interest.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While there is no known risk to public health from finch trichomonosis or Paridae pox, people can develop gastroenteritis following infection with garden bird-associated strains of 
  <span class="italic">S.</span> Typhimurium. Evaluation of the spatio-temporal trends of the 
  <span class="italic">S.</span> Typhimurium phage types seen in garden birds and matched biotypes in people over a 20-year period in England and Wales found evidence of a positive association in both time and space between the two cohorts [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C52" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C52">52</a>]. Whole-genome sequence studies of 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. Typhimurium phage types 40 and 56(v) from both garden birds and people in GB showed that they were genetically closely related [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C78" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C78">78</a>]. While these combined data support wild birds as a potential source of zoonotic disease, it is important to note that wild bird-associated biotypes represented only 0.2% of human 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> infections over a 10-year period [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C52" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C52">52</a>]. Risks to domesticated animal health from wild bird disease should similarly be considered.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social science methodologies can be used to understand the motivations of people who feed garden birds [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C79" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C79">79</a>] and the ways to most effectively communicate guidance to direct and effect improvements in practices for disease prevention and control. Parallel approaches being used to understand community participation in citizen science might be useful here [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C80" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C80">80</a>]. The use of supplementary feeding to support recovery programmes for species of conservation concern has generated a strategic and integrated approach, applying structured decision-making processes to the critical evaluation of benefits and risks for individual conservation projects [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C81" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C81">81</a>]. A similar approach may be tenable on a larger scale to facilitate the development of best-practice guidance for feeding garden birds integrating available information from various disciplines.
