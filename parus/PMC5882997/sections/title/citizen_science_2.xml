 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Citizen science offers a cost-effective means to undertake large-scale, year-round, longitudinal disease surveillance in conjunction with the monitoring of wildlife populations, their distributions and abundances [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C20">20</a>]. This approach lends itself to monitoring species, such as songbirds, that use peri-domestic habitats and are positively perceived by the public [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C21">21</a>]. In GB, national wild bird disease surveillance has been achieved over a 25-year period through public reporting of observed morbidity and mortality. The methods used have evolved over this period in several ways, most notably involving a shift from opportunistic reports only (1992–2004) to an integrated system of independent opportunistic and systematic surveillance approaches (2005–present) [
  <a rid="RSTB20170091C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20170091C22">22</a>], which has been greatly facilitated by expansion of an already existing national citizen science scheme [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Briefly, volunteers in the British Trust for Ornithology's (BTO) Garden BirdWatch (GBW) scheme submit weekly reports throughout the calendar year, providing measures of occurrence and abundance of wild birds using their gardens. Expansion of this scheme to include the recording of observation of disease now provides a structured and systematic dataset that can be used to control for the spatial and temporal biases seen in opportunistic reporting approaches. Post-mortem examinations are conducted from a subset of incidents, including those reported by both GBW participants and opportunistic recorders. Standardized examination protocols, supported by ancillary diagnostic tests, are conducted, and set case and incident definitions are employed (see the electronic supplementary material). A collaborative approach, bringing together veterinary diagnostic laboratories, conservation and animal welfare organizations, government, the wild bird care industry and academia, underpinned by public contributions, has been adopted to maximize awareness and impact across invested communities.</p>
