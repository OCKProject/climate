 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This review summarizes field data on a national scale that clearly demonstrates the dynamism of endemic and emerging diseases in wild bird populations, even within a relatively small geographical area, such as GB, and a short time frame. The aetiological agents, mechanisms of emergence, modes of transmission and anthropogenic activities likely to influence transmission vary. In a world where the focus is typically on emerging conditions (e.g. finch trichomonosis and Paridae pox), the marked reduction of an endemic disease (e.g. passerine salmonellosis) reinforces that changes in occurrence can be bidirectional and that there may be interplay between the conditions present. Our findings highlight the importance of longitudinal scanning surveillance to capture early signals of changes in disease epidemiology, not just the emergence of novel conditions. Such surveillance informs the real-time prioritization of recommendations for mitigation tailored to current conditions and their concomitant risks to both wild bird and public health. There is a need to balance the risks and benefits of supplementary feeding of garden birds to both wildlife and people, which can be facilitated by engaging with the general public and the bird food industry to promote understanding and to encourage compliance with best-practice guidance.</p>
