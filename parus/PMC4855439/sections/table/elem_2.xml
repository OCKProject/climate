  <p>We used the upper and lower 2.5 % of genes based on fold-change to identify differentially methylated genes with the sum of both average methylation levels &gt; 10 % in order to exclude hypomethylated genes in both tissue types. The fourth (brain hypomethylated) and fifth (brain hypermethylated) column show average and median brain gene expression values expressed as fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped fragments (FPKM) for the set of genes with differentially methylated gene features</p>
