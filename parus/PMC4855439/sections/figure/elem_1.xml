  <p>Distribution of methylation level in blood and brain for mCpG-sites. Methylated CpG sites (methylation level &gt; 0 %) covered in both tissues are divided into ten bins according to their methylation level on the x-axis. The y-axis indicates the proportion of total CpGs that are methylated within each bin. A higher abundance of hypermethylated (methylation level &gt; 80 %) CpG sites was observed in brain compared to blood</p>
