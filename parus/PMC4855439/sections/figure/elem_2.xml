  <p>CHG and CHH methylation sequence motifs. Occurrence of nucleotides are given (bits) relative to the distance from the C nucleotide. CpA sites are predominantly methylated (methylation level &gt;10Â %) at both CHG and CHH sites, whereas methylated CpC sites are very rare. Cytosine is the most dominant third nucleotide at CHH methylated sites</p>
