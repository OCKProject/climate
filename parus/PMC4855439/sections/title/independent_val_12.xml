 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to validate the RNA-seq gene expression results, we performed qPCR on 11 randomly chosen genes using RNA isolated from whole brain tissue of the same individual, as well as five additional individuals. The results revealed a highly significant positive correlation between the RNA-seq and qPCR gene expression results (Pearson correlation; 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.753, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001)(Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S15). In order to validate the WGBS methylation results, we generated reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data using DNA isolated from blood samples from two additional individuals. An average non-CpG methylation level of &lt;0.4 % was observed, with only ~2 % of the methylated sites (relative methylation &gt;10 %) derive from non-CpG sites in the two RRBS samples (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S4), confirming the lack of non-CG methylation in the blood. Furthermore, we used the two RRBS samples to perform correlation analysis on 2000 randomly selected CpG sites (coverage &gt; 10x in all samples) ranging in methylation level between 0 and 100 % in the WGBS sample. We observed a high correlation between the WGBS and both RRBS samples, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.758 (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) and 0.767 (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), respectively (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S16). Together, these results validate the RNA-seq and WGBS results presented here.
