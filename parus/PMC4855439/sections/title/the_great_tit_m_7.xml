 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing in brain and blood samples from a single adult male great tit recently used for genome assembly and annotation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. A total of 12.2 (blood) and 10.6 (brain) million CpG sites with a minimum depth of 10x were covered, representing 80 and 69 % of the total CpG sites in the genome, respectively. We observe a higher average CpG methylation level (the ratio of methylated reads to all reads covering a specific site) in brain compared to blood, based on 10,246,241 CpG sites covered (&gt;10x) in both tissues (50.0 and 42.7 %, respectively; Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The large majority of covered CpG-sites were methylated (relative methylation &gt;10 %) in both brain (73.0 %) and blood (70.2 %). These numbers are consistent with previous findings in mammals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. We observe significant non-CpG methylation in brain (CHG: 3.4 %, CHH: 5.5 %) but not in blood (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). For blood, 97 % of methylated Cs were derived from CpG sites (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). In brain, the majority of methylated Cs (52 %) were located at non-CpG sites, but with generally lower methylation levels. The higher general methylation level in brain is due to a larger proportion of fully methylated CpG-sites (&gt;80 %) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Similar analysis for non-CpG methylation in brain shows that both CHG and CHH sites have generally no or very low methylation levels (&lt;20 %) and similar distributions (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S1). The majority of non-CpG methylation in the great tit brain occurs at CpA dinucleotide sites (75 %), representing 72 and 88 % of methylated CHH and CHG sites, respectively (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>, Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S2). Additional non-CpG methylation mainly occurs at CpT sites (22 %), with CpC dinucleotide sites being rarely methylated (3 %). Furthermore, the average methylation level for CpA sites is 3.4 %, 1.16 % for CpT sites, and only 0.31 % for CpC sites (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Further sequence analysis revealed a dominant CAC sequence motif for CHH methylated sites (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). These motifs are consistent with previous findings in mammals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], but have not been described previously in Aves.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the methylation levels in genic regions we divided the genes into specific gene features: TSS (300 bp upstream - 50 bp downstream of the annotated TSS), five prime untranslated region (5’UTR), GB, coding sequence (CDS), introns, three prime untranslated regions (3’UTR) and transcription termination site (TTS; 50 bp upstream - 200 bp downstream of the annotated TTS). Methylation levels were further calculated in the context of gene regions by dividing each gene into overlapping sliding windows and including the 10 kb upstream and downstream regions (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figures S3, S4). We found low methylation levels in TSS and 5’UTR regions and higher methylation levels in the GB increasing towards the 3’UTR before decreasing again near the TTS. We found higher methylation levels in coding regions compared to intronic regions (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S5) and longer genes have generally higher CpG methylation levels (Fig.
