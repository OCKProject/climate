 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We show distinct methylation patterns of two tissue types in the great tit. In addition, we observe a clear link between methylation and the regulation of gene expression and TE activity in the brain. The dominant CAG and CAC sequence motifs for brain non-CpG methylation, which are also observed in mammals, suggests a conserved non-CpG regulatory mechanism is present between birds and mammals. From our results, we hypothesize a distinct function for CpG and non-CpG methylation in TE silencing in the brain. This theory is supported by the contrast between CpG and non-CpG methylation in TEs. Moreover, a negative correlation between non-CpG methylation and TE activity (not found for CpG methylation) shows that non-CpG methylation is involved in TE silencing and perhaps the dominant regulatory form of methylation in the brain.</p>
