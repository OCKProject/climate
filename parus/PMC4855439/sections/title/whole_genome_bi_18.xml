These reads were aligned to the great tit reference genome [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>] using BS-Seeker v2.0.6 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>] with Bowtie2 v2.1.0 using the local alignment mode [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. In total, 95,79 and 98.04 % of the genome was covered with an average depth of 31.89x (52 % mapping rate) and 33.04x (64 % mapping rate) in brain and blood, respectively. Methylation levels (defined as the ratio of methylated/total reads at a given site) were determined using the methylation call scripts from BSseeker2. All downstream analysis was performed using sites covered by a minimum of 10 reads.
