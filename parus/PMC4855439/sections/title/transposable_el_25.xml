 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transposable elements (TE) were annotated using RepeatMasker (v4.0.3) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>] with RepBase (update: 20130422) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. In total, 26,834 TEs covering 2.1 % (21.3 Mb) of the genome were used in the analysis with TEs smaller than 500 bp excluded. We used a sliding window approach to assess the relative methylation levels of TEs by divided them into three different regions; the TE, 2 kb upstream and 2 kb downstream. Each region was subdivided into ten overlapping sliding windows (20 % of the regions length) with an overlap of 10 %, and average methylation levels were calculated for each sliding window. We used Tophat version 2.0.10 to uniquely align the RNA-seq reads (84.3 % overall mapping rate) to the reference genome [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>] with following settings: max-multihits 1,--read-realign-edit-dist 0,--mate-inner-dist 50 and --mate-std-dev 150. TE expression was assessed using the cufflinks --GTF option with a GFF containing all identified TEs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>] and --overlap-radius 5,--intron-overhang-tolerance 5. TE expression values (FPKM) were extracted from the Cufflinks output. Spearman’s correlations between TE expression and methylation were calculated using R (version: 3.0.2).
