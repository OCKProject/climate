 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">RNA was extracted from hypothalamus tissue of five great tits collected for another study (Verhagen unpublished.). Punches were taken from the hypothalamus region using the method of Perfito et al. 2012 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. In short, brain tissue was cut on a cryostat. 3 mm circular punches were sampled from the hypothalamus region, resulting in sampling equal volumes from each individual brain. Brain punches were immediately added to 1 ml TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), homogenized and stored at -80C until extraction. Total RNA of brain punches was extracted using the method of TRIzol Reagent. For these five individuals and the single reference individual used for the other analyses (for RNA extraction see RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing) 354 ng of RNA was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA with QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) following the standard protocols. RNA concentration was quantified using a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an AATI Fragment Analyser (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Heidelberg, Germany). The expression level of 12 genes was further investigated by qPCR. The qPCR analysis was performed with PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a C1000 Touch CFX96 (Biorad, Veenendaal, the Netherlands) Primers used for qPCR analysis are given in Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S5. Great tit GAPDH (augustus_masked-chr1-processed-gene-22.8) was used as a standard control. The qPCR program was performed as follows: 50 °C (2 min), 95 °C (2 min), (95 °C (15 s), 60 °C (1 min))x40 cycles. PCR fragment sizes for the 12 genes were visualized on 1 % agarose gel to verify their band size and specificity.
