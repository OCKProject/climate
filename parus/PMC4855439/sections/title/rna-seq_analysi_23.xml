  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. In total, 200.8 M trimmed paired end reads were aligned (84.7 % overall mapping rate) against the reference genome with Tophat v2.0.10 using –max-multihits 20, --read-realign-edit-dist 0,--mate-inner-dist 50,--mate-std-dev 150 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. Tophat analysis included a pre-alignment to the reference genome to filter out reads extending the maximum number of alignments (-M option) followed by alignment to the reference transcriptome (-G) and alignment to the genome. Transcript assembly and quantification was done with Cufflinks v2.2.0 including the annotation (-g option),--overlap-radius 5 and --intron-overhang-tolerance 5. Expression values were extracted from the cufflinks output and represented as fragments per kilobase of exons per million mapped reads (FPKM) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. We used a two sample 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-test assuming equal variances to test for significant gene expression differences between differentially methylated gene sets. Spearman’s correlations between gene expression and methylation were calculated using R (version: 3.0.2).
