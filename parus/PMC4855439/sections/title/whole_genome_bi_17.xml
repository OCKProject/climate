 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA was extracted from whole blood using a Gentra Puregene Kit (Qiagen, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Homogenized whole brain was incubated overnight at 55 °C in 750 μl Cell Lysis Solution (Gentra Puregene Kit, Qiagen, USA) with 20 μl proteinase K. 250 μl of this lysed tissue was added to 250 ul Cell Lysis Solution. To remove excess of fat and proteins, 500 μl 24:1 chloroform:isoamylalcohol was added and mixed until homogeneous, followed by 10 min centrifugation at 12.000x g after which the upper layer was collected. Cell Lysis Solution was added to this upper layer until 500 μl of sample liquid was obtained and total DNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was stored in DNA Hydration Solution (Qiagen, USA), and the concentration was determined with a Nanodrop 2000 (ThermoThermo Scientific, USA). DNA was sheared using a Covaris E210 device to ~700 bp peak fragment sizes. One microgram sheared and purified DNA including 1 ng sheared Lambda DNA was used for end repair, adenylating and adapter ligation according to illumina TruSeq LT DNA sample preparation guide. Adapter Ligated DNA was purified using AmpureXP beads (Agencourt) and subsequently used for bisulfite conversion according to EpiTect Plus Bisulfite workflow (Qiagen) with small modifications i.e. three additional rounds of denaturation’s (5 min at 95 °C each) and incubations (60 °C for 25, 85 and 125 min respectively). Converted DNA was purified following manufacturer’s instructions (EpiTect) and split over three parallel reactions for library amplification using Pfu Cx hotstart DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies) and 18 PCR cycles. PCR products were pooled per sample and final amplified bisulfite converted libraries were quantified using Qubit (Invitrogen) and Bio analyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were used for clustering on two partial flowcells on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system generating 358.3 M (72.4Gbp) and 292.4 M (59.1Gbp) paired-end reads (101 bp) for brain and blood, respectively.</p>
