 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed DNA methylation in 26,834 TEs (mainly LINE/CR1 and LTR/ERVL elements) divided into short interspersed elements (SINE), long interspersed elements (LINE), and LTR retrotransposons. CpG sites within TEs are largely hypermethylated in both brain and blood (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S12). The CpG methylation levels in TEs and upstream and downstream 2 kb flanking regions in brain are significantly higher than in blood, with the difference in average methylation reaching up to 20 %. Interestingly, the opposite pattern was observed for non-CpG methylation, with decreased non-CpG methylation in TEs compared to their flanking regions in brain (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S13). Additionally, TE expression shows a negative correlation with non-CpG methylation level (Spearman’s rho &lt; −0.11, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 1x10
  <span class="sup">−15</span>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). This negative correlation is even stronger in the 2 kb upstream (Spearman’s rho &lt; −0.20, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 1x10
  <span class="sup">−15</span>) and downstream regions (Spearman’s rho &lt; −0.19, P &lt; 1x10
  <span class="sup">−15</span>). Surprisingly this negative correlation was not observed for CpG methylation (Spearman’s rho: TE-body = 0.033, upstream = −0.0056, downstream = −0.0023; Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S14). The methylation patterns did not differ between the different types of TEs.

    <p>Non-CpG methylation in relation to TE expression in the brain. Figure shows the non-CpG methylation level in TEs, 2 kb upstream, and 2 kb downstream regions in relation to expression, presented as fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped fragments (FPKM). Active TEs (FPKM &gt; 0) show lower non-CpG methylation levels compared to inactive TEs (FPKM = 0)</p>
