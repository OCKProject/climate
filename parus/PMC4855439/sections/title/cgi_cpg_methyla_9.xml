 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We divided the CGIs into three groups according to the position of the CGI: promoter associated CGIs (2 kb upstream - 500 bp downstream of annotated TSS), intragenic CGIs, and intergenic CGIs. While promoter CGIs in general tend to be hypomethylated, intragenic CGIs tend to have higher methylation in both tissues (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S8). Moreover, when comparing the methylation levels of these CGIs in blood and brain, we found fewer differentially methylated CGIs in promoter regions (11.9 %) compared to intragenic and intergenic CGIs (23.0 and 25.3 %, respectively; Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). We found that genes associated with hypermethylated CGIs (both promoter and intragenic) in brain compared to blood are largely involved in developmental processes (morphogenesis, cell differentiation, organ development, embryonic development, and system development; Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Tables S1, S2). These results are consistent with previous studies where differential methylation across tissues was found in genes linked to development [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. Genes associated with hypomethylated promoter CGIs in brain compared to blood are involved in the protein secretion of platelet, neurotrophin production, and regulation of protein targeting to membrane (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Table S3), while genes with hypomethylated intragenic CGIs in brain are enriched for categories linked to (neuron) development and differentiation (cell differentiation, system development, generation of neurons and neurogenesis; Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Table S4). We observe significantly higher brain expression of genes associated with both promoter and intragenic hypomethylated CGIs compared to hypermethylated CGIs in brain (Promoter:
