 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Until recently, chickens were the only birds with DNA methylation information available [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. The recent publication of the great tit genome has revealed methylation patterns analogous to those of mammals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. However, the observed dominant sequence motifs for non-CpG methylation have not been previously described in the Aves class. We have shown differential methylation levels between brain and blood for groups of genes linked to the functions of those tissues. Furthermore, differentially methylated CGIs between brain and blood that are located in promoter and intragenic regions are overrepresented in genetic loci essential for development. TEs are hypermethylated at CpG sites but hypomethylated at non-CpG sites. Interestingly, TE expression in brain tissue negatively correlates with non-CpG methylation, but not with CpG methylation. This novel finding provides new insights in the mechanism of TE silencing by methylation in the great tit brain.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed a positive correlation between gene length and methylation level (both CpG and non-CpG). One explanation is that larger genes can compensate for lowly methylated TSS and 5’UTR regions, since they consist of a relatively larger GB. This, however, does not explain that genes in the first size rank (smallest genes) show higher methylation in CpG context. Since single exon genes will be more predominant in the lower rank, with the methylation levels being higher in coding-sequences compared to intronic regions, this might explain the unusually high methylation levels of the smallest gene set.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a very strong association between TSS hypomethylation and gene function; genes with brain related functions were also hypomethylated in brain TSS, supporting that decreased TSS methylation is involved in very specific gene regulation. Interestingly, this signal was not observed for promoter CGIs. In general, methylation levels are conserved in promoter CGIs between the two tissues, being hypomethylated in both brain and blood, supporting the generalization that CGI methylation silences promoters. Intragenic CGIs tend to show higher methylation levels. Hypermethylated promoter and intragenic CGIs in brain are associated with genes involved in development. One hypothesis is that CGI hypermethylation in genomic loci linked to development could silence transcription after brain development. Following human germ cell development, the genome is demethylated and remethylated [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. The opposing hypermethylation of intragenic CGIs in adult brain and hypomethylation in blood could further be explained by the negative correlation between gene body methylation and expression in brain [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>] and the positive correlation in blood [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. However this does not explain the difference between adult blood and brain methylation levels at promoter CGIs.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Non-CpG methylation in (passerine) birds seems to be restricted to certain tissue types and we only found this in brain. No or very low non-CpG methylation was found for genes involved in transcriptional and translational processes. In addition, these genes show higher expression compared to the average. We therefore suggest that highly expressed genes have very little or no non-CpG methylation to enhance transcription. We found a dominant CAG and CAC sequence motif for both CHG and CHH methylated sites, as previously described in mammals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. This supports the existence of a shared non-CpG regulatory mechanism between birds and mammals. We could even argue that non-CpG methylation occurs predominantly on CWG and CWH sites (W = A or T), because CC dinucleotide sites are hardly methylated. The observed dominant motifs are associated with a stronger binding affinity of MeCP2 (especially the methylated CpA dinucleotide sites) in mammals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. MeCP2 has also been shown to preferentially silence longer genes enriched with methylated CpA sites [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. This could explain why we find no or very low CpA methylation in genes involved in protein, DNA, and RNA metabolism (which are generally shorter genes), but do find it in longer genes (e.g. genes involved in cell adhesion). However, the exact function of MeCP2 binding to non-CpG methylated sites remains largely unclear and is associated with both transcriptional silencing and activation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The large differences we found in general methylation levels between brain and blood can be explained by a larger proportion of fully methylated CpG sites in brain, where in blood moderate methylation is more abundant. This dissimilarity might in part be attributed to hypermethylated TEs in brain, which are methylated at lower levels in blood. Methylation of TEs decreases or inhibits transpositional activity. Previous studies observed large differences in TE methylation levels between tissues [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>], although not specifically for blood and brain. Opposite to CpG methylation, we found decreased non-CpG methylation in TEs compared to their flanking regions. In addition, our observation that non-CpG methylation negatively correlates with TE activity suggests a distinct role for non-CpG methylation in TE silencing in the brain. Surprisingly, we did not observe any correlation between CpG methylation and TE activity. Recent studies have shown that TEs are more active in brain tissue compared to other tissues in mammals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. Based on our results, we hypothesize that non-CpG methylation is involved in, and is perhaps even the main regulator of TE silencing in brain.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to note that although we observe a role for brain methylation in regulating gene expression and TE activity, the brain consists of several highly distinctive regions with a variety of functions. Therefore, the results presented here must be taken as the average for whole brain, and cannot be directly correlated with individual brain regions. Moreover, since we only used two tissue types in our analysis, we can only draw conclusions about differences among these tissues. To make more general conclusions about tissue-specificity, more tissues need to be included in the future. Nevertheless, these results provide new insights and present new possibilities to further exploration of the role of methylation (especially the role of non-CpG methylation in TEs) in specific brain regions. In addition, while whole genome bisulfite sequencing is considered the gold standard technique for analyzing genome-wide DNA methylation patterns, the high cost associated with producing such datasets limits the number of biological replicates in studies such as this one. Therefore, although performing statistical analysis at the genic level allows for robust statistical analysis within a single sample, and no non-CpG methylation was detected in the whole blood sample (as expected), further studies in additional individuals are required to confirm the results presented here.</p>
