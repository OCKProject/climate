 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each gene is subdivided into TSS (300 bp upstream, 50 bp downstream of annotated TSS), GB (representing the full length of the annotated gene), and TTS (50 bp upstream, 200 bp downstream of annotated TTS). Transcripts with similar TSS and TTS boundaries were merged to use a set of unique transcripts for downstream analysis. We calculated the fold-change difference in average CpG methylation level between blood and brain in all three gene features (TSS, GB, TTS) where the sum of the relative methylation level in blood and brain is at least 10 % (to exclude hypomethylated gene features in both tissues) and with at least three CpG sites covered. We used the upper (hypermethylated) and lower (hypomethylated) 2.5 % of genes to define differentially methylated regions. We calculated the average non-CpG methylation in blood and brain for TSS, GB, and TTS with at least three non-CpG sites covered. We divided each region into 40 groups of percentiles based on their non-CpG methylation levels using a custom python script and the upper (40th) and lower (1st) percentiles were defined as differentially methylated. The GB was further subdivided into 4 different GB features using custom python scripts; 5’UTR, CDS, intronic sequences, and 3’UTR. We calculated the average methylation levels for both CpG and non-CpG sites covering these GB features. In addition, we used a sliding window approach to correlate the methylation level with gene expression in brain (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figures S7-S11). We used three different gene regions; the GB, 10 kb upstream, and 10 kb downstream of the gene boundaries, For each region, we used 40 overlapping sliding windows (5 % of the regions length) with an overlap of 2.50 %. We subdivided the genes in 10 percentiles based on gene length to assess the correlation between gene length and relative methylation level (over the full length of the annotated gene).
