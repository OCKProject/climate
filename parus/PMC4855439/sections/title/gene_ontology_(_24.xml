 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We performed blastp (e-value 0.1) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>] to human, mouse, and chicken, and InterProScan [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>] on the total great tit gene set. Out of 16,424 transcripts, 15,186 were assigned to a total of 247,144 GO-terms (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S3). These results were imported into Blast2GO to assign GO-terms for each individual gene [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. We calculated the fold-change difference in average CpG methylation level between blood and brain in all three gene features (TSS, GB, TTS) where the sum of the relative methylation level in blood and brain is at least 10 % (to exclude hypomethylated gene features in both tissues) and with at least three CpG sites covered. We used the upper (hypermethylated) and lower (hypomethylated) 2.5 % of gene features to define differentially methylated regions for gene ontology analysis. We calculated the average non-CpG methylation in blood and brain for TSS, GB, and TTS with at least three non-CpG sites covered. We divided the regions into 40 groups of percentiles based on their non-CpG methylation levels (minimum 3 non-CpG sites) using a custom python script and the upper (40th) and lower (1st) percentiles were defined as differentially methylated and used for GO-enrichment analysis. The CytoScape plugin BINGO [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>] was used for GO enrichment analysis using a hypergeometric test to calculate p-values and a Benjamin &amp; Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction to calculate q-values [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. The GO annotations from Blast2GO were used as the reference data set. GO-terms with a q-value less than or equal to 0.05 were considered enriched.
