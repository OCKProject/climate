  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA was extracted from whole blood using a Gentra Puregene Kit (Qiagen, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Homogenized whole brain was incubated overnight at 55 °C in 750 μl Cell Lysis Solution (Gentra Puregene Kit, Qiagen, USA) with 20 μl proteinase K. 250 μl of this lysed tissue was added to 250 ul Cell Lysis Solution. To remove excess of fat and proteins, 500 μl 24:1 chloroform:isoamylalcohol was added and mixed until homogeneous, followed by 10 min centrifugation at 12.000x g after which the upper layer was collected. Cell Lysis Solution was added to this upper layer until 500 μl of sample liquid was obtained and total DNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was stored in DNA Hydration Solution (Qiagen, USA), and the concentration was determined with a Nanodrop 2000 (ThermoThermo Scientific, USA). DNA was sheared using a Covaris E210 device to ~700 bp peak fragment sizes. One microgram sheared and purified DNA including 1 ng sheared Lambda DNA was used for end repair, adenylating and adapter ligation according to illumina TruSeq LT DNA sample preparation guide. Adapter Ligated DNA was purified using AmpureXP beads (Agencourt) and subsequently used for bisulfite conversion according to EpiTect Plus Bisulfite workflow (Qiagen) with small modifications i.e. three additional rounds of denaturation’s (5 min at 95 °C each) and incubations (60 °C for 25, 85 and 125 min respectively). Converted DNA was purified following manufacturer’s instructions (EpiTect) and split over three parallel reactions for library amplification using Pfu Cx hotstart DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies) and 18 PCR cycles. PCR products were pooled per sample and final amplified bisulfite converted libraries were quantified using Qubit (Invitrogen) and Bio analyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were used for clustering on two partial flowcells on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system generating 358.3 M (72.4Gbp) and 292.4 M (59.1Gbp) paired-end reads (101 bp) for brain and blood, respectively.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each gene is subdivided into TSS (300 bp upstream, 50 bp downstream of annotated TSS), GB (representing the full length of the annotated gene), and TTS (50 bp upstream, 200 bp downstream of annotated TTS). Transcripts with similar TSS and TTS boundaries were merged to use a set of unique transcripts for downstream analysis. We calculated the fold-change difference in average CpG methylation level between blood and brain in all three gene features (TSS, GB, TTS) where the sum of the relative methylation level in blood and brain is at least 10 % (to exclude hypomethylated gene features in both tissues) and with at least three CpG sites covered. We used the upper (hypermethylated) and lower (hypomethylated) 2.5 % of genes to define differentially methylated regions. We calculated the average non-CpG methylation in blood and brain for TSS, GB, and TTS with at least three non-CpG sites covered. We divided each region into 40 groups of percentiles based on their non-CpG methylation levels using a custom python script and the upper (40th) and lower (1st) percentiles were defined as differentially methylated. The GB was further subdivided into 4 different GB features using custom python scripts; 5’UTR, CDS, intronic sequences, and 3’UTR. We calculated the average methylation levels for both CpG and non-CpG sites covering these GB features. In addition, we used a sliding window approach to correlate the methylation level with gene expression in brain (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figures S7-S11). We used three different gene regions; the GB, 10 kb upstream, and 10 kb downstream of the gene boundaries, For each region, we used 40 overlapping sliding windows (5 % of the regions length) with an overlap of 2.50 %. We subdivided the genes in 10 percentiles based on gene length to assess the correlation between gene length and relative methylation level (over the full length of the annotated gene).

A CGI was considered intragenic if annotated within the boundaries of a gene, or if it completely covered the gene. We calculated the relative methylation levels for CGIs with at least three CpG sites, and differentially methylated CGIs were determined using a fisher exact test.

Total DNA was prepared by using 250 μl of the stored blood samples with 750 μl Cell Lysis Solution (Gentra Puregene Kit, Qiagen, USA) incubated with proteinase K at 55C overnight, followed by DNA extraction following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was stored in DNA Hydration Solution (Qiagen, USA). Integrity of the DNA as well as absence of RNA was verified by running and visually analyzing 1.5 ul of DNA on a 1 % agarose gel next to a DNA ladder. High-quality genomic DNA (1 μg) was sent to the Carver High-Throughput DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Unit (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA) for generation of RRBS libraries following standard protocols. Briefly, DNA was restriction digested using the methyl-insensitive restriction enzyme Mspl, and the resulting fragments were size-selected (20–200 bp) using agarose gel electrophoresis. Size-selected DNA was bisulfite-treated with the EpiTech Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and column-purified. The final libraries were quantified using Qubit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the average size was determined on an Agilent bioanalyzer DNA7500 DNA chip (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and diluted to 10 nM. The 10 nM dilution was further quantitated by qPCR on an ABI 1900 to ensure high accuracy quantification for consistent pooling of barcoded libraries and maximization of the number of clusters in the Illumina flowcell. RRBS Illumina sequencing was performed on libraries multiplexed and loaded onto 8-lane flowcells for cluster formation and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500.
