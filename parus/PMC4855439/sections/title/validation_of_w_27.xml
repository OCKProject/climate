 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For this we used blood samplings of two great tits originating from the F2 inter-cross between lines selected for high and low levels of exploratory behaviour [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>]. Blood samples of 10 ul were collected when the birds were 40 days old and stored in 1 ml Cell Lysis Solution (Gentra Puregene Kit, Qiagen, USA). Total DNA was prepared by using 250 μl of the stored blood samples with 750 μl Cell Lysis Solution (Gentra Puregene Kit, Qiagen, USA) incubated with proteinase K at 55C overnight, followed by DNA extraction following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was stored in DNA Hydration Solution (Qiagen, USA). Integrity of the DNA as well as absence of RNA was verified by running and visually analyzing 1.5 ul of DNA on a 1 % agarose gel next to a DNA ladder. High-quality genomic DNA (1 μg) was sent to the Carver High-Throughput DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Unit (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA) for generation of RRBS libraries following standard protocols. Briefly, DNA was restriction digested using the methyl-insensitive restriction enzyme Mspl, and the resulting fragments were size-selected (20–200 bp) using agarose gel electrophoresis. Size-selected DNA was bisulfite-treated with the EpiTech Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and column-purified. The final libraries were quantified using Qubit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the average size was determined on an Agilent bioanalyzer DNA7500 DNA chip (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and diluted to 10 nM. The 10 nM dilution was further quantitated by qPCR on an ABI 1900 to ensure high accuracy quantification for consistent pooling of barcoded libraries and maximization of the number of clusters in the Illumina flowcell. RRBS Illumina sequencing was performed on libraries multiplexed and loaded onto 8-lane flowcells for cluster formation and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500. The libraries were sequenced to a total read length of 100 bp from one end (single-end sequencing) of the molecules. Raw reads were trimmed using trim_galore v 0.4.1 and aligned to the great tit reference genome [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>] using BS-Seeker v2.0.10 in --rrbs mode [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>] with Bowtie2 v2.2.7 using the local alignment mode [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. This resulted in a mappability of 75.43 and 75.94 %. Methylation levels were determined using the methylation call scripts from BSseeker2 with a minimum depth of 10x. 2000 randomly selected CpG sites (coverage &gt; 10x in all samples) ranging in methylation level between 0 and 100 % in the WGBS sample were extracted from the RRBS samples. Pearson correlations on the 2000 randomly selected CpG sites were calculated using R (version: 3.0.2).
