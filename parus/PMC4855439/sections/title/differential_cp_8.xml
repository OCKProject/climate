 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified genes differentially methylated between brain and blood in three gene features; TSS, GB, and TTS. Based on the fold change calculated from the relative methylation in the two tissue types, we extracted the 5 % of genes with most extreme methylation fold changes (upper and lower 2.5 %) between tissues for enrichment analysis (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). For TSS, GB, and TTS these sets included 382, 410, and 289 genes, respectively. We found very little overlap in the set of differentially methylated genes from the three gene features (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S6). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that genes with a hypomethylated TSS in the brain compared to blood were enriched in categories linked to regulation of axonogenesis, neuronal synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and spindle localization (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>: Table S1). In contrast, genes with a hypomethylated TSS in blood compared to brain were largely enriched in categories linked to lymphocyte and leukocyte cell activation, immune response, and hemopoiesis (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>: Table S2). Many of these enriched biological processes correspond directly to the specific functions of the examined tissues. Moreover, this result suggests that, at least in brain and blood, genes are generally TSS-hypomethylated in the tissue they are expected to be expressed in. Genes with hypermethylated GBs in brain compared to blood are involved in the (positive) regulation of transcription, development (cell fate commitment, regionalization, embryonic and organ development/morphogenesis), and regulation of immune system process (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>: Table S3). GB hypomethylated genes in brain compared to blood are involved in transcription, RNA-splicing, and translation (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>: Table S4). These results suggests that genes involved in transcription, splicing, and translation are generally GB-hypomethylated in brain to enhance their transcription, while genes important for developmental processes are GB-hypermethylated to silence their transcription, supported by significant differences in brain gene expression data between the two sets (TSS;

  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01; Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Genes with hypermethylated TTS in brain compared to blood are involved in the negative regulation of transcription, opposite of GB-hypermethylated genes (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>: Table S5). The difference in expression in relation to brain methylation supports the observed negative correlation between methylation levels and gene expression in all gene features, earlier described by Laine et al. 2016 [
