 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CGIs were predicted using the cpgplot software, part of the EMBOSS package (version 6.6.0.0) applying default settings (−window 100 -minlen 200 -minoe 0.6 -minpc 50). In total 33,131 CGIs were identified in the genome. CGIs were associated with a promoter if the CGI was annotated within 2 kb upstream to 500 bp downstream of a gene’s annotated TSS. A CGI was considered intragenic if annotated within the boundaries of a gene, or if it completely covered the gene. We calculated the relative methylation levels for CGIs with at least three CpG sites, and differentially methylated CGIs were determined using a fisher exact test. Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple testing, q-value &lt; = 0.05 is considered significant.</p>
