 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl (-CH3) group to the 5’ carbon site of cytosines catalyzed by DNA-methyltransferases, which occurs mainly at CpG sites in animals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. It is involved in many biological processes including modulation of gene expression. The majority of methylation studies have been conducted on either humans or model species for human diseases, and studies on ecological model systems are rare. Moreover, studies on such systems, where reference genomes are often lacking, mainly use targeted methods such as MS-AFLP or RRBS that rely heavily on assumptions from human and rodent studies and provide only limited functional insights [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. We assessed whole genome DNA methylation in the great tit, a model organism for ecological and evolutionary studies on e.g. the effects of climate change on natural populations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>], the allocation of resources to breeding [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>], the impact of variation in personality traits on other life history characters [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>] and one of the first in the class of Aves to study the methylome [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. Whole methylome information will give us detailed insight into processes related to gene expression, silencing and tissue specialization, and allows us to better predict what variation is important for answering ecologically relevant questions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies on DNA methylation in animals have focused mainly on CGIs, which are often found near the TSS and are usually hypomethylated [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Methylation in promoter regions is often found to be negatively-correlated with gene expression, becoming less accessible for transcription factors or RNA-polymerases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. However, not all functions and mechanisms of DNA methylation are well understood. For instance, a positive correlation is observed between gene expression and gene body (GB) methylation in many mammalian tissues [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. In contrary, a slightly negative correlation was found in brain neural tissue [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that GB methylation may have a role in splicing [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. However, recent evidence contradicts this [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. Other studies show that it could prevent interruptive transposable element (TE) insertions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>] and DNA methylation is known to suppress the activity of TEs in both plants and animals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. However, the underlying mechanisms of TE silencing differ between plants and animals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. In plants this involves small RNA-guided DNA methylation of cytosines resulting in a specific signature of dense methylation in all sequence contexts (CpG and non-CpG) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>], whereas a similar system in mammals is unknown, and DNA methylation in TEs and genes is almost exclusively found in a CpG context.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The methylation landscape can vary between tissue types, playing a large role in for example gene regulation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Previous studies have identified differentially methylated regions across tissues [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. However, these studies were mainly conducted in mammals and did not focus specifically on gene features, but rather on differentially methylated regions throughout the genome. The observation that DNA methylation negatively correlates with gene expression suggests that hypomethylation occurs in gene promoter regions that are associated with the biological functions of the tissue. Interestingly, in mammals CGI methylation levels were found to be more similar in promoter regions between tissue types compared to intra and intergenic CGIs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. Furthermore, CGIs showing differences in methylation patterns between tissues were overrepresented at loci essential for development (ectoderm and mesoderm development, neurogenesis and segment specification) in human and mouse [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>], suggesting a distinct role for CGI methylation in development.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to CpG-methylation, CHG and CHH trinucleotide sites (where H represents any nucleotide but G) can be methylated as well, and this type of methylation is reported for somatic tissues including brain, muscle and placenta [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. Non-CpG methylation accumulates during early postnatal development in the mammalian brain and seems to be driven specifically by the DNA methyltransferase 
  <span class="italic">DNMT3A</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. CpA dinucleotide sites are predominantly methylated compared to CpT and CpC sites in mammals, and are starting to be linked to gene regulation in the brain [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. In addition, the methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) binds to methylated non-CpG sites, with a high affinity for mCpA dinucleotide sites. The function of non-CpG methylation and the binding of MeCP2 in brain tissue remains largely unclear, but some studies hypothesize a role for MeCP2 as a transcriptional repressor [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>], whereas others propose a role as a transcriptional activator [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To expand our understanding of DNA methylation and its possible functions in birds, we investigated both CpG and non-CpG whole genome DNA methylation in brain and blood of a passerine bird (great tit, 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>). We specifically assess methylation patterns and their functional roles in relation to gene features, CGIs, and TEs.
