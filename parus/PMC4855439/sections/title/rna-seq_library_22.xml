 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">RNA was extracted from homogenized whole brain using the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. For library preparation we used the TruSeq Stranded RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) using a barcoded adapter. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. This resulted in 229.6 M (46.4Gbp) paired-end 100 bp RNA-seq reads.</p>
