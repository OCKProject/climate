  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing in brain and blood samples from a single adult male great tit recently used for genome assembly and annotation [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. A total of 12.2 (blood) and 10.6 (brain) million CpG sites with a minimum depth of 10x were covered, representing 80 and 69 % of the total CpG sites in the genome, respectively. We observe a higher average CpG methylation level (the ratio of methylated reads to all reads covering a specific site) in brain compared to blood, based on 10,246,241 CpG sites covered (&gt;10x) in both tissues (50.0 and 42.7 %, respectively; Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The large majority of covered CpG-sites were methylated (relative methylation &gt;10 %) in both brain (73.0 %) and blood (70.2 %). These numbers are consistent with previous findings in mammals [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. We observe significant non-CpG methylation in brain (CHG: 3.4 %, CHH: 5.5 %) but not in blood (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). For blood, 97 % of methylated Cs were derived from CpG sites (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). In brain, the majority of methylated Cs (52 %) were located at non-CpG sites, but with generally lower methylation levels. The higher general methylation level in brain is due to a larger proportion of fully methylated CpG-sites (&gt;80 %) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Similar analysis for non-CpG methylation in brain shows that both CHG and CHH sites have generally no or very low methylation levels (&lt;20 %) and similar distributions (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S1). The majority of non-CpG methylation in the great tit brain occurs at CpA dinucleotide sites (75 %), representing 72 and 88 % of methylated CHH and CHG sites, respectively (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>, Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S2). Additional non-CpG methylation mainly occurs at CpT sites (22 %), with CpC dinucleotide sites being rarely methylated (3 %). Furthermore, the average methylation level for CpA sites is 3.4 %, 1.16 % for CpT sites, and only 0.31 % for CpC sites (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Further sequence analysis revealed a dominant CAC sequence motif for CHH methylated sites (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). These motifs are consistent with previous findings in mammals [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the methylation levels in genic regions we divided the genes into specific gene features: TSS (300 bp upstream - 50 bp downstream of the annotated TSS), five prime untranslated region (5’UTR), GB, coding sequence (CDS), introns, three prime untranslated regions (3’UTR) and transcription termination site (TTS; 50 bp upstream - 200 bp downstream of the annotated TTS). Methylation levels were further calculated in the context of gene regions by dividing each gene into overlapping sliding windows and including the 10 kb upstream and downstream regions (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figures S3, S4). We found low methylation levels in TSS and 5’UTR regions and higher methylation levels in the GB increasing towards the 3’UTR before decreasing again near the TTS. We found higher methylation levels in coding regions compared to intronic regions (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S5) and longer genes have generally higher CpG methylation levels (Fig.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified genes differentially methylated between brain and blood in three gene features; TSS, GB, and TTS. Based on the fold change calculated from the relative methylation in the two tissue types, we extracted the 5 % of genes with most extreme methylation fold changes (upper and lower 2.5 %) between tissues for enrichment analysis (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). For TSS, GB, and TTS these sets included 382, 410, and 289 genes, respectively. We found very little overlap in the set of differentially methylated genes from the three gene features (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S6). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that genes with a hypomethylated TSS in the brain compared to blood were enriched in categories linked to regulation of axonogenesis, neuronal synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and spindle localization (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>: Table S1). In contrast, genes with a hypomethylated TSS in blood compared to brain were largely enriched in categories linked to lymphocyte and leukocyte cell activation, immune response, and hemopoiesis (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>: Table S2). Many of these enriched biological processes correspond directly to the specific functions of the examined tissues. Moreover, this result suggests that, at least in brain and blood, genes are generally TSS-hypomethylated in the tissue they are expected to be expressed in. Genes with hypermethylated GBs in brain compared to blood are involved in the (positive) regulation of transcription, development (cell fate commitment, regionalization, embryonic and organ development/morphogenesis), and regulation of immune system process (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>: Table S3). GB hypomethylated genes in brain compared to blood are involved in transcription, RNA-splicing, and translation (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>: Table S4). These results suggests that genes involved in transcription, splicing, and translation are generally GB-hypomethylated in brain to enhance their transcription, while genes important for developmental processes are GB-hypermethylated to silence their transcription, supported by significant differences in brain gene expression data between the two sets (TSS;

While promoter CGIs in general tend to be hypomethylated, intragenic CGIs tend to have higher methylation in both tissues (Additional file

Genes with no or very low non-CpG methylation (lower 2.5 %) are largely involved in transcriptional/translational processes (gene expression, mRNA metabolic process, ribosome biogenesis, and translation; Additional file

The genes with the highest methylation (upper 2.5 %) in terms of TSS and TTS non-CpG methylation are mainly involved in system development, glial cell differentiation, gliogenesis and glial cell fate specification (Additional file

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed DNA methylation in 26,834 TEs (mainly LINE/CR1 and LTR/ERVL elements) divided into short interspersed elements (SINE), long interspersed elements (LINE), and LTR retrotransposons. CpG sites within TEs are largely hypermethylated in both brain and blood (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S12). The CpG methylation levels in TEs and upstream and downstream 2 kb flanking regions in brain are significantly higher than in blood, with the difference in average methylation reaching up to 20 %. Interestingly, the opposite pattern was observed for non-CpG methylation, with decreased non-CpG methylation in TEs compared to their flanking regions in brain (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S13). Additionally, TE expression shows a negative correlation with non-CpG methylation level (Spearman’s rho &lt; −0.11, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 1x10
   <span class="sup">−15</span>; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). This negative correlation is even stronger in the 2 kb upstream (Spearman’s rho &lt; −0.20, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 1x10
   <span class="sup">−15</span>) and downstream regions (Spearman’s rho &lt; −0.19, P &lt; 1x10
   <span class="sup">−15</span>). Surprisingly this negative correlation was not observed for CpG methylation (Spearman’s rho: TE-body = 0.033, upstream = −0.0056, downstream = −0.0023; Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S14). The methylation patterns did not differ between the different types of TEs.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to validate the RNA-seq gene expression results, we performed qPCR on 11 randomly chosen genes using RNA isolated from whole brain tissue of the same individual, as well as five additional individuals. The results revealed a highly significant positive correlation between the RNA-seq and qPCR gene expression results (Pearson correlation; 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.753, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001)(Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S15). In order to validate the WGBS methylation results, we generated reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data using DNA isolated from blood samples from two additional individuals. An average non-CpG methylation level of &lt;0.4 % was observed, with only ~2 % of the methylated sites (relative methylation &gt;10 %) derive from non-CpG sites in the two RRBS samples (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S4), confirming the lack of non-CG methylation in the blood. Furthermore, we used the two RRBS samples to perform correlation analysis on 2000 randomly selected CpG sites (coverage &gt; 10x in all samples) ranging in methylation level between 0 and 100 % in the WGBS sample. We observed a high correlation between the WGBS and both RRBS samples, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.758 (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) and 0.767 (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), respectively (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S16). Together, these results validate the RNA-seq and WGBS results presented here.
