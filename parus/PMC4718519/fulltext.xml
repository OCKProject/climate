We evaluated effects of supplemental feeding used as religious/cultural practices which could potentially aid conservation of endangered phasianids. We compared fed breeding groups to neighboring nonfed groups. Fed groups initiated first clutches significantly earlier than nonfed groups. Earlier laying groups within fed and nonfed groups showed significantly lower hatching rates than later groups; however, fed groups showed significantly higher hatching rates than nonfed groups laying in the same period. Earlier laying increased opportunities to renest. All six fed groups with clutch failures renested compared to only one of five nonfed groups with clutch failures. Fed female breeders showed significantly greater investment in their young with larger clutches and larger eggs, which likely increased survivability of early hatchlings. We observed no predation on birds at feeding sites and recorded only four cases of predation on incubating females, which showed no detectable difference between fed and nonfed groups. Ground-nesting birds typically face high risks of predation. Ten of the 48 groups nested in trees, which occurs in few phasianid species. Tree nests showed significantly higher hatching rates compared to ground nests; however, we found no significant difference in tree nesting between fed and nonfed groups. This partridge is one of four gallinaceous species with cooperative breeding. Breeding groups with helpers had significantly greater reproductive success than single pairs, and fed female breeders with helpers laid bigger eggs than single pairs. Comparing annual reproductive output per group, fed groups not only produced significantly more independent young (&#x02265;150 days post-hatching), their young hatched significantly earlier, which likely have greater reproductive value over later hatched young of nonfed groups. Supplemental feeding year-round is likely what enabled the successes of the fed partridges.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (No. 31172105, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsfc.gov.cn">http://www.nsfc.gov.cn</ext-link>) to JR.

This species is of special concern as it has undergone a dramatic regional population decline due to the degradation and loss of tree-line habitats and illegal hunting in many areas throughout western China [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This study was first initiated at a high altitude alpine site, the Pamuling sacred site, where monks of the Pamuling monastery have promoted protection of local wildlife and have provided supplemental food daily the year around for Buff-throated Partridges and two other pheasant species (Blood Pheasant, <italic>Ithaginis cruentus</italic>, and White Eared Pheasant, <italic>Crossoptilon crossoptilon</italic>). As a result, the partridges that live within this sacred site and receive daily supplemental food have become habituated to the presence of humans and, therefore, were much easier to observe than wild partridges. At this Pamuling sacred site, it is this special religious practice of year-round supplemental feeding which made this study possible and which may serve as a potentially valuable practice for the conservation of rare pheasants like the Buff-throated Partridge.</p><p>The provision of food for gallinaceous species is a traditional practice employed by indigenous communities within cultural protected areas across many Himalayan regions, particularly within the Tibetan sacred sites [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

In this particular case, the breeding ecology of these partridges included two special characteristics nearly unique among gallinaceous species: nesting in trees [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and cooperative breeding [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>These partridges typically roost together in trees [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and, although most groups nest on the ground, some groups in the Pamuling Mountain area have constructed their nests in trees. Roosting in trees occurs in a number of gallinaceous species, but nesting in trees is very rare among pheasants, reported only in the two <italic>Tetraophasis</italic> and five <italic>Tragopan</italic> species [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

Only three other species of the Galliformes engage in cooperative breeding [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These partridges&#x02019; cooperative breeding groups are typically small, resident territorial groups composed of one breeding pair and one to three adult &#x0201c;helpers&#x0201d;, usually males [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This partridge population also includes &#x0201c;groups&#x0201d; of two composed of a single breeding pair, which is characteristic of regular cooperatively breeding species [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Cooperative breeding among bird species often increases foraging efficiency and survival, but no evidence of this had been found for these partridge cooperative breeders before this study.

Within the Pamuling Mountain study area, we selected two different sets of breeding groups: (1) fed groups, which received daily supplemental food (typically rice and corn) within the vicinity of the Monastery, and (2) nonfed (i.e., non-supplemented) groups that foraged exclusively on natural resources. All the fed groups, including their territories [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], were found only within the area of the Pamuling sacred site (i.e., the central core area shown in light gray in <xref rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

The food at these two sites was augmented sporadically throughout the day by offerings contributed by local people from the neighboring community when they worshipped at the sacred site. The third supplemental feeding site was a dumpsite (D in <xref rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), where the monks from the monastery threw &#x0201c;household&#x0201d; garbage which included food waste from the kitchen and canteen. The two partridge groups that fed at this site over the four years of the study [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] were also treated as &#x0201c;fed&#x0201d; groups; however, we only found and monitored nests of these two territorial groups in 2008 and 2009. Both the supplemental fed and the nonfed breeding groups occupied areas with a similar composition of tree-line habitats [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>Birds were observed every day from mid-March to late-July, corresponding to the breeding season, and from mid-August to late-October (and occasionally later), which corresponded to the first half of the non-breeding season. Each spring, the field team searched for and found as many breeding group nest sites as possible when the breeding females were laying their eggs. Although a total of 68 fed groups had been recorded over the four years within the core sacred site shown in <xref rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, finding active nests of fed groups was not easy. Yet, finding nests of nonfed groups was much more difficult, since nonfed groups were spread out over a much larger area and were far more wary of humans. We found and observed active nest sites for 27 supplemental fed groups (six in 2006, seven in 2007, six in 2008, and eight in 2009) and 21 nonfed groups (five in 2006, five in 2007, six in 2008, and five in 2009). Members of the same breeding family group were confirmed based on observations that all members foraged together and shared the same roosting tree [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>Once a nest was found, it was examined two days later to determine the clutch initiation date, since eggs were usually laid around mid-day [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Following completion of the clutch, nests were visited every two days to determine whether breeding attempts were on-going or whether the nests had failed. Since incubation periods typically varied from 20 to 25 days, at 17 or 18 days after the clutch initiation date, we began checking the nests every day to record the hatching date. From these observations, we were able to determine clutch completion date, clutch size, incubation period, and hatching date. Bird remains and/or large numbers of feathers at the nest-site during the breeding period were taken to indicate that the breeding female had been preyed on [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In order to set up comparable subject cases for calculating reproductive success [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], we chose the start of incubation as the starting point for the comparative study of the fed and nonfed groups. Therefore early nests that were terminated before egg-laying was completed due to the death of the breeding female or simply deserted were not considered in the analyses of reproductive output; however, breeding females killed by predators during incubation were included.</p><p>As part of the analyses of reproductive success, for each clutch, we recorded the number of eggs (clutch size) and egg size. We measured the maximum length and breadth of each egg to the nearest mm (or occasionally nearest 0.5 mm) with a band tape and weighed each egg to the nearest gram (or occasionally nearest 0.5 g) using a spring balance. When incubation was completed, we recorded the hatching date and the number of chicks hatched as well as the number of unhatched eggs. For purposes of assessing different aspects of reproductive &#x0201c;success&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;hatchlings&#x0201d; were considered as equivalent to &#x0201c;fledglings&#x0201d;, since the partridge &#x0201c;hatchlings&#x0201d; are precocial. Chicks that survived to 150 days post-hatching were considered to be &#x0201c;independent young&#x0201d; with similar morphometric measurements to the adults [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. We defined &#x0201c;hatching rate&#x0201d; of a clutch as the number of hatchlings over the total number of eggs in the clutch including unhatched or lost eggs. We defined &#x0201c;clutch failure&#x0201d; as meaning the loss (or failure to hatch) of <italic>all</italic> the eggs in a clutch and &#x0201c;brood failure&#x0201d; as the loss (death or disappearance) of <italic>all</italic> the chicks from a given clutch.</p><p>We considered total &#x0201c;annual reproductive success&#x0201d; as measured by three different outputs: the total number of eggs, hatchlings, and independent young produced per breeding group with the number of independent young considered as the most important output [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. For any group that renested in the same season, the output of both the first and second clutches were added together to represent the &#x0201c;total annual reproductive success&#x0201d; of that group.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Selection of study groups and possibility of pseudoreplication</title><p>Longitudinal observational studies, such as ours, raise the possibility of pseudoreplication from year to year [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], which assumes &#x0201c;the same groups occur in the same treatments year after year&#x0201d;. Although 35 fed partridges were banded as part of several overlapping field studies, only eight banded birds occurred in fed groups of this study. Those eight were distributed among six fed nesting groups. None of the eight banded birds were present in a breeding group in more than two consecutive years, although identification of repeat individuals allowed one group to be identified in a third year. Therefore, we could confirm that six fed groups were directly related to seven later groups, which involved a total of 13 groups, 48% of the 27 fed groups. For the nonfed groups, no birds were banded; however, two groups were identified from individual characteristics of group members to have been the same group in a subsequent year, which involved only four groups, 19% of the 21 nonfed groups.</p><p>Examination of the seven cases among the fed groups where we knew that a group in one year was present in the following year, the seven cases showed a total of 13 important changes: 3 changed group size, 5 new adult male helpers appeared of which 4 came from other groups (only one new male helper was recruited from the progeny of that group), 2 breeding males were replaced the following year by an outside male that previously had been a helper in that group, and 3 changed their nest type (2 tree to ground nest; 1 ground to tree nest). Similarly, for nonfed groups, the two cases identified also showed important changes: one with a change in group size, the other with a replacement of a male helper with a male from another group. The prevalence of these year-to-year changes among the breeding groups of those nine cases diminishes the concern about pseudoreplication.</p><p>Also, in addition to the observed year-to-year changes in group sizes and composition, we never found a breeding group using the same nest site the following year; therefore, locations of the nest sites discovered each year all differ from the previous year's nest sites (see the locations of all the nesting sites in <xref rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). This means that 1) each group changed its nest site from year to year, and 2) it was often not possible to find the nest of the same group each year. The result is that there were many cases where group nesting sites from a given year, say 2006, did not show any nearby nesting sites for the next year (i.e., 2007 in this example), in which case, it is unlikely that those breeding groups were represented in the following year.</p><p>The search in early spring each year to locate nesting sites was spread across different areas. Note in the map in <xref rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> how the locations of nesting sites for fed groups are well distributed over the central sacred site (light gray area), and the nonfed groups are widely distributed in the neighboring areas surrounding the central sacred site (gray hatched area). The relatively wide scattering of the nesting sites each year acted to increase the likelihood of including a broader, non-selective sampling of the groups within the study area. Given these points, we conclude that the possible problem of pseudoreplication is small and very likely outweighed by the changes in group size and composition and in nest type and location as well as by other factors and chance occurrences related to weather, predation, etc.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Data analysis</title><p>As a precautionary measure to avoid possible complications of pseudoreplication, we used Fisher&#x02019;s exact test to determine the probability of most of the differences between groups we examined. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test is a nonparametric one-tailed statistical test which determines the probability that the differences as defined with respect to a specific hypothesis among two cases compared in a 2X2 table could be the same due to chance.</p><p>The additional parametric statistical tests used for a few special analyses were described as follows. A General Linear Model (GLM) univariate test was used to compare the differences in laying dates of first clutches of fed and nonfed groups with year as a random factor. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to assess the effects of food on egg size (egg length, breadth, and weight) with clutch size as a covariate and on clutch size with clutch initiation date as a covariate. In all these statistical tests, we used p &#x02264; .05 as indicating statistical significance. The parametric statistical tests were conducted using SPSS for windows release 17.0 (SPSS Inc. 2001, Chicago).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec008"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Early laying by the supplemental fed breeding groups</title><p>Early laying is the single most common effect from supplemental feeding [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Given the possibility of higher predation risk due to higher densities of fed groups, we expected that fed groups may experience higher predation than nonfed groups (H16). We recorded four breeding females killed during incubation on ground nests by unknown predators: three from fed groups and one from a nonfed group. The difference was not significant with a high <italic>p</italic>-value (<italic>p</italic> = 0.910).</p><p>Given that the Buff-throated Partridges at this site were observed to occasionally use tree nests [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], we assumed that tree nests offered greater security against clutch predation (H17). The numbers were too low to determine the hatching success of tree nests versus ground nests within fed groups or nonfed groups; therefore, we combined fed and nonfed groups in order to determine the relative nesting success of groups with tree nests compared to groups with ground nests. All ten tree nests (100%) produced at least one hatchling compared to only 61% of groups with ground nests. The difference was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014; <xref rid="pone.0146568.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Since this test confirmed that tree nests showed a higher hatching success, we assumed that tree nests would be expected to produce more hatchlings per egg than ground nests. The greater numbers involved allowed us to test this hypothesis within fed groups (H18) and nonfed groups (H19).

Young hatched early in the season are likely to be larger and more experienced and, therefore, often dominant over later hatched young, and will likely have an advantage competing for resources and for positions in winter groups [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Offspring from first nests would be the oldest members of their cohort and could establish a level of dominance that promotes their ascendancy to breeder status [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The high reproductive value of early hatched young selects for early laying [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Young hatching earlier have a much higher chance of surviving and demonstrate greater reproductive value [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; therefore, a more useful statistic is the relative number of independent young hatched earlier from fed versus nonfed groups. The earlier breeding fed groups not only produced significantly more young, but the most important difference was that 80% of fed young hatched earlier than any nonfed young (<xref rid="pone.0146568.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>).</p><p>What are the limits of earlier advancement of laying? If early laying buys time, what does it cost? On Pamuling Mountain, even with supplemental food, attempting to lay in early April or into March is moving into the end of winter, when it is still quite cold and late snowstorms still happen. We examined the reproductive costs of pushing the limits of how early the partridge bred by comparing success among four different sets of groups: the earliest fed groups (Mar 27-Apr 11); the later laying fed groups (Apr 12&#x02013;19); the earliest laying nonfed groups (Apr 13&#x02013;26); and the later laying nonfed groups (Apr 27-May 12). We focused on hatching rates because that stage was most likely to be affected by the conditions during incubation. Because the earliest fed groups suffered more losses and lower hatching rates than the later fed groups and were not clearly any more successful than the earliest nonfed groups, was their higher effort and risk worth it? The benefits of an early timing of breeding can be quantified only when considering also the post-fledging period [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. We do know that the four fed groups with clutch failures all renested with three producing independent young and that the 12 early independent young hatched in the earliest breeding fed groups may well have had greater reproductive value than the later hatched young of all the later laying groups [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Lack of available food is most likely the greatest constraint against early breeding [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Due to the length and cold of the high altitude winter, the availability of natural foods is low in winter, and high protein foods are likely to be at their lowest at the end of winter and beginning of spring just when early partridge breeders would face their greatest needs.</p><p>For precocial species like the partridge, the highest energy and nutritional demands are during egg-laying when their daily expenditure for the production of clutches is greater than for altricial species [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The high energy demands of laying are followed next by incubation when the breeding females must spend nearly all of their time at the nest sitting on the clutch to protect the eggs from cold and predators. While they are incubating, they have little time to forage, relying instead on their fat reserves [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To be able to provide that high level of energy into the first two stages of breeding, female pheasant species, such as grouse, ptarmigans, and these partridges, need to be in good condition with sufficient fat reserves <italic>before</italic> they begin to lay their first clutch in early spring [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].</p><p>Along with stimulating early breeding in birds, supplemental feeding before and during the breeding season may lead to production of larger clutches and larger eggs [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Both represent greater investments by the female breeder to increase the number and survivability of the young. The fed female partridge breeders significantly increased clutch size more often from three to four (<xref rid="pone.0146568.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and significantly increased the size of their eggs (<xref rid="pone.0146568.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The greater investment in clutch size and, particularly, in egg size showed that the resources available were abundant enough to support those investments. In particular, the relatively consistent amount of the increase in egg size may have been to improve the size and survivability of their chicks which would be hatching under less than favorable environmental conditions of early spring at that high altitude [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The first clutch sizes of fed and nonfed birds did not decline over the laying period of the first clutches (Mar 27-May 12)(<xref rid="pone.0146568.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The mean egg weight per group did show a slight decline from early to late laying dates for both fed and nonfed groups, but the R<sup>2</sup> values were very low (<xref rid="pone.0146568.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). In contrast, the fed partridges&#x02019; six renesting clutches were all significantly smaller with smaller egg weights (<xref rid="pone.0146568.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The reduced sizes of these replacement clutches do appear to fit into the general pattern of seasonal decline in clutch size [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Larger egg size can produce a larger hatchling, which may give a better chance to survive [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Smaller egg sizes, in contrast, allow the chick to hatch earlier and may reduce the cost to females [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Supplemental feeding also carries some risk associated with a higher density of birds near feeding sites, which is likely to increase competition and may attract predators and increase the risk of predation [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The few cases of predation on adult partridges we recorded were at nests, not at feeding sites, and we found no significant difference between fed and nonfed groups.</p><p>With predation being a major risk for ground-dwelling gamebirds [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the partridges in our study engaged in several behaviors to reduce risks from predators. One was communal roosting in trees, in which all members of a group roost together in dense conifer trees, which gives them protection from predators and thermoregulatory benefits through cold nights [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Another was nesting in trees. While roosting in trees occurs in many gallinaceous species, nesting in trees has been reported only in the Buff-throated Partridge and in the five species of tragopans (<italic>Tragopan</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In our study, most of the nests were on the ground with just over one-fifth found in trees. Although we found no difference in the use of tree nesting by fed and nonfed groups, we were able to show the first evidence that hatching success of groups that nested in trees was significantly greater than for those groups that nested on the ground (all groups combined, <xref rid="pone.0146568.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>), and the groups nesting in trees showed significantly greater hatching rates compared to groups nesting on the ground both within nonfed groups and within fed groups (<xref rid="pone.0146568.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>).</p><p>Supplemental feeding increases survival of fed birds; the increase in food availability may free more time for vigilance and reduce exposure to predation [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] as well as more time for resting and preening [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Winter food supplementation increases rates of winter survival of game birds [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Winter feeding for songbirds (often from fall into early spring) increases productivity in the subsequent breeding season [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. For populations of two <italic>Parus</italic> species in Sweden, food supplementation in autumn and winter improved winter survival, which led to a doubling of the fed breeding populations the following spring [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Young adult partridges remaining with their parents within the safety of their known territory can gain greater security and experience [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. At the same time, these young adults benefit the breeding pair by assisting in territorial defense and vigilance for predators and joining in communal roosting [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]; this is the basis of the cooperative breeding shown by Buff-throated Partridges [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The mutual fitness benefits of breeding cooperatively are likely to stem from group living per se rather than from alloparental effects [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], which is why solitary male partridges often join as a helper to a territorial breeding pair [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and, in addition to the benefits of group living, unrelated male helpers also increase their chances of becoming the dominant breeding male [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Such promotion occurred in two of the seven year-to-year cases of fed groups with marked individuals (described in Methods above). Ours is the first study of these cooperative breeding partridges to show that cooperative breeding groups (i.e., breeding groups with adult helpers) experience greater reproductive success than single pairs. Groups with helpers were significantly more likely to produce independent young compared to single pair groups (<xref rid="pone.0146568.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>).</p><p>Among the partridge cooperative breeding groups, helpers have been observed to contribute to vigilance and territorial defense [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Such assistance by partridge helpers may give the breeding female more time to feed and accumulate greater resources to lay earlier and to invest more in their clutches [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. We were able to show that among the supplemental fed groups, breeding groups with helpers produced significantly greater mean egg weights compared to single pair groups (<xref rid="pone.0146568.t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>); however, nonfed groups with helpers did not show a significant difference compared to single pair groups (<xref rid="pone.0146568.t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). We suggest that the combined benefits of supplemental feeding and assistance of adult helpers work together to further reduce the workload of a fed female breeder and to increase her time and resources compared to fed single pairs or to nonfed female breeders with helpers.</p><p>A related study of cooperative breeding in Arabian babblers (<italic>Turdoides squamiceps</italic>) showed that helpers with access to supplemental food were able to spend longer periods on sentinel duty without a loss in body mass [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. That example shows further how the benefits of supplemental feeding can serve to enhance the benefits provided by helpers in a cooperative breeding group. We suggest that for partridge fed groups, supplemental feeding may reduce feeding time for all adult members of cooperative groups, which may further increase vigilance of helpers, thereby further reducing the risk of predation [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. For a fed female breeder with helpers, the combined benefits may allow her to invest even more in her offspring without significantly increasing her reproductive costs, as shown by the significantly larger eggs produced by fed females in cooperative groups compared to fed females in single pair groups [<xref rid="pone.0146568.t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>]. We suggest that a more detailed study of vigilance and foraging behaviors of fed cooperative breeding partridge groups would be valuable in many ways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is year-round supplemental feeding that provides a continuous daily support that increases the probability of survival to all the birds in a partridge breeding group. The year-round availability of supplemental food buffers adverse periods, giving a more stable temporal distribution of food as compared with natural conditions [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], thereby favoring long-term success. Florida Scrub-Jays have consistently bred early in suburban areas where human-provided food is ubiquitous year-round, suggesting that resource predictability may be a perceptual cue for the appropriate timing of breeding [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The strong annual response of the Pamuling fed partridge groups with exceptionally early breeding, larger clutches, and larger eggs may be due in part a response to the predictability of the long-term year-round supplemental feeding at the Pamuling sacred site.</p><p>The fact that the fed partridge groups showed such a strong set of significant responses to the supplemental feeding provides substantial evidence that the particular example of supplemental feeding practiced at the Pamuling Tibetan sacred site appears to be a successful conservation approach. A number of our results, while statistically significant, were based on small sample sizes; therefore, we recommend that the supplemented population should be monitored to assure that the beneficial effects of such a treatment continue [<xref rid="pone.0146568.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Tibetan sacred sites offer a unique opportunity to continue to explore the many benefits and costs of supplemental feeding as a conservation tool for threatened bird species management. We, therefore, encourage further comparative studies examining differences in resource availability, density, behavior, and survivorship between supplemental fed and nonfed populations of the Buff-throated Partridge and similar pheasant species across a number of sacred sites in the region.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Will Stein for useful comments, Zhang Man for her help in remaking <xref rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, Beibei Du and Wen Lin for office work, and Pinjia Que and Pengfei Yu for their help in the field work.
