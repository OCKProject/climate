 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study species, the Buff-throated Partridge and its congener, the Chestnut-throated Partridge (
  <span class="italic">Tetraophasis obscurus</span>), are high altitude pheasants (also called pheasant-grouse, pheasant-partridge, and monal-partridge) which are closely related to the monal pheasants (
  <span class="italic">Lophophorus</span> spp.) and tragopans (
  <span class="italic">Tragopan</span> spp.) [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref063">63</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref065">65</a>]. Despite their close phylogenetic relations to these other pheasants, these 
  <span class="italic">Tetraophasis</span> pheasants likely were called ‘partridges’ due to their cryptic plumage and lack of sexual dimorphism. The plumage patterns of these two 
  <span class="italic">Tetraophasis</span> species are characteristic of pheasant species that are monogamous with multi-year pair bonds [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref055">55</a>]. Their monogamous habits with longer term pair bonds, cryptic plumage, territorial behavior, communal roosting, occasional tree nesting, and cooperative breeding all taken together suggest a special adaptive model for a species faced with a short breeding season, a long cold high altitude winter, and a likely prevalent risk of predation [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The wild foraging (not supplemented) partridge breeding groups living in the surrounding area beyond the central sacred site fed mainly on plant roots, stems, flowers, and occasional insects [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref002">2</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref066">66</a>]. Cooperative breeding territorial groups typically spend all their time together and use the same roost site year-round [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref052">52</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref054">54</a>]. The breeding female of each group typically lays three to four eggs per clutch (range 1–5), which are incubated exclusively by the dominant breeding female [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref050">50</a>]. Within the Pamuling Mountain study area, we selected two different sets of breeding groups: (1) fed groups, which received daily supplemental food (typically rice and corn) within the vicinity of the Monastery, and (2) nonfed (i.e., non-supplemented) groups that foraged exclusively on natural resources. All the fed groups, including their territories [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref062">62</a>], were found only within the area of the Pamuling sacred site (i.e., the central core area shown in light gray in 
  <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a>). The nonfed groups all were found in the surrounding areas outside of the central Pamuling sacred site. Locations of all the nest sites for fed and nonfed groups for the four years of the study are shown on the map in 
  <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a>. The locations of the nonfed groups’ nest sites are indicated by small rings with an ‘N’ and year (i.e., ‘06’, ‘07’, ‘08’, or ‘09’), and locations of the fed groups’ nest sites are indicated by an ‘F’ and year as noted above. Supplemental feeding occurred at three known fixed sites around the Monastery. The two main supplemental feeding sites were two ‘ritual offering’ sites (F1 and F2 in 
  <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a>), where each morning monks from the Pamuling Tibetan Monastery provided rice and corn. The food at these two sites was augmented sporadically throughout the day by offerings contributed by local people from the neighboring community when they worshipped at the sacred site. The third supplemental feeding site was a dumpsite (D in 
  <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a>), where the monks from the monastery threw “household” garbage which included food waste from the kitchen and canteen. The two partridge groups that fed at this site over the four years of the study [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref062">62</a>] were also treated as “fed” groups; however, we only found and monitored nests of these two territorial groups in 2008 and 2009. Both the supplemental fed and the nonfed breeding groups occupied areas with a similar composition of tree-line habitats [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref062">62</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were observed every day from mid-March to late-July, corresponding to the breeding season, and from mid-August to late-October (and occasionally later), which corresponded to the first half of the non-breeding season. Each spring, the field team searched for and found as many breeding group nest sites as possible when the breeding females were laying their eggs. Although a total of 68 fed groups had been recorded over the four years within the core sacred site shown in 
  <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a>, finding active nests of fed groups was not easy. Yet, finding nests of nonfed groups was much more difficult, since nonfed groups were spread out over a much larger area and were far more wary of humans. We found and observed active nest sites for 27 supplemental fed groups (six in 2006, seven in 2007, six in 2008, and eight in 2009) and 21 nonfed groups (five in 2006, five in 2007, six in 2008, and five in 2009). Members of the same breeding family group were confirmed based on observations that all members foraged together and shared the same roosting tree [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref052">52</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref054">54</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once a nest was found, it was examined two days later to determine the clutch initiation date, since eggs were usually laid around mid-day [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref067">67</a>]. Following completion of the clutch, nests were visited every two days to determine whether breeding attempts were on-going or whether the nests had failed. Since incubation periods typically varied from 20 to 25 days, at 17 or 18 days after the clutch initiation date, we began checking the nests every day to record the hatching date. From these observations, we were able to determine clutch completion date, clutch size, incubation period, and hatching date. Bird remains and/or large numbers of feathers at the nest-site during the breeding period were taken to indicate that the breeding female had been preyed on [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to set up comparable subject cases for calculating reproductive success [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref068">68</a>], we chose the start of incubation as the starting point for the comparative study of the fed and nonfed groups. Therefore early nests that were terminated before egg-laying was completed due to the death of the breeding female or simply deserted were not considered in the analyses of reproductive output; however, breeding females killed by predators during incubation were included.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As part of the analyses of reproductive success, for each clutch, we recorded the number of eggs (clutch size) and egg size. We measured the maximum length and breadth of each egg to the nearest mm (or occasionally nearest 0.5 mm) with a band tape and weighed each egg to the nearest gram (or occasionally nearest 0.5 g) using a spring balance. When incubation was completed, we recorded the hatching date and the number of chicks hatched as well as the number of unhatched eggs. For purposes of assessing different aspects of reproductive “success”, “hatchlings” were considered as equivalent to “fledglings”, since the partridge “hatchlings” are precocial. Chicks that survived to 150 days post-hatching were considered to be “independent young” with similar morphometric measurements to the adults [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref067">67</a>]. We defined “hatching rate” of a clutch as the number of hatchlings over the total number of eggs in the clutch including unhatched or lost eggs. We defined “clutch failure” as meaning the loss (or failure to hatch) of 
  <span class="italic">all</span> the eggs in a clutch and “brood failure” as the loss (death or disappearance) of 
  <span class="italic">all</span> the chicks from a given clutch.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We considered total “annual reproductive success” as measured by three different outputs: the total number of eggs, hatchlings, and independent young produced per breeding group with the number of independent young considered as the most important output [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref069">69</a>]. For any group that renested in the same season, the output of both the first and second clutches were added together to represent the “total annual reproductive success” of that group.
