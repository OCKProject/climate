 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study began out of interest and concern for the Buff-throated Partridge (
  <span class="italic">Tetraophasis szechenyii</span> Madarász), which is an unusual, little known, and endangered “pheasant-partridge” endemic to high altitude tree-line regions of western China [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref002">2</a>]. This species is of special concern as it has undergone a dramatic regional population decline due to the degradation and loss of tree-line habitats and illegal hunting in many areas throughout western China [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref002">2</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref004">4</a>]. This study was first initiated at a high altitude alpine site, the Pamuling sacred site, where monks of the Pamuling monastery have promoted protection of local wildlife and have provided supplemental food daily the year around for Buff-throated Partridges and two other pheasant species (Blood Pheasant, 
  <span class="italic">Ithaginis cruentus</span>, and White Eared Pheasant, 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon crossoptilon</span>). As a result, the partridges that live within this sacred site and receive daily supplemental food have become habituated to the presence of humans and, therefore, were much easier to observe than wild partridges. At this Pamuling sacred site, it is this special religious practice of year-round supplemental feeding which made this study possible and which may serve as a potentially valuable practice for the conservation of rare pheasants like the Buff-throated Partridge.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The provision of food for gallinaceous species is a traditional practice employed by indigenous communities within cultural protected areas across many Himalayan regions, particularly within the Tibetan sacred sites [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The principal goal of this study is to assess the effects of year-long supplemental feeding on the breeding ecology and reproductive success of the Buff-throated Partridges living in the Pamuling sacred site. In this particular case, the breeding ecology of these partridges included two special characteristics nearly unique among gallinaceous species: nesting in trees [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref050">50</a>] and cooperative breeding [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref051">51</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These partridges typically roost together in trees [

  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref054">54</a>], and, although most groups nest on the ground, some groups in the Pamuling Mountain area have constructed their nests in trees. Roosting in trees occurs in a number of gallinaceous species, but nesting in trees is very rare among pheasants, reported only in the two 
  <span class="italic">Tetraophasis</span> and five 
  <span class="italic">Tragopan</span> species [

  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref057">57</a>] and the tree nesting are behaviors expected to reduce predation risk, which is expected to be important for this species given that predation is the greatest cause of mortality in such ground-dwelling phasianid species [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Buff-throated Partridge is a regular cooperative breeder [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref051">51</a>], which is extremely rare amongst the Galliformes. Only three other species of the Galliformes engage in cooperative breeding [
