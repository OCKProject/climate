 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a precautionary measure to avoid possible complications of pseudoreplication, we used Fisher’s exact test to determine the probability of most of the differences between groups we examined. Fisher’s exact test is a nonparametric one-tailed statistical test which determines the probability that the differences as defined with respect to a specific hypothesis among two cases compared in a 2X2 table could be the same due to chance.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The additional parametric statistical tests used for a few special analyses were described as follows. A General Linear Model (GLM) univariate test was used to compare the differences in laying dates of first clutches of fed and nonfed groups with year as a random factor. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to assess the effects of food on egg size (egg length, breadth, and weight) with clutch size as a covariate and on clutch size with clutch initiation date as a covariate. In all these statistical tests, we used p ≤ .05 as indicating statistical significance. The parametric statistical tests were conducted using SPSS for windows release 17.0 (SPSS Inc. 2001, Chicago).</p>
