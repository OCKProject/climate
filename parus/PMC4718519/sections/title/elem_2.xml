  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study was conducted over a four-year period from March 2006 through December 2009 on Pamuling Mountain (30°06′N 101°11′E) in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China. Our study site encompassed the top of the Pamuling Mountain from the highest peak at 4400 m down to an elevation of 3350 m which defined the lower limit of the study area. The 3350 m elevation limit serves as an outer boundary which circumscribes the entire 50.6 km

   <span class="italic">Tetraophasis obscurus</span>), are high altitude pheasants (also called pheasant-grouse, pheasant-partridge, and monal-partridge) which are closely related to the monal pheasants (

   <span class="italic">Tetraophasis</span> pheasants likely were called ‘partridges’ due to their cryptic plumage and lack of sexual dimorphism. The plumage patterns of these two 
   <span class="italic">Tetraophasis</span> species are characteristic of pheasant species that are monogamous with multi-year pair bonds [
   <a rid="pone.0146568.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref055">55</a>]. Their monogamous habits with longer term pair bonds, cryptic plumage, territorial behavior, communal roosting, occasional tree nesting, and cooperative breeding all taken together suggest a special adaptive model for a species faced with a short breeding season, a long cold high altitude winter, and a likely prevalent risk of predation [

   <a rid="pone.0146568.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref054">54</a>]. The breeding female of each group typically lays three to four eggs per clutch (range 1–5), which are incubated exclusively by the dominant breeding female [
   <a rid="pone.0146568.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref050">50</a>]. Within the Pamuling Mountain study area, we selected two different sets of breeding groups: (1) fed groups, which received daily supplemental food (typically rice and corn) within the vicinity of the Monastery, and (2) nonfed (i.e., non-supplemented) groups that foraged exclusively on natural resources. All the fed groups, including their territories [
   <a rid="pone.0146568.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref062">62</a>], were found only within the area of the Pamuling sacred site (i.e., the central core area shown in light gray in 
   <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a>). The nonfed groups all were found in the surrounding areas outside of the central Pamuling sacred site. Locations of all the nest sites for fed and nonfed groups for the four years of the study are shown on the map in 
   <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a>. The locations of the nonfed groups’ nest sites are indicated by small rings with an ‘N’ and year (i.e., ‘06’, ‘07’, ‘08’, or ‘09’), and locations of the fed groups’ nest sites are indicated by an ‘F’ and year as noted above. Supplemental feeding occurred at three known fixed sites around the Monastery. The two main supplemental feeding sites were two ‘ritual offering’ sites (F1 and F2 in 
   <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a>), where each morning monks from the Pamuling Tibetan Monastery provided rice and corn. The food at these two sites was augmented sporadically throughout the day by offerings contributed by local people from the neighboring community when they worshipped at the sacred site. The third supplemental feeding site was a dumpsite (D in 
   <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a>), where the monks from the monastery threw “household” garbage which included food waste from the kitchen and canteen. The two partridge groups that fed at this site over the four years of the study [
   <a rid="pone.0146568.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref062">62</a>] were also treated as “fed” groups; however, we only found and monitored nests of these two territorial groups in 2008 and 2009. Both the supplemental fed and the nonfed breeding groups occupied areas with a similar composition of tree-line habitats [
   <a rid="pone.0146568.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref062">62</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were observed every day from mid-March to late-July, corresponding to the breeding season, and from mid-August to late-October (and occasionally later), which corresponded to the first half of the non-breeding season. Each spring, the field team searched for and found as many breeding group nest sites as possible when the breeding females were laying their eggs. Although a total of 68 fed groups had been recorded over the four years within the core sacred site shown in 
   <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a>, finding active nests of fed groups was not easy. Yet, finding nests of nonfed groups was much more difficult, since nonfed groups were spread out over a much larger area and were far more wary of humans. We found and observed active nest sites for 27 supplemental fed groups (six in 2006, seven in 2007, six in 2008, and eight in 2009) and 21 nonfed groups (five in 2006, five in 2007, six in 2008, and five in 2009). Members of the same breeding family group were confirmed based on observations that all members foraged together and shared the same roosting tree [
   <a rid="pone.0146568.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref052">52</a>,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once a nest was found, it was examined two days later to determine the clutch initiation date, since eggs were usually laid around mid-day [
   <a rid="pone.0146568.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref067">67</a>]. Following completion of the clutch, nests were visited every two days to determine whether breeding attempts were on-going or whether the nests had failed. Since incubation periods typically varied from 20 to 25 days, at 17 or 18 days after the clutch initiation date, we began checking the nests every day to record the hatching date. From these observations, we were able to determine clutch completion date, clutch size, incubation period, and hatching date. Bird remains and/or large numbers of feathers at the nest-site during the breeding period were taken to indicate that the breeding female had been preyed on [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to set up comparable subject cases for calculating reproductive success [
   <a rid="pone.0146568.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref068">68</a>], we chose the start of incubation as the starting point for the comparative study of the fed and nonfed groups. Therefore early nests that were terminated before egg-laying was completed due to the death of the breeding female or simply deserted were not considered in the analyses of reproductive output; however, breeding females killed by predators during incubation were included.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As part of the analyses of reproductive success, for each clutch, we recorded the number of eggs (clutch size) and egg size. We measured the maximum length and breadth of each egg to the nearest mm (or occasionally nearest 0.5 mm) with a band tape and weighed each egg to the nearest gram (or occasionally nearest 0.5 g) using a spring balance. When incubation was completed, we recorded the hatching date and the number of chicks hatched as well as the number of unhatched eggs. For purposes of assessing different aspects of reproductive “success”, “hatchlings” were considered as equivalent to “fledglings”, since the partridge “hatchlings” are precocial. Chicks that survived to 150 days post-hatching were considered to be “independent young” with similar morphometric measurements to the adults [
   <a rid="pone.0146568.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref067">67</a>]. We defined “hatching rate” of a clutch as the number of hatchlings over the total number of eggs in the clutch including unhatched or lost eggs. We defined “clutch failure” as meaning the loss (or failure to hatch) of 
   <span class="italic">all</span> the eggs in a clutch and “brood failure” as the loss (death or disappearance) of 
   <span class="italic">all</span> the chicks from a given clutch.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We considered total “annual reproductive success” as measured by three different outputs: the total number of eggs, hatchlings, and independent young produced per breeding group with the number of independent young considered as the most important output [
   <a rid="pone.0146568.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref069">69</a>]. For any group that renested in the same season, the output of both the first and second clutches were added together to represent the “total annual reproductive success” of that group.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selection of study groups and possibility of pseudoreplication</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Longitudinal observational studies, such as ours, raise the possibility of pseudoreplication from year to year [
   <a rid="pone.0146568.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref070">70</a>], which assumes “the same groups occur in the same treatments year after year”. Although 35 fed partridges were banded as part of several overlapping field studies, only eight banded birds occurred in fed groups of this study. Those eight were distributed among six fed nesting groups. None of the eight banded birds were present in a breeding group in more than two consecutive years, although identification of repeat individuals allowed one group to be identified in a third year. Therefore, we could confirm that six fed groups were directly related to seven later groups, which involved a total of 13 groups, 48% of the 27 fed groups. For the nonfed groups, no birds were banded; however, two groups were identified from individual characteristics of group members to have been the same group in a subsequent year, which involved only four groups, 19% of the 21 nonfed groups.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examination of the seven cases among the fed groups where we knew that a group in one year was present in the following year, the seven cases showed a total of 13 important changes: 3 changed group size, 5 new adult male helpers appeared of which 4 came from other groups (only one new male helper was recruited from the progeny of that group), 2 breeding males were replaced the following year by an outside male that previously had been a helper in that group, and 3 changed their nest type (2 tree to ground nest; 1 ground to tree nest). Similarly, for nonfed groups, the two cases identified also showed important changes: one with a change in group size, the other with a replacement of a male helper with a male from another group. The prevalence of these year-to-year changes among the breeding groups of those nine cases diminishes the concern about pseudoreplication.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also, in addition to the observed year-to-year changes in group sizes and composition, we never found a breeding group using the same nest site the following year; therefore, locations of the nest sites discovered each year all differ from the previous year's nest sites (see the locations of all the nesting sites in 
   <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a>). This means that 1) each group changed its nest site from year to year, and 2) it was often not possible to find the nest of the same group each year. The result is that there were many cases where group nesting sites from a given year, say 2006, did not show any nearby nesting sites for the next year (i.e., 2007 in this example), in which case, it is unlikely that those breeding groups were represented in the following year.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The search in early spring each year to locate nesting sites was spread across different areas. Note in the map in 
   <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a> how the locations of nesting sites for fed groups are well distributed over the central sacred site (light gray area), and the nonfed groups are widely distributed in the neighboring areas surrounding the central sacred site (gray hatched area). The relatively wide scattering of the nesting sites each year acted to increase the likelihood of including a broader, non-selective sampling of the groups within the study area. Given these points, we conclude that the possible problem of pseudoreplication is small and very likely outweighed by the changes in group size and composition and in nest type and location as well as by other factors and chance occurrences related to weather, predation, etc.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a precautionary measure to avoid possible complications of pseudoreplication, we used Fisher’s exact test to determine the probability of most of the differences between groups we examined. Fisher’s exact test is a nonparametric one-tailed statistical test which determines the probability that the differences as defined with respect to a specific hypothesis among two cases compared in a 2X2 table could be the same due to chance.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The additional parametric statistical tests used for a few special analyses were described as follows. A General Linear Model (GLM) univariate test was used to compare the differences in laying dates of first clutches of fed and nonfed groups with year as a random factor. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to assess the effects of food on egg size (egg length, breadth, and weight) with clutch size as a covariate and on clutch size with clutch initiation date as a covariate. In all these statistical tests, we used p ≤ .05 as indicating statistical significance. The parametric statistical tests were conducted using SPSS for windows release 17.0 (SPSS Inc. 2001, Chicago).</p>
