 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is year-round supplemental feeding that provides a continuous daily support that increases the probability of survival to all the birds in a partridge breeding group. The year-round availability of supplemental food buffers adverse periods, giving a more stable temporal distribution of food as compared with natural conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref019">19</a>], thereby favoring long-term success. Florida Scrub-Jays have consistently bred early in suburban areas where human-provided food is ubiquitous year-round, suggesting that resource predictability may be a perceptual cue for the appropriate timing of breeding [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref033">33</a>]. The strong annual response of the Pamuling fed partridge groups with exceptionally early breeding, larger clutches, and larger eggs may be due in part a response to the predictability of the long-term year-round supplemental feeding at the Pamuling sacred site.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fact that the fed partridge groups showed such a strong set of significant responses to the supplemental feeding provides substantial evidence that the particular example of supplemental feeding practiced at the Pamuling Tibetan sacred site appears to be a successful conservation approach. A number of our results, while statistically significant, were based on small sample sizes; therefore, we recommend that the supplemented population should be monitored to assure that the beneficial effects of such a treatment continue [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tibetan sacred sites offer a unique opportunity to continue to explore the many benefits and costs of supplemental feeding as a conservation tool for threatened bird species management. We, therefore, encourage further comparative studies examining differences in resource availability, density, behavior, and survivorship between supplemental fed and nonfed populations of the Buff-throated Partridge and similar pheasant species across a number of sacred sites in the region.</p>
