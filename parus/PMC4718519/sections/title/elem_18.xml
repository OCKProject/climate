 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although we were unable to calculate adult survival for fed or nonfed groups, observations of breeding females during incubation, when these females are considered quite vulnerable [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref016">16</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref037">37</a>], provided a well-defined time period (three to four weeks) to allow valid comparisons of mortality of female breeders of fed and nonfed groups. Given the possibility of higher predation risk due to higher densities of fed groups, we expected that fed groups may experience higher predation than nonfed groups (H16). We recorded four breeding females killed during incubation on ground nests by unknown predators: three from fed groups and one from a nonfed group. The difference was not significant with a high 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-value (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.910).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that the Buff-throated Partridges at this site were observed to occasionally use tree nests [
  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref050">50</a>], we assumed that tree nests offered greater security against clutch predation (H17). The numbers were too low to determine the hatching success of tree nests versus ground nests within fed groups or nonfed groups; therefore, we combined fed and nonfed groups in order to determine the relative nesting success of groups with tree nests compared to groups with ground nests. All ten tree nests (100%) produced at least one hatchling compared to only 61% of groups with ground nests. The difference was statistically significant (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.014; 
  <a rid="pone.0146568.t006" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0146568.t006">Table 6</a>). Since this test confirmed that tree nests showed a higher hatching success, we assumed that tree nests would be expected to produce more hatchlings per egg than ground nests. The greater numbers involved allowed us to test this hypothesis within fed groups (H18) and nonfed groups (H19). In both cases, tree nests showed significantly higher hatching rates than ground nests (
  <a rid="pone.0146568.t006" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0146568.t006">Table 6</a>). Last, we tested whether the use of tree nests was more frequent among nonfed groups than fed groups. That result was not significant (
  <a rid="pone.0146568.t006" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0146568.t006">Table 6</a>).
