 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study was conducted over a four-year period from March 2006 through December 2009 on Pamuling Mountain (30°06′N 101°11′E) in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China. Our study site encompassed the top of the Pamuling Mountain from the highest peak at 4400 m down to an elevation of 3350 m which defined the lower limit of the study area. The 3350 m elevation limit serves as an outer boundary which circumscribes the entire 50.6 km

  <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a>. The light gray area in the center delimits the boundary of the 339 ha Pamuling Tibetan Monastery sacred site within which the supplemental feeding sites are located (

  <a rid="pone.0146568.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146568.g001">Fig 1</a> is covered with a mosaic of Himalayan tree-line habitats. The dominant vegetation of the sacred site and the surrounding area above 3350m was 
  <span class="italic">Quercus aquifolioides</span> oak forest on the southern and western slopes of the area, with flaky fir, 
  <span class="italic">Abies squamata</span>, forest and violet-purple rhododendron, 
  <span class="italic">Rhododendron nitidulum</span>, scrub (approximately 50 cm in height) dominating north-facing slopes. Alpine meadows, primarily composed of Sichuan kobresia (
  <span class="italic">Kobresia setchwanensis)</span> made up a smaller proportion of the tree-line mosaic [

  <a rid="pone.0146568.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146568.ref062">62</a>]. The semi-humid climate was typical of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau tree-line with spring occurring from April to June, summer only in July, autumn from August to September, and a long winter from October to March [
