 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In practice, conservation has three main aims: (1) to determine what biodiversity needs to be conserved, (2) to identify and assess threats to biodiversity and (3) to develop solutions that mitigate current or potential biodiversity losses (Groom et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2006</a>; Primack 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">2006</a>; Berger-Tal and Saltz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2016b</a>). Social learning has a role in each of these aims and has therefore been suggested to be important in conservation contexts (Whitehead 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" href="#CR133">2010</a>; Greggor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2014b</a>; Schakner and Blumstein 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">2016</a>; see Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Meanwhile, there has been progress in recognizing the value of social learning in conservation on the international policy stage. The last meeting of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2014</a>) explicitly discussed the impact that cetacean culture (i.e. socially learned, group-specific behavioural variants) should have on species’ management and policy. However, despite proposing that socially learned behaviour needs to be considered when conserving migratory species, these proceedings only acknowledged a small portion of the potential uses of social learning in conservation. By exploring each of the main conservation aims in more detail, the extent of where social learning could be used in management and policy becomes apparent.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aim 1: what to conserve?</div>
  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social learning can create behavioural variants that form valuable units of biodiversity. When information consistently travels from parents to offspring, social learning can act as a form of non-genetic inheritance (Laland et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2001</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2009</a>), which can drive population differences in behaviour. When social learning leads to the adoption of fitness relevant behaviours or drives reproductive isolation in sympatric groups, socially learned behavioural variants can shrink effective population sizes, thereby magnifying threats that would otherwise be considered over a geographical area (Whitehead et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134" href="#CR134">2004</a>; Ryan 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">2006</a>). Additionally, culturally derived behaviours and the conformity they promote can put certain populations at greater risk than others. For example, even though orcas (
   <span class="italic">Orcinus orca</span>) are capable of capturing a variety of prey, southern resident populations (a socially and culturally distinct group) mainly hunt chinook salmon (
   <span class="italic">Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</span>) (Ford and Ellis 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2006</a>) and are therefore more vulnerable than other groups of orcas if salmon populations decline (Whitehead 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" href="#CR133">2010</a>). Finally, it has been argued that some group-specific, socially learned behaviours are worthy of conserving in their own right because their loss would result in unwanted homogenization of species’ behaviours (Slabbekoorn and Smith 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" href="#CR108">2002</a>; Whitehead 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" href="#CR133">2010</a>). For example, the diversity of song in Dupont’s lark (
   <span class="italic">Chersophilus duponti</span>) declines as habitat fragmentation increases (Laiolo 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2008</a>), a type of loss akin to the disappearance of human languages (Laiolo and Jovani 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2007</a>). Thus, quantifying stable, socially learned behaviours can inform conservation management about population vulnerability and behavioural variation worth saving (Whitehead 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" href="#CR133">2010</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aim 2: what threatens biodiversity?</div>
  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social learning can benefit animals where it helps them adjust to human induced changes in the environment, but it can also prove detrimental where it spreads behaviours that lead to human-wildlife conflict. Therefore, predicting where social learning occurs can be important for assessing threats posed by human activities. In species that rely on the social transfer of information for survival, identifying where human activities could disrupt information transfer is essential for accurate threat forecasting. For example, chemical pollutants such as heavy metals can blunt fishes’ responses to conspecific alarm cues (Mirza et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">2009</a>), which would reduce their ability to learn socially about predators. Meanwhile, anthropogenic noise can distract attention and mask auditory communication channels (Shannon et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" href="#CR105">2015</a>), such that individuals would be less likely to pick up on alarm vocalizations that could lead to learning about predators (Grade and Sieving 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2016</a>). In this way, identifying where survival mostly rely on social learning can help prioritize which species or populations most need protection from processes that interfere with information transfer, such as chemical pollution or anthropogenic noise.
  </p>
  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As well as disrupting learning channels, human activity can also reduce the diversity of information carried socially in populations. The loss of socially learned information as a result of population decline can have long-term consequences that threat forecasting should strive to evaluate. For example, it has been suggested that the failure of the North Atlantic right whale (
   <span class="italic">Eubalaena glacialis</span>) population to rebound after whaling was banned might be due to the their loss of socially retained information about feeding habitats (Whitehead et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134" href="#CR134">2004</a>). Thus, accurate assessments of species recovery rates may need to consider the social learned information that populations carry when determining their relevant Allee effects (i.e. inverse density dependence; fitness-driving processes that are magnified as population size decreases; Stephens et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114" href="#CR114">1999</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a more positive sense, the occurrence of social learning amid human-induced habitat changes can also have net benefits for species survival where it allows animals to flexibly respond to threats. Social learning can help spread novel behavioural variants that facilitate animals’ ability to adjust to environmental changes (van der Post and Hogeweg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">2009</a>; Brown 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2012</a>; Rubenstein 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">2016</a>), such as the uptake of innovations (entirely novel behaviours) that allow for the adoption of new foods or foraging techniques (Ramsey et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">2007</a>). For example, black rats (
   <span class="italic">Rattus rattus</span>) in Israel created a new foraging niche and expanded their range into nearby forests by adopting a socially learned foraging technique that allowed them to eat pine cones (Terkel 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" href="#CR116">1996</a>). More generally, foraging innovations have been linked to invasion success, at least in birds (Sol and Lefebvre 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112" href="#CR112">2000</a>; Sol et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113" href="#CR113">2002</a>). Meanwhile in primates, species-level measures of foraging innovations are correlated with social learning (Reader and Laland 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">2002</a>). Thus, social learning of novel foraging techniques could more widely accelerate behavioural adjustments to changing habitats, and those species which are most innovative might be most likely to spread novel behaviour. Models that aim to predict the spread of invasive species or the resilience of species to shifting climate could benefit from incorporating this information (Keith and Bull 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The acquisition of novel behaviour and the expansion of niches via social learning may equally serve as a threat to biodiversity when innovations put species in conflict with people. There have been documented cases where social learning has been implicated in aiding the spread of conflict or problematic behaviours, such as the depredation of fishing catches by sperm whales (
   <span class="italic">Physeter macrocephalus</span>) (Schakner et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">2014a</a>), crop raiding behaviours by African elephants (
   <span class="italic">Loxodonta Africana</span>) (Chiyo et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2012</a>) and spreading bears’ and dolphins’ reliance on anthropogenic foods (Mazur and Seher 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2008</a>; Donaldson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2012</a>). These types of conflict can foster negative attitudes towards wildlife, can reduce support for local conservation programs and lead to persecution or culling of conflict species (Mpanduji et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2004</a>; Thirgood et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" href="#CR117">2005</a>). Additionally, since social learning does not always spread the most efficient or rewarding behaviour (Boyd and Richerson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">1985</a>; Laland and Williams 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1998</a>; Giraldeau et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2002</a>), animals may socially learn conflict behaviours despite other, equally beneficial options being available. For example, in the case of black bears (
   <span class="italic">Ursus americanus</span>), Mazur and Seher (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2008</a>) found that cubs obtain preferences for human-developed or natural habitat from their mother, regardless of the presence of both habitat types in the area. Moreover, the bears in developed habitats were 45 times more likely to feed on human-produced food, even though a third of these bears would not survive past their first year due to conflict-related deaths. Therefore, conflict behaviours that spread via social learning can persist even if they reduce fitness. Overall, the likelihood that species will acquire and spread either adaptive or maladaptive behaviours is vitally important to predicting future resilience or conflict with humans.

  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social learning can be harnessed to enhance or prevent behaviour that would aid conservation goals. Social learning has been proposed to be useful in reducing the incidence of road collisions (Proppe et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">2016</a>) and has been found to help spread information about novel predators in reintroduction programs (Griffin 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2004</a>) and increase the survival of reintroduced hatchery-reared fish (Brown and Laland 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2001</a>; Brown and Day 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2002</a>). Moreover, some of the detrimental behaviours that animals pick up post release, such as an attraction or tameness towards humans, can be prevented by giving animals time to interact with knowledgeable, adult conspecifics prior to release (Walters et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130" href="#CR130">2010</a>). Social learning can also be promoted by broadcasting attractive social cues to help animals colonize newly restored habitat or avoid settling in poor habitat that might otherwise be perceived as high quality, thereby preventing perceptual errors and ecological traps (sensu Gilroy and Sutherland 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2007</a>). For instance, social cues have been harnessed, in attracting threatened bird species to settle in suitable habitat by playing conspecific song (Virzi et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" href="#CR126">2012</a>) or erecting conspecific decoy models (Kress and Nettleship 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">1988</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, less is known about how to prevent the social transmission of behaviour that may exacerbate conservation problems. Schakner and Blumstein (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">2016</a>) put forth theoretical tactics for preventing learning that could, in principle, be adapted to social learning situations. They propose that populations can occupy one of several learning stages with regards to a specific behaviour—pre-learning, mid-learning, and post learning—each of which may be targeted with different tactics by conservationists. Before the conflict behaviour has entered the population, mitigation techniques should focus on preventing individual learning about the outcome of the behaviour. For example, in bear populations without conflict, efforts should focus on keeping human food out of reach. If the behaviour has entered the population but has not fully spread—i.e. during association formation—management would benefit from removing individuals that have already acquired the conflict behaviour. If the behaviour is ubiquitous throughout the population, deterrents may be the only viable solution to prevent the behaviour. Future development and testing of such tactics in conservation settings are fundamental to many conservation policies because social learning can easily derail a management solution, like spreading wariness of traps or decreasing the effectiveness of deterrents. For example, it has been suggested that population estimates of sperm whales in the nineteenth century were underestimated because, individuals learned socially to avoid boats (Smith et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" href="#CR109">2008</a>). Had there been a way to reduce or reverse transmission of this fear, populations could have been surveyed more accurately.
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, while we only mention it briefly here, similar types of strategies for preventing the transmission of behaviour or encouraging its adoption could also be employed on the human side of conservation. Conservation solutions rely heavily on information exchange between networks of organizations and communities, and many conservation problems, especially in cases of human-wildlife conflict, need to address the root human cause of the biodiversity threat for effective mitigation (Woodroffe et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138" href="#CR138">2005</a>). Insight gained from social learning in general could help spread information about conservation initiatives or practices (e.g. sustainable harvesting), or change cultural behaviour (Clayton and Myers 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2015</a>), such as reducing the demand for ivory or shark fin soup. In contrast, there are instances where the maintenance of cultural norms, such as taboos on certain hunting practices, are equally as important in conserving species as legislative change (e.g. in Madagascar Jones et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2008</a>). Even though encouraging or preventing social learning in humans carries with it necessary logistical and ethical considerations, social learning research that is applicable to humans has great conservation implications.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Barriers to using social learning</div>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite its many potential conservation uses, social learning is not widely used in practice. Even in areas where social learning has been developed as a tool for altering behaviour, such as in reintroduction efforts, prescribed interventions do not exist for many species or contexts. Simply exposing conspecifics to an experienced individual, which is often recommended (e.g. Shier 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">2016</a>), may not help if individuals differ in their propensity to attend to or learn from others (Mesoudi et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2016</a>). Additionally, certain social stimuli may never be learned if they fail to attract attention or do not consistently occur with perceivable outcomes. Although these issues have been commonly researched in the social learning literature (see Rendell et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2011</a>), they are not often considered in conservation practice; yet they are crucial to determining the frequency and strength of cues necessary to produce or prevent social learning.
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the explosion of social network-based diffusion analysis—i.e. a technique that identifies social learning based on whether information spreads preferentially between individuals who associate or interact most frequently (Farine and Whitehead 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2015</a>)—it is becoming easier to identify behaviours that are learned socially and to identify biases in information spread. The development of these techniques offers an unprecedented opportunity to integrate social learning knowledge into conservation practice. However, social learning is still primarily studied in captivity. Accurately predicting, for example, the influence of social learning on species’ flexibility in their responses to climate change (e.g. Keith and Bull 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2016</a>) requires that learning biases are also resolved in the wild if such modelling is to be representative of real world behaviour.
  </p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Without clear expectations for social transmission and guidelines to encourage or inhibit the spread of information, socially targeted mitigations are not going to be widely used in conservation. Calls for targeting learning as part of conservation interventions continue to grow (Greggor et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2014b</a>; Berger-Tal and Saltz 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2016b</a>) and so too does the importance of using social learning effectively. By highlighting many of the biases that are relevant to conservation practice, it becomes clearer where current knowledge about social learning can be better used, and where further research is needed.
