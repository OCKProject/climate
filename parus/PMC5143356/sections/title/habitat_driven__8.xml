 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In theory, social learning should be favoured over individual learning when animals are uncertain or acquiring information individually is costly (Rendell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2011</a>), and should be favoured in environments that are variable enough to promote learning as opposed to genetic adaptation, but not too variable such that learned information is quickly outdated (Laland and Kendal 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2003</a>). Additionally, the value and variability of resources have also been suggested to influence greater use of social information when competition is high (Smolla et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" href="#CR110">2015</a>). Even though theories about what conditions should favour social learning have been well explored (see list in Fragaszy and Perry 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2003</a>; pg. 34), predicting where social learning will actually occur is challenging (Rendell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2011</a>), especially in the wild. Empirical validation is needed for a range of these theories. As a first step, the theory and modelling about what optimal level of environmental variability most encourages social learning need to be mapped onto the real-world conditions of change that animals currently experience because of human influences.

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There have been but a handful of empirical field tests of the hypotheses that social learning should be favoured in conditions of mid-level environmental variability. Wilkinson and Boughman (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137" href="#CR137">1999</a>) looked at whether the rate at which feeding patches disappeared—a proxy for environmental variability—predicted species’ use of social information at several communal roosts in three bat species that differed in foraging ecology. They found that they could predict the relative amount that each species followed conspecifics out of the roost based on how often bats foraged unsuccessfully on their own. However, their prediction that sufficiently high patch variability would select against social learning in one of their study species was not supported with the data. Such experiments in other wild systems are central to predicting whether social learning propensities will increase or decrease as conditions change. Tests of the propensity for social learning across urban and rural habitats, for instance, where variability is proposed to differ, would be hugely informative. Such tests will help inform predictions about which environments impacted by humans are most likely to interfere with or generate social learning.
