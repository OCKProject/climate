 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species differ in their propensity to learn. However, species ranging from bumblebees (
  <span class="italic">Bombus terrestris</span>) (Worden and Papaj 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139" href="#CR139">2005</a>) to chimpanzees (
  <span class="italic">Pan troglodytes</span>) (Whiten et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135" href="#CR135">1999</a>) are routine social learners. Therefore, social learning is perhaps better predicted by the circumstance in question, rather than by assumptions about the learning capacities of the species involved (Laland and Kendal 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2003</a>). Species do not have to be social to learn socially (Wilkinson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136" href="#CR136">2010</a>), but social species may have more opportunities for social learning. Thus, social learning is expected to be more common in social as opposed to solitary species (Roper 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">1986</a>; Lee 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">1991</a>; Lefebvre et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">1996</a>; Lefebvre and Giraldeau 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">1996</a>; Reader and Lefebvre 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">2001</a>). However, a species’ social system alone cannot predict the occurrence of social learning (Thornton and McAuliffe 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121" href="#CR121">2015</a>; Thornton et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" href="#CR123">2016</a>). There are species that may seem like good candidates for social learning, such as spotted hyenas (
  <span class="italic">Crocuta crocuta</span>), that live in social groups and are opportunistic foragers, but for which social learning does not influence the uptake of novel behaviours in foraging tasks (Benson-Amram et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2014</a>). Such exceptions are not only interesting from an academic standpoint, but explaining why such exceptions exist is crucial to predicting the use of social learning in lesser studied species of conservation concern.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In some cases, there are easily identifiable reasons why a species may not learn socially. For example, alarm behaviour is less likely to lead to social learning in species where alarms do not reliably predict a high threat of predators (Griffin, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2004</a>). For instance, alarm calling in birds can be triggered by the presence of a predator, but can also result from false alarms about non-predatory intruders or be given by deceptive individuals that gain from distracting conspecifics (Møller 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">1988</a>). Thus, learning immediately and irreversibly about whatever stimulus is paired with conspecific alarm calling could be detrimental. In contrast, for many fish species, where alarm signals are derived from the chemicals released by injured conspecifics, the alarm always indicates the presences of predators and thus should be more robust to extinction (Griffin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if a species learns socially in one context, it does not mean that it will learn socially in all contexts. For example, Norway rats (
  <span class="italic">Rattus norvegicus</span>) learn socially about novel foods (Galef 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">1982</a>). However, these rats do not learn socially about a novel foraging technique in which individuals dive for molluscs on river beds (Galef 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">1982</a>), perhaps because the behaviour is harder to observe underwater. Meanwhile, the same is true for vervet monkeys (
  <span class="italic">Chlorocebus pygerythrus</span>) that appear not to use social information when learning about a new deterrent, such as recently installed electric fencing (Weingrill et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132" href="#CR132">2005</a>), even though they learn socially in novel food contexts (e.g. van de Waal et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128" href="#CR128">2013</a>). Investigating what separates the contexts in which a species does and does not learn socially would clearly be important in facilitating or preventing social learning.
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species-level biases are also fundamental to predicting threats and advising conservation policy. Migrating species differ in whether they socially learn their travel route; many baleen whales and bird species do, but sea turtles do not (Scott et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">2014</a>). Several conservation considerations hinge on whether or not a migratory species learns its route socially, such as: do migration routes represent a cultural variant that needs to be maintained, should the loss of migratory knowledge be included in threat forecasting, and should social learning should be encouraged in reintroductions to aid first migrations (e.g. Urbanek et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" href="#CR125">2005</a>)? Meanwhile, differences in species’ social learning propensities can influence the extent to which a management action persists over time. For example, the effectiveness of an intervention designed to prevent waterfowl from taking handouts from park visitors differed by species, potentially because of differences in social learning between them (Conover 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">1999</a>). Geese (
  <span class="italic">Branta canadensis</span>) and swans (
  <span class="italic">Cygnus olor</span>) were conditioned to avoid bread through the application of distasteful chemicals. Even though both showed similar levels of initial avoidance, the geese lost their avoidance faster than the swans once regular bread was available because they forage in larger groups where a greater number of social cues were available to indicate food palatability (Conover 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">1999</a>). Overall, determining which species are most likely to learn socially in a given context is essential to determining if social learning should be used in its conservation.
