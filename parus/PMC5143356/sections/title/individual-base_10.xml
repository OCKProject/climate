 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another source of bias in social learning stems from who is observing the socially produced information. Some individuals can have preferences for asocially acquired information, even if the information is outdated or suboptimal (Leadbeater and Florent 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">2014</a>). The developmental stage, sex or personal experience of the observer can all influence how likely an individual is to copy a demonstrator (Nottebohm 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">1970</a>; Reader and Laland 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">2000</a>; van Bergen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2004</a>; Thornton and Malapert 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" href="#CR120">2009</a>). Of these observer-driven biases, those that are dependent on the stage of development are best studied. Such biases influence social learning during critical periods, often to help in the development of evolutionarily appropriate behaviour. The acquisitions of birdsong and mate preference are classic examples where information is learned socially during a sensitive period of development (Nottebohm 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">1970</a>; Clayton 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">1989</a>). This means, for example, that birds which do not have social exposure to song or the appropriate parent will develop suboptimal song and mate preferences that can reduce their reproductive prospects. While sensitive periods are utilized in many captive breeding programs, such as encouraging socially mediated migration and habitat choices (Urbanek et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" href="#CR125">2005</a>), the mitigation of social learning interference during critical periods has not often been attempted in the wild. Such efforts are limited by the fact that we lack understanding of what happens after interference is removed (e.g. in the case of anthropogenic noise, Shannon et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" href="#CR105">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding where learning is biased towards certain age groups, for instance, could be crucial to accurately assessing where natural channels of information flow might be disrupted by human activities. For example, older female matriarchs carry social knowledge in elephants (
  <span class="italic">L. africana</span>), such that groups with older females have higher fitness and respond better towards predators (McComb et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">2001</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">2011</a>). Since older elephants (including females) have larger tusks, they are preferentially targeted by poachers (Dobson and Poole 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1998</a>). Similar social learning biases towards older females have also been found in orca social groups (Brent et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2015</a>). Therefore, assessing the impact of this social learning bias is crucial to accurately predicting the threats posed by poachers and the demographic costs that the removal of such individuals from the population would have (Whitehead 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" href="#CR133">2010</a>). Also important to such assessments is whether individuals are flexible in employing different social learning strategies that enable them to learn when to switch to a different demonstrator if their demonstrator becomes unreliable or ceases to exist (discussed in Heyes 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2016</a>; Mesoudi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other factors during development can also influence the probability of a given individual attending to and learning about social information. For instance, the level and timing of developmental stress that quail (
  <span class="italic">Coturnix japonica</span>) experience influences their use of social information (Boogert et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2013</a>). Developmental stress can be triggered by inadequate food provisioning (Pravosudov and Kitaysky 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">2006</a>), and areas with high human impact, such as urban habitat, appear to have lesser quality food as evidenced by the stunted development seen in urban populations (e.g. great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> and blue tits 
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>; Bailly et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2016</a>). Therefore, researching whether suboptimal habitat influences individual social learning tendencies may help explain natural individual variation in social information use and could be an important component of predicting the impact of urbanization on animal populations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whether an animal has previous experience with a stimulus can also influence whether they learn socially about it. Short-term habituation to non-threatening stimuli, on the order of ∼5 presentations, does not hamper fear conditioning, but long-term habituation, such as lifetime experience with a non-threatening stimulus (e.g. a heterospecific), does (Curio 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">1988</a>). Other types of experiences can also influence whether individuals use social information. Early life experience with conspecifics can influence individuals’ tendency to learn socially in later life (Chapman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2008</a>). Moreover, the type of social experience an individual has with a stimulus can determine whether learning occurs, although the direction of this effect can depend on the species. For example, individual pigeons do not learn a new feeding technique if they scrounged from others who learned the method (Lefebvre and Helder 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">1997</a>). In contrast, in some other species, such as meerkats (
  <span class="italic">Suricata suricatta</span>) and common marmosets (
  <span class="italic">Callithrix jacchus</span>), scrounging experience has been shown to promote social learning (Caldwell and Whiten 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2003</a>; Thornton and Malapert 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" href="#CR120">2009</a>). These differences in the effects of scrounging on social learning may be linked both to species-level variation in social tolerance (Caldwell and Whiten 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2003</a>) and the extent to which the act of scrounging exposes individuals to the instrumental contingencies of a task (Thornton and Malapert 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" href="#CR120">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another type of bias driven by individuals stems from who is producing information. Demonstrator bias (otherwise known as “indirect” or “model-based” bias; Rendell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2011</a>) can differ depending on the species. For example, nine-spine sticklebacks, chimpanzees and meerkats are more likely to copy older individuals (Dugatkin and Godin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">1993</a>; Thornton and Malapert 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" href="#CR120">2009</a>; Horner et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2010</a>), while rats (
  <span class="italic">R. norvegicus</span>) do not show copying biases relating to demonstrator’s age (Galef 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2009</a>). Moreover, a given species can exhibit multiple demonstrator biases, such as copying older and more knowledgeable conspecifics (Kendal et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2015</a>). To complicate matters further, the rules about who to copy can vary depending on an individual’s early life experience. Zebra finches (
  <span class="italic">Taeniopygia guttata</span>) that experienced higher levels of developmental stress are less likely to copy their parents than unaffected offspring are (Farine et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2015</a>). Current research has not revealed general rules that determine these individual copying biases between species. Indeed, simple rules are unlikely to exist, given the number of biases that can apply. However, the better we can predict where similar assumptions about biases hold across related species or social systems, the better management techniques that target social learning will generalize across contexts.
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An understanding of individual-based biases that influence how information spreads socially within wild populations is of great importance in several mitigation settings. Selective removal practices that target an individual after they have committed “problem behaviour” are often ineffective in the long term (Treves and Naughton-Treves 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" href="#CR124">2005</a>). Such practices would be more effective, and considerable time and money saved, if managers could determine ahead of time the probability that problem behaviour would spread, and under what timeframe it might do so. Additionally, management solutions that do not have the capacity to target all individuals in a population could benefit from insight into which individuals tend to spread information in a population. It has been proposed, for example, that road collisions could be reduced by installing invisible fences near roads and fitting shock collars on a subset of the population, in the hopes that avoidance will spread socially (Proppe et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">2016</a>). Again, much time, energy and investment could be saved if collared individuals could be chosen based on their location in the social network and their likelihood of acting as a “demonstrator” for others.
