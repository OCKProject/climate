 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social learning can be harnessed to enhance or prevent behaviour that would aid conservation goals. Social learning has been proposed to be useful in reducing the incidence of road collisions (Proppe et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">2016</a>) and has been found to help spread information about novel predators in reintroduction programs (Griffin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2004</a>) and increase the survival of reintroduced hatchery-reared fish (Brown and Laland 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2001</a>; Brown and Day 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2002</a>). Moreover, some of the detrimental behaviours that animals pick up post release, such as an attraction or tameness towards humans, can be prevented by giving animals time to interact with knowledgeable, adult conspecifics prior to release (Walters et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130" href="#CR130">2010</a>). Social learning can also be promoted by broadcasting attractive social cues to help animals colonize newly restored habitat or avoid settling in poor habitat that might otherwise be perceived as high quality, thereby preventing perceptual errors and ecological traps (sensu Gilroy and Sutherland 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2007</a>). For instance, social cues have been harnessed, in attracting threatened bird species to settle in suitable habitat by playing conspecific song (Virzi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" href="#CR126">2012</a>) or erecting conspecific decoy models (Kress and Nettleship 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">1988</a>).

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, less is known about how to prevent the social transmission of behaviour that may exacerbate conservation problems. Schakner and Blumstein (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">2016</a>) put forth theoretical tactics for preventing learning that could, in principle, be adapted to social learning situations. They propose that populations can occupy one of several learning stages with regards to a specific behaviour—pre-learning, mid-learning, and post learning—each of which may be targeted with different tactics by conservationists. Before the conflict behaviour has entered the population, mitigation techniques should focus on preventing individual learning about the outcome of the behaviour. For example, in bear populations without conflict, efforts should focus on keeping human food out of reach. If the behaviour has entered the population but has not fully spread—i.e. during association formation—management would benefit from removing individuals that have already acquired the conflict behaviour. If the behaviour is ubiquitous throughout the population, deterrents may be the only viable solution to prevent the behaviour. Future development and testing of such tactics in conservation settings are fundamental to many conservation policies because social learning can easily derail a management solution, like spreading wariness of traps or decreasing the effectiveness of deterrents. For example, it has been suggested that population estimates of sperm whales in the nineteenth century were underestimated because, individuals learned socially to avoid boats (Smith et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" href="#CR109">2008</a>). Had there been a way to reduce or reverse transmission of this fear, populations could have been surveyed more accurately.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, while we only mention it briefly here, similar types of strategies for preventing the transmission of behaviour or encouraging its adoption could also be employed on the human side of conservation. Conservation solutions rely heavily on information exchange between networks of organizations and communities, and many conservation problems, especially in cases of human-wildlife conflict, need to address the root human cause of the biodiversity threat for effective mitigation (Woodroffe et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138" href="#CR138">2005</a>). Insight gained from social learning in general could help spread information about conservation initiatives or practices (e.g. sustainable harvesting), or change cultural behaviour (Clayton and Myers 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2015</a>), such as reducing the demand for ivory or shark fin soup. In contrast, there are instances where the maintenance of cultural norms, such as taboos on certain hunting practices, are equally as important in conserving species as legislative change (e.g. in Madagascar Jones et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2008</a>). Even though encouraging or preventing social learning in humans carries with it necessary logistical and ethical considerations, social learning research that is applicable to humans has great conservation implications.
