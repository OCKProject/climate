 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite its many potential conservation uses, social learning is not widely used in practice. Even in areas where social learning has been developed as a tool for altering behaviour, such as in reintroduction efforts, prescribed interventions do not exist for many species or contexts. Simply exposing conspecifics to an experienced individual, which is often recommended (e.g. Shier 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">2016</a>), may not help if individuals differ in their propensity to attend to or learn from others (Mesoudi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2016</a>). Additionally, certain social stimuli may never be learned if they fail to attract attention or do not consistently occur with perceivable outcomes. Although these issues have been commonly researched in the social learning literature (see Rendell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2011</a>), they are not often considered in conservation practice; yet they are crucial to determining the frequency and strength of cues necessary to produce or prevent social learning.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the explosion of social network-based diffusion analysis—i.e. a technique that identifies social learning based on whether information spreads preferentially between individuals who associate or interact most frequently (Farine and Whitehead 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2015</a>)—it is becoming easier to identify behaviours that are learned socially and to identify biases in information spread. The development of these techniques offers an unprecedented opportunity to integrate social learning knowledge into conservation practice. However, social learning is still primarily studied in captivity. Accurately predicting, for example, the influence of social learning on species’ flexibility in their responses to climate change (e.g. Keith and Bull 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2016</a>) requires that learning biases are also resolved in the wild if such modelling is to be representative of real world behaviour.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Without clear expectations for social transmission and guidelines to encourage or inhibit the spread of information, socially targeted mitigations are not going to be widely used in conservation. Calls for targeting learning as part of conservation interventions continue to grow (Greggor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2014b</a>; Berger-Tal and Saltz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2016b</a>) and so too does the importance of using social learning effectively. By highlighting many of the biases that are relevant to conservation practice, it becomes clearer where current knowledge about social learning can be better used, and where further research is needed.
