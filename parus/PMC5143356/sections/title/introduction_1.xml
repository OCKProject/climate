 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research generated from the interface of behavioural ecology and comparative cognition can have important conservation implications, not just for those who study species of conservation concern. Issues that involve feeding, space use and survival around predators and anthropogenic threats are at the forefront of conservation behaviour research (Greggor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2016a</a>). As humans profoundly alter the environment, flexible decision making is important for animals in each of these contexts. Regardless of whether this flexibility involves the creation of novel behaviours, such as feeding innovations (Sol et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113" href="#CR113">2002</a>), or adjusting existing behaviours in response to changing environmental cues, such as timing migration, species that are able to adjust their behaviour are more likely to survive (Berger-Tal and Saltz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2016a</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One key cognitive process that facilitates flexible behaviour is learning. Where and when animals learn are important to conservation because these can allow animals to acquire appropriate behaviour without having to undergo genetic change (Brown 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2013</a>) and can be used as a tool in conservation management (Custance et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2002</a>; Whitehead 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" href="#CR133">2010</a>; Greggor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2014b</a>; Schakner and Blumstein 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">2016</a>). However, learning is still under-utilized in most conservation contexts, including species translocations, invasive species control and human-wildlife conflict (Bell 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2016</a>; Berger-Tal et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2016</a>). Social learning, i.e. learning from the actions of others or the by-product of othersâ€™ behaviour (sensu Heyes 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">1994</a>; Hoppitt and Laland 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2008</a>), can accelerate the spread of behavioural change, with fewer costs than individual learning (Boyd and Richerson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">1985</a>). By this definition, social learning occurs in many species ranging from insects to great apes and across contexts ranging from mate choice to foraging and to predator avoidance (Hoppitt and Laland 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2013</a>). Because of the importance of these contexts for conservationists, social learning principles are widely relevant to species of conservation concern (Custance et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2002</a>; Whitehead 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" href="#CR133">2010</a>). However, despite the overlap of general principles between the two fields, actually using knowledge about social learning can be challenging given the details of conservation interventions.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Imagine, for example, that certain villages are suddenly having problems with endangered species X raiding their soybean crops. Crop raiding is spreading rapidly and threatening the livelihood of people in the villages. There has been support within the communities to cull species X to prevent the destruction of their crops. Should all farmers that grow this crop target species X, even if their farms have not yet been damaged? Or is it a matter of a few problem individuals spreading the behaviour to others? If so, which individuals should be culled and how will their removal influence the behaviour of others? Meanwhile, instead of culling, a local conservation agency suggests employing deterrents to keep species X away from farms. However, one individual of species X in particular is known to have ignored deterrents in the past. Will other individuals learn that deterrents are not dangerous and quickly render them useless? Effective management of this problem is essential to the survival of species X and to the livelihood of the villagers, but effective culling strategies and deterrent methods rely on predictions about whether or not conflict behaviours will be learned socially and spread equally throughout the population.</p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even in this simplistic example, the pace of behavioural acquisition is important, as is the potential unevenness of its spread between individuals. In these and many other types of problems that conservation managers face, an understanding of how social learning operates in the wild is crucial for effective conservation practices that involve and target animal behaviour. However, predicting where social learning will occur is not straightforward (Rendell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2011</a>), and this limits our current ability to implement conservation management and policy that utilizes social learning processes. This review will detail the potential conservation uses of social learning and will highlight areas where social learning biases deserve greater attention because of their conservation implications.
