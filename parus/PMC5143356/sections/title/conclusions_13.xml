 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social learning has many potential conservation applications but is biased by attention, experience and species-level constraints. Understanding social learning biases will be crucial to its effective use in quantifying biodiversity, as a predictive tool to gauge and quantify threats to wildlife and as an active tool for conservation management. It is no surprise that it is rarely used in conservation management, despite its potential, because no clear guidelines exist for tapping into social learning rules. Simply because social learning occurs in one species, individual or context does not mean it will in all others. While these details may be academically interesting, they are a barrier to simple conservation solutions. The field greatly needs systematic reviews to help locate areas where existing evidence strongly supports the use of social learning and to make such evidence readily available. Without evidence, the effectiveness of social learning interventions cannot be compared to traditional methods. Meanwhile, many areas where we do not yet have clear predictions about where, when or why social learning occurs are prime topics for future research by behavioural ecologists and comparative psychologists with conservation in mind. Not only the further study of social learning biases will enrich the behavioural ecology field but also the development of extractable rules and predictions will be of great use to conservation practitioners.</p>
