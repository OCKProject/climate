 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dispersal is any movement of individuals or propagules that has potential consequences for gene flow across space (Ronce, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0322" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0322">2007</a>; Appendix I). Dispersal has a central role in life history and its evolution is fundamental in determining the consequences of land use change, habitat degradation, and climate change for species persistence, or a species' invasive potential (Clobert 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0058">2012</a>; Travis 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0367" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0367">2013a</a>). Whether or not, and how far, an organism moves between the place of its birth and reproduction can be the target of intense selection (Ronce, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0322" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0322">2007</a>). However, any evolutionary change in dispersal ability will occur only if the underlying traits (see Appendix I) have a heritable component (Falconer &amp; Mackay, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0106">1996</a>; Lynch &amp; Walsh, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0227" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0227">1998</a>; Danchin 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0076">2011</a>). The speed of the evolutionary change will depend on the underlying genetic architecture (Orr, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0275" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0275">2005</a>; Richards, Bossdorf &amp; Pigliucci, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0306" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0306">2010</a>; MacKay 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0229" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0229">2012</a>), the dispersal trait's genetic variance, and its covariance with other traits that may be under selection (Appendix I).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dispersal is a complex and multidimensional phenotype, which makes describing its genetic basis highly challenging (see online Table 
  <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). Dispersal comprises departure (initiation to leave the natal habitat), transfer (movement), and settlement (establishment in the novel breeding habitat), and often involves multiple morphological, physiological and behavioural traits (Clobert 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0059">2009</a>). Further, departure and transfer can be actively undertaken by the organism or vectored by other abiotic or biotic agents, and in most cases even vectored dispersal is influenced by morphological, physiological or behavioural adaptations (Bonte 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0039">2012</a>), potentially leading to ‘dispersal syndromes’ (Appendix I) (Clobert 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0059">2009</a>). In actively dispersing organisms, an individual's ability or capacity to move is often related to its morphology, size or endurance, although high movement abilities only lead to dispersal when individuals have a propensity to disperse. Dispersal may be the result of a ‘dedicated behaviour’, the main function of which is to disperse; or it may occur as a by‐product of other movements, such as foraging or mate searching (Van Dyck &amp; Baguette, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0381" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0381">2005</a>; Burgess 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0046">2015</a>; Bonte &amp; Dahirel, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0032">2017</a>). While some species show a recognizable locomotory or behavioural ‘dispersal morph’, which allows a more accurate quantification of dispersal [see Zera &amp; Denno, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0413" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0413">1997</a> for a review], in most species dispersal traits show continuous phenotypes, and hence are more difficult to quantify. Passive dispersal has the added complexity of dispersers being vectored by agents such as animals, wind, water or gravity, with the eventual dispersal process resulting from the interaction between the vector and individual traits (Cousens, Dytham &amp; Law, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0070">2008</a>). Seed dispersal by wind, for example, depends on the overall size of the plant, including height of seed release, and on the seed size and morphology (e.g. presence of plumes or wings; Soons 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0347" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0347">2004</a>; Thomson 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0361" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0361">2010</a>). Seed dispersal by animals is affected by traits such as plant height and the seed's adhesive structures (Albert 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0001">2015</a>), while fruit placement, size, colour and nutritional content affect their attractiveness to potential frugivorous dispersers (Russo, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0328" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0328">2003</a>; Lomáscolo 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0224" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0224">2010</a>). Passive dispersal and phoretic (transport of one species by another) behaviour is also found in animal taxa (e.g. Houck &amp; O'Connor, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0175" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0175">1991</a>). Whether active or passive, dispersal is often correlated with other key life‐history characteristics, such as morphological characteristics or reproductive traits (Stevens 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0353" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0353">2012</a>, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0351" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0351">2014</a>; Bonte &amp; Dahirel, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0032">2017</a>), resulting in the potential for trait co‐evolution if the correlations are genetic. Additionally, environmental conditions can strongly impact dispersal. For example, dispersal propensity may be affected by population density (Bowler &amp; Benton, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0041">2005</a>; Matthysen, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0236" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0236">2005</a>), and wind force affects seed dispersal distances (Greene, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0137" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0137">2005</a>). Understanding whether different genotypes are differently influenced by environmental conditions – i.e. genotype–environment (G × E) interactions (Appendix I) – is also important (e.g. Donohue, Polisetty &amp; Wender, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0092">2005</a>; Sinervo 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0345" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0345">2006</a>; Ducatez 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0094">2012</a>; Pennekamp 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0281" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0281">2014</a>; Cote 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0063">2017a</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How do evolutionary models of dispersal deal with this complexity? There are two main categories of dispersal models: theoretical ecological and/or evolutionary models that aim at a general understanding of the causes and consequences of dispersal, and taxon‐specific predictive models. While the vast majority of models of dispersal fall into the former category, the latter approach is mostly used for tactically describing movement in a specific ecological context (e.g. spread of invasive species, species range shift; see online Table 
  <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S2</a> and do not usually consider evolution. In models that do consider evolution, the genetic basis of dispersal is usually kept as simple as possible: a typical assumption is a single locus affecting a single, broadly defined trait related to dispersal (e.g. dispersal propensity, shape of the dispersal kernel, environmentally cued rules for individual departure and settling; see online Table 
  <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S2</a>). Hence, a critical question is whether the accumulation of empirical information about genetic architectures for dispersal should result in new approaches to modelling dispersal evolution, and whether this increased complexity matters.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our goal in this review is twofold. First, even though several reviews already exist on different aspects of the genetics of dispersal (e.g. Gatehouse, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0126" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0126">1989</a>; Wheat, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0393" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0393">2012</a>; Zera &amp; Brisson, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>; Dingle, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0085">2014</a>; see also reviews on the genetics of other movement types: Pulido, Berthold &amp; van Noordwijk, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0300" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0300">1996</a>; van Noordwijk 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0269" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0269">2006</a>; Pulido, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0299" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0299">2007</a>; Dingle, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0085">2014</a>), we review current knowledge across different taxa. We focus on inferences of the genetic basis of dispersal using direct estimates of their heritability or population genetic variance, comparisons of dispersal traits among populations, and genetic correlations/covariances between dispersal traits (Appendix I) and other traits. Our perspective is on the genetic architecture of dispersal components, which has not been reviewed previously, and we review the few cases in which loci influencing dispersal have been identified. Second, we review current theory on dispersal evolution. Specifically, we review how genetics have been accounted for in existing models, which to date have almost exclusively been developed to provide qualitative, theoretical predictions on dispersal evolution, and we discuss how predicted evolutionary outcomes may depend on assumptions about dispersal genetic architecture. Finally, we present results from a new model that we developed to illustrate how the evolution of dispersal probability in a fragmented landscape depends upon the underlying genetic architecture.
