 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenotypic variation in dispersal among populations</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If dispersal has a genetic basis and can evolve, divergent selection on dispersal should produce predictable differences in dispersal phenotypes among different types of populations. While Section 
  <a rid="brv12356-sec-0005" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12356-sec-0005">II.3</a> documented the evolvability of dispersal, here we address an extension to that concept, focusing on the evolution of dispersal differences among populations, and its role in linking ecological and evolutionary dynamics. It is notable, however, that differences between populations in any trait, even if in accordance with predictions, are not in itself evidence for genetic variation, and should always be accompanied by common‐garden breeding trials.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of the best‐known examples indicating micro‐evolution of dispersal come from range‐expanding species (e.g. Thomas

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0064">2017b</a>) and from metapopulations showing contrasting levels of connectivity. Individuals from range margins might be predicted to evolve a higher dispersal propensity than core populations, and newly founded populations are likely to comprise more dispersive individuals than old populations in a metapopulation. In fact, both the evolution of increased or decreased dispersal can be predicted for species expanding over fragmented landscapes or experiencing a sudden fragmentation event (Leimar &amp; Norberg,

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0063">2017a</a>). On the one hand, as habitat fragmentation imposes diverse costs during transfer (Bonte 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0039">2012</a>; Baguette &amp; Van Dyck, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0006">2007</a>), we can simply expect a reduction in dispersal propensity (reviewed in Cote 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0064">2017b</a>). In the bog fritillary butterfly 
  <span class="italic">Boloria</span> (
  <span class="italic">Proclossiana</span>) 
  <span class="italic">eunomia</span>, dispersal propensity was dramatically decreased by landscape fragmentation, which induced higher dispersal mortality (Schtickzelle, Mennechez &amp; Baguette, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0338" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0338">2006</a>; Schtickzelle

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0337" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0337">2007</a>). A reduced propensity to initiate wind‐assisted dispersal has been reported in spiders in fragmented landscapes (Bonte 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0037">2006</a>, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0031">2007</a>). The proportion of dispersing 
  <span class="italic">versus</span> non‐dispersing achenes has been shown to differ among populations in desert annual herbs (Venable &amp; Burquez, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0384" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0384">1989</a>), as well as among other species populations that differ in the degree of habitat fragmentation (Imbert, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0179" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0179">2001</a>; Riba 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0305" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0305">2009</a>). Isolated populations of the annual herb 
  <span class="italic">Crepis sancta</span> along pavements in the city of Montpellier evolved less‐dispersive seeds within approximately 10 generations (Cheptou 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0055">2008</a>). Similarly, 
  <span class="italic">Mycelis muralis</span> populations collected from fragmented landscapes had propagules with a lower terminal velocity (a proxy of dispersal ability), than those in non‐fragmented landscapes (Riba 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0305" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0305">2009</a>). Habitat fragmentation, on the other hand, may select for adaptations to improve transfer and settlement through, for example, movement and navigation abilities and, in highly fragmented landscapes, for higher emigration rates (Olivieri &amp; Gouyon, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0273" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0273">1997</a>; Baguette &amp; Van Dyck, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0006">2007</a>). This occurs because the increased habitat loss and local extinction probability increase the dispersal costs, but also raise the dispersal benefits gained through recolonizations (e.
  <span class="italic">G</span>. Olivieri &amp; Gouyon, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0273" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0273">1997</a>; Travis &amp; Dytham, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0368" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0368">1999</a>; see also the Glanville fritillary butterfly example in Section

   <span class="italic">d</span>
  </a>). In some insects, more efficient transfer has been suggested to evolve in fragmented landscapes, for example by increased investments in thorax and flight muscle mass and by improved navigation skills (Thomas, Hill &amp; Lewis, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0360" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0360">1998</a>; Merckx &amp; van Dyck,

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0133" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0133">2012</a>). Improved settlement capacities through increased perceptual ability are found in speckled wood butterflies 
  <span class="italic">Pararge aegeria</span> in fragmented relative to more continuous habitat (Öckinger &amp; Van Dyck, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0272" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0272">2012</a>). Whether dispersal will increase or decrease in response to habitat fragmentation will depend on factors such as the proportion of empty habitats to colonize, the degree of environmental heterogeneity and, importantly, the amount of genetic variation in dispersal traits (Cheptou 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0056">2017</a>; Cote

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparisons of individuals from expanding range fronts with those from core populations also provide interesting insights about eco‐evolutionary dynamics (Appendix I) involved in dispersal evolution. For example, in northern Australia, research on the invasive cane toad 
  <span class="italic">Rhinella marina</span> has documented behavioural and morphological changes associated with increased dispersal rate in populations at the expanding range front (Phillips 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0291" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0291">2006</a>, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0290" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0290">2008</a>). Common‐garden breeding trials have suggested a genetic basis to dispersal rate, as toads with parents from the range front have higher dispersal rates than toads with parents from the core populations (Phillips, Brown &amp; Shine, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0289" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0289">2010</a>). A number of candidate genes linked to dispersal in cane toads have been identified recently (Rollins, Richardson &amp; Shine, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0321" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0321">2015</a>). Similar results supporting an increased dispersal rate at the expansion front have been observed for other taxa including butterflies (Hill, Thomas &amp; Blakeley,

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0259" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0259">2015</a>) and some invasive plants (Monty &amp; Mahy,

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0177" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0177">2015</a>). These findings from field populations are closely paralleled by results from laboratory studies on range expansions in protists (Fronhofer &amp; Altermatt, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0113" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0113">2015</a>; Fronhofer, Nitsche &amp; Altermatt,

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0400" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0400">2016</a>). Increased seed dispersal at range edges compared to central locations has been observed in 
  <span class="italic">Senecio inaequidens</span> (Monty &amp; Mahy, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0250" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0250">2010</a>), but not in 
  <span class="italic">Senecio madagascariensis</span> (Bartle, Moles &amp; Bonsor, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0009">2013</a>), indicating that dispersal ability may evolve rapidly in response to natural selection, but that some species or populations may be limited in their ability to do so.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, between‐population differentiation in dispersal may reflect a history of divergent selection on dispersal, imposed for example by habitat fragmentation or range expansions. Divergence among natural populations therefore provides evidence not only for a genetic basis of dispersal but also for its, sometimes rapid, evolutionary responses. However, the genetic architecture of dispersal traits has mostly been ignored from empiricists working on the eco‐evolutionary dynamics of dispersal. This is despite the fact that the speed of evolutionary changes and the likelihood that eco‐evolutionary dynamics occur likely involve a combination of standing genetic variation, new mutations and genetic covariances among traits (Reznick &amp; Ghalambor,
