 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to the fragmentation event the mean and variance of the phenotypic distributions of dispersal probability are similar between simulations with different numbers of loci (Fig. 
  <a rid="brv12356-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#brv12356-fig-0001">1</a>). Despite this, the speed of the response to fragmentation differs among simulations and this has associated effects on the population sizes. In populations in which a large number of loci control dispersal, emigration probability evolves less quickly to low values, and there is typically a smaller reduction in population size (Fig. 
  <a rid="brv12356-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#brv12356-fig-0002">2</a>). This is because when dispersal probabilities take longer to decline, more individuals disperse and thus recolonize empty suitable patches despite the higher chance of dispersal mortality due to the presence of unsuitable habitat.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results highlight that the genetic architecture underlying dispersal, even simply the number of loci controlling dispersal traits, can have evolutionary and ecological consequences for populations. In this case, alternative monogenic and polygenic representations of the genetic architecture of dispersal led to significant differences in the rate of dispersal evolution, although the direction was the same. There is clearly much scope for future work on the effect of genetic architecture on the evolution of dispersal traits and their demographic consequences.</p>
