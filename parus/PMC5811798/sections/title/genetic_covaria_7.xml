 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic covariances among dispersal traits and between dispersal and other traits</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As discussed above, dispersal is a multidimensional process made of different components (propensity to disperse, distance and direction of movements, and settlement choice), determined by various physiological, morphological and behavioural traits and induced by multiple ecological factors (reviewed in Zera &amp; Brisson, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>). Important questions are (
  <span class="italic">i</span>) how to characterize the complexity and the genetic drivers of dispersal, (
  <span class="italic">ii</span>) whether the multiple traits determining dispersal are genetically correlated, (
  <span class="italic">iii</span>) whether they are genetically correlated to other fitness‐related traits, and (
  <span class="italic">iv</span>) whether these correlations generally result from selection or genetically based traits or from plasticity (Clobert 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0059">2009</a>; Stevens 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0351" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0351">2014</a>; Cote 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0063">2017a</a>). The answer to these questions has important repercussions for the evolution of dispersal, as genetic covariances may either facilitate or constrain evolutionary changes (Futuyma, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0120" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0120">2010</a>; Kirkpatrick, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0196" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0196">2010</a>; Duputié 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0099">2012</a>). It is therefore surprising that although phenotypic correlations between dispersal and other phenotypic traits have been studied extensively in many organisms (reviewed in Cote 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0064">2017b</a>), studies on genetic correlations or covariances are relatively scarce.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interrelationships between events at the different dispersal stages (Clobert 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0059">2009</a>) involve correlations between dispersal components. Some of these relationships are trivial, such as the emigration status intrinsically predicting the distance moved (i.e. non‐dispersing individuals moving null to short distances), and others are subtler, such as the correlation between the distance moved and the choice of settlement. Few theoretical studies incorporate these types of correlations: for example, the movement ability and the propensity to disperse may co‐vary, particularly in fragmented landscapes where the costs of transfer between habitats are high (Travis 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0372" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0372">2012</a>). Empirical studies, however, rarely measure more than one dispersal component or dispersal stage, and when they do, they rarely estimate correlations between them. Some studies focused on the transfer stage have, however, found that dispersal distance is often correlated with the direction or the linearity of movements and settlement behaviours (Selonen &amp; Hanski, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0340" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0340">2004</a>; Merckx &amp; van Dyck, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0246" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0246">2007</a>; Delgado &amp; Penteriani, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0080">2008</a>; Delgado 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0081">2010</a>). Individuals dispersing over longer distances display straighter movements directed towards other habitats, while short‐distance dispersers wander around. These relationships at the phenotypic level can result from genetic correlations between dispersal components or from plasticity, a common environmental effect on all components or a third, unknown trait covarying with both components. To our knowledge, these alternative sources of covariation have not been tested so far.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Along with covariation among traits directly relevant to the dispersal process, dispersal components also covary with various other traits that improve the likelihood and success of dispersal (Clobert 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0063">2017a</a>). These correlations, defining dispersal syndromes (Appendix I), have been well studied at the species level (e.g. Zera &amp; Brisson, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>; Stevens

  <span class="italic">,</span> and references therein), whereas information about the phenotypic structure, and occasionally about the genetic structure, at the individual level is only starting to accumulate. The most commonly observed correlation is that between dispersal and body size, body mass or derivatives (e.g. leg, wing or thorax size) in many animals (Bradford &amp; Taylor, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0042">1997</a>; Zera &amp; Denno,

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0376" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0376">2013</a>). Such relationships may arise because morphology directly affects the movement efficiency or the competitive ability of individuals, and therefore their dispersal success. Both dispersal traits and correlated morphological traits can be heritable (Thomas 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0360" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0360">1998</a>; Saastamoinen

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0212" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0212">2016</a>), and it is therefore not surprising to see that their correlations also can have a genetic basis (e.g. Roff &amp; Bradford, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0316" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0316">1998</a>; Lobón

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0331" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0331">2012</a>). However, when tested, these correlations sometimes have proven to be environmentally driven as well (Saastamoinen 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Investment in morphology and the physiological machinery that supports dispersal may co‐vary with a number of other traits and processes. Arguably the most intensively studied species with regard to the physiological and genetic underpinnings of dispersal is the wing‐dimorphic cricket 
  <span class="italic">Gryllus firmus</span>, which shows systematic differences between the long‐winged and short‐winged morphs (reviewed in Zera &amp; Harshman, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0414" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0414">2001</a>; Zera &amp; Brisson, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>). Selection studies demonstrate that wing length is associated with differences in juvenile hormone and ecdysteroid levels (Zera, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0409" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0409">2006</a>). The morphs also differ in genetically controlled lipid synthesis and triglyceride accumulation (Zera &amp; Larsen, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0415" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0415">2001</a>; Zera &amp; Zhao, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0416" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0416">2003</a>), investment in the flight apparatus, mainly flight muscle mass (Zera &amp; Denno, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0413" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0413">1997</a>; Zera &amp; Harshman, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0414" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0414">2001</a>), and respiration rate (Crnokrak &amp; Roff, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0074">2002</a>). In addition to morphology, dispersal syndromes also involve traits related to reproductive performance and hence demographic parameters (Zera &amp; Brisson, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>; Bestion, Clobert &amp; Cote,

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0408" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0408">2015</a>). Here too, some of the best examples of genetic covariances between dispersal and reproductive traits are those from wing‐dimorphic crickets 
  <span class="italic">Gryllus firmus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">G. veletis</span> (Crnokrak &amp; Roff,

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>), in which a negative genetic correlation between dispersal and traits, such as embryo viability (Evans, García‐González &amp; Marshall, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0105">2007</a>), fecundity (Roff &amp; Bradford,

  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0223" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0223">2011</a>) and ovary development (Zera &amp; Brink, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0411" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0411">2000</a>; Roff &amp; Gélinas, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0318" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0318">2003</a>) is evident. In a similar manner, in plants, genes that control plant architecture are expected to influence not only seed dispersal, but also floral presentation, ability to compete for light, or even size (Kirchoff &amp; Claßen‐Bockhoff, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0195" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0195">2013</a>). Genes associated with plant height or size are likely to be associated with overall growth rates, competitive ability, and fitness itself (Donohue, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0089">1998</a>, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0090" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0090">1999</a>; Wender 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0392" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0392">2005</a>), and genes that influence the timing of dispersal are also expected to influence the timing of flowering. Finally, few studies have tested genetic correlations between dispersal and behavioural traits or between dispersal and physiological traits. Pedigree analyses showed that exploratory behaviour is genetically correlated with movement propensity in great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> and that departure and settlement are genetically correlated with aggressiveness in western bluebirds 
  <span class="italic">Sialia mexicana</span> (Duckworth &amp; Kruuk, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0096">2009</a>; Korsten 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0201" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0201">2013</a>). In marmots 
  <span class="italic">Marmota flaviventris</span>, there is a negative genetic correlation between dispersal and time allocated to vigilance (Blumstein 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0026">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dispersal traits can therefore be genetically correlated with other traits under selection, and it is unclear whether such correlations result from joint selection on multiple traits, or from pleiotropy. Some trait combinations lead to higher dispersal success than others and are therefore likely to be under correlational selection. For example, in western bluebirds, higher aggressiveness in dispersers increases their colonization success at the range‐expanding front (Duckworth &amp; Badyaev, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0095">2007</a>). Given that selective pressures vary along environmental gradients, when scaled up towards among‐population variation, divergent environmental gradients may eventually select for specific dispersal‐related trait combinations and/or specific dispersal syndromes. Consequently, different syndromes among populations could emerge and be maintained (Clobert 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
