 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(1) Our review of the empirical literature on the genetic basis of dispersal shows that the available evidence is largely skewed to a few groups of organisms, notably insects, birds and plants. Overall, these studies show that dispersal often has a genetic basis, that it has evolutionary potential in the form of genetic variation, and that dispersal may evolve in response to natural selection, sometimes even over relatively short timescales. Dispersal, which is a complex process involving departure, transfer and settling and is the outcome of several interacting traits, appears to be polygenic, even though genes of moderate to large effect may control certain aspects of dispersal. Correlations among the multiple traits determining dispersal, and among other life‐history traits, are still relatively poorly understood, even though they might contribute to the evolution of dispersal syndromes, and may constrain dispersal from evolving to its adaptive optimum. Further, dispersal can be highly plastic and, as a result, genetic variation for dispersal plasticity can lead to environment‐dependent genetic variation for dispersal. We still lack understanding of the relative importance of plasticity

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(2) Major unanswered empirical questions regarding the genetic basis of dispersal include the degree to which dispersal traits are correlated with each other and with other traits under selection. This is especially important for a complex process such as dispersal, which is likely to be determined by diverse physiological, morphological, metabolic, and behavioural traits, each of which may be exposed to selection 
  <span class="italic">via</span> processes other than dispersal. Another arena for further empirical investigation is the environmental dependence of the genetic architecture of dispersal. This is important particularly if dispersal itself causes a change in the environment that the organism experiences. Finally, identification of specific genes underlying dispersal variation in natural populations would provide access to resolving important issues of dominance, epistasis, and allelic effects of dispersal genes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(3) Importantly, the potential roles of epigenetic mechanisms underlying variation in dispersal are almost unknown although such mechanisms can influence both the context dependency of dispersal (i.e. the intragenerational level) and the evolution of dispersal (i.e. the transgenerational level). As environmentally sensitive molecular elements causing phenotypic changes, epigenetic factors have the potential to provoke rapid responses to environmental changes. Therefore, ignoring the epigenetic architecture of dispersal can bias predictions of both its evolution and the dynamics of the response to environmental changes. Either performed in nature or under controlled conditions, future studies on the molecular bases of dispersal would be particularly useful if they include parallel investigations on the genetic and epigenetic architectures in predefined environments. This would help to unravel the interactions between the epigenetic and genetic determinants of dispersal (and its correlated traits), and also help evaluate interactions with the environmental context.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(4) Models describing the genetic basis of dispersal have remained surprisingly simple. Hence, we do not know the degree to which existing theory on dispersal evolution is robust to the limiting assumptions made about the underlying genetics, especially when considering transient and eco‐evolutionary dynamics. Further theoretical development should look at how elements of the genetic architecture of dispersal traits, such as number of loci and allelic effect size, rate of recombination and linkage disequilibrium, and non‐additive allelic effects (dominance and epistasis), will affect maintenance of additive genetic variation in dispersal traits and their potential rate of evolution. Explicitly considering genetic correlations among dispersal traits and other traits under selection may be especially productive. Addressing these gaps, and understanding the potential for rapid dispersal evolution, is particularly important in the context of non‐equilibrium scenarios such as ongoing habitat fragmentation, range expansion and shifts. Especially in cases where eco‐evolutionary feedbacks are involved, genetic architecture might also affect the ultimate evolutionary outcome in terms of evolutionarily stable dispersal strategy. Theory that combines eco‐evolutionary dynamics with elements of genetic architecture is now required to understand under what circumstances this might occur.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(5) New empirical understanding on the genetic basis of dispersal, together with novel genetically explicit theory on dispersal evolution, will enable addressing the challenge of incorporating dispersal evolution into predictive models for forecasting species' eco‐evolutionary responses to environmental changes. This will enable moving towards more realistic quantitative predictions that might ultimately inform effective species' management under ongoing environmental change.</p>
