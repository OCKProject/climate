 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dispersal is key in linking ecological and evolutionary dynamics as it connects populations both demographically and genetically (Hanski, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0152" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0152">2012</a>; Hendry, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0163" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0163">2016</a>). Variation in population densities and demography caused by dispersal feeds back on the evolutionary dynamics of the dispersal trait itself, or other life‐history or fitness‐related traits, by affecting changes in allele frequencies, the strength of density‐dependent mechanisms, the opportunity to either avoid conspecifics (e.g. Ronce, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0322" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0322">2007</a>; Kubisch 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0204" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0204">2014</a>) or to follow them in some other cases (e.g. Penteriani &amp; Delgado, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0282" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0282">2011</a>; Coppock, Gardiner &amp; Jones, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0062">2016</a>). The resulting eco‐evolutionary dynamics (also called eco‐evolutionary feedback when the effects between ecology and evolution are reciprocal; Post &amp; Palkovacs, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0296" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0296">2009</a>; Hanski, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0152" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0152">2012</a>) are characterized by rapid evolution due to strong selection, and are likely to occur, or at least to be most detectable, during environmental change or in highly spatio‐temporally variable environments (Reznick &amp; Ghalambor, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0304" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0304">2001</a>; Crespi, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0072">2004</a>; Hanski, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0151" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0151">2011</a>, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0152" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0152">2012</a>). Accordingly, rapid evolution of dispersal has been predicted and documented during range expansion or shifts and as a consequence of habitat fragmentation (see Section 
  <a rid="brv12356-sec-0003" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12356-sec-0003">II.1</a>; Hanski, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0152" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0152">2012</a>; Cheptou 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Theoretical models predict interesting eco‐evolutionary dynamics involving dispersal evolution (see also Section 
  <a rid="brv12356-sec-0003" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12356-sec-0003">II.1</a>). For example, both ‘evolutionary rescue’ determined by evolution of increased dispersal, and ‘evolutionary suicide’ determined by loss of dispersal, can be predicted for species expanding over fragmented landscapes or experiencing a sudden fragmentation event (Leimar &amp; Norberg, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0213" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0213">1997</a>; Heino &amp; Hanski, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0160" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0160">2001</a>; Gyllenberg 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0145" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0145">2002</a>; Travis 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0375" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0375">2010b</a>; Poethke 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0292" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0292">2011a</a>). The outcome will depend on factors such as the stage of expansion, the manner and rapidity of fragmentation and, importantly, the amount of genetic variation in dispersal traits. Further, models of range shifting following a shift in environmental conditions predict ‘elastic’ range margins, where the range shifts and expands due to rapid increase in dispersal during the environmental change, but then retracts due to decreased dispersal following the cease of the change (Holt, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0174" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0174">2003</a>; Kubisch, Hovestadt &amp; Poethke, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0205" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0205">2010</a>; Henry, Bocedi &amp; Travis, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0166" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0166">2013</a>). The type of environmental gradient determines the amplitude of the fluctuation in range size.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impact of the genetic architecture of dispersal traits on dispersal eco‐evolutionary dynamics has mostly been ignored. An exception is the model by Kubisch 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0204" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0204">2014</a>) which showed that ploidy affects dispersal evolution, and hence rate of range expansion, depending on the type of environmental gradient over which expansion occurs. While clonal species expanded faster in shallow gradients relative to sexually reproducing species, they expanded more slowly over steeper gradients. Whether or not genetic architecture might affect evolutionary equilibria, it surely affects the rate of evolution (see Section 
  <a rid="brv12356-sec-0005" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12356-sec-0005">II.3</a>) which is key for eco‐evolutionary dynamics to occur. For example, rapid evolutionary changes likely involve a combination of standing genetic variation and new mutations (Hendry, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0162" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0162">2013</a>), with the balance between the two determining not only the speed of evolutionary changes, but also the likelihood that eco‐evolutionary dynamics will occur (Becks 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0014">2010</a>). For example, North 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0271" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0271">2011</a>) showed that high mutation rates allowed maintenance of dispersal polymorphisms in fragmented landscapes with high patch turnover rate. In turn, the occurrence or not of eco‐evolutionary feedbacks might affect the amount of adaptive genetic variation that is maintained (Becks 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0014">2010</a>; Hanski, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0152" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0152">2012</a>). Hence, the underlying genetic architecture determining maintenance of genetic variation prior to changes, as well as mutation rate and magnitude, will likely affect dispersal eco‐evolutionary dynamics (R. C. Henry, G. Bocedi &amp; J. M. J. Travis, in preparation). How much additive genetic variation is generally present within a population is still much debated and indeed this might be idiosyncratic to the population, its evolutionary history and spatial location (e.g. marginal 
  <span class="italic">versus</span> core habitats; bottlenecks) (Kawecki, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0189" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0189">2008</a>; Hanski, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0152" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0152">2012</a>; Hendry, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0162" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0162">2013</a>). However, even in cases where populations seem to be genetically depauperate, rapid evolution (including of dispersal) has been observed (e.g. Rollins 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0321" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0321">2015</a>). The genetic mechanisms behind this are unknown although heritable epigenetic variation might be a potential one (Bonduriansky &amp; Day, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0030">2009</a>; Rollins 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0321" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0321">2015</a>; Legrand 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0211" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0211">2017</a>). Further genetic variation can be maintained by non‐additive genetic effects (dominance and epistasis) and be converted to additive genetic variation following a bottleneck (Roff &amp; Emerson, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0317" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0317">2006</a>). Finally, genetic covariances among traits might either favour or hinder rapid evolutionary responses (Reznick &amp; Ghalambor, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0304" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0304">2001</a>; Etterson, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0104">2004</a>; Hendry, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0162" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0162">2013</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While a few theoretical studies have begun to consider explicit genetic architecture in modelling the eco‐evolution of dispersal, models developed and parameterized for addressing questions related to particular species in particular environments remain even scarcer. A recent exception is Hanski 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0155" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0155">2017</a>), who used a metapopulation model to predict the distribution of the Glanville fritillary butterfly over 22 years across the heterogeneous landscape of the Åland islands SW Finland. Of the 125 population networks 33 were above the extinction threshold for long‐term persistence. Spatial configuration and habitat area predicted metapopulation size and persistence, but interestingly in the 33 networks above the extinction threshold, allelic variation in SNPs of the 
  <span class="italic">Pgi</span> gene explained ∼30% of variation in metapopulation size. Based on previous knowledge (see Section 
  <a rid="brv12356-sec-0004" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12356-sec-0004">II.2</a>), this indicates that individuals with specific 
  <span class="italic">Pgi</span> genotypes that are more dispersive increase colonization rate and decrease extinction rate of these population networks (Hanski 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0155" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0155">2017</a>). Consistently, three viable networks that were extinct for at least 5 years had lower frequency of the dispersive genotype than the 27 networks that persisted for the full 22 years (Hanski 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0155" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0155">2017</a>).
