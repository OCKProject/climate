 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE GENETIC BASIS OF DISPERSAL</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We carried out an extensive literature search using the 
  <span class="italic">Web of Science</span> (WOS) database (see online Appendix 
  <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>: Methods). We targeted not only dispersal traits 
  <span class="italic">sensu stricto</span> (such as distance covered or propensity to leave a patch), but also dispersal‐related traits such as locomotory capacity or wing morphology that may serve as proxies for dispersal. We selected papers from the search results on the criteria that the study dealt strictly with (
  <span class="italic">i</span>) assessing the existence of the genetic basis/variation of dispersal traits, or (
  <span class="italic">ii</span>) estimating the heritability values of dispersal and related traits, or (
  <span class="italic">iii</span>) determining their genetic architecture. We moreover reviewed studies on evolutionary responses of dispersal traits to environmental changes or on population differentiation in dispersal. We also collected information on whether dispersal traits are correlated with each other or with other traits, whether due to chromosomal linkage or pleiotropy (Appendix I), with the aim to determine whether dispersal can be a direct target of natural selection, whether it can evolve 
  <span class="italic">via</span> selection on correlated traits, or both.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most straightforward approach to investigating the genetic basis of phenotypes is to measure their heritability (
   <span class="italic">h</span>
   <span class="sup">
    <span class="italic">2</span>
   </span>; Appendix I). In animals, heritability of dispersal‐related traits has been estimated in diverse taxa, from aquatic invertebrates to mammals (see online Table 
   <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). However, as pointed out in previous reviews of dispersal (e.g. Zera &amp; Brisson, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>; Dingle, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0085">2014</a>), the literature on heritability estimates remains somewhat unbalanced, with most studies focusing on birds and insects. For mammals, fish, amphibians and reptiles, few studies are available, and information on invertebrates other than insects was almost absent. Heritability estimates of dispersal‐related traits in the two best‐represented animal taxa (birds and insects) range from 0 to 1, with average values of 0.35 for both. Most studies – with the exception of those on birds – did not quantify dispersal distance or propensity 
   <span class="italic">per se</span> but used proxies related to movement ability during the transfer stage of dispersal, such as flight capacity in insects, and speed or locomotion performance in fish and reptiles (e.g. Garland, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0125" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0125">1990</a>; Robertson

   <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). Morphological traits are also often used as proxies of dispersal. Examples of such traits in insects include thorax ratio, wing shape, and wing muscle strength (e.g. Van Dyck, Matthysen &amp; Wiklund,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Very few animal studies have estimated the heritability of traits related to stages of dispersal other than transfer. A notable exception is pre‐dispersal behaviour in arachnid species (Bonte, Bossuyt &amp; Lens,

   <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). Most other estimates of heritability that are related to departure or settlement stages are from bird species, with 
   <span class="italic">h</span>
   <span class="sup">
    <span class="italic">2</span>
   </span> reported for the propensity to leave the natal area, distance moved to the breeding site, and/or habitat choice in the settlement phase. We found 11 examples in bird species with estimates of 
   <span class="italic">h</span>
   <span class="sup">
    <span class="italic">2</span>
   </span> significantly greater than zero in at least one of these traits, and five in which 
   <span class="italic">h</span>

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0201" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0201">2013</a>). Few studies have published heritability estimates for traits related to the settlement phase of dispersal (see online Table 
   <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). Most that do pertain to conspecific attraction (Møller,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In plants, significant among‐family variance and heritability have been documented in a number of dispersal‐related traits, mostly in annual herbs and crop species (see online Table 
   <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). Some species of the Brassicaceae family, such as the rapeseed (
   <span class="italic">Brassica napus</span>) show high levels of heritability in pod shatter resistance that varied from 
   <span class="italic">h</span>
   <span class="sup">

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0222" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0222">2016</a>). Pod shatter resistance is a trait under strong selection in cereal crops, such as rice (

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0199" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0199">2006</a>) and soybean (

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0088">2014</a>) because it prevents seed dispersal and, therefore, the loss of grains in terms of yield. High heritability values were also recorded for a diverse array of traits in the spikelets of a grass species 
   <span class="italic">Brachypodium hybridum</span> (see online Table 
   <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). On average these traits showed

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0179" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0179">2001</a>). The narrow‐sense heritability of dispersal‐related traits measured in the panicle of the canary grass (
   <span class="italic">Phalaris aquatic</span>), an invasive species in native grassland across California, show values above 
   <span class="italic">h</span>

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0193" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0193">2003</a>). Another example of a passively dispersed species shows that heritability is environment‐dependent. For example, in 
   <span class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>, Donohue 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0092">2005</a>) quantified broad‐sense heritability estimates of fruit and plant architectural traits associated with dispersal, based on genetic differences among ecotypes. The values ranged from

   <span class="sup">
    <span class="italic">2</span>
   </span> = 0 to 0.7, depending on the trait and the environment in which the trait was measured. The heritability of aspects of seed dispersal patterns

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0092">2005</a>), and were strongly dependent on how dispersal‐related traits of maternal plants responded to density (Wender, Polisetty &amp; Donohue, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0392" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0392">2005</a>). Furthermore, some studies that investigate seed dispersal by tropical vertebrates have shown moderate values of broad‐sense heritability in natural populations. Wheelwright (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What have we learned from these studies? While there are many examples of heritability estimates for putative proxies of dispersal and movement ability in general, heritability estimates for specific traits involved in the entire process of dispersal, such as propensity to leave the natal patch or distance travelled between sites, are very rare and would be important to target for future studies. Birds are the most broadly studied taxon in this regard, as the heritability of dispersal has been studied in multiple species in free‐living conditions. These studies are based on marked individuals of known relatedness, in one case combined with 
   <span class="italic">in situ</span> cross‐fostering (Roche 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0308" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0308">2011</a>). Until recently most studies were based on parent–offspring or sibling similarities, but several analyses have now been published based on Animal Models (Appendix I) that make use of complete pedigree information (Duckworth &amp; Kruuk, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0096">2009</a>; Korsten 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0200" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0200">2010</a>; Charmantier

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0086">2012</a>). Parent–offspring and sib–sib analyses typically yield higher heritability estimates than Animal Models (McCleery 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0086">2012</a>), due to maternal and common environment effects (van Noordwijk 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0269" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0269">2006</a>; Zera &amp; Brisson, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>). Further, heritability estimates may also be inflated by biases in detectability due to limited study areas (van Noordwijk, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0270" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0270">1984</a>; Doligez &amp; Pärt, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0087">2008</a>) and to more numerous social interactions among siblings synchronizing their movements (Matthysen, Van de Casteele &amp; Adriaensen, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0237" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0237">2005</a>; Cote

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0064">2017b</a>). As a whole, heritability studies suggest that variation in dispersal can arise as a result of additive genetic variation, but also that in many cases much of the phenotypic variation is explained by environmental variation, including transgenerational effects (Appendix I). Recent work, for instance, has demonstrated strong epigenetic signals in dispersal propensity (van Petegem 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0287" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0287">2015</a>). Furthermore, similarity in dispersal phenotypes among related individuals may be caused by (maternally transmitted) symbionts or parasites (Goodacre 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic architecture of dispersal</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A fundamental question regarding the evolution of any trait is whether the trait's heritable variation arises from a single gene, a few genes (each of large effect, oligogenic), or many genes (each of very small effect, polygenic; Appendix I) (Mackay, Stone &amp; Ayroles,

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0393" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0393">2012</a>]. One of the first genes identified to influence both larval and adult locomotion behaviour was the foraging gene (Pereira &amp; Sokolowski, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0283" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0283">1993</a>), where larvae with the dominant ‘rover’ allele (

   <span class="sup">R</span>) move further than individuals homozygous for the ‘sitter’ allele (
   <span class="italic">for</span>
   <span class="sup">S</span>) in the presence of food (Edelsparre 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0102">2014</a>). Importantly, adult dispersal distance in the field is also higher for individuals with the 
   <span class="italic">for</span>
   <span class="sup">R</span> allele (Edelsparre 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0102">2014</a>). In both cases, detailed functional genomic validation has demonstrated that these effects arise from variation in expression of the gene itself. A transcriptome study of long‐wing and short‐wing artificially selected lines of the cricket 
   <span class="italic">Gryllus firmus</span> identified a number of large‐magnitude differences in expression of genes that function in flight and reproduction (Nanoth Vellichirammal 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0410" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0410">2016</a>). These data on genetic covariances in expression of genes related to flight and reproduction are also relevant to the discussion of genetic correlations (see Section 
   <a rid="brv12356-sec-0007" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12356-sec-0007">II.5</a>). By developing a state‐of‐the‐art phenotyping platform, a further recent study of the cotton bollworm 
   <span class="italic">Helicoverpa armigera</span> showed that a suite of expressed candidate genes linked to physiological adaptations are required for long‐distance flight, allowing this insect to respond to deteriorating conditions (Jones

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indications of oligogenic architectures related to dispersal have also been uncovered in other organisms. Allelic variation in the gene responsible for the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All studies examining the genetic basis of dispersal in natural populations in animals have so far either used a candidate gene approach (e.g. the 
   <span class="italic">Pgi</span> studies described above) or a limited number of markers (all other studies than the 
   <span class="italic">Pgi</span> studies described above). The low resolution of marker densities, often in combination with a small number of genotyped individuals, means that the power to detect genetic variants associated with dispersal is modest at best. One way to circumvent such issues is to study dispersal in model systems, for instance using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (Mackay 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0229" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0229">2012</a>), which consists of more than 200 fully sequenced inbred lines derived from North Carolina (Mackay 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0229" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0229">2012</a>), and thus offers genomic tools for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits with high precision and statistical power. Jordan 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0186" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0186">2012</a>) investigated the genomic regions affecting locomotion variation across 167 lines of 
   <span class="italic">D. melanogaster</span>. Using nearly 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to explain inter‐line variation in locomotion, they found 220 SNPs (Appendix I) in 192 genes associated with this phenotype. Of these, 12 SNPs explained about 60% of the variation observed in both sexes. Importantly, they found a negative relationship between the effect size of individual SNPs and their frequency in the sample as a whole, indicating that rare alleles had the largest effects. Similar results appear to be emerging from a recent study in the 
   <span class="italic">M. cinxia</span> butterfly's metapopulation (Fountain 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0108">2016</a>). In this study, individual butterflies were genotyped for 222 SNPs across the genome, including SNPs from candidate genes and neutral regions. Fifteen SNP loci, mostly associated with flight, changed in frequency in a non‐random way in response to habitat fragmentation (Fountain 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0108">2016</a>). These loci were identified in comparisons of new 
   <span class="italic">versus</span> old populations and therefore are likely enriched in rare alleles with respect to the entire metapopulation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In plants, the best‐studied examples of genes involved in dispersal come from domesticated species and model genetic organisms. In domesticated species, research has focused on dispersal features such as seed shattering in cereals (Konishi 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0199" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0199">2006</a>), and fruit/pod shattering (dehiscence) of multi‐seeded fruits such as pods in legumes and siliques in the mustard family, Brassicaceae (Raman 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0301" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0301">2014</a>) or on the proportion of central achenes produced per capitulum of some species of the Asteraceae family (Imbert, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0179" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0179">2001</a>). Depending on the species and population studied, genetic analysis of pod shattering has documented between one and 13 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) or causative loci associated with this trait (Konishi 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0219" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0219">2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the above examples, where the small number of loci associated with dispersal variation suggests an oligogenic genetic architecture, numerous studies (outside the field of dispersal) indicate that quantitative traits generally arise 
   <span class="italic">via</span> a polygenic architecture (Mackay 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0229" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0229">2012</a>; Husby 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0178" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0178">2015</a>; Santure 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0333" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0333">2015</a>). While the relatively few examples of genes with large effect size could arise from underpowered QTL or GWA studies, it could also indicate the absence of such loci. Indeed, it has been argued that publishing bias is responsible for inflating the frequency of known oligogenic examples relative to their true general relevance for evolution in the wild (Rockman, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0309" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0309">2012</a>). The multi‐factorial nature of dispersal is frequently manifested as quantitative phenotypic variation in dispersal and in traits that contribute to dispersal. On the whole, there is good evidence for genetic variation in dispersal in natural populations, and evidence from other complex life‐history traits suggests that this variation is seldom caused by single genes of large effect. Instead, multiple loci probably combine to affect dispersal. Further studies, using genome‐wide approaches, are required to confirm this hypothesis.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Why is knowing the number of genes contributing to dispersal variation relevant? One reason is that it may influence patterns of convergent evolution. With a small number of genes involved in trait expression, the same genes may evolve in multiple taxa to create similar phenotypes. For example, orthologues of a number of candidate genes identified in 
   <span class="italic">D. melanogaster</span> also appear to regulate dispersal in other insects (Wheat, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0393" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0393">2012</a>). In plants, orthologues of a major gene that controls pod shattering INDEHISCENT (IND), are expressed in diverse species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae); in 
   <span class="italic">Lepidium campestre</span>, which has dehiscent fruits, expression patterns of the dehiscence‐pathway genes were similar to that in 
   <span class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> (Lenser &amp; Theißen, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0214" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0214">2013</a>). Homologues of IND have been found even outside of the Brassicaceae (Gioia 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0131" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0131">2013</a>). Another reason is that deciphering the genetic architecture of dispersal may provide information on the speed at which this phenotype may evolve in response to environmental changes (Hoffmann &amp; Willi, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0172" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0172">2008</a>). For example, the existence of complex epistatic interactions (Appendix I) between genes involved in quantitative traits can decrease the amount of genetic variation at these genes compared to an additive architecture (Hansen, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0149" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0149">2006</a>). This means that a complex epistatic architecture of dispersal may limit its evolutionary potential in the context of environmental changes because of a limited pool of available genetic variants on which selection can act.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Artificial selection and experimental evolution of dispersal</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides the approaches detailed above that characterize genetic variation for dispersal, indirect evidence for the genetic basis of dispersal can be provided through studies that elicit evolutionary responses directly by imposing selection on dispersal phenotypes. Experimental evolution and artificial selection can be used to estimate heritability (e.g. Jordan 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0190" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0190">2012</a>), but they can also directly demonstrate the evolutionary potential of a trait. Experimental evolution allows evolutionary changes of dispersal in experimental populations subjected to specific conditions while artificial selection exerts selection on dispersal traits alone by breeding partners chosen for their dispersal phenotype (Zera &amp; Brisson, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>). This type of approach is hence very powerful but its application is generally limited to species that can easily be reared in the laboratory.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Part of the current knowledge of the evolutionary potential of dispersal comes from artificial selection on domesticated species, particularly plants, and on model micro‐organisms. Decreased seed dispersal has been subject to strong artificial selection in diverse domesticated plant species (Li &amp; Gill,

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0228" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0228">2015</a>), and reversion to dispersing forms has been documented in naturalized crop species (De Wet &amp; Harlan, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0084">1975</a>). Based on genetic analyses of domestication traits, Fuller &amp; Allaby (
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0119" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0119">2009</a>) inferred that domestication first imposed selection on seed size and germination even before agriculture was widely practiced, and as crops became cultivated, selection for lack of dispersal followed. Similarly in bacteria, experimental evolution and selection experiments show that bacterial motility, as well as sporulation, are evolvable traits (Girgis

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results of selection experiments on dispersal traits are however not always straightforward, as exemplified by the case of the spider mite 
   <span class="italic">Tetranychus urticae</span>. In this species, aerial dispersal was initially found to be highly heritable in a narrow sense (Li &amp; Margolies, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0217" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0217">1993</a>, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0218" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0218">1994</a>) but recently, this trait has been discovered to be driven by epigenetic control (van Petegem 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0288" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0288">2016</a>). Yano &amp; Takafuji (
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0403" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0403">2002</a>) reported a response to selection, while Tien, Sabelis &amp; Egas (
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0363" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0363">2011</a>) did not detect any response for this trait. A third trait, dispersal distance, was not amenable to selection due to substantial intergenerational plasticity (Bitume 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0023">2011</a>, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0022">2015</a>). Experimental landscapes that differed in the spatial correlation of patch extinctions were found to cause evolution of dispersal in the spider mite, with increased spatial correlation selecting for less emigration (departure) but more long‐distance dispersal (Fronhofer 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0118">2014</a>). Further work using experimental metapopulations showed that increased spatial variation in habitat availability reduced dispersal rates in terms of departure from patches (De Roissart, Wang &amp; Bonte, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0082">2015</a>; De Roissart

Although the various traits involved in dispersal contrasted in their response to selection, experimental evolution in the spider mite has resulted in some responses to selection, demonstrating both a genetic basis of dispersal and existing variation for dispersal within sampled populations.

   <a rid="brv12356-sec-0005" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12356-sec-0005">II.3</a> documented the evolvability of dispersal, here we address an extension to that concept, focusing on the evolution of dispersal differences among populations, and its role in linking ecological and evolutionary dynamics. It is notable, however, that differences between populations in any trait, even if in accordance with predictions, are not in itself evidence for genetic variation, and should always be accompanied by common‐garden breeding trials.

Individuals from range margins might be predicted to evolve a higher dispersal propensity than core populations, and newly founded populations are likely to comprise more dispersive individuals than old populations in a metapopulation. In fact, both the evolution of increased or decreased dispersal can be predicted for species expanding over fragmented landscapes or experiencing a sudden fragmentation event (Leimar &amp; Norberg,

   <span class="italic">Mycelis muralis</span> populations collected from fragmented landscapes had propagules with a lower terminal velocity (a proxy of dispersal ability), than those in non‐fragmented landscapes (Riba

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0305" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0305">2009</a>). Habitat fragmentation, on the other hand, may select for adaptations to improve transfer and settlement through, for example, movement and navigation abilities and, in highly fragmented landscapes, for higher emigration rates (Olivieri &amp; Gouyon,

Whether dispersal will increase or decrease in response to habitat fragmentation will depend on factors such as the proportion of empty habitats to colonize, the degree of environmental heterogeneity and, importantly, the amount of genetic variation in dispersal traits (Cheptou

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparisons of individuals from expanding range fronts with those from core populations also provide interesting insights about eco‐evolutionary dynamics (Appendix I) involved in dispersal evolution. For example, in northern Australia, research on the invasive cane toad

Common‐garden breeding trials have suggested a genetic basis to dispersal rate, as toads with parents from the range front have higher dispersal rates than toads with parents from the core populations (Phillips, Brown &amp; Shine, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0289" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0289">2010</a>). A number of candidate genes linked to dispersal in cane toads have been identified recently (Rollins, Richardson &amp; Shine,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, between‐population differentiation in dispersal may reflect a history of divergent selection on dispersal, imposed for example by habitat fragmentation or range expansions. Divergence among natural populations therefore provides evidence not only for a genetic basis of dispersal but also for its, sometimes rapid, evolutionary responses. However, the genetic architecture of dispersal traits has mostly been ignored from empiricists working on the eco‐evolutionary dynamics of dispersal. This is despite the fact that the speed of evolutionary changes and the likelihood that eco‐evolutionary dynamics occur likely involve a combination of standing genetic variation, new mutations and genetic covariances among traits (Reznick &amp; Ghalambor,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As discussed above, dispersal is a multidimensional process made of different components (propensity to disperse, distance and direction of movements, and settlement choice), determined by various physiological, morphological and behavioural traits and induced by multiple ecological factors (reviewed in Zera &amp; Brisson, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>). Important questions are (
   <span class="italic">i</span>) how to characterize the complexity and the genetic drivers of dispersal, (
   <span class="italic">ii</span>) whether the multiple traits determining dispersal are genetically correlated, (
   <span class="italic">iii</span>) whether they are genetically correlated to other fitness‐related traits, and (
   <span class="italic">iv</span>) whether these correlations generally result from selection or genetically based traits or from plasticity (Clobert 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0063">2017a</a>). The answer to these questions has important repercussions for the evolution of dispersal, as genetic covariances may either facilitate or constrain evolutionary changes (Futuyma, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0120" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0120">2010</a>; Kirkpatrick,

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0099">2012</a>). It is therefore surprising that although phenotypic correlations between dispersal and other phenotypic traits have been studied extensively in many organisms (reviewed in Cote 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0064">2017b</a>), studies on genetic correlations or covariances are relatively scarce.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interrelationships between events at the different dispersal stages (Clobert 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0059">2009</a>) involve correlations between dispersal components. Some of these relationships are trivial, such as the emigration status intrinsically predicting the distance moved (i.e. non‐dispersing individuals moving null to short distances), and others are subtler, such as the correlation between the distance moved and the choice of settlement. Few theoretical studies incorporate these types of correlations: for example, the movement ability and the propensity to disperse may co‐vary, particularly in fragmented landscapes where the costs of transfer between habitats are high (Travis 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0372" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0372">2012</a>). Empirical studies, however, rarely measure more than one dispersal component or dispersal stage, and when they do, they rarely estimate correlations between them. Some studies focused on the transfer stage have, however, found that dispersal distance is often correlated with the direction or the linearity of movements and settlement behaviours (Selonen &amp; Hanski, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0340" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0340">2004</a>; Merckx &amp; van Dyck,

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0081">2010</a>). Individuals dispersing over longer distances display straighter movements directed towards other habitats, while short‐distance dispersers wander around. These relationships at the phenotypic level can result from genetic correlations between dispersal components or from plasticity, a common environmental effect on all components or a third, unknown trait covarying with both components. To our knowledge, these alternative sources of covariation have not been tested so far.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Along with covariation among traits directly relevant to the dispersal process, dispersal components also covary with various other traits that improve the likelihood and success of dispersal (Clobert

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Investment in morphology and the physiological machinery that supports dispersal may co‐vary with a number of other traits and processes. Arguably the most intensively studied species with regard to the physiological and genetic underpinnings of dispersal is the wing‐dimorphic cricket 
   <span class="italic">Gryllus firmus</span>, which shows systematic differences between the long‐winged and short‐winged morphs (reviewed in Zera &amp; Harshman,

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>). Selection studies demonstrate that wing length is associated with differences in juvenile hormone and ecdysteroid levels (Zera, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0409" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0409">2006</a>). The morphs also differ in genetically controlled lipid synthesis and triglyceride accumulation (Zera &amp; Larsen,

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0074">2002</a>). In addition to morphology, dispersal syndromes also involve traits related to reproductive performance and hence demographic parameters (Zera &amp; Brisson,

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0318" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0318">2003</a>) is evident. In a similar manner, in plants, genes that control plant architecture are expected to influence not only seed dispersal, but also floral presentation, ability to compete for light, or even size (Kirchoff &amp; Claßen‐Bockhoff, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0195" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0195">2013</a>). Genes associated with plant height or size are likely to be associated with overall growth rates, competitive ability, and fitness itself (Donohue, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0089">1998</a>,

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0392" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0392">2005</a>), and genes that influence the timing of dispersal are also expected to influence the timing of flowering. Finally, few studies have tested genetic correlations between dispersal and behavioural traits or between dispersal and physiological traits. Pedigree analyses showed that exploratory behaviour is genetically correlated with movement propensity in great tits 
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span> and that departure and settlement are genetically correlated with aggressiveness in western bluebirds 
   <span class="italic">Sialia mexicana</span> (Duckworth &amp; Kruuk,

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0201" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0201">2013</a>). In marmots 
   <span class="italic">Marmota flaviventris</span>, there is a negative genetic correlation between dispersal and time allocated to vigilance (Blumstein 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0026">2010</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dispersal traits can therefore be genetically correlated with other traits under selection, and it is unclear whether such correlations result from joint selection on multiple traits, or from pleiotropy. Some trait combinations lead to higher dispersal success than others and are therefore likely to be under correlational selection. For example, in western bluebirds, higher aggressiveness in dispersers increases their colonization success at the range‐expanding front (Duckworth &amp; Badyaev, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0095">2007</a>). Given that selective pressures vary along environmental gradients, when scaled up towards among‐population variation, divergent environmental gradients may eventually select for specific dispersal‐related trait combinations and/or specific dispersal syndromes. Consequently, different syndromes among populations could emerge and be maintained (Clobert

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Active dispersers are known to adjust their dispersal decisions according to the environmental conditions they encounter at each of the three dispersal stages (i.e. context‐dependent dispersal or conditional dispersal; Clobert 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0059">2009</a>). Similarly, passive dispersal can be impacted by the environment indirectly – such as temperature effects on plant height and thus dispersal distance (Zhang, Jongejans &amp; Shea, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0417" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0417">2011</a>) – or directly, such as changes in ocean currents transporting plankton (McManus &amp; Woodson, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0243" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0243">2012</a>). At the molecular level, the associations between certain candidate genes and dispersal have also been shown to depend on environmental conditions. Dispersal phenotypes therefore result from the combination of genetic (G) and environmental (E) effects, and genotype–environment (G × E) interactions. For instance, the associations between the 
   <span class="italic">Pgi</span> gene and flight metabolic rate or other traits (see Section 
   <a rid="brv12356-sec-0004" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12356-sec-0004">II.2</a>) depend on thermal conditions in several butterfly species (Karl &amp; Fischer,

   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0025">2012</a>). Similarly, when 
   <span class="italic">D. melanogaster</span> larvae are reared under low‐nutrient conditions, adults with 
   <span class="italic">for</span>
   <span class="sup">S</span> alleles exhibit more exploratory behaviour and a lower reproductive output than 
   <span class="italic">for</span>
   <span class="sup">R</span> individuals, the opposite association than when reared under high‐nutrient conditions (Burns 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0047">2012</a>). Studies of the migratory African armyworm, 
   <span class="italic">Spodoptera exempta</span>, are good examples of the existence of G × E interaction (Gatehouse, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0126" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0126">1989</a>, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0127" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0127">1997</a>). Selection experiments of this species show that only individuals raised in the laboratory under high density are selected to fly long distances. Otherwise, individuals showed a short flight duration. The existence of significant G × E interactions would indicate that genetic variation underlies such plasticity, and the potential for selection to act on conditional dispersal (e.g. Venable,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While evidence of conditional dispersal is substantial, quantitative studies on the genetic component of such plasticity are still relatively rare. Pennekamp 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0281" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0281">2014</a>) quantified the contribution of G, E, and G × E to this variable for 44 different genotypes from three population densities in the ciliate 
   <span class="italic">Tetrahymena thermophila</span>. They found that 43% of the variance in dispersal propensity was explained by G, 13% by E and 2% by G × E, with reaction norms (Appendix I) to density varying among genotypes from negative to positive density dependencies (see also Fronhofer, Kropf &amp; Altermatt, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0114" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0114">2015a</a>). A recent study showed that this significant G × E interaction could be explained by other traits like cooperation and result in the variation of dispersal syndromes along a density gradient (Jacob 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0182" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0182">2016</a>). In the spider 
   <span class="italic">Erigone atra</span>, temperatures during development affected both long‐ and short dispersal strategies (Bonte 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0036">2008</a>). Using parent–offspring regressions, Bonte 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0038">2003</a>) found that 16 and 13% of the phenotypic variation in pre‐dispersal behaviour in response to multiple stressors could be attributed to genotypic and genotype × environment interactions, respectively. Both studies thus point to the existence of substantial genetic variation in dispersal reaction norms for long‐distance dispersal strategies, but not for more routine (short‐distance) behaviours. In another study using saltmarsh‐inhabiting wolf spiders 
   <span class="italic">Pardosa purbeckensis</span>, population‐specific reaction norms relative to wind conditions were found to be adaptive relative to putative costs of transfer. Genetic variation in the reaction norms declined significantly with habitat and thus population size (Bonte 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0031">2007</a>). Similarly, in the plant 
   <span class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>, significant heritability was detected for seed dispersal patterns, but the magnitude of heritability depended on the density at which the plants were grown (Donohue 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0092">2005</a>). Since density is, in part, determined by seed dispersal patterns, this suggests that the evolutionary potential (expression of genetic variation) of dispersal could depend on the level of dispersal itself. Hence, evolutionary or plastic changes in dispersal, which determine post‐dispersal density, could either mask or release further genetic variation for dispersal, depending on specific patterns of genotype–environment interaction (Donohue, 
   <a rid="brv12356-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0091">2005</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importantly, the environmental conditions that influence dispersal can be experienced by the individual itself either during its development or during the adult stage, but also by its parents (so‐called parental or transgenerational effects; e.g. Sinervo

When plasticity occurs through maternal effects, it might be difficult to tease apart environmental from genotype × environment effects. This is because maternal genes and broad‐sense epigenetic factors (including hormonal conditions or endosymbionts) are confounded, and maternal environmental conditions can select simultaneously for different genotypes through selective embryo mortality (Duong
