 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most straightforward approach to investigating the genetic basis of phenotypes is to measure their heritability (
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span>; Appendix I). In animals, heritability of dispersal‐related traits has been estimated in diverse taxa, from aquatic invertebrates to mammals (see online Table 
  <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). However, as pointed out in previous reviews of dispersal (e.g. Zera &amp; Brisson, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>; Dingle, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0085">2014</a>), the literature on heritability estimates remains somewhat unbalanced, with most studies focusing on birds and insects. For mammals, fish, amphibians and reptiles, few studies are available, and information on invertebrates other than insects was almost absent. Heritability estimates of dispersal‐related traits in the two best‐represented animal taxa (birds and insects) range from 0 to 1, with average values of 0.35 for both. Most studies – with the exception of those on birds – did not quantify dispersal distance or propensity 
  <span class="italic">per se</span> but used proxies related to movement ability during the transfer stage of dispersal, such as flight capacity in insects, and speed or locomotion performance in fish and reptiles (e.g. Garland, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0125" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0125">1990</a>; Robertson 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0307" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0307">2002</a>; Zera &amp; Brisson, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>; Drangsholt, Damsgard &amp; Olesen, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0093">2014</a>; Mattila &amp; Hanski, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0239" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0239">2014</a>; see online Table 
  <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). Morphological traits are also often used as proxies of dispersal. Examples of such traits in insects include thorax ratio, wing shape, and wing muscle strength (e.g. Van Dyck, Matthysen &amp; Wiklund, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0382" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0382">1998</a>; Roff &amp; Bradford,

  <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Very few animal studies have estimated the heritability of traits related to stages of dispersal other than transfer. A notable exception is pre‐dispersal behaviour in arachnid species (Bonte, Bossuyt &amp; Lens, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0031">2007</a>; Nachappa 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0260" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0260">2010</a>; see online Table 
  <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). Most other estimates of heritability that are related to departure or settlement stages are from bird species, with 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> reported for the propensity to leave the natal area, distance moved to the breeding site, and/or habitat choice in the settlement phase. We found 11 examples in bird species with estimates of 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> significantly greater than zero in at least one of these traits, and five in which 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> was reported to be non‐significant (see online Table 
  <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). Examples of very high estimates are 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0.95 for propensity to leave the natal population in western bluebirds, 
  <span class="italic">Sialia mexicana</span>, based on an Animal Model analysis (Duckworth &amp; Kruuk, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0096">2009</a>), and 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0.86 for natal dispersal estimated from mother–daughter regression in the wandering albatross, 
  <span class="italic">Diomedea exulans</span> (Charmantier 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0053">2011</a>). Other studies report modest heritabilities, such as 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0.15 for dispersal distance in great tits, 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (Korsten 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0201" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0201">2013</a>). Few studies have published heritability estimates for traits related to the settlement phase of dispersal (see online Table 
  <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). Most that do pertain to conspecific attraction (Møller, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0249" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0249">2002</a>; Serrano &amp; Tella, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0341" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0341">2007</a>; Roche, Brown &amp; Brown, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0308" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0308">2011</a>), and one pertains to heterospecific attraction (Wheelwright, Lawler &amp; Weinstein, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0398" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0398">1997</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In plants, significant among‐family variance and heritability have been documented in a number of dispersal‐related traits, mostly in annual herbs and crop species (see online Table 
  <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). Some species of the Brassicaceae family, such as the rapeseed (
  <span class="italic">Brassica napus</span>) show high levels of heritability in pod shatter resistance that varied from 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0.85 to 0.92 (Liu 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0222" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0222">2016</a>). Pod shatter resistance is a trait under strong selection in cereal crops, such as rice (
  <span class="italic">Oryza sativa</span>) (Konishi 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0199" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0199">2006</a>) and soybean (
  <span class="italic">Glycine max</span> (L.) 
  <span class="italic">Merr</span>.) (Dong 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0088">2014</a>) because it prevents seed dispersal and, therefore, the loss of grains in terms of yield. High heritability values were also recorded for a diverse array of traits in the spikelets of a grass species 
  <span class="italic">Brachypodium hybridum</span> (see online Table 
  <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>). On average these traits showed 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0.54, with values ranging from 0.86 (average number of seeds per spikelet) to 0 (average length of inflorescence) (Neji 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0262" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0262">2015</a>). The heritability of dispersal‐related traits in wild species has been scarcely documented, but studies show that broad‐sense heritability of achene and capitulum traits range from 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0.4 to 0.8 in 
  <span class="italic">Heterosperma pinnatum</span> (Venable &amp; Burquez, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0384" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0384">1989</a>) and that the narrow‐sense heritability of the proportion of achenes that disperse in 
  <span class="italic">Crepis sancta</span> is greater than 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0.2 (Imbert, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0179" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0179">2001</a>). The narrow‐sense heritability of dispersal‐related traits measured in the panicle of the canary grass (
  <span class="italic">Phalaris aquatic</span>), an invasive species in native grassland across California, show values above 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0.5 (Kelman &amp; Culvenor, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0193" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0193">2003</a>). Another example of a passively dispersed species shows that heritability is environment‐dependent. For example, in 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>, Donohue 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0092">2005</a>) quantified broad‐sense heritability estimates of fruit and plant architectural traits associated with dispersal, based on genetic differences among ecotypes. The values ranged from 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0 to 0.7, depending on the trait and the environment in which the trait was measured. The heritability of aspects of seed dispersal patterns 
  <span class="italic">per se</span> under controlled conditions ranged from 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0.01 to 0.4 (Donohue 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0092">2005</a>), and were strongly dependent on how dispersal‐related traits of maternal plants responded to density (Wender, Polisetty &amp; Donohue, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0392" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0392">2005</a>). Furthermore, some studies that investigate seed dispersal by tropical vertebrates have shown moderate values of broad‐sense heritability in natural populations. Wheelwright (
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0397" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0397">1993</a>) reported 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0.6 for seed diameter in the sweetwood tree (
  <span class="italic">Ocotea tenera</span>), and Galetti 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0121" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0121">2013</a>) quantified 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0.35 for seed size in 
  <span class="italic">Euterpe edulis</span>, a keystone palm species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What have we learned from these studies? While there are many examples of heritability estimates for putative proxies of dispersal and movement ability in general, heritability estimates for specific traits involved in the entire process of dispersal, such as propensity to leave the natal patch or distance travelled between sites, are very rare and would be important to target for future studies. Birds are the most broadly studied taxon in this regard, as the heritability of dispersal has been studied in multiple species in free‐living conditions. These studies are based on marked individuals of known relatedness, in one case combined with 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> cross‐fostering (Roche 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0308" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0308">2011</a>). Until recently most studies were based on parent–offspring or sibling similarities, but several analyses have now been published based on Animal Models (Appendix I) that make use of complete pedigree information (Duckworth &amp; Kruuk, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0096">2009</a>; Korsten 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0200" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0200">2010</a>; Charmantier 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0053">2011</a>; Doligez 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0086">2012</a>). Parent–offspring and sib–sib analyses typically yield higher heritability estimates than Animal Models (McCleery 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0241" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0241">2004</a>; Charmantier 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0053">2011</a>; Doligez 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0086">2012</a>), due to maternal and common environment effects (van Noordwijk 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0269" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0269">2006</a>; Zera &amp; Brisson, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0412" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0412">2012</a>). Further, heritability estimates may also be inflated by biases in detectability due to limited study areas (van Noordwijk, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0270" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0270">1984</a>; Doligez &amp; Pärt, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0087">2008</a>) and to more numerous social interactions among siblings synchronizing their movements (Matthysen, Van de Casteele &amp; Adriaensen, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0237" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0237">2005</a>; Cote 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0064">2017b</a>). As a whole, heritability studies suggest that variation in dispersal can arise as a result of additive genetic variation, but also that in many cases much of the phenotypic variation is explained by environmental variation, including transgenerational effects (Appendix I). Recent work, for instance, has demonstrated strong epigenetic signals in dispersal propensity (van Petegem 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0287" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0287">2015</a>). Furthermore, similarity in dispersal phenotypes among related individuals may be caused by (maternally transmitted) symbionts or parasites (Goodacre 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0135" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0135">2009</a>; Debeffe 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
