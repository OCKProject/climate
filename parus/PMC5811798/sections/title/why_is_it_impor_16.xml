 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Why is it important to include the genetic architecture of dispersal in models?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dispersal traits are often quantitative traits showing continuous and heritable variation within populations (see Section 
  <a rid="brv12356-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12356-sec-0002">II</a> and see online Table 
  <a rid="brv12356-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12356-supitem-0001">S1</a>) and can thus be assumed polygenic in nature. This assumption, however, potentially introduces many complications when modelling the evolution of a trait. Ignoring, or not, these complications may matter in some cases but not in others. For example, and as alluded to above, details of the distribution of allelic effects at loci affecting a trait will affect its evolutionary dynamics. Previous models, nevertheless, have ignored these genetic details and have been based on much simpler assumptions (reviewed in Section 
  <a rid="brv12356-sec-0011" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12356-sec-0011">III.2
   <span class="italic">a</span>
  </a>), in part for practical reasons but also because modellers were mostly interested in finding optimal strategies, corresponding to equilibrium points located at maxima of fitness landscapes. Whether and how the optimal strategy is reached by evolution then depends mostly on the shape of the adaptive landscape around an equilibrium point and less on the genetic architecture of the trait [see Ronce, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0322" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0322">2007</a> for a review of modelling techniques]. This is because we generally assume that, as long as genetic variation exists in the direction of selection on the adaptive landscape, a population will reach the equilibrium point.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Details of the genetic architecture of dispersal trait(s) may then matter most when considering the evolutionary dynamics of a (meta)population, especially in non‐equilibrium situations such as range expansions, or extinction–colonization dynamics. That is, the number of loci, their distribution of allelic effects and possible epistatic interactions, their mutation and recombination rates, and their number of pleiotropic effects will all affect the rate of trait evolution towards an optimal strategy even if they do not affect the existence or position of that strategy on an adaptive landscape. However, when dispersal evolution and eco‐evolutionary dynamics are co‐determined, for instance during range expansion, genetic details underlying trait variation may have quantitative and qualitative effects on model outcomes. Typically, of the features just enumerated, some will enhance and some will constrain the rate of evolution of a dispersal trait and are thus worth considering because they may feedback on the evolutionary process itself. We will, however, not provide an exhaustive review of all possible effects of complex polygenic architectures on trait evolution but rather focus on a few simple examples.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, keeping in mind that rates of evolution depend on the amount of additive (heritable) genetic variation in a trait, any characteristic that increases the genetic and thus the phenotypic variance of a trait will be favourable under directional selection towards an optimum value. Increasing the number of loci, the mutation rate, or the mutational effect size (i.e. proportion of variance contributed by a locus) will speed up evolution by increasing trait variation, but will become an impediment when selection is stabilizing by generating a variance load (i.e. reduction of mean population fitness due to phenotypic variation around the optimum). Furthermore, when loci contribute unequally to trait variation, the shape of the phenotypic distribution may depart from normality, and become skewed, or have higher kurtosis. For example, Débarre, Yeaman &amp; Guillaume (
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0077">2015</a>) showed that when traits are affected by a few loci of large effect (i.
  <span class="italic">E. major</span> loci) together with many loci of small effect (i.
  <span class="italic">E. minor</span> loci), they are better able to resist homogenization by gene flow and lead to better local adaptation under diversifying selection between divergent habitats than when only minor loci are considered. In Débarre 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0077">2015</a>), increasing the allelic effect of major loci increased the skewness of the phenotypic distributions in divergent populations connected by gene flow, which increases the response to selection towards phenotypic optima. The enhancing effect of major loci on rates of evolution has also been shown when populations face a sudden, large shift in their environment and when a trait is determined by a mix of major and minor loci (Gomulkiewicz 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0134" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0134">2010</a>), or during range expansion on coarse or stepwise environmental gradients (Gilbert &amp; Whitlock, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0129" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0129">2017</a>). Traits determined by many minor loci can, however, confer faster adaptation to coarse gradients when the mutation rate is large (Gilbert &amp; Whitlock, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0129" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0129">2017</a>). Finally, genetic architectures with many possible mutational paths will cause faster trait evolution than genetic architectures that constrain trait variation on a single path. That is, traits determined by many loci at which multiple allelic combinations may provide the same trait value (i.e. when there is genetic redundancy) will achieve higher rates of evolution compared to when trait values can only be reached by a single combination of alleles (Yeaman, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0404" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0404">2015</a>). All these aspects must thus be carefully considered when modelling dispersal as a polygenic trait.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, when selection acts on allelic variants at multiple loci, statistical linkage, and thus linkage disequilibrium (LD) may ensue because some allelic combinations may be favoured over others. Selection will then maintain LD among beneficial allelic combinations, which contributes to adaptation in heterogeneous environments despite recombination and sometimes strong gene flow (Le Corre &amp; Kremer, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0209" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0209">2003</a>, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0210" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0210">2012</a>). This is especially true when adapting from standing genetic variation in the presence of gene flow and for genetic architectures with high genetic redundancy, which can maintain clusters of co‐adapted loci that can function as loci of major effect (Yeaman &amp; Guillaume, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0405" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0405">2009</a>; Yeaman &amp; Whitlock, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0406" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0406">2011</a>). The rate of recombination, in addition to the number and effect sizes of loci under selection, is thus an important parameter to consider when modelling polygenic traits.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, dominance and epistasis, both representing non‐additive allelic effects, are important in the evolution of quantitative traits because of their contributions to trait genetic variance (Falconer &amp; Mackay, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0106">1996</a>; Lynch &amp; Walsh, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0227" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0227">1998</a>). They are seldom taken into account, mostly because both are very complex features to model in multi‐locus systems, and are expected to be of most influence in small or inbred populations (e.g. for dominance: Wolak &amp; Keller, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0402" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0402">2014</a>; see Section 
  <a rid="brv12356-sec-0012" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12356-sec-0012">III.2
   <span class="italic">a</span>
  </a> for single‐locus models with dominance). Whether epistasis contributes significantly to trait evolution is also still under intense debate (e.g. Hansen, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0150" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0150">2013</a>; Barton, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0012">2017</a>). However, it is safe to assume that epistasis can be ignored for polygenic traits affected by many loci of small effects at which selection is of the same intensity as drift, in which case epistasis will not contribute much to trait variation (Barton, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0012">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, genetic non‐independence among traits, caused by physically linked or pleiotropic loci, has the potential either to constrain or enhance the co‐evolution of correlated traits (Lande, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0207" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0207">1979</a>; Walsh &amp; Blows, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0388" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0388">2009</a>). For instance, traits that are under uniform selection across populations, such as dispersal traits or other life‐history traits, may be displaced from their optimum if they are genetically correlated to traits under directional selection (Guillaume, 
  <a rid="brv12356-bib-0142" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12356-bib-0142">2011</a>). Such genetic non‐independence may have far‐reaching eco‐evolutionary consequences (see Section 
  <a rid="brv12356-sec-0015" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12356-sec-0015">III.2
   <span class="italic">d</span>
  </a>). As reviewed in Section 
  <a rid="brv12356-sec-0007" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12356-sec-0007">II.5</a>, many dispersal traits are strongly correlated with each other and/or with other traits under selection. While the mechanisms underlying these correlations (e.g. pleiotropy, physical linkage, environmentally induced correlations) have been identified in only a few cases, many of these traits likely share a common genetic basis and are subject to correlated evolution. However, current models consider different traits as evolving independently. In some models, correlated evolution can arise because of imposed or emerging trade‐offs (e.g. dispersal 
  <span class="italic">versus</span> reproductive abilities), likely generating statistical linkage, but genetic constraints have not yet been considered.
