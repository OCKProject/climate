  </span>, potentially threatening bird populations if these mismatches are too great or increase too rapidly. Population dynamics depend on minimizing phenological mismatch of consumers and peak resource availability
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. For migratory birds, arrival to the breeding grounds is a critical phenological event that sets the stage for the remainder of the breeding season, impacting offspring survival and performance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. While the optimal date of arrival is likely a function of conditions at the breeding grounds, actual arrival date can be influenced by conditions at the wintering grounds and along the migratory route
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. Still, migratory timing can be very tightly linked to conditions at the breeding grounds, with the timing of spring arrival driving phenological events throughout the annual cycle
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although birds have had to adapt to climatic shifts and resulting asynchronies with resources throughout their evolutionary history, the current rate and magnitude of change have exceeded normal bounds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>, raising the question of whether migrant bird populations have been able to keep pace with key phenological events. We found that a majority of migratory bird species adjusted the date of their arrival, usually in the direction (earlier or later) that vegetation green-up changed. Thus, it appears the phenology of migratory arrival is more often than not responding to climate change. In a similar set of North America passerine migrants, median capture date advanced approximately 1 day/degree °C over 40 years, but spring vegetation phenology advanced at 3.2 days/degree °C
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. Here, we found that the interval between bird arrival and vegetation green-up increased significantly in nine species of the 48 examined. These increases in phenological intervals were detected despite only 12 years of data, and may become more apparent in more species over longer time series. Across all species, the mean growth in the phenological interval between arrival and green-up was 0.575 days/year. Thus, although populations adjusted their arrival, they did not do so sufficiently to keep pace with changing green-up.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Europe, migratory pied flycatchers (
  <span class="italic">Ficedula hypoleuca</span>)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span> and collared flycatchers
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span> advanced egg laying dates, but not as much as necessary to coincide with peak insect abundance, while in the eastern United States, Marra 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span> found that median capture dates of 42 species of long-distance passage migrants advanced, but lagged behind advances in plant budburst. In one contrasting study, Cresswell and McCleery
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span> determined that non-migratory great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) in England advanced their laying phenology earlier than the phenology of their insect prey, but others have found stable or increasing phenological intervals in this species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Our results are generally comparable to previous studies of individual species’ responses to food availability at individual study sites which have benefitted from longer time series generally dating to the 1960s or 1970s. While we observed an advance in green-up of 0.372 days/year across the breeding ranges of 48 bird species, advances in caterpillars have ranged from 0.189 to 0.87 days per year in (European) studies reviewed by Visser 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. Similarly, we observed that mean arrival advanced by 0.426 days/year across species, whereas studies of birds responding to caterpillars reviewed by Visser 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (4 species, 11 sites) showed advances ranging from 0.17 to 0.52 days/year. Despite these similarities, our observations of trends in green-up (1.699 days/year earlier to 2.730 days/year later) and arrival ranged more widely (1.750 days/year earlier to 0.716 days/year later) than previous work, suggesting increased variation in phenological trends across species and their breeding ranges. Our results for North American passerines generally show a greater magnitude of increase in phenological interval, at 0.575 days/year, than reported in Visser 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>, but it is unclear if this difference is due to different continents, species, length of time series, spatial scope, recent acceleration of growth in phenological interval, or other factors. Overall, birds appear to be exhibiting phenotypic plasticity in response to their changing environmental conditions, but the pace and magnitude of phenological change in vegetation may well exceed the extent of this plasticity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trends in phenological interval varied by ecoregion, an unanticipated result. We found that although many eastern bird species have advanced their arrival times, this advance lagged behind increasingly early green-up and as a result, the interval between arrival and green-up has increased over the 2001 to 2012 period. In a similar yet unexpected process, species of the Western Forests experienced increasingly later green-up, but did not arrive late enough to match those changing conditions. These species also face increasing phenological intervals despite the direction of phenological shift. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of strong regional variation in phenological interval trends in migratory birds. Regional variation in trends in arrival dates (but not intervals) has, however, been reported for European and Australian birds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. The effects of recent climate change on the phenology of migratory birds, therefore, are strongly dependent on region. Conclusions drawn for one biome or region, or from a single species, should be very cautiously applied at larger geographic scales or to entire avian communities.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecoregional differences in trends in arrival dates and phenological intervals may be the result of birds from different ecoregions tending to have differing migration distances and origins (wintering grounds). For instance, trends in arrival dates can depend on migration distance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. However, our results, which show that the geography of green-up trends strongly explains trends in phenological intervals, may suggest a more limited role for species traits such as migration distance, in explaining those trends. Nonetheless, further examining the role of dispersal-related species traits, especially when dissecting finer-scale aspects of species tracking, is a ripe area for future research.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study provides an important link between mechanistic ecological studies at local scales and broader changes in the climate at continental scales. Our work benefitted from continental-scale data sets with which the phenologies of birds and vegetation could be united. However, such broad-scale data sets often lack the direct mechanistic linkages that are gained from many local data sets. For example, green-up is not a direct measure of food availability, which has strong mechanistic linkages to arrival phenology. However, we view green-up as a strong index point for arrival timing of migratory insectivorous birds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> for the following reasons. First, green-up predicts the increase in availability of insects as bird resources. Most foliage gleaning birds consume primarily herbivorous insects
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>, whose biomass in turn increases as a direct response to green-up
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. Second, green-up occurs at comparable temperature thresholds to the flight of many insects
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span> and degree-day models predict both leafing phenology of plants and flight of insects
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>. Third, birds incur costs for later arrival. While it has not yet been established whether edible arthropod biomass generally decreases at times beyond early spring
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>, anti-herbivore allelopathic chemicals tend to increase throughout the growing season
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span> and birds may face additional costs with later arrival such as fewer available nest sites and fewer available mates with territories
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite these biological linkages between phenologies of birds and green-up, we note that the interval between green-up and bird arrival is not expected to be zero (only that the interval should be consistent under stable interannual conditions). Ideally, phenologies of all forage resource groups would be combined with detailed phenologies of bird species’ reproductive events, including territory establishment, egg laying, hatching, and fledging. Lacking such data at broad scales, we suggest that answering the question of phenological mismatch across trophic levels will require a dual approach in which direct observation and experimentation at local scales tests causal mechanisms, while spatially broad datasets are employed to scale up to the continental level and enable regional and cross-species comparisons.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two methodological notes are worth mentioning. In this study, we have considered the sensitivity of observed trends in phenological interval to our estimation of arrival date as the inflection point of a logistic model fit to the proportion of presences to absences over time. However, modeling approaches for phenological data are an area of current debate. For instance, Newson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span> employed generalized additive models to characterize multiple phenological events over the year, and approaches such as this that employ non-parametric smoothing allow maximum model shape flexibility. Linden 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span> empirically evaluated parametric and nonparametric models and suggested that parametric models are most often preferable for modeling the arrival period. Regardless of the approach, however, the sensitivity of phenological interval to arrival date estimation should be evaluated, because the estimation could be influenced by data following the arrival period. In the Methods section and in Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> we detail the sensitivity of our results to arrival estimation including impacts of passing (nonbreeding) migrants, latitudinal effects, estimation window size, and proportional position of the arrival estimation within the arrival period.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, our analyses leveraged observations from eBird; citizen-science data varies in quality and is spatially and temporally heterogeneous, and eBird’s citizen-science data is not immune to this limitation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. However, eBird’s data remains the richest source of presence-absence data for birds and can offer insights at previously unexplored spatial scopes, as well as across many species concurrently
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span>. Our confidence in eBird data as appropriate for estimating mean arrival dates of bird populations is supported by the following: i) the law of large numbers, suggesting that richer data may be less susceptible to outliers, misidentifications, or observer biases unless these vary systematically; ii) our demonstration that the number of checklists submitted per observer, which can be related to the number of species reported, does not vary systematically by region (Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>); iii) our filtering of arrival date estimates to those species-cell-years with good model fits; iv) thorough model sensitivity analyses provided in Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>; v) the previous use of this method and data by Hurlbert 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>; vi) similar limitations in citizen science data as professionally collected data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>; vii) similar accuracy and data quality in citizen science data as professionally collected data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>; viii) general conformity of results derived from eBird data with experimental results, while offering novel insights
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span>. Methods for further refinement of models to account for potential biases are actively being developed
  <span class="sup">

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although we observed migrant North American birds failing to keep pace with the rapidly shifting phenology of vegetation, the specific demographic and ecosystem consequences of these trends remain unknown. Demographic trends are predicted by trends in climatic suitability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span>, and if birds are unable to keep pace with their changing environment, reduced fitness for individuals

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span>, and in the extreme, extirpations, could result. Declines in migratory bird populations attributable to climate-related phenological mismatch have already been observed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span>, and phenological synchrony can be comparable to food availability and conspecific density in explaining reproductive success
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
  </span>, but the sensitivity of different demographic parameters to mismatch are still poorly understood. For instance, density dependent compensation may buffer against mismatch to maintain populations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span> but selection favouring reduced phenological interval can be relaxed when populations have declined
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
  </span>. We expect demographic response rates to differ across species (according to their traits) and regions, highlighting the importance of both regional scale analytical approaches and of continental-scale programs for monitoring the occurrence and demography of sensitive widespread taxa such as birds. Whatever the demographic consequences of phenological asynchrony may be, it is clear that even over the relatively short time span of 12 years, this mismatch is increasing for a large number of migratory bird species, providing evidence that trophic interactions are failing to keep pace with a rapidly changing climate.
