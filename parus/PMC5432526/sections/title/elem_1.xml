  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the 12 year period, green-up dates advanced significantly in 27 species’ breeding ranges, by a mean of 0.952 days/year, and became later in four species breeding ranges by a mean of 1.52 days/year (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). Across all species, the mean trend in green-up date in cells making up a species’ breeding range (the mean of trends in Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>), was an advance of 0.372 ± 0.387 days/year. Similarly, arrival dates advanced significantly for 25 of 48 species (52%) by a mean of 0.669 days/year, while arrival became later only for one species, 
   <span class="italic">Contopus sordidulus</span>, by 0.370 days/year (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Across all species, mean arrival advanced by 0.426 ± 0.340 days/year (mean of slopes in Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Frequently, when green-up changed significantly in a species’ range, a species’ arrival also changed significantly, and usually in the same direction; when both green-up and arrival changed significantly for a given species, they always became earlier.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenological intervals (date
   <sub>arrival</sub> – date
   <sub>green-up</sub>) between green-up and arrival increased significantly in nine species (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). We observed two types of increasing phenological interval: increasing positive intervals occurred when green-up increasingly preceded arrival, while increasing negative interval occurred when green-up became increasingly later relative to arrival over time. For species with increasing positive intervals, both green-up and arrival tended to become earlier over time. However, green-up advanced at a greater pace than did arrival. For the seven species with significantly increasing positive intervals, the intervals increased by mean = 0.630 days/year on average (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). For species with increasing negative intervals (mean = 1.60 days/year), green-up tended to get later over time but arrival trend was more variable, advancing for some species and getting later for others (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). For the latter group, the pace of change in arrival was typically slower than for green-up. Thus, for both species with increasing positive and negative intervals, greater phenological change was generally observed in green-up than in arrival. Still, we did not detect statistically significantly changing intervals for 39 of 48 species (81%) over this 12 year period (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). Also, the number of species for which trends in phenological interval were considered significant differed with statistical adjustments for multiple comparisons (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>), but significant effects remained with each approach. Because the phenological interval could increase positively or negatively, mean trend in phenological interval was only an advance of 0.092 days/year across all species, but the mean absolute effect size (change in any direction) across species was an increase in phenological interval of 0.575 ± 0.512 days/year (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Across the majority of species where phenological intervals were increasing, the advance in arrival date lagged behind the advance in green-up date (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Similarly, a linear regression between arrival trend and green-up trend across species (Arrival trend = 0.376 × Green-up trend −0.286, 
   <span class="italic">adj. R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.350, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) showed that for species where green-up was getting earlier, bird arrival was also getting earlier. However, that slope was significantly (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.004) different from 1. This indicates that arrival was not getting earlier as quickly as was green-up (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trends in phenological intervals differed by region (Figs 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). We partitioned North America into five large ecoregions for which we expected distinct patterns in vegetation phenology and possible differences in migration phenology of birds, but for which we had no 
   <span class="italic">a priori</span> expectation for trends in phenological intervals (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). Species that breed primarily in Eastern Temperate Forests tended to display increasing positive phenological interval over time, whereas species breeding in the Western Forests tended to exhibit increasing negative trends in phenological interval (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). Species that breed primarily in the Deserts and Great Plains, and Northern and Southern Ecosystems tended to exhibit little change in phenological interval (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These regionally varying trends in phenological interval were mirrored by continental-scale variation in underlying green-up and arrival patterns. From 2001–2012, green-up advanced throughout eastern and northern North America, but unexpectedly lagged in much of western North America (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). We expected arrival trends would follow green-up trends. Arrival of migratory birds occurred earlier in most areas, especially in eastern North America (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>), consistent with previous work
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
   </span>. In some areas however, birds arrived later, notably around the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Northwest. While the delayed arrival in the west is consistent with delayed green-up in the west, arrival trends around the Gulf of Mexico became later while green-up became earlier, an incongruity suggesting that bird arrival times to these areas were determined by other factors.
