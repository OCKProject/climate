 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We divided North America into a grid of 200 km × 200 km ‘cells’ based on the North America Albers Equal Area Conic Projection (NAD83). This resolution was selected to be sufficiently coarse to permit arrival to be estimated in a robust way from the data available from citizen science efforts, yet fine enough to allow meaningful analyses using these cells as spatial (analytical) units.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated bird arrival dates using data from eBird (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebird.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ebird.org</span>, “basic” dataset, accessed May 7, 2014), a database of citizen science checklists, following Hurlbert &amp; Liang (2012). Although detection probability of birds in this database likely varies with observer ability, species traits, and temporal and spatial extent of observations, we assumed that due to the large number of observers, variation in the composite data did not suffer from seasonal, annual, or geographic biases in estimates of arrival date. We selected 48 passerine species for analysis based on the following criteria: i) common species with large breeding ranges; ii) breeding range primarily located near populated areas of North America and thus likely to be well-sampled via citizen science endeavors; and iii) breeding range largely non-overlapping with winter range. To estimate arrival dates, we first masked eBird records to each species’ North American breeding range, which were obtained from NatureServe (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://services.natureserve.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://services.natureserve.org</span>). Second, for all records located in a grid cell for a given year, we used R (version 3.1, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) to fit a logistic model to the dates of presences (species observed) and assumed absences (species not observed on checklist where all species present were considered reported) between Julian days 80 to 180, with the proportion of presences as the response variable (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). The day 80 to 180 window we used, though arbitrary, was selected to encompass the probable mean arrival dates. Our logistic models allowed for (maximum) asymptotes &lt;1, since the proportion of surveys positively reporting a given species rarely approached 1. We used the inflection point of the fitted logistic model as the estimated mean arrival date of a given species to a given cell in a given year. We repeated this estimation procedure for all species in each cell and year. Where data were sparse (&lt;10 presences per cell-year), logistic models could not be reliably fit to the data so these grid cells were excluded from analysis. To limit potential biases generated in instances where the logistic models poorly fit bird observation data over time, we further excluded all arrival date estimates from models with poor fit as indicated by the residual deviance divided by residual degrees of freedom was &gt;4, and all models with low statistical significance (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). The estimated mean arrival date was utilized rather than first arrival date or the range in arrival dates because it is less sensitive to outliers and more accurately represents the arrival of the population

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Although arrival dates vary in their uncertainty, we did not weight mean arrival date estimates by the inverse variance because this variation represents not only uncertainty in the arrival estimate but also the variability in when individuals of a species arrive (for instance, whether a population arrives more synchronized versus variably over time).

It provides the date of “onset of greenness increase” which is derived from fitting a logistic model to Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data, for each year, computed from a Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function-Adjusted Reflectance function for an 8 day period at a 500 m pixel resolution

  </span>. We aggregated the dates in each 200 km grid cell using QGIS (version 2.6, Open Source Geospatial Foundation Project, Boston, USA, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qgis.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.qgis.org</span>) and its “zonal statistics” function to determine the mean date of onset of greenness each year across all MODIS pixels and treated this as the estimated date of green-up. There is generally high correspondence of satellite-derived phenological data and field observations of vegetation

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated phenological interval as the difference between arrival and green-up dates for a given species, in a given cell and year. The interval is typically thus a positive number, as birds typically arrive following green-up. However, when birds arrive prior to green-up, phenological interval is a negative number. Since green-up is an index of phenology of food resources but is several mechanistic steps removed from optimal bird arrival dates (which are likely species-specific), we refrain from placing any functional value (positive or negative) on mean interval for each species. Rather, the interval as measured here is an index of phenology, and if birds are synchronized with respect to local phenology, we expect the measured interval to be constant over time, even with year-to-year variation. Linear trends in phenological interval over time, however, indicate that bird species are increasingly not synchronized with vegetation. We do not presume that the phenological interval between green-up and arrival ought to be zero (that green-up and arrival should be synchronous) to maximize fitness, or that arrival strictly determines other phenological events in birds.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore variation in trends of green-up, arrival and phenological interval across species (as in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">l</a>), we determined (for each of those responses) slopes for each species by fitting linear mixed models, with ‘grid cell’ as a factor with random intercept, to estimated values across the years 2001 to 2012. Similarly, to explore variation in trends of green-up, arrival and phenological interval across space (as in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), we determined slopes in green-up, arrival and phenological interval at each cell by fitting linear mixed models, with ‘species’ as a factor with random intercept, to estimated values across the 2001 to 2012 period. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows these slopes mapped across cells. These and all other maps used the North America Albers Equal Area Conic projection and were created with QGIS (version 2.6, Open Source Geospatial Foundation Project, Boston, USA, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qgis.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.qgis.org</span>) and display U.S. Geological Survey North American political boundaries (2006 version).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We defined increasing positive phenological interval as a positive trend in the difference between arrival and green-up, when arrival increasingly lags green-up. We defined increasing negative phenological interval as the negative trend in the difference between arrival and green-up, when arrival increasingly precedes green-up.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate broader geographic trends, we defined five large ecoregions in North America (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>) by combining similar Level 1 ecological regions from the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/ecoregions.htm" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/ecoregions.htm</span>). We then assigned species to an ecoregion if either their breeding range covered &gt;33% of an ecoregion, and/or if an ecoregion covered &gt;33% of the species’ range (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test if arrival changed to the same degree as green-up across species, we performed a linear regression of trend in arrival by trend in green-up, with species as the observational unit, and where ‘trend’ indicates the mean slope of mixed model with cell as a factor with random intercept as calculated above. To test for ecoregions in explaining trend in phenological interval, we performed a multiple linear regression with ecoregions as predictors of trend in phenological interval and plotted the regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assumed that the logistic curve was an appropriately shaped model of how occupancy varies over time as bird populations arrive to a cell. Although nonparametric
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span> and parametric
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span> models are both employed in phenological studies of birds, parametric models are often preferable
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. Still, the logistic might not be appropriate if a large proportion of migrants arriving to a cell pass through, rather than remain in the cell. In this case occupancy would be expected to peak and decline rather than reach an asymptote, thereby resulting in poor model fits particularly in the post-arrival period. Additionally, if birds are less sensitive to environmental conditions when passing through a cell than when settling to breed, synchrony may be less important for their fitness. Although we were unable to differentiate among those birds passing through a cell and those remaining to breed, we excluded arrival estimates from logistic models with poor fits or that lacked statistical significance (discussed above). Furthermore, we tested the sensitivity of our results to passing migrants in three ways (see Supplemental Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). First, because passing birds are expected to decrease with latitude, we re-estimated trends in phenological interval while controlling for latitude and found that more species showed significant trends in interval, suggesting our estimates of the number of species with significant trends in phenological interval was conservative. Second, if passing migrants impact occupancy over time then arrival date estimation may be sensitive to the range of dates over which arrival is estimated (‘window size’), and this effect would vary with latitude
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. We found that the sensitivity of arrival to window size did not vary with latitude. Third, we re-estimated arrival dates based on alternative points on the logistic curves of proportion of presences over time, focusing especially on earlier arrival given that there may be fitness benefits to early arrival. We found that with earlier arrival estimates more species showed significant trends in phenological interval and that the mean trend in phenological interval was stronger, suggesting our estimates may have been conservative. A full discussion of these secondary analyses of arrival estimation sensitivities and their rationales is provided in Supplementary Note
