 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trends in phenological intervals differed by region (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). We partitioned North America into five large ecoregions for which we expected distinct patterns in vegetation phenology and possible differences in migration phenology of birds, but for which we had no 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> expectation for trends in phenological intervals (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). Species that breed primarily in Eastern Temperate Forests tended to display increasing positive phenological interval over time, whereas species breeding in the Western Forests tended to exhibit increasing negative trends in phenological interval (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). Species that breed primarily in the Deserts and Great Plains, and Northern and Southern Ecosystems tended to exhibit little change in phenological interval (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These regionally varying trends in phenological interval were mirrored by continental-scale variation in underlying green-up and arrival patterns. From 2001–2012, green-up advanced throughout eastern and northern North America, but unexpectedly lagged in much of western North America (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). We expected arrival trends would follow green-up trends. Arrival of migratory birds occurred earlier in most areas, especially in eastern North America (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>), consistent with previous work
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. In some areas however, birds arrived later, notably around the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Northwest. While the delayed arrival in the west is consistent with delayed green-up in the west, arrival trends around the Gulf of Mexico became later while green-up became earlier, an incongruity suggesting that bird arrival times to these areas were determined by other factors.
