 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding whether and how species are able to adjust and adapt to climate change has become one of the most urgent challenges facing ecology. Climate change is projected to drive hundreds of bird species to extinction and greatly reduce the ranges of others
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>, and is already impacting species richness and composition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Despite these impacts, in recent decades a majority of species examined have shifted the timing (phenology) of key ecological events, such as migration or reproduction
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>, consistent with expectations under climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. For instance, birds appear to be laying eggs earlier
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, especially among populations experiencing greater increases in temperature
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. Earlier arrival of migrants on breeding grounds has also been reported
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>, mirroring advances in spring vegetation phenology
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More important than whether birds are shifting their phenologies is whether these shifts adequately compensate for a changing climate and resulting shifts in avian food resources that drive fitness. Individuals and species might be able to adjust rapidly: phenotypically plastic behavioural responses can track environmental conditions closely
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, and even evolutionary changes in migratory behaviour which are generally expected to be much slower can occur rapidly
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Migratory birds, given their ability to rapidly move long distances, might appear to be among the most adaptable animals to climate change. Migration itself is partly an adaptation to intra-annual changes in climate, so additional inter-annual climatic changes might seem not to pose a problem for further adaptation. However, onset of long-distance migration in birds is primarily cued by physiological responses to photoperiod—which is annually consistent—yet conditions at their breeding grounds depend on climate—which is annually variable
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. To maximize fitness, birds must time their breeding phenology (including arrival on breeding grounds, breeding, egg laying, and fledging) to coincide with optimal habitat conditions and food availability. This means there is evolutionary incentive to correctly anticipate breeding site conditions while birds are still at their winter grounds, often thousands of kilometers distant. As climate at the breeding grounds changes, birds may be unable to adjust wintering ground departure times and transit speeds sufficiently to match their arrival with altered breeding resource phenology, particularly leaf growth and the closely associated emergence of herbivorous insects.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Arriving too early at breeding grounds can bring risk of freezing (due to cold temperatures) and hatching chicks before peak resource abundance, whereas arriving too late can mean fewer nest sites, fewer mates with successfully guarded territories, and declining resource abundance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. As such, the loss of synchrony between insect emergence and migrant bird arrival phenology
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> can be accompanied by negative fitness consequences including reduced reproductive output and juvenile survival
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. The decoupling of the phenology across trophic levels can ultimately lead to population declines and biodiversity loss
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. Beyond impacts on birds, phenological asynchrony between birds and their insect prey can generate novel trophic cascades: for instance, a lack of predation on insects can cause insect outbreaks and subsequently increase defoliation of trees
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We ask whether bird migration phenology has kept pace with the phenology of their food. To address this question, we undertook the first continental scale study of phenological asynchrony, presenting trends in the intervals between vegetation green-up and the arrival of 48 passerine bird species in North America for the period 2001–2012. Although only 12 years of data, the rapid pace of warming (approximately 0.024 °C per year in the contiguous U.S.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>), a key driver of green-up, makes this is a sufficient period over which to test for substantial trends in phenological interval. We used mean green-up date as derived from satellite imagery as a proxy for timing of peak resource availability and as a yardstick with which to compare avian arrival
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Green-up provides a reasonable proxy for passerine food availability—and a closer one than climatic conditions—because green-up timing is strongly correlated with the emergence of young insects that fuel migrants and form the primary food source for nestling passerine birds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Green-up is also known to be a strong predictor of migratory and breeding phenology in birds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then compared green-up dates with migratory bird arrival dates, as estimated from continent-wide citizen science observations provided by eBird. The continental extent of this study complements local scale mechanistic investigations (e.g. refs 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a> and 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>) and enabled estimation of trends in phenological intervals throughout breeding ranges and across widely varying ecological conditions. We expected that phenological intervals would increase with increasingly earlier green-up, indicating a lack of adaptation to changing vegetation phenology.
