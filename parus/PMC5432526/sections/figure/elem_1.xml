  <p>Ecoregional differences in arrival trend vs. green-up trend relationship and in explaining trend in phenological interval. (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) Relationship between trend in bird species arrival and trend in green-up. Each symbol represents a species, and symbol colour and shape indicate the primary ecoregion of the species’ breeding range, as defined in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> (only the most occupied region shown). Black line indicates linear regression for all species (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), blue line indicates where trend in arrival equals trend in green-up. The trend for all species was statistically significantly (
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.004) different from slope = 1 (blue line), indicating trend in arrival changed less than trend in green-up. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) Ecoregions as linear regression coefficients predicting trend in phenological interval across species. Bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.
