 <div class="caption">
  <p>Trends in green-up date, bird arrival date, and phenological interval by species. Bars indicate +/− 1 standard error. Species are ranked by trend in phenological interval. In (
   <span class="bold">A</span>), positive values indicate arrival (orange) or green-up (green) are getting later, negative values indicate they are getting earlier. Note that for species on the right (with increasing phenological interval), green-up is getting earlier at a greater rate than is arrival. In (
   <span class="bold">B</span>), positive values indicate increasing phenological interval (black) between green-up and arrival date. Coloured symbols below the panel indicate the general location(s) of the species’ breeding range in North America. Asterisks indicate statistically significant trends in phenological interval (p &lt; 0.05). Note that species on the right (with increasing positive phenological interval) tend to breed in Eastern Temperate Forests, whereas species on the left (with increasing negative phenological interval) tend to breed in Western Forests.
