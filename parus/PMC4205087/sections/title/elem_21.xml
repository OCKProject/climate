 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean maximum wing chord (the measure of chick size) was 28.95±0.34 mm for 7-day-old chicks (range 13 to 41, N = 266) and 34.69±0.63 mm for 8-day-old chicks (range 16 to 48, N = 70). The interaction of treatment and year was included in the only plausible model of chick size (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111180.s009" href="#pone.0111180.s009">Table S9</a> for the AICc model fits of all candidate models). Model averaged parameter estimates indicated that treatment had a greater effect on chick maximum wing chord in 2009 than in 2010 (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111180-t004" href="#pone-0111180-t004">Table 4</a>). In fact, a plot of maximum wing chord by year shows that fed chicks were larger than control chicks in 2009 but that there was no difference between them in 2010 (
