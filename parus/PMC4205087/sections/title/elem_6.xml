 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to measure the degree of correlation between pairs of reproductive parameters; strong correlation between a pair of reproductive parameters suggests that an extraneous factor impacting the earliest-occurring variable of the pair will affect the later-occurring variable indirectly. A correlation matrix revealed only weak levels of co-variation between most pairs of reproductive parameters (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111180-t001" href="#pone-0111180-t001">Table 1</a>). The analysis focuses on the effects of food supplementation on each of the reproductive success parameters outlined in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111180-t002" href="#pone-0111180-t002">Table 2</a>. Year, adult age, and other individual characteristics may also affect reproductive success. Furthermore, aspects of breeding parameters early on in a breeding attempt (e.g. breeding date, clutch size) may influence later measures of breeding success (e.g. chick size, number of juveniles). To investigate these effects, a series of models were fitted for each response variable using the statistical package R, version 3.0.3 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-R1">[32]</a>. Where appropriate (see below and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111180-t002" href="#pone-0111180-t002">Table 2</a>), we used general linear models, linear mixed models (fitted by maximum likelihood) and generalised linear mixed models (fitted by maximum likelihood). Mixed models were fitted using the lme4 package 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Bates1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Bates1">[33]</a> within R. Intercept-only models (null models) were included within each set of candidate models. Treatment (fed or control), year and the interaction of treatment and year were included amongst the candidate models of each response variable unless the response was measured in only a single year. Hatching dates were used as the measure of breeding timing because more data was available for hatching than for laying dates and the two variables were highly correlated (R = 0.91, P&lt;0.001, N = 22). As well as analysing hatching date as a breeding parameter itself, it was included as a fixed effect (and the interaction of treatment and hatching date) in all other analyses except for nest survival. For nest survival, the date on which the nest was found (and the interaction of treatment and date found) was used instead. Values of hatching date or date nest found were standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Male age (young (yearling) or old (2+ years old)) was included, as well as the interaction of treatment and male age, amongst candidate models of hatching date to account for the possible impact of male age on arrival times and therefore breeding date and territory quality. For other analyses, hatching date was used instead because territory quality has been shown to be more important for reproductive success than individual characteristics 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Currie1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Currie1">[23]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Prt2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Prt2">[25]</a>. For chick size, chick age (7 days-old or 8 days old) was included in all models (except for a null model) as a controlling factor and number of chicks was considered in some of the candidate models. All subsets of the full models in each case have been considered (except for chick size, where chick age was kept in all models as a necessary control). The full lists of candidate models are provided in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111180.s002" href="#pone.0111180.s002">Tables S2</a>–
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111180.s011" href="#pone.0111180.s011">S11</a>. The strength of support for competing candidate models was assessed using AIC corrected for small sample size (AICc 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Burnham1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Burnham1">[34]</a>) and AICc weights (

Model ranking by AICc and model averaging of parameter estimates was carried out with the R package AICcmodavg

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Female identity (ID) was included where appropriate as a random effect in mixed models to account for multiple broods of individuals between and across years. Male ID was used as the random effect for the analyses of young fledged per male per breeding season and number of breeding attempts per male per breeding season. Male ID was also used as the random effect for the analysis of hatching date because male age was included as a factor (we had less data on female age). Male and female ID were never included together, female ID being nested within male ID. Several candidate models of nest survival failed to converge when fitted with random effects. For the analysis of this parameter, pseudoreplication was avoided by randomly selecting one datum per individual by the 
  <span class="italic">sample</span> procedure in R (dataset reduced from 110 nests to 99 nests) and the models were fitted with general linear models instead. For the analysis of multiple brooding by males, initial modelling for random effects did not allow for year effects because of the lack of contrasts in multiple brooding available between all of the factors treatment, hatching date and year. Modelling with random effects without year provided a standard deviation of 0 for the random effect of male ID, indicating that multiple brooding did not depend on individual identity. To allow for year effects to be included in the candidate models without discarding data, models of multiple brooding were conducted with general linear models. Unringed individuals were included within some analyses. The number of unringed individuals was relatively high in 2008 (10 males/7 females of 22 pairs), but fewer in 2009 and 2010 (5 males/7 females of 40 pairs in 2009; 5 males/5 females of 48 pairs in 2010). Thus there may have been some pseudoreplication of unringed breeders between years, although only about 50% of unringed adult birds are expected to return the following year 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Arnold1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Arnold1">[17]</a>. Fed pairs that stopped using feeders when cages were deployed were included in analyses of clutch size and egg volume, as they were still being fed during those stages of the breeding cycle. For all other analyses, these pairs were excluded from the dataset.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total number of chicks fledged across the whole breeding season was obtained for individual parents instead of pairs (new pairs could form after failed nesting attempts and males could have simultaneous broods with multiple females). Individuals with failed broods were included in the analysis because feeding treatment may influence decisions about re-laying following nest failure. As there were no cases of multiple broods within the control group of females, we did not use linear modelling to test for an effect of food supplementation on multiple brooding by females. Instead, we used a Fisher Exact Test to test the significance of the treatment effect. Details of the models run for each breeding parameter are listed in
