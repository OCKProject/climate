  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All of the field experiments and animal protocols were conducted with the permission of the Fair Isle Bird Observatory Trustees and the National Trust for Scotland. Bird ringing was licensed by the British Trust for Ornithology. This study did not involve protected species and the birds were not collected. The sampling methods were non-invasive and are described fully in the Methods section. No individuals were sacrificed or harmed in any way. The vertebrate work involved provision of supplementary food to wild birds in their natural habitat. The birds' natural food supply was available to all birds throughout the study. The study was thus was non-invasive and indeed the food supplementation experiment was expected to be beneficial to those individuals (and their offspring) that received the supplementary food. We therefore did not seek approval from an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Study location and species</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was conducted on Fair Isle (59°32′N, 1°39′W), a ca. 1,000 ha island lying north-east of the Scottish mainland, UK. Breeding wheatears arrive on Fair Isle between the beginning of April and mid-May. Nests are located in holes in the ground, under rocks or in dry stone walls. First clutch egg-laying begins in early May and continues into June. Clutch size ranges from 4 to 8 eggs; incubation, by the female, lasts about 13 days (range 10–18 days 
   <a rid="pone.0111180-Moreno1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Moreno1">[28]</a>). Both parents provision the chicks. Chicks fledge after approximately 15 days. The parents continue to feed fledglings until they become independent, about two weeks after fledging.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adult wheatears were captured with spring traps (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.moudry.cz" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.moudry.cz</span>, model SB30). Plumage features were used to sex and age captured birds as fledged in the previous year (young), before the previous year (old) or fledged before the current year (unknown if young or old) 
   <a rid="pone.0111180-Svensson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Svensson1">[29]</a>. All males, but only a minority of females, could be aged as young or old. All captured birds were measured (maximum wing chord to 1 mm), weighed to 0.1 g, and fitted with a numbered metal ring and a unique combination of plastic colour rings to enable individual identification in the field. Nestlings were ringed when approximately 7 days old.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feeding experiment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prey availability for wheatears was increased by providing mealworms in plastic bowls placed on the ground. During 2008–2010, feeders were available from territory establishment in late April/early May, and filled with at least 30 g of mealworms (mean ± SD  = 37.8±2.7 g, n = 20 mealworm samples). Feeders were refilled on at least five days in each week, until autumn departure of all breeding birds and their offspring (August/early September). Mean (± SD) first egg laying date of fed pairs was 17.1±5.1 days after each feeder was set up (N = 24 fed territories with this information available Sample sizes of supplementary fed (treatment) and unfed (control) wheatear pairs were: 2008 – 15 fed, 14 control; 2009 – 23 fed, 22 control; 2010 – 27 fed, 27 control.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As there are age-related differences in arrival date and breeding success of wheatears 
   <a rid="pone.0111180-Currie1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Currie1">[23]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0111180-Arlt2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Arlt2">[30]</a>, a daily standard study site route was walked from mid-April until the end of May, and newly established breeding pairs were selected alternately as fed and control (i.e. unfed) pairs. A pair was selected if behavioural signs of pair establishment were observed. In this way, fed and control pairs were stratified both spatially and with respect to arrival date. This procedure also meant that supplementary feeding only began after territory establishment, thus avoiding the potentially confounding situation of the highest quality individuals establishing territories around feeders, to the exclusion of lower quality individuals.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One feeder was located in the estimated centre of each food-supplemented territory. Direct observation and footage from small video cameras (Sony Handycam, model DCR-SR32) confirmed the identities of the wheatears using the feeders. At least three recording sessions of at least 1 hour each – made on different days and at different times during daylight – were viewed per feeder, but viewing sessions were extended to 4 hours if neither or only one of a pair had attended the feeder during the initial period. During this video monitoring, none of the adult wheatears from control pairs were ever recorded taking mealworms from any of the feeders in any year. Wheatears from supplementary fed pairs were sometimes recorded taking mealworms from other feeders outside their own territory. 88.3% of feeding visits in a random sample of 20 recording sessions were made by the target pair. The remaining visits were by European starlings (
   <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wire mesh cages permitted wheatears but not European starlings to access feeding bowls through a small hole cut at the bottom or via a hinged weighted walkway that swung shut when the heavier starlings attempted to enter, swinging back open again when the starling stepped off the platform. Fed pairs started using feeders within a few days of them being set up. To let wheatears get used to attending feeders, one month generally passed between positioning feeders and deploying cages. In each year, however, some wheatear pairs (n = 5, 6 and 2 in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively) that had initially attended feeders stopped using them once the cages were positioned. Such pairs were excluded from some analyses, as explained below. The feeders that were used by the target wheatears became depleted of mealworms between top-ups and as approximately 88% of visits were by the target pair, we estimate that, on average, at least 23.5 g of mealworms – approximately 88% of the minimum of 27.0 g available (37.8 g per feed ×5 days (minimum)/7 days  = 27.0 g) – were taken by each target pair per day.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reproductive parameters</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nests were found by observing the parents going to and from nest holes. On finding each nest, its status was recorded as (i) being built, containing (ii) eggs or (iii) chicks. Nest contents were subsequently checked every other day and the number of any dead chicks or un-hatched eggs recorded. Laying date, clutch size, egg volume, hatching date, hatching success, chick wing length and number of fledglings were recorded (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111180.s001" href="#pone.0111180.s001">Table S1</a>). Egg volume was recorded because of the possibility that supplementary feeding may influence female investment in egg production, with potential carry-over effects on chick size

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to measure the degree of correlation between pairs of reproductive parameters; strong correlation between a pair of reproductive parameters suggests that an extraneous factor impacting the earliest-occurring variable of the pair will affect the later-occurring variable indirectly. A correlation matrix revealed only weak levels of co-variation between most pairs of reproductive parameters (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111180-t001" href="#pone-0111180-t001">Table 1</a>). The analysis focuses on the effects of food supplementation on each of the reproductive success parameters outlined in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111180-t002" href="#pone-0111180-t002">Table 2</a>. Year, adult age, and other individual characteristics may also affect reproductive success. Furthermore, aspects of breeding parameters early on in a breeding attempt (e.g. breeding date, clutch size) may influence later measures of breeding success (e.g. chick size, number of juveniles). To investigate these effects, a series of models were fitted for each response variable using the statistical package R, version 3.0.3 
   <a rid="pone.0111180-R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-R1">[32]</a>. Where appropriate (see below and 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111180-t002" href="#pone-0111180-t002">Table 2</a>), we used general linear models, linear mixed models (fitted by maximum likelihood) and generalised linear mixed models (fitted by maximum likelihood). Mixed models were fitted using the lme4 package 
   <a rid="pone.0111180-Bates1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Bates1">[33]</a> within R. Intercept-only models (null models) were included within each set of candidate models. Treatment (fed or control), year and the interaction of treatment and year were included amongst the candidate models of each response variable unless the response was measured in only a single year. Hatching dates were used as the measure of breeding timing because more data was available for hatching than for laying dates and the two variables were highly correlated (R = 0.91, P&lt;0.001, N = 22). As well as analysing hatching date as a breeding parameter itself, it was included as a fixed effect (and the interaction of treatment and hatching date) in all other analyses except for nest survival. For nest survival, the date on which the nest was found (and the interaction of treatment and date found) was used instead. Values of hatching date or date nest found were standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Male age (young (yearling) or old (2+ years old)) was included, as well as the interaction of treatment and male age, amongst candidate models of hatching date to account for the possible impact of male age on arrival times and therefore breeding date and territory quality. For other analyses, hatching date was used instead because territory quality has been shown to be more important for reproductive success than individual characteristics 
   <a rid="pone.0111180-Currie1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Currie1">[23]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0111180-Prt2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Prt2">[25]</a>. For chick size, chick age (7 days-old or 8 days old) was included in all models (except for a null model) as a controlling factor and number of chicks was considered in some of the candidate models. All subsets of the full models in each case have been considered (except for chick size, where chick age was kept in all models as a necessary control). The full lists of candidate models are provided in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111180.s002" href="#pone.0111180.s002">Tables S2</a>–
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111180.s011" href="#pone.0111180.s011">S11</a>. The strength of support for competing candidate models was assessed using AIC corrected for small sample size (AICc 
   <a rid="pone.0111180-Burnham1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Burnham1">[34]</a>) and AICc weights (
   <span class="italic">w</span>AICc). The plausible models were defined as those with ΔAIC
   <span class="italic">
    <sub>i</sub>

   <a rid="pone.0111180-Burnham1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Burnham1">[34]</a>. Model averaging of main effects excluded models in which those main effects were also included in interaction terms. Model ranking by AICc and model averaging of parameter estimates was carried out with the R package AICcmodavg

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Female identity (ID) was included where appropriate as a random effect in mixed models to account for multiple broods of individuals between and across years. Male ID was used as the random effect for the analyses of young fledged per male per breeding season and number of breeding attempts per male per breeding season. Male ID was also used as the random effect for the analysis of hatching date because male age was included as a factor (we had less data on female age). Male and female ID were never included together, female ID being nested within male ID. Several candidate models of nest survival failed to converge when fitted with random effects. For the analysis of this parameter, pseudoreplication was avoided by randomly selecting one datum per individual by the 
   <span class="italic">sample</span> procedure in R (dataset reduced from 110 nests to 99 nests) and the models were fitted with general linear models instead. For the analysis of multiple brooding by males, initial modelling for random effects did not allow for year effects because of the lack of contrasts in multiple brooding available between all of the factors treatment, hatching date and year. Modelling with random effects without year provided a standard deviation of 0 for the random effect of male ID, indicating that multiple brooding did not depend on individual identity. To allow for year effects to be included in the candidate models without discarding data, models of multiple brooding were conducted with general linear models. Unringed individuals were included within some analyses. The number of unringed individuals was relatively high in 2008 (10 males/7 females of 22 pairs), but fewer in 2009 and 2010 (5 males/7 females of 40 pairs in 2009; 5 males/5 females of 48 pairs in 2010). Thus there may have been some pseudoreplication of unringed breeders between years, although only about 50% of unringed adult birds are expected to return the following year 
   <a rid="pone.0111180-Arnold1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Arnold1">[17]</a>. Fed pairs that stopped using feeders when cages were deployed were included in analyses of clutch size and egg volume, as they were still being fed during those stages of the breeding cycle. For all other analyses, these pairs were excluded from the dataset.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total number of chicks fledged across the whole breeding season was obtained for individual parents instead of pairs (new pairs could form after failed nesting attempts and males could have simultaneous broods with multiple females). Individuals with failed broods were included in the analysis because feeding treatment may influence decisions about re-laying following nest failure. As there were no cases of multiple broods within the control group of females, we did not use linear modelling to test for an effect of food supplementation on multiple brooding by females. Instead, we used a Fisher Exact Test to test the significance of the treatment effect. Details of the models run for each breeding parameter are listed in
