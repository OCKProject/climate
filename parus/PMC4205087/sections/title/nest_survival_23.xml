 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Out of 36 nests of fed parents, 34 were successful (≥1 chick fledged) and 54 of 63 nests of control parents were successful. Mean Mayfield daily nest survival rates 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Mayfield1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Mayfield1">[36]</a> were 99.5±0.4% for nests of fed parents and 97.2±1.2% for nests of control parents. There were three plausible models of nest survival: the null model, one with treatment alone and one with standardized nest finding date alone (
