 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many animal populations are limited by food availability 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-White1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-White1">[1]</a>, which can itself be influenced by variation in climate, habitat quality and competition. For example, temperature and rainfall have strong effects on migrant bird populations by changing the abundance and phenology of their invertebrate food supply 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Both1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Both1">[2]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Studds1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Studds1">[5]</a>. The availability of invertebrates to birds may also be affected by temperature and rainfall via changes in activity of invertebrates and birds or in foraging efficiency of birds 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-GrubbJr1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-GrubbJr1">[6]</a>. This may affect the ability of insectivorous birds to obtain sufficient energy reserves for reproduction or to provide adequate food for their young 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Both1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Both1">[2]</a>. Food availability may constrain the reproductive output of migrant birds by limiting the number or quality of offspring fledged in individual nesting attempts, or by limiting the number of nesting attempts during each breeding season

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many long distance migratory birds travel to temperate zones to take advantage of seasonal peaks in food availability for breeding. Many Palaearctic songbird populations are declining 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Burfield1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Burfield1">[9]</a>; this may be due to changes in breeding productivity and/or survival rates. The underlying causes are unknown but possibilities include environmental changes in the breeding and/or wintering areas that affect the abundance of food. Successful breeding and migration both demand large quantities of food and so these stages of the annual cycle may be particularly food-limited. Food supplementation of resident and short-distance migratory songbird species usually advances laying date 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Martin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Martin1">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Robb1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Robb1">[11]</a>. The impacts of food supplementation on clutch size and fledgling production have been more varied, with some studies reporting increases 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Simons1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Simons1">[12]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Soler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Soler1">[14]</a>, others showing no effect 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Arcese1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Arcese1">[15]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Arnold1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Arnold1">[17]</a> and at least one even finding reductions in productivity 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Harrison1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Harrison1">[18]</a>. Very few studies have addressed experimentally the impacts of changes in food availability on breeding productivity of long-distance migrant songbirds 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Buchanan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Buchanan1">[19]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Thaxter1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Thaxter1">[20]</a> and these have focused on Nearctic-Neotropical migrants.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we examine the impact of an experimental manipulation of food availability on the breeding productivity of an Old World long-distance migrant songbird, the northern wheatear (
  <span class="italic">Oenanthe oenanthe</span>, henceforth “wheatear”). This species is in decline over much of Europe, including the UK 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Wretenberg1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Wretenberg1">[21]</a>, largely attributed to changes in habitat management that alters food availability 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Arlt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Arlt1">[22]</a>. We test the impact of changing food availability on reproductive success and identify the mechanisms by determining which aspects of reproductive performance and timing are most sensitive to changes in food availability. This has implications for the potential impacts of natural changes in food supply, for example due to climate or habitat changes, on wheatear populations. Our experimental design was not intended to mirror directly the changes in food availability expected under any particular climate change scenario or land-use change. Rather, by supplementing food across whole breeding seasons, we aimed to identify which aspects of the bird's breeding performance are currently limited by food availability and thus are phenotypically flexible to climate- and habitat-linked alterations in food supply.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is evidence that wheatear breeding success may be constrained by habitat characteristics linked to food availability. For example, wheatear territory quality (largely determined by vegetation height, which affects wheatear foraging success) appears to be more important than individual quality in determining reproductive success 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Currie1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Currie1">[23]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Prt2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Prt2">[25]</a>. Wheatears holding territories with experimentally-shortened vegetation rear young much more successfully than those in which the vegetation grows taller 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Prt2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Prt2">[25]</a>. Adult survival rates are also higher in wheatears breeding in territories with short field layers 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Low1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Low1">[26]</a>. Food supplementation of wheatears in a breeding area led to increased survival rates of both adults and fledged juveniles 
  <a rid="pone.0111180-Seward1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0111180-Seward1">[27]</a>, indicating that determinants of fitness are food-limited. Examining the impact of food-supplementation on breeding performance will test whether the food availability also limits the investment of adult wheatears in egg laying and brood provisioning.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The key aim of this study was to use a food supplementation experiment to test the hypothesis that food availability impacts on breeding success in wheatears. Furthermore, we explored the mechanisms for this effect by examining which of the following key aspects of the breeding cycle were most limited by food availability: timing of breeding, clutch size, egg size, hatching success, chick size, number of fledglings per nesting attempt and rates of multiple brooding.</p>
