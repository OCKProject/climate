     </span>. We also expect higher model accuracy after testing the temporal projections against temporally (but not spatially) independent data (‘Internal TT’) than against spatially and temporally independent data (‘External TT’). This hypothesis aims to assess if cross-validation procedures are good indicators of model transferability.

While holding the number of variables constant (i.e., trivariate models), model accuracy − both within and beyond the model calibration time period − will increase with the combination of different types of environmental predictors related to climate, habitat availability, and ecosystem functioning conditions.

      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">104</a>
     </span>. These ‘regional’ climate-driven models will be able to define the climate niche of species more generally (i.e. fewer omission errors) than ‘local’ models, and they can then be improved by the incorporation of land use/cover and ecosystem functioning at finer scales (i.e. Gerês-Xurés Biosphere Reserve).

     </span>. Species ecological characteristics will affect our ability to describe their distributions within the time frame used for model fitting (i.e. calibration) and to predict distributional shifts through time (i.e. temporal projections). If so, species’ traits might help to identify environmental predictors more suitable for predicting species’ distribution.
