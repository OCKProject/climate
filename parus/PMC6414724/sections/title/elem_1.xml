  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study area is the Baixa Limia-Serra do Xurés Natural Park (
   <span class="italic">c</span>. 29 345 ha), located in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1A</a>). It is included in the Gerês-Xurés transboundary UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1B</a>) and protected under EU legislation (Habitat and Bird Directives). The zone is a mountain range, with elevation gradient between 323 and 1529 m a.s.l., located in the transition between the Mediterranean and Eurosiberian biogeographic regions and in the proximity of the Atlantic coast
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>

  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used occurrence (presence/absence) data for bird species at two different scales (both spatial extent and resolution): (1) Iberian extent at 10-km resolution and (2) Gerês-Xurés Mountains at 230-m resolution (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). At the Iberian scale, bird data were obtained from the combination of the Second Spanish and Portuguese Atlases of Breeding Birds

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
   </span>. This dataset documents the occurrence of breeding bird species in 6212 grid cells of 10-km resolution (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1A</a>), with field data mostly collected between 1998 and 2005. At the Gerês-Xurés scale, bird data was surveyed in 2000 and 2010 using two different sampling methodologies. A set of 344 5-min point counts with unlimited distance were carried out in 2000 (hereafter: ‘calibration dataset’) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1C</a>). This initial dataset was partly replicated in 2010 by re-sampling a subset of 204 5-min point counts to evaluate the temporal transferability of ENMs (i.e. internal temporal transferability assessment; hereafter: ‘Internal TT’ dataset). Simultaneously, another set of 384 20-min point counts with a limited distance of 80 m was surveyed twice during the spring of 2010 to form a spatially and temporally independent data set (i.e. external temporal transferability assessment; hereafter: ‘External TT’ dataset) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1C</a>). The censuses were undertaken during the breeding season (May–June). To avoid possible detection biases caused by the time of survey, wind speed or cloud cover, all censuses were carried out during the 4 h after sunrise (peak vocal activity) and under uniform weather conditions (days without marked rainfall or wind). In the ‘External TT’ survey, the point counts were resampled in the afternoon during the 4 h before sunset (peak vocal activity).

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first developed three sets of trivariate models based exclusively upon each type of environmental predictor (henceforth ‘individual’ models): (1) Climate, (2) Land cover, and (3) EFAs (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> for a flow diagram of the modelling approach and steps). We also developed an additional set of models by using the environmental suitability predicted from the ‘individual’ models as predictor variables to integrate in a balanced way all possible combinations of these three environmental drivers within the modelling framework (henceforth ‘combined’ models) (see e.g.

Climate models were calibrated at local (Gerês-Xurés) scale at 230 m resolution (henceforth ‘local climate models’) and then combined with the environmental suitability predicted from ENMs based upon land cover and/or EFAs (henceforth ‘non-hierarchical approach’). Climate models were also calibrated at the Iberian Peninsula scale (henceforth ‘regional climate models’) at 10-km resolution. These regional climate models were then directly projected (‘direct downscaling approach’, see

These local climate projections were used as predictor variables into combined models to hierarchically integrate climate suitability calibrated at regional scale with the environmental suitability predicted from ENMs based upon land cover and/or EFAs at local scale (henceforth ‘hierarchical approach’,

   </span>: generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), generalized boosted regression models (GBM), random forest (RF), factorized distribution algorithm (FDA), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and artificial neural networks (ANN). For each technique, we used the default settings in biomod2 because these settings are optimized for SDMs (see
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
   </span>). Presence-background modelling techniques such as MaxEnt or GARP were not considered as they are designed to cope with the lack of absence data
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
   </span>, which is not the case, and did not show significant improvement in terms of predictive accuracy. We applied a 30-fold split-sample procedure by randomly selecting 70% of the data for calibration and the remaining 30% for model evaluation (hereafter ‘crossvalitation’). Our results for the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC), true skill statistic (TSS), the Cohen’s kappa coefficient were highly correlated (see Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">S3.1</a>), and consequently, we only present results on AUC − a threshold-independent method − as a means of evaluating model performance
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
   </span>. In order to quantify model ability to accurately predict presences, we also computed sensitivity (i.e. the proportion of presences that were correctly predicted) as indicator of omission errors
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
   </span>. We applied the weighted average approach for computing a consensus (hereafter ‘ensemble model’) of the single models by calculating the weighted average of all single models with AUC &gt; 0.65, using AUC values as model weights. This consensus method provides significantly more robust predictions than all the single-models and other consensus methods
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>

  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temporal transferability of the ENMs (i.e. the ability of the model to predict species distribution in a different time frame) was tested by comparing the environmental suitability predicted for 2010 − derived from ensemble models calibrated for 2000 − against observed occurrence data available for 2010 from two independent sources: (1) a dataset obtained from the replication in 2010 of a subset of the initial point counts used to calibrate the models, which enables a temporally (but not spatially) independent assessment of model transferability (i.e. ‘Internal TT’); and (2) another dataset obtained from a distinct set of locations and using a different sampling methodology, which offers a more independent − spatially and temporally − evaluation of the model transferability (i.e. ‘External TT’).</p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As described above, the AUC of the ROC and Sensitivity were also used as accuracy metrics to evaluate model transferability

   </span>. We also calculated the number of species with AUC higher than 0.7 as a complementary indicator. To compare the spatial predictions for years 2000 and 2010, derived from the different ENMs, we calculated the Schoener’s D metric, the most common measure of niche overlap
