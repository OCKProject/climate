 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings showed that ENMs developed with the three sets of predictors (namely climate, land-use/cover and EFAs) were all useful for describing the distribution of our target species (cf. Figs 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">S3.1</a>). The integration of these ecologically relevant predictors significantly increased the model performance within the calibration time period, under both the hierarchical and non-hierarchical integration approach (see ‘crossvalidation’ in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). As expected, the enhanced model performance within the calibration time was also translated into an increase in model transferability (cf. Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), providing additional support to the relevance of integrating climate and land-use/cover variables to improve our future biodiversity projections

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span> (‘H2’). In this sense, the integration of predictor variables related to ecosystem functioning − an often neglected dimension of ecological niche of species (but see
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>
  </span>) − was found to increase model performance and transferability (cf. Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), especially for migrant, forest specialist species (cf. Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Nonetheless, the overall predictive accuracy beyond the calibration time period was considerably low, being acceptable for less than 25% of modelled species (‘H1’). The lack of model transferability might be due to the existence of non-analogous conditions and, consequently, the need to extrapolate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>
  </span>. Then, low transferability is almost a consequence of high uncertainty due to extrapolation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>
  </span>. Indeed, a large spatial dissimilarity between years 2000 and 2010 was found for annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality. Theoretically, more temporally stable variables could lead to higher model transferability, but it depends upon the species to be modelled and the relative importance of those variables in the model (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">S4.1</a>). Also, land abandonment process and wildfires has been affecting landscape over the last decade (see Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">S4.2</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">S4.3</a>), with strong impacts on the bird community, as has been already documented for our study area

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. In this sense, the explicit consideration of ecologically meaningful processes for species (i.e., fire disturbance) and more mechanistic approaches when modelling species distributions might have improved the temporal transferability of our ENMs, as has been illustrated for fire-prone systems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">84</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>
  </span>. In addition, the development of more appropriate extrapolation methods can help generate more realistic predictions in different spaces or times, allowing higher model transferability and credibility

 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Theoretically, the hierarchical approach should have improved our predictions beyond the calibration time period, as regional climate models (i.e. those calibrated at Iberian scale and projected into the Gerês-Xurés conditions) should be able to capture a wider range of species distributions and, in turn, a wider range of climate conditions than local climate models (i.e. those calibrated at Gerês-Xurés level) (see spatial projections for Eurasian skylark, 
  <span class="italic">Alauda arvensis</span>, in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). Indeed, the high sensitivity of the downscaled climate projections derived from regional models (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) suggests that they were able to capture the broad climate envelope of the species, being refined with the subsequent integration of ENMs based upon land cover and ecosystem functioning variables at Gerês-Xurés scale (cf. Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). These results contribute to the mounting evidence that hierarchical approaches effectively capture the intrinsic characteristics of ecological systems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>, successfully integrating climate suitability over large scales with habitat characteristics at more local scales (see e.g.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>
  </span>). This multiscale hierarchical approach did not, however, show any advantages in terms of model transferability relative to the classic, non-hierarchical integrative approach (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), undermining its suitability for making predictions of bird distributions under global change scenarios, at least in our particular case (‘H3’). Here we applied the ‘direct approach’ to obtain fine-grained, downscaled climate suitability from models calibrated at broader scale
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span>. This approach relies on the assumption ﻿that fine-grain species distributions show the same environmental associations as distributions at the coarse grain
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span>, which might not be necessarily the case for all species. Alternative hierarchical approaches based on Bayesian modelling framework might help to overcome these limitations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>
  </span>, eventually leading to more accurate predictions. Moreover, niche truncation is one of the most challenging issues when ENMs are used to predict in other times or spaces
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>
  </span>. For example, niche truncation can result from a limited range of environmental conditions existing in the study region used to calibrate models (i.e., realized environmental space 
  <span class="italic">sensu</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">91</a>
  </span>). In our study, models calibrated at local (Gerês-Xurés) and regional (Iberian Peninsula) scales have likely resulted in different niche truncation. Then, the challenge for predictive ecology is how to deal with predictions into non-analogous conditions (i.e., beyond the point of niche truncation), which can be an important constraint, even having chosen the most appropriate predictors. Recent research has also highlighted that the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation might be caused by dependence structures in the data that might also persist in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. The large difference found between model accuracy within and beyond the calibration timeframe draws attention to the need for using independent validation data or, alternatively, block cross-validation methods if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>
  </span>. Last but not least, the lack of repeated temporal sample structure in our bird data (both at local and regional scale), required for accounting statistically for biases related to imperfect detection, is an additional source of variation
