 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All ENMs performed well during the crossvalidation procedure (AUC
  <sub>mean</sub> = 0.923 ± 0.081). However, the predictive accuracy of their temporal projections was much lower when tested against temporally (i.e. ‘Internal TT’; AUC
  <sub>mean</sub> = 0.615 ± 0.071) and spatiotemporally (i.e. ‘External TT’; AUC
  <sub>mean</sub> = 0.601 ± 0.067) independent datasets (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). The low temporal transferability (AUC was higher than 0.7 for less than 25% of species) indicates that the ability of the models to predict distributional shifts is limited.

    <p>Model performance and transferability measured by AUC and sensitivity values for each set of predictors, modelling approach, and type of evaluation. For all box plots, lower and upper whiskers encompass the 95% interval, lower and upper hinges indicate the first and third quartiles, and the central black line indicates the median value.</p>
