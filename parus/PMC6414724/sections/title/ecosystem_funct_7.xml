 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecosystem functional attributes (EFAs) were derived from the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) obtained from 16-day maximum value composite images captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor at a spatial resolution of ∼230 m. EVI is related to the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by vegetation. EVI proved to have better sensitivity in high biomass regions and lower influence from the canopy background and atmospheric noise than other vegetation indices

  </span>. Three independent metrics of the EVI seasonal dynamics were calculated for 2001 (MODIS complete year closest to 2000) and 2010: (1) EVI annual mean, an estimator of annual primary production, which is one of the most integrative descriptors of ecosystem functioning (productivity indicator); (2) EVI seasonal standard deviation, a descriptor of the difference in carbon gains between seasons (seasonality indicator); and (3) the date of the maximum EVI value, an indicator of the growing season peak, as it indicates the most productive month during the year (phenology indicator) (see
