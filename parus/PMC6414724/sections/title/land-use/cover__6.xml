 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The land-use/cover variables were derived from optical and thermal multispectral bands of Landsat TM and ETM + images acquired over the same temporal sequence as the bird sampling was carried out (20 March 2000, 8 June 2000, 24 June 2000, 19 May 2010 and 30 July 2010). The land-cover classification was obtained using a hybrid classification procedure, which combines unsupervised and supervised strategies

  </span> (see details in Supplementary Information 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">S2</a>). Land-use/cover types were then aggregated in broad categories to describe the landscape composition, and three main categories were selected to describe habitat preference for the target bird species: (1) scrubland, (2) forest and (3) cropland. Land-use/cover variables represent the percentage of these three main categories in each geographic unit (i.e. grid cell), and they were resampled from their original resolution of 30 m to the spatial resolution of the EFAs (~230 m).
