   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
   </span>). In particular, 19 climate variables were computed for each year from monthly time series of air temperatures (mean maximum and mean minimum temperature) and total precipitation by using the function ‘
   <span class="italic">biovars</span>’ available in the R package ‘
   <span class="italic">dismo</span>’, version 1.1–4
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
   </span>. From the initial set of 19 climate variables, we selected the two most ecologically relevant for the bird species according to expert knowledge and scientific literature

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
   </span>: (1) the maximum temperature of the warmest month, and (2) the average annual precipitation. A third predictor variable − (3) seasonality of precipitation (i.e. coefficient of variation) − was also selected after ensuring no problems related to collinearity with the other climate variables (see Supplementary Information 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a> for correlations between pairs of predictors, description and visualization). Climate variables were resampled from their original resolution of 200 m to 230 m in order to match the spatial resolution of the EFAs.

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The land-use/cover variables were derived from optical and thermal multispectral bands of Landsat TM and ETM + images acquired over the same temporal sequence as the bird sampling was carried out (20 March 2000, 8 June 2000, 24 June 2000, 19 May 2010 and 30 July 2010). The land-cover classification was obtained using a hybrid classification procedure, which combines unsupervised and supervised strategies

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
   </span> (see details in Supplementary Information 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">S2</a>). Land-use/cover types were then aggregated in broad categories to describe the landscape composition, and three main categories were selected to describe habitat preference for the target bird species: (1) scrubland, (2) forest and (3) cropland. Land-use/cover variables represent the percentage of these three main categories in each geographic unit (i.e. grid cell), and they were resampled from their original resolution of 30 m to the spatial resolution of the EFAs (~230 m).

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecosystem functional attributes (EFAs) were derived from the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) obtained from 16-day maximum value composite images captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor at a spatial resolution of ∼230 m. EVI is related to the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by vegetation. EVI proved to have better sensitivity in high biomass regions and lower influence from the canopy background and atmospheric noise than other vegetation indices
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
   </span>. Three independent metrics of the EVI seasonal dynamics were calculated for 2001 (MODIS complete year closest to 2000) and 2010: (1) EVI annual mean, an estimator of annual primary production, which is one of the most integrative descriptors of ecosystem functioning (productivity indicator); (2) EVI seasonal standard deviation, a descriptor of the difference in carbon gains between seasons (seasonality indicator); and (3) the date of the maximum EVI value, an indicator of the growing season peak, as it indicates the most productive month during the year (phenology indicator) (see
