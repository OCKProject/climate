 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate variables were calculated from meteorological stations in Spain and Portugal by using multiple regression techniques (see details in
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>). In particular, 19 climate variables were computed for each year from monthly time series of air temperatures (mean maximum and mean minimum temperature) and total precipitation by using the function ‘
  <span class="italic">biovars</span>’ available in the R package ‘
  <span class="italic">dismo</span>’, version 1.1–4
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>. From the initial set of 19 climate variables, we selected the two most ecologically relevant for the bird species according to expert knowledge and scientific literature

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>: (1) the maximum temperature of the warmest month, and (2) the average annual precipitation. A third predictor variable − (3) seasonality of precipitation (i.e. coefficient of variation) − was also selected after ensuring no problems related to collinearity with the other climate variables (see Supplementary Information 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a> for correlations between pairs of predictors, description and visualization). Climate variables were resampled from their original resolution of 200 m to 230 m in order to match the spatial resolution of the EFAs.
