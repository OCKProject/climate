  <span class="italic">c</span>. 29 345 ha), located in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1A</a>). It is included in the Gerês-Xurés transboundary UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1B</a>) and protected under EU legislation (Habitat and Bird Directives). The zone is a mountain range, with elevation gradient between 323 and 1529 m a.s.l., located in the transition between the Mediterranean and Eurosiberian biogeographic regions and in the proximity of the Atlantic coast

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. The area has been greatly affected by the abandonment of traditional agricultural and livestock activities, which has favoured vegetation encroachment and recent forest expansion
