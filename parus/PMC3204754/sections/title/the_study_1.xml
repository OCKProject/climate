 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A wide variety of bird species from all regions of South Korea were tested, and particular attention was paid to susceptible species and birds with neurologic signs. Carcasses of wild birds submitted to the Conservation Genome Resource Bank for Korean Wildlife, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea, were used for this study. The study also included samples from dead wild birds submitted to the Animal Disease Diagnostic Center of the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of South Korea.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Investigation focused on the presumed peak period of mosquito vector activity (April–October) and included samples from dead wild birds. A total of 715 wild birds (belonging to 72 species) from all regions of South Korea were found dead and were examined during 2005–2008. All carcasses underwent postmortem examination, during which samples were obtained for diagnosis. In 2005, a total of 51 samples were tested; 167 samples were tested in 2006, 239 in 2007, and 258 in 2008. Taxonomic families of the collected birds and their migratory status are shown in

  <span class="italic">Ae. monachus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. fabalis</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">A. albifrons</span> birds, which are known to migrate from the Russian Eastern Region to South Korea (

  <span class="italic">Corvidae</span> spp. and raptors (
  <span class="italic">Accipitridae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Strigidae</span> spp.), which have been identified as potential sources of WNV for resident birds (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carcasses were subjected to necropsy, and brains and kidneys were obtained. Organs were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (10% suspension) and centrifuged. Ten 50% tissue culture infectious doses of a stock WNV were used as a control for antigen detection. WNV RNA in samples was investigated by reverse transcription–PCR with primers (Table). Information on the RNA extraction and the reverse transcription–PCR used is available in the 
  <a ref-type="local data" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Technical Appendix</a>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During 2005–2008, we analyzed 1,309 organ samples (639 brain and 670 kidney) from dead birds for WNV RNA. WNV was not detected in these samples. Diagnostic examination of wild birds as a part of the nationwide surveillance has not detected patterns or clusters of birds with evidence of neurologic disease or viral encephalitides suggestive of WNV infection. Several cases of mass die-offs among wild birds were the result of chemical poisoning (
