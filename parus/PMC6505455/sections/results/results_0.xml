 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A diverse population of birds belonging to 64 families were identified in the riverine areas along the Bhagirathi river (upper Ganges) at different elevations during the survey period. A total of 280 bird species were encountered during the survey period which constitutes almost 40% of the total number of species (693) reported from the state of Uttarakhand (

  <a rid="T4715785" ref-type="table" href="#T4715785">1</a>). Over 30 bird species, that are solely dependent on the river or use it opportunistically, were recorded during this survey period (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4715755" href="#F4715755">2</a>). The maximum number of species recorded were terrestrial, with no mention of water in habitat accounts (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4715755" href="#F4715755">2</a>). Bird species richness varied greatly with elevation and across seasons. Maximum number of species (n=178) were recorded in mid-elevation sites in and around Uttarkashi and the least (n=41) were recorded in high elevation sites around Gangotri (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4715741" href="#F4715741">3</a>). Species richness was consistently higher in the lowest elevations (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4715741" href="#F4715741">3</a>), although some species, residing around the elevations between 300 to 700 m asl, were not hill birds, such as the Jungle Babbler, Indian Peafowl, Red-vented Bulbul, Spotted Dove and Brown-headed Barbet (Table 
  <a rid="T4715785" ref-type="table" href="#T4715785">1</a>). Although few species were recorded at high elevations in winter, species richness was high around Harsil (at 2,500 m asl) in summer. In winter, species richness decreased sharply with elevation (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4715741" href="#F4715741">3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was a large amount of seasonal turnover at each location, demonstrating substantial elevational migration undertaken by a large fraction of the avian community (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4715741" href="#F4715741">3</a>). Lower elevations (Rishikesh and Devprayag) showed more species in winter, where a number of species used/preferred these habitats as wintering grounds to escape the harsh winters. This pattern is common and has been observed in previous studies in Western Himalayas with mid- and high-elevation habitats experiencing high species turnover between winters and summers (

Adults, sub-adults and chicks were seen on multiple occasions. Adults were recorded year-round feeding from shingle beds near Bagori village and Dharali in the Harsil valley. Breeding grounds of Ibisbill were documented in Harsil and our records qualify this population as resident (

On one occasion, a pair (male and female) was seen during low light period of early morning hours (near Gangani, Uttarkashi district) at an elevation of 2,200 m asl on 11 November 2017. The birds were spotted on the highway basking in the sun, the habitat being dominated by tall grass, dense bushes and oak (

  </span>) forests. The birds were very shy and flew off immediately. On another occasion, a single individual was photo-captured in a pine forest near Devprayag (850 m asl). The bird, being a habitat specialist, requires open, early successional habitats in the Himalaya. The bird remains in few small refuges with its habitat being heavily disturbed (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4788541" href="#F4788541">a</a>): A single bird was seen in Harsil in late May 2014 at around 5:00 p.m. The bird was feeding voraciously by pecking on insects from the river bed while walking for small stretches intermittently. It continued feeding till light faded. It was seen in this locality for two consecutive days though there were no further sightings. This individual might be a vagrant which used this site as a stopover during the long migration back to the Mongolian highlands. The species is a new record at this altitude (2,500 m asl) for the state of Uttarakhand.

It manoeuvred efficiently, confirming its tactics of surprise hunting by flying swiftly amidst houses, shrubs and tall trees. The species is known to prefer well vegetated broadleaf and coniferous forests at high elevations almost up to treeline in the Himalaya (

It occupied coniferous forests, almost invariably in the vicinity of torrential streams. They were usually seen foraging from top canopy, but often in the middle canopy of very tall deodars.
