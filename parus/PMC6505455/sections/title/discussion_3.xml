 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Riverine habitats are important for birds globally, with around 60 specialist species recognised and up to 23% of all bird species utilising freshwaters, including rivers, for part or all of their life cycles (

  <a rid="B4775943" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4775943">Ormerod and Tyler 1993</a>). The present study reveals that riverine areas along Himalayan headwaters hold a rich avian community with a representation from 64 families. This corroborates that riverine areas provide a range of habitats required for species belonging to different families. Qualitative field studies like ours can potentially provide the baseline data for ecological questions pertaining to the effects of habitat modification apart from understanding the basic ecology of individual species or communities. Natural habitats are undergoing rapid modification owing to multiple stressors and documenting information on wildlife residing in natural versus modified habitats can provide insight to management needs. Recognition of the riparian corridor as significant areas of maintaining regional biodiversity holds promise for issues related to watershed management. Alteration of river flow regimes is a global concern in terms of maintaining the integrity of these land-water ecotone habitats (
  <a rid="B4775915" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4775915">Naiman et al. 1993</a>). Forests along headwater streams may be important habitats for many species. Unfortunately, in India, the location of most dams overlap with species-rich areas in the Himalaya (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding species habitat requirements is imperative in guiding management recommendations for conservation planning, as it may help to reduce the division often apparent between modellers and conservation practitioners. Observational field studies, like ours, lay the foundation for the same by documentaing species distribution for areas which lie outside protected areas. Shifts in the structure and function of many freshwater ecosystems are attributed to climatic changes leading to decreases in primary productivity and uncoupling of trophic linkages along with shifts in the composition of riverine communities. This renders these riverine ecosystems and dependent flora and fauna vulnerable to ecological malfunctioning and ultimately biodiversity loss. Specifically in our study area, due to the development of the Tehri dam and Koteshwar hydropower plant, around 153 km (almost 71%) of river length has been affected. Bank-nesting species are vulnerable to loss of riparian habitat and nest flooding during sensitive periods of their annual cycles such as breeding (
  <a rid="B4776078" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4776078">Chiu et al. 2008</a>, 
  <a rid="B4736892" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4736892">Chiu et al. 2013</a>
  <a rid="B4776004" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4776004">Roche et al. 2012</a>). Riverine areas not only provide remnant habitats for many habitat specialists discussed above, but also provide corridors between otherwise isolated pockets of habitats. Conflicts between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provided by riverine areas may ultimately arise, with global freshwater resources likely to be further stressed due to increasing demand for water needed to sustain growing human populations and changing climate. As many riverine forest sites are bound to undergo irreversible changes, conservation efforts focused at a large spatial scale with considerations for natural fluvial geomorphic processes should be prioritised.
