 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Himalaya encompasses the highest mountains in the world; snow and glacier melt run-off being the major source of water for the Himalayan rivers. Biogeographically, this enormous mountain range has been divided into Northwestern-, Western-, Central-, Eastern- and Trans-Himalayan regions (
  <a rid="B4776014" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4776014">Rodgers and Panwar 1988</a>). This study was conducted along the river Bhagirathi, one of the major headstreams of the Upper Ganges in the state of Uttarakhand in the Western Indian Himalaya. Field surveys were undertaken along a 217 km river stretch, between an elevational gradient of 330 m asl (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The catchment has mean summer temperatures of 1.3°C–39.6°C and winter temperatures of -27.4 to 7.6°C, while annual precipitation ranges from 533–2,284 mm. Given the large altitudinal relief, the study area is characterised by diverse biomes. The river flows through deep gorges and narrow valleys and is lined by different land-uses ranging from agriculture to urban sprawls. The development of Tehri dam, Koteshwar hydropower plant and Kotli-Bhel hydropower project (under development in Bhagirathi basin) has led to the diversion of approximately 68 km (31%) of the river Bhagirathi; around 85 km (39%) of the riverine buffer zone has been submerged to a width of 1 km (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A pilot survey was conducted in the study area to understand the different habitat types present and the utilisation of those habitat types by various bird species. For every sighting, the habitat use by individual birds was noted and behaviour was classified as feeding, roosting or nesting. Bird checklists were meticulously maintained in all the accessible areas along the river around Rishikesh (300 m asl), Devprayag (700 m asl), New Tehri (2,100 m asl), Uttarkashi (1,300 m asl), Harsil (2,500 m asl) and Gangotri (3,200 m asl). Exhaustive bird lists were made during pre-monsoon (February-June) and post-monsoon (September-January) seasons at each of these locations between April 2013 and May 2018. A total of 72 trails of 500 m length each were walked at different times of the year by a single observer every time. Out of these, 41 were permanent which were sampled thrice every season for all the years. Apart from these, opportunistic sightings were also noted. Both vocalisations and direct sightings were used for bird identification. Photographs were taken on all possible occasions for future reference and especially for rare species previously unrecorded from this region. The identification of birds was based on standard literature (

  <a rid="B4786206" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4786206">Praveen et al. 2018</a>). To understand broad patterns of habitat use by different bird species, birds were classified into three major functional categories; (A) riverine: habitat especially or generally near water, (B) riparian: riparian or water mentioned in habitat accounts and (C) terrestrial: woodlands, grasslands or no mention of water in habitat accounts, based on field observations and literature collated from
