 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural riverine areas encompass interfaces between land-aquatic systems with sharp environmental gradients representing the most diverse, dynamic and complex biophysical habitats on earth (
  <a rid="B4775915" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4775915">Naiman et al. 1993</a>). Although riparian corridors are well known for their high levels of biodiversity, the values have seldom been quantified. While riparian zones typically are a small component of the landscape, they provide an essential habitat for many species of birds (
  <a rid="B4783727" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4783727">Knopf 1985</a>, 
  <a rid="B4736732" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4736732">Stauffer and Best 1980</a>, 
  <a rid="B4736722" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4736722">Stevens et al. 1977</a>). Riverine systems, being prone to large-scale habitat alterations due to natural and climatic fluctuations, call for devising potential indicators for monitoring ecosystem health. Birds are conspicuous, operate at multiple scales and often occupy apex positions in food webs. Thus, they suffice as potential candidates for long-term monitoring purposes, especially through popular citizen-science programmes. Riparian ecotones often support an avian community that is more diverse and with a higher abundance than the surrounding uplands (

  <a rid="B4736732" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4736732">Stauffer and Best 1980</a>). Riverine forests also support high densities and diversities of migratory birds providing pathways and edge cover during migration (

  <a rid="B4775915" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4775915">Naiman et al. 1993</a>). In addition, species may use riparian areas differentially throughout the season (
  <a rid="B4775994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4775994">Rice and Anderson 1980</a>); hence, habitat associations of different species need to be monitored across seasons to thoroughly appraise riparian zones for conservation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Himalayan mountain system is globally renowned for its notable biological diversity, supported by the complex orogeny and consequent climatic and edaphic conditions. The avifauna of the Western Himalaya, an Endemic Bird Area (
  <a rid="B4783763" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4783763">Jathar and Rahmani 2006</a>), has attracted a number of ornithologists and naturalists over the years. Birds inhabiting this region show a large variety of distributional patterns with some species being restricted to narrow elevational bands while others are relatively broadly distributed. Amongst these, a large number undertake short migration from higher elevation breeding grounds to warmer lower elevations for wintering (
  <a rid="B4736781" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4736781">Grimmett et al. 2013</a>). Thus, the avifaunal assemblage of any particular location remains dynamic.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat alteration remains a major threat to montane ecosystems around the world, the phenomenon being pronounced in the Himalaya. Parallel to being biodiverse, freshwater systems are abode to millions of human population, the Ganges being the most densely populated river basin of the world (
  <a rid="B4783741" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4783741">Immerzeel et al. 2010</a>). Distortion of land and water due to developmental projects and increasing agricultural pressure is well documented in this region (
  <a rid="B4736771" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4736771">Grumbine and Pandit 2013</a>, 
  <a rid="B4775905" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4775905">Manel et al. 2000</a>) and warrant a dire need to document the floral and faunal diversity of natural versus modified landscapes. Misapprehending the risks involved in land-use decisions, including the construction of hydroelectric dams in the Indian Himalaya (
  <a rid="B4736842" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4736842">Bandyopadhyay 1995</a>), can lead to large scale negligence towards biodiversity conservation strategies. Biodiversity loss has multiple causes, but habitat destruction via land-use change has remained a predominant driver (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we inventoried the avifauna of the Bhagirathi Valley in the Western Himalayan Region, India. There exists no previous published literature concerning avifauna for this region. We documented bird species occurring in the region during pre- and post-monsoon seasons along with reporting of some opportunistic records. We have discussed the habitat associations of the recorded bird species along with their seasonal distribution in the river basin. We also report some noteworthy sightings which are new to this region and the state. This is the first published multi-year study of distribution patterns of birds from the Bhagirathi valley, Uttarakhand, India.</p>
