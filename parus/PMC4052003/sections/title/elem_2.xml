  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Wuyur River originates from the western foot of Xiaoxin’an Mountain, northeastern China, of which the watershed is presented to be an elongated strip and flows through the main food production zone of Heilongjiang Province in China (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), wherein contact with heavy metals like Hg is increased. The lower reaches of the river way are replaced by a large area of reed marsh after entering into the Zhalong Wetland. Zhalong Wetland covers an area of 2,100 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> (123° 51′ to 124° 37′ E, 46° 48′ to 47° 32′ N) (core area, which is the roosting and breeding site of endangered water birds, e.g., red-crowned cranes, is approximately 700 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>; buffer zone occupies 1,400 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> surrounding of the core area for protecting other common water birds) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). A large area of pristine reed marsh attracts a population of more than approximately 500 migratory red-crowned cranes to inhabit and breed there from the late March to the early November (approximately 8 months) per year.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tectonically, the wetland was formed by alluvial deposits with an average altitude of 140 m with 4,700 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> of agricultural land around it (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>). River feeding and precipitation are the major sources of water in this inland reed marsh. Climatically, the wetland has a typical temperate, semiarid, and semihumid continental monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 410 mm and a potential evaporation of 1,500 mm. The volume of runoff from upper reaches was abruptly decreased from 7.5 × 10
   <span class="sup">8</span> m
   <span class="sup">3</span> per year in the 1980s to less than 1 × 10
   <span class="sup">8</span> m
   <span class="sup">3</span> per year in the twenty-first century. Various sludges and wasted water from the surrounding residential area, agricultural land, and industrial workshop containing several types of toxic contaminants, like Hg, were discharged directly into the wetland without complete disposal treatment. The wastewater discharge volume increased from 0.17 × 10
   <span class="sup">8</span> m

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 19 sampling sites were designed for aquatic plant (i.e., reed) and aquatic animal collection. The first set of two sample sites (i.e., S1 and S2) was in the middle reaches of Wuyur catchments, the second set of ten sample sites (S3–S10, S15, and S16) was in buffer zone A of the Zhalong marsh, the third set of six sample sites (i.e., S11–S14, S17, and S18) was in the core area of the wetland, and the remaining one sample (S19) was designed in buffer zone B of the wetland (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>). Three parts of reed organ, i.e., root, rhizome, and stem, and three aquatic animal families, i.e., 
   <span class="italic">Perccottus glenni</span> Dybowski, 
   <span class="italic">Cybister japonicus</span> Sharp, and Viviparidae, that are typical preys of the red-crown crane in the wetland were collected at designed sampling sites (see details in Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Surface sediment at each site was sampled simultaneously. All of the prey samples were rinsed thoroughly in field with distilled water to remove pollutants attached on their body, then placed in car refrigerator at −4 °C, and transported back to the laboratory.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Excretions (mainly feces) of the red-crowned cranes were collected in late October of 2011, and after-hatch residual eggshells were collected from the field in late April and early May of 2012. The outer parts of feces were carefully removed, and the core parts of the feces were picked up to avoid the influence by the sediment. We collected residual eggshell samples left by the red-crowned cranes at four nesting sites (S10, S13, S15, and S17) and excretion at sites S15 and S17. Similarly, the eggshells were washed with distilled water in the field and immediately transferred to the laboratory.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four red-crowned crane carcasses were collected at four nesting sites: one adult crane was collected in early April of 2010 at site S10 [body weight (BW) 9.4 kg, male]; two subadult cranes were found in early November at site S13 (BW 6.5 kg, female) and site S15 (BW 6.8 kg, male), and both dead cranes had almost no residues in their stomach, but with few grass seeds and stems; and one adult crane sample found in late October of 2012 at S17 (an obvious fracture injury was found in the right wing; BW 8.3 kg, male). The direct death cause for these crane samples was starvation because of food shortage in freezing condition as reported by our previous research [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. The cranes were immediately transferred to the laboratory for dissection. Approximately, 1- to 2-g samples of livers, kidney, and breast muscles were collected using a stainless steel knife. Polyethylene gloves were used throughout all dissection procedures to prevent contamination. Some flight feathers were also collected from the cranes and washed with distilled water in the laboratory.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After drying the reed organs, aquatic animal body, eggshell, and feathers of red-crowned crane samples with filter papers, these samples were oven-dried to a constant weight (48 h at 60 °C). The dried samples were ground to homogenous powders in a quartz bowl for acid digestion. Similar processes were performed on the feces subsamples, liver, kidney, and muscle of red-crowned crane, without washing and drying in the laboratory.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 0.5 g of each category sample was acid digested in a microwave according to USEPA (1996) methods [

Triplicate subsamples of known dry weight were digested in acid mixture, evaporated slowly to almost dryness (90 °C), and the residue was dissolved in 5 ml 1:1 diluted HCl and then settled to 25 ml for analysis after the solution cooled down to room temperature.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We determined T-Hg concentration in sediments, prey tissues, and the body and excretions of a red-crowned crane using a mercury analyzer (Tekran 2600 CVAFS; Tekran Instrument Corporation, Knoxville, USA) with a detection limit of 0.005 μg kg
   <span class="sup">−1</span>. Prior to Hg measurement, we used a reagent blank composed of 30 % HCl to set a zero reading. To verify the performance of the instrument, a certified reference material was analyzed before, during, and at the end of every run.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MeHg was extracted from the tissues of water animals and red-crowned cranes according to the method developed by Zheng et al. [

   <sub>4</sub> solution. After shaking for 10 min, the solution was filtered. The samples were buffered to pH 4 with either 2 M HCl or 6 M NaOH solution. Thereafter, the filtrate was passed through a sulfhydryl cotton tube filled with 0.1 g cotton and was eluted by 1 ml of 2 M HCl solution. This process was repeated twice more under additional solvent (1 ml). MeHg was extracted from the elution with benzene. It was then analyzed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection and a detection limit of 0.1 μg kg

The results agreed with the certified values for all metals, with average recovery rates of 91.7 and 92.4 % for T-Hg and MeHg, respectively. All of the materials used for sampling and analysis were acid-washed. Moreover, all of the samples were analyzed in triplicate at a relative standard deviation lower than 1.5 %.
