 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 19 sampling sites were designed for aquatic plant (i.e., reed) and aquatic animal collection. The first set of two sample sites (i.e., S1 and S2) was in the middle reaches of Wuyur catchments, the second set of ten sample sites (S3–S10, S15, and S16) was in buffer zone A of the Zhalong marsh, the third set of six sample sites (i.e., S11–S14, S17, and S18) was in the core area of the wetland, and the remaining one sample (S19) was designed in buffer zone B of the wetland (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>). Three parts of reed organ, i.e., root, rhizome, and stem, and three aquatic animal families, i.e., 
  <span class="italic">Perccottus glenni</span> Dybowski, 
  <span class="italic">Cybister japonicus</span> Sharp, and Viviparidae, that are typical preys of the red-crown crane in the wetland were collected at designed sampling sites (see details in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Surface sediment at each site was sampled simultaneously. All of the prey samples were rinsed thoroughly in field with distilled water to remove pollutants attached on their body, then placed in car refrigerator at −4 °C, and transported back to the laboratory.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Excretions (mainly feces) of the red-crowned cranes were collected in late October of 2011, and after-hatch residual eggshells were collected from the field in late April and early May of 2012. The outer parts of feces were carefully removed, and the core parts of the feces were picked up to avoid the influence by the sediment. We collected residual eggshell samples left by the red-crowned cranes at four nesting sites (S10, S13, S15, and S17) and excretion at sites S15 and S17. Similarly, the eggshells were washed with distilled water in the field and immediately transferred to the laboratory.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four red-crowned crane carcasses were collected at four nesting sites: one adult crane was collected in early April of 2010 at site S10 [body weight (BW) 9.4 kg, male]; two subadult cranes were found in early November at site S13 (BW 6.5 kg, female) and site S15 (BW 6.8 kg, male), and both dead cranes had almost no residues in their stomach, but with few grass seeds and stems; and one adult crane sample found in late October of 2012 at S17 (an obvious fracture injury was found in the right wing; BW 8.3 kg, male). The direct death cause for these crane samples was starvation because of food shortage in freezing condition as reported by our previous research [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. The cranes were immediately transferred to the laboratory for dissection. Approximately, 1- to 2-g samples of livers, kidney, and breast muscles were collected using a stainless steel knife. Polyethylene gloves were used throughout all dissection procedures to prevent contamination. Some flight feathers were also collected from the cranes and washed with distilled water in the laboratory.
