 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Wuyur River originates from the western foot of Xiaoxin’an Mountain, northeastern China, of which the watershed is presented to be an elongated strip and flows through the main food production zone of Heilongjiang Province in China (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), wherein contact with heavy metals like Hg is increased. The lower reaches of the river way are replaced by a large area of reed marsh after entering into the Zhalong Wetland. Zhalong Wetland covers an area of 2,100 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (123° 51′ to 124° 37′ E, 46° 48′ to 47° 32′ N) (core area, which is the roosting and breeding site of endangered water birds, e.g., red-crowned cranes, is approximately 700 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>; buffer zone occupies 1,400 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> surrounding of the core area for protecting other common water birds) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). A large area of pristine reed marsh attracts a population of more than approximately 500 migratory red-crowned cranes to inhabit and breed there from the late March to the early November (approximately 8 months) per year.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tectonically, the wetland was formed by alluvial deposits with an average altitude of 140 m with 4,700 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of agricultural land around it (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>). River feeding and precipitation are the major sources of water in this inland reed marsh. Climatically, the wetland has a typical temperate, semiarid, and semihumid continental monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 410 mm and a potential evaporation of 1,500 mm. The volume of runoff from upper reaches was abruptly decreased from 7.5 × 10
  <span class="sup">8</span> m
  <span class="sup">3</span> per year in the 1980s to less than 1 × 10
  <span class="sup">8</span> m
  <span class="sup">3</span> per year in the twenty-first century. Various sludges and wasted water from the surrounding residential area, agricultural land, and industrial workshop containing several types of toxic contaminants, like Hg, were discharged directly into the wetland without complete disposal treatment. The wastewater discharge volume increased from 0.17 × 10
  <span class="sup">8</span> m
  <span class="sup">3</span> in 1993 to 0.45 × 10
  <span class="sup">8</span> m
  <span class="sup">3</span> in 2010. Increasing amount of pollution discharges elevated various toxic element concentrations not only in the sediment but also in the entire biota.
