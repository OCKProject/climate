 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mercury (Hg) is a relatively common element in the environment and comes in various organic and inorganic forms. However, it is a primary concern for water fowls because it affects their health [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Hence, Hg is undesirable and potentially hazardous to the environment and its biota [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. The effect of Hg on aquatic environments has been investigated extensively [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. According to these studies, large quantities of the Hg that enter in these environments are often attached to particulate matter [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>] and are readily taken up by plants [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. As a result, elevated Hg is returned to consumers at the upper trophic level [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. The high concentration of Hg in soil generally enhances the Hg content in plants and water animals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Therefore, we must determine the buildup of Hg concentration in aquatic birds and their prey to detect net change in ecological systems.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent research has shown that the body burden of metals in animals is proportional to the metal content in the environment [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Frequently, environmentally sensitive aquatic plants (i.e., reed) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>], fish [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>], and water birds are often employed to indicate the pollution levels of a metal-contaminated region [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The red-crowned crane (
  <span class="italic">Grus japonensis</span>) is a rare international species that has been near extinction since 2000, as indicated in the Red List of Endangered Species generated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Worldwide, its population is very small at 2,750 mature individuals. Although the resident population in Japan remains stable [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], the migratory population in mainland Asia continually declines because of the loss and degradation of wetlands for agricultural and industrial development [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. Red-crowned cranes are omnivores and typically feed on aquatic plants (e.g., reed roots and stems) and water animals (e.g., fish, shells, and aquatic insects). Thus, their dietary intake of Hg is significantly affected by their prey [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. This Hg eventually accumulates in the bodies of the red-crowned cranes, given that they roost and nest in stable sites for years. Thus, they may be chronically exposed to contaminated habitats and prey [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zhalong National Nature Reserve (Zhalong Wetland), in the downstream Wuyur catchments, northeastern China, is one of the largest habitant and breeding sites for migratory red-crowned crane. More than 30 petrochemical plants located in the midstream of the catchments and large area of arable land around the wetland may bring about some amount of Hg accumulation and high probability of contact of cranes with the toxic chemical. An adverse factor is that all rare species such as the red-crowned cranes in China are protected in legislation, and any intentional killing of those rare water fowls is prohibited. An alternative approach is to investigate Hg contamination level in their habitats [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>] and to examine their external tissues (e.g., feather and egg) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>] and excretions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. In our previous research, feces were found to contain a measurable level of Cd and suitable as an indicator for body burden of Cd on red-crowned crane [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. However, data are scarce on body burden and dietary exposure to Hg on the water bird in this region.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This research examines the levels of total mercury (T-Hg) and methyl mercury (MeHg) in the prey of the red-crowned crane to estimate the exposure levels of red-crowned cranes and to determine whether their feathers, excretions (mainly feces), and eggshells can indicate Hg contamination in the bodies of these birds. The present study is the first to investigate the accumulation of Hg in and the dietary exposure of red-crowned cranes to this element in northeastern China. The results from this research enrich our understanding of the ecological safety of the health of migratory red-crowned cranes in China.</p>
