 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After drying the reed organs, aquatic animal body, eggshell, and feathers of red-crowned crane samples with filter papers, these samples were oven-dried to a constant weight (48 h at 60 °C). The dried samples were ground to homogenous powders in a quartz bowl for acid digestion. Similar processes were performed on the feces subsamples, liver, kidney, and muscle of red-crowned crane, without washing and drying in the laboratory.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 0.5 g of each category sample was acid digested in a microwave according to USEPA (1996) methods [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. Five milliliters of 3:7 H
  <sub>2</sub>SO
  <sub>4</sub>:HNO
  <sub>3</sub> (trace metal grade) was added to each subsample [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>], which was then refluxed at about 150 °C for 3 h. Triplicate subsamples of known dry weight were digested in acid mixture, evaporated slowly to almost dryness (90 °C), and the residue was dissolved in 5 ml 1:1 diluted HCl and then settled to 25 ml for analysis after the solution cooled down to room temperature.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We determined T-Hg concentration in sediments, prey tissues, and the body and excretions of a red-crowned crane using a mercury analyzer (Tekran 2600 CVAFS; Tekran Instrument Corporation, Knoxville, USA) with a detection limit of 0.005 μg kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Prior to Hg measurement, we used a reagent blank composed of 30 % HCl to set a zero reading. To verify the performance of the instrument, a certified reference material was analyzed before, during, and at the end of every run.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MeHg was extracted from the tissues of water animals and red-crowned cranes according to the method developed by Zheng et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. These tissues were dried in their digestion vessels. All of the subsamples were then heated overnight at approximately 60 °C prior to the addition of 50 ml of 2 M HCl and 1 ml of 1 % CuSO
  <sub>4</sub> solution. After shaking for 10 min, the solution was filtered. The samples were buffered to pH 4 with either 2 M HCl or 6 M NaOH solution. Thereafter, the filtrate was passed through a sulfhydryl cotton tube filled with 0.1 g cotton and was eluted by 1 ml of 2 M HCl solution. This process was repeated twice more under additional solvent (1 ml). MeHg was extracted from the elution with benzene. It was then analyzed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection and a detection limit of 0.1 μg kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the precision and accuracy of the applied analytical method based on certified reference materials (GBW-07601 for T-Hg, 0.36 ± 0.05 mg kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span>; GBW-07604 for MeHg, 0.026 ± 0.003 mg kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) in relation to the measured values (trace metals in fish muscle and the feathers of the red-crowned crane). The results agreed with the certified values for all metals, with average recovery rates of 91.7 and 92.4 % for T-Hg and MeHg, respectively. All of the materials used for sampling and analysis were acid-washed. Moreover, all of the samples were analyzed in triplicate at a relative standard deviation lower than 1.5 %.
