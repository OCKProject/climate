 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The red-crowned cranes accumulated measurable levels of Hg. The order of contamination is as follows: feces &lt; muscle &lt; eggshell &lt; liver &lt; kidney &lt; feathers (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). The feathers contained the highest concentrations of T-Hg and MeHg at 3.89 and 2.67 ppm, respectively. Furthermore, the Hg concentration in the internal organs was relatively high. In the kidney, T-Hg content varied from 0.89 to 2.73 ppm, and MeHg concentration ranged from 0.62 to 2.46 ppm. In the liver, T-Hg varied from 0.68 to 2.48 ppm, and MeHg concentration ranged from 0.48 to 2.24 ppm. Furthermore, these organs were the most prone to Hg accumulation, i.e., the 2.73 ppm of T-Hg accumulated in the kidney was below the sublethal level (3 to 13 ppm) recommended by Eisler [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. The feces had the lowest T-Hg concentration at 0.18 to 0.23 ppm. Moreover, the MeHg concentrations were close to the analytical detection limits. The muscles also possessed low metal concentrations. In the eggshells obtained from sites S10 and S13, the T-Hg concentrations were 1.39 and 1.16 ppm, respectively, which were above the sublethal level (1 ppm) of Hg content in bird eggs according to Burger and Gochfeld [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. In addition, T-Hg concentration is significantly lower in the migratory red-crowned cranes of China than in the resident cranes of Japan (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The T-Hg and MeHg concentrations in the eggshells were significantly correlated with those in the liver and kidney (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.985,

  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.967,

  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.960, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). In the core area (main habitat of the red-crowned crane), the daily intake of Hg by these cranes ranged from 39.94 to 48.03 ppb, whereas the intake ranged from 54.39 to 65.09 ppb in the buffer zone (breeding and foraging sites for other protected water birds) (Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). Based on the average concentrations, T-Hg and MeHg were bioconcentrated and biomagnified through the food chain in Zhalong Wetland, as presented in Fig.
