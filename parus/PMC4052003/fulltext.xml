However, it is a primary concern for water fowls because it affects their health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Hence, Hg is undesirable and potentially hazardous to the environment and its biota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The effect of Hg on aquatic environments has been investigated extensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. According to these studies, large quantities of the Hg that enter in these environments are often attached to particulate matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and are readily taken up by plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As a result, elevated Hg is returned to consumers at the upper trophic level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The high concentration of Hg in soil generally enhances the Hg content in plants and water animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, we must determine the buildup of Hg concentration in aquatic birds and their prey to detect net change in ecological systems.</p><p>Recent research has shown that the body burden of metals in animals is proportional to the metal content in the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Frequently, environmentally sensitive aquatic plants (i.e., reed) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and water birds are often employed to indicate the pollution levels of a metal-contaminated region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The red-crowned crane (<italic>Grus japonensis</italic>) is a rare international species that has been near extinction since 2000, as indicated in the Red List of Endangered Species generated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Worldwide, its population is very small at 2,750 mature individuals. Although the resident population in Japan remains stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the migratory population in mainland Asia continually declines because of the loss and degradation of wetlands for agricultural and industrial development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Red-crowned cranes are omnivores and typically feed on aquatic plants (e.g., reed roots and stems) and water animals (e.g., fish, shells, and aquatic insects). Thus, their dietary intake of Hg is significantly affected by their prey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This Hg eventually accumulates in the bodies of the red-crowned cranes, given that they roost and nest in stable sites for years. Thus, they may be chronically exposed to contaminated habitats and prey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Zhalong National Nature Reserve (Zhalong Wetland), in the downstream Wuyur catchments, northeastern China, is one of the largest habitant and breeding sites for migratory red-crowned crane. More than 30 petrochemical plants located in the midstream of the catchments and large area of arable land around the wetland may bring about some amount of Hg accumulation and high probability of contact of cranes with the toxic chemical. An adverse factor is that all rare species such as the red-crowned cranes in China are protected in legislation, and any intentional killing of those rare water fowls is prohibited. An alternative approach is to investigate Hg contamination level in their habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and to examine their external tissues (e.g., feather and egg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and excretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In our previous research, feces were found to contain a measurable level of Cd and suitable as an indicator for body burden of Cd on red-crowned crane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, data are scarce on body burden and dietary exposure to Hg on the water bird in this region.</p><p>This research examines the levels of total mercury (T-Hg) and methyl mercury (MeHg) in the prey of the red-crowned crane to estimate the exposure levels of red-crowned cranes and to determine whether their feathers, excretions (mainly feces), and eggshells can indicate Hg contamination in the bodies of these birds. The present study is the first to investigate the accumulation of Hg in and the dietary exposure of red-crowned cranes to this element in northeastern China. The results from this research enrich our understanding of the ecological safety of the health of migratory red-crowned cranes in China.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Area</title><p>The Wuyur River originates from the western foot of Xiaoxin&#x02019;an Mountain, northeastern China, of which the watershed is presented to be an elongated strip and flows through the main food production zone of Heilongjiang Province in China (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), wherein contact with heavy metals like Hg is increased. The lower reaches of the river way are replaced by a large area of reed marsh after entering into the Zhalong Wetland. Zhalong Wetland covers an area of 2,100&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup> (123&#x000b0; 51&#x02032; to 124&#x000b0; 37&#x02032; E, 46&#x000b0; 48&#x02032; to 47&#x000b0; 32&#x02032; N) (core area, which is the roosting and breeding site of endangered water birds, e.g., red-crowned cranes, is approximately 700&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup>; buffer zone occupies 1,400&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup> surrounding of the core area for protecting other common water birds) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). A large area of pristine reed marsh attracts a population of more than approximately 500 migratory red-crowned cranes to inhabit and breed there from the late March to the early November (approximately 8&#x000a0;months) per year.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Location of Wuyur catchment (<bold>a</bold>) and infield sampling design (<bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12011_2014_9993_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Tectonically, the wetland was formed by alluvial deposits with an average altitude of 140&#x000a0;m with 4,700&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup> of agricultural land around it (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). River feeding and precipitation are the major sources of water in this inland reed marsh. Climatically, the wetland has a typical temperate, semiarid, and semihumid continental monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 410&#x000a0;mm and a potential evaporation of 1,500&#x000a0;mm. The volume of runoff from upper reaches was abruptly decreased from 7.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup>&#x000a0;m<sup>3</sup> per year in the 1980s to less than 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup>&#x000a0;m<sup>3</sup> per year in the twenty-first century. Various sludges and wasted water from the surrounding residential area, agricultural land, and industrial workshop containing several types of toxic contaminants, like Hg, were discharged directly into the wetland without complete disposal treatment. The wastewater discharge volume increased from 0.17&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup>&#x000a0;m<sup>3</sup> in 1993 to 0.45&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup>&#x000a0;m<sup>3</sup> in 2010.

First, the prey of these cranes contained measurable levels of T-Hg and MeHg, but the dietary exposure level of this population to Hg was below the Hg toxicity threshold. Second, the Hg concentration levels in the feathers and eggshells of these cranes were significantly high and were correlated with those in their internal organs (i.e., liver, kidneys, and muscles). However, the Hg content in the feces of the water bird was either low or even below the detection limit.</p><p>The finding of this study agreed with the conclusion drawn by Eisler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] with respect to the bioaccumulation of Hg in the habitat of the red-crowned crane. According to Eisler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], Hg is not only bioconcentrated by organisms but also biomagnified through the food chain. Barr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] determined that loons laid fewer eggs when the Hg concentrations in their prey averaged 300 to 400&#x000a0;ppb. Furthermore, they did not lay eggs when this average exceeded 400&#x000a0;ppb. In the current study, the Hg contents in all of the prey did not exceed the allowable concentration limit (200&#x000a0;ppb) recommended by Agah et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and the toxicity threshold concentration (300&#x000a0;ppb) provided by Barr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This result suggests that the incidence of Hg in prey does not contribute highly to the diets of water birds (such as red-crowned cranes and other water fowls) in this region.</p><p>The present study reveals that MeHg dominates the Hg content in prey tissues and in the bodies of water birds. This finding is consistent with those of many previous researches. According to Burger and Gochfeld [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and Evers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], muscle tissue provides the protein used to form feathers. Furthermore, the feathers are among the few body compartments in which MeHg can be remobilized. Therefore, the Hg concentrations in feathers during growth can indicate MeHg contamination in the body of the red-crowned crane. In the current study, the T-Hg concentrations in the feathers of the red-crowned crane in Zhalong Wetland were similar to the average Hg concentrations in the Little Egrets of Tai Lake (0.64&#x000a0;ppm) and Poyang Lake (0.41&#x000a0;ppm) in Southern China as well as those of Common Eiders in Aleutian Island (0.98&#x000a0;ppm) and in the Amchitak and Kiska area (0.64&#x000a0;ppm) as reported by Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and Burger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, the concentrations determined by the present study were lower than those in the Little Egrets of Pearl Delta (2.09&#x000a0;ppm) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in China.</p><p>In the current study, the increasing Hg content in the feathers of red-crowned cranes demonstrated that crane feathers are prone to Hg contamination, as with the feathers of many other birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The T-Hg and MeHg concentrations in the feathers of the red-crowned crane exceed those in their internal organ tissues (liver and kidney). This finding contradicts those of many previous researches. This discrepancy is most likely influenced by external contamination (i.e., atmospheric deposition) because exogenous fractions of heavy metals cannot be completely removed by washing alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, the use of crane feathers as indicators of Hg pollution may be challenged, and further research is recommended.</p><p>The T-Hg and MeHg concentrations in the eggshells are strongly correlated with those in the liver and kidney. However, they are not significantly correlated with the concentrations in the muscle. This result agrees with that of Evers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], which postulates that MeHg in the muscle contributes only slightly to Hg concentration in the developing egg. Burger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] reported that the T-Hg content in eggs normally ranges between 10 and 20&#x000a0;% of that in the liver. In the present study, the eggshells of the red-crowned crane removed Hg from its body, as indicated by the relatively high T-Hg and MeHg concentrations therein. The eggshells of birds such as the Great Tit (<italic>Parus major</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and common loon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] perform a similar function. Given that Chinese law prohibits the intentional killing of wild cranes and the picking of their eggs, the eggshells of these birds can effectively indicate the Hg risk level to the red-crowned crane.</p><p>Our results showed that the T-Hg concentrations in feces were low and that MeHg concentrations therein were below the analytical detection limit. Dauwe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] determined that the Great Tit could excrete Hg from its body. Hence, its feces can indicate the pollution levels in a metal-contaminated region. Conversely, Leonzio et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] reported that the total Hg and MeHg concentrations in feces are limited. Our results confirm this finding because the feces of the red-crowned crane do not always reflect the contamination status of Hg in its body. Thus, excretions may not be a suitable indicator of Hg risk level.</p><p>Similar to the results reported by Takazawa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and Malik et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], we determined relatively high Hg contents in the kidney and liver tissues of the red-crowned crane. According to these previous studies, the livers and kidneys of water fowls are prone than other internal organs to the accumulation of many toxic metals, such as Hg. According to Eisler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], Hg concentrations that exceed 3&#x000a0;ppm in kidney or liver tissue are presumptive evidence of an environmental Hg problem. In the present study, however, the T-Hg concentrations in the internal organs of the red-crowned crane were below the concentration threshold of Hg toxicity, thereby suggesting that the Hg risk level to the red-crowned crane was low.</p><p>The daily Hg intake of the red-crowned crane (39.94 to 48.03&#x000a0;ppb) was significantly lower than the concentration at the sublethal effect level recommended by Eisler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] for sensitive aquatic bird species (i.e., 100 to 500&#x000a0;ppb&#x000a0;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Hence, we regard the level of dietary exposure of the migratory red-crowned cranes to Hg as safe in China. However, the elevated Hg levels in the buffer zone of Zhalong Wetland and the detectable levels of T-Hg and MeHg in red-crowned cranes should be examined further.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was funded by the school of supporting youth&#x02019;s academic backbone project in Heilongjiang Province of China (grant no. 1253G063), Heilongjiang Province Environmental Geography College Key Laboratory of remote sensing monitoring project.
