 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine temporal changes in DNA methylation across the four time points, we used GPrank (
  <a rid="evz044-B69" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B69">Topa and Honkela 2018</a>). GPrank uses Gaussian process modeling to rank and identify temporal patterns and has previously been applied to both temporal transcriptome data (
  <a rid="evz044-B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B68">Topa and Honkela 2016</a>) as well as temporal genotype data (
  <a rid="evz044-B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B70">Topa et al. 2015</a>). By utilizing beta-binomial Gaussian process regression in a Bayesian framework, this allows for modeling any form of temporal variation in DNA methylation (linear as well as highly nonlinear dynamics) and is therefore well suited and frequently used to analyze data from sequencing-based genetic time series.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our main interest was to detect changes in DNA methylation across the breeding season and between the two contrasting temperature treatments. In GPrank, the effect of time is modeled using a Gaussian process (
  <a rid="evz044-B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B52">Rasmussen and Williams 2006</a>). For each CpG site, we fitted a time-independent model without a temporal change (model 0, i.e., null model) and two different time-dependent models, allowing for a temporal change in DNA methylation (model 1 and model 2; see below). Both the time-independent and time-dependent models included a fixed variance component from the beta-binomial model that captures the uncertainty due to finite sequencing depth (
  <a rid="evz044-B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B70">Topa et al. 2015</a>), and an additive white noise, which represents random background noise. In the time-dependent models (model 1 and model 2), methylation levels are allowed to change between sampling time points, which was modeled using a squared exponential covariance in the Gaussian process: it tests correlation between two data points to estimate length scale and amplitude in the data (i.e., how fast the change is in time) to improve point estimate fit with the Gaussian process function. In the time-dependent model 2, we additionally allowed for differences between treatment groups in the pattern of temporal change (compared with model 1) by allowing the treatment groups to have separate time-dependent components and thereby capture possible treatment-specific temporal trajectories. We made comparisons between model 1 and model 0 to test for time dependence and between model 2 and model 0 to test for time dependence with treatment-specific trajectories and between model 2 and model 1 to test for treatment-specific trajectories of the time-dependent sites. Thus, sites were classified as time independent, time dependent, or as time dependent with treatment-specific trajectories (
  <a rid="evz044-T1" ref-type="table" href="#evz044-T1">table 1</a>). All three model comparisons were run separately for each CpG site and we selected the best fitting model based on the log-Bayes factor values (log BF), using log BF ≥ 3 which in the log-Bayes factor scale is considered as positive evidence in favor of the alternative model (
  <a rid="evz044-B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B51">Raftery and Kass 1995</a>). We also clustered the data set using only time-dependent sites (without or with treatment effect).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the GP models cannot take relatedness into account, we examined 5,000 sites across the log BF range of 49–3 and identified as temporally changing based on GPrank model 1 with GLMM using R packages lme4 (
  <a rid="evz044-B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B3">Bates et al. 2015</a>) and lme4qtl (
  <a rid="evz044-B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B86">Ziyatdinov et al. 2017</a>). We included the IBD matrix (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">supplementary table 2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Material</a> online) as a random effect in lme4qtl to control for potential differences in methylation due to shared sibship. Otherwise, both models used methylation count as the response, time point as a fixed effect and individual repeated measure was added as random effect (for both lme4 and lme4qtl). We compared the estimates between the two models for time point and intercept. As the estimates for both models, with and without controlling fore relatedness were highly congruent (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">supplementary fig. S1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Material</a> online), we conclude that relatedness per se did not influence our analysis when looking at temporal change in DNA methylation patterns. Ideally however, the analyses would be done in a GP model where both relatedness and the repeated measures structure of the data could be considered.
