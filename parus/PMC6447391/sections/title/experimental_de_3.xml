 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study included samples (see “Blood sample collection”) from female great tits that are part of a large-scale experiment where females are artificially selected for early or late reproduction using genomic selection. The experimental design for this artificial selection experiment is described in more detail in Verhagen I, Gienapp P, Laine VN, Mateman AC, van Oers K, Visser ME (unpublished data). In short, offspring (F1) from a wild parental generation (P) from the Hoge Veluwe (the Netherlands) with either early (early line) or late (late line) lay dates were collected and genotyped with a 650k single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip to calculate genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs), the value of an individual in the breeding scheme based on the estimated genomic marker (i.e., SNPs) effects throughout the genome (see Verhagen I, Gienapp P, Laine VN, Mateman AC, van Oers K, Visser ME unpublished data; Gienapp P, Calus MPL, Laine VN, Visser ME, unpublished data, for details). Based on their GEBVs, birds were selected within the early or late reproducing selection line in such a way that birds with the most extreme GEBVs were housed in pairs in outdoor aviaries to generate the F1-generation. Birds from the F1-generation, in their turn, were genotyped and selected for extreme GEBVs within the two selection lines to produce the F2-generation. From these F2 birds, pairs were put in climate-controlled aviaries and subjected to two contrasting temperature treatments from January until July. The two temperature treatments mimicked a cold and warm year in the Netherlands using observed temperatures from the year 2013 and 2014, respectively (see Verhagen I, Laine VN, Mateman AC, Pijl A, de Wit R, van Lith B, Kamphuis W, Viitaniemi HM, Williams TD, Caro SP, Meddle SL, Gienapp P, van Oers K &amp; Visser ME (unpublished data)). Photoperiod changed daily following the natural photoperiod. Aviaries were provided with three nest boxes and from March onward, nesting material was provided.</p>
