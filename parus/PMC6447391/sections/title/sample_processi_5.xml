 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The detailed description of the sample processing can be found in Mäkinen et al. (forthcoming). In short, DNA was extracted from red blood cell samples using FavorPrepT M 96-well Genomic DNA Kit (Favorgen). Quantity and quality of the extraction was assessed with Nanodrop 2000 (Agilent Biotechnologies) and by gel electrophoresis by running the samples on a 1% agarose gel. Library preparation and sequencing were done at Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA. Samples were individually barcoded and pooled together in four pools of 16 samples, thereby randomizing individuals, sampling days, and treatments for each pool. To obtain enough coverage, each pool was sequenced on two lanes for 100-bp single-end. To avoid effects due to difference in flow cells, the four pools, which were all ran twice, were ran on the same flow cell.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The control and bisulfite-treated libraries were prepared with the Hyper Library Construction kit from Kapa Biosystems, according to the “Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing For Methylation Analysis” protocol (Illumina). Briefly, samples were digested with MspI, which generates CCGG overhangs, prior to bisulfite treatment and library building. The libraries were size selected for fragments of 20–200 bp in length. The libraries were quantified by quantitative PCR and pools were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 using a HiSeq SBS sequencing kit version 4 (Illumina). All pools were sequenced on the same flow cells. Fastq files were generated and demultiplexed with the bcl2fastq v2.17.1.14 Conversion Software (Illumina). Lanes were spiked with PhiX to provide nucleotide diversity and to measure bisulfite conversion success. PhiX reads were subsequently removed from the data set. Adaptors and individual barcodes were also trimmed from the reads. All the reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) samples are deposited in Short Read Archive under Biosample accession SAMN07692587 and are described in detail in Mäkinen et al. (forthcoming).</p>
