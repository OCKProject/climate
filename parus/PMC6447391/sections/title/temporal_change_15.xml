 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study shows that there is potential in using reversible methylation patterns to identify genes responding to environmental cues similar to transcriptomic studies. In particular, we can compare the genes that displayed temporal changes in methylation with those that additionally showed a temperature effect. For example, although the GO-terms in the time-dependent class were mostly involved in developmental and regulatory effects in various tissues, the time-dependent treatment class was involved in chromatin modification, more specifically H3K4 methylation (GO:0042800 and GO:0048188). This chromatin mark has previously been associated with transcriptional activation (

  <a rid="evz044-B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B33">Liu et al. 2017</a>). Another group (GO:0001223; transcription coactivator binding) contained three genes 
  <span class="italic">ESR1</span>, 
  <span class="italic">POU2F1</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">RORA</span> which provides a potential link between temperature sensing and reproduction. In 
  <span class="italic">ESR1</span>, the estrogen receptor, methylation at the promoter was recently shown to be a prominent mechanism that mediates maternal environmental effects (
  <a rid="evz044-B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B5">Bentz et al. 2016</a>). 
  <span class="italic">RORA</span> is a gene with circadian properties (
  <a rid="evz044-B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B21">Jetten 2009</a>) and 
  <span class="italic">POU2F1</span> is a transcription factor connected to progesterone and glucocorticoids (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We did not see time-dependent methylation changes in many of the typically investigated candidate genes in relation to timing of reproduction (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">BMAL</span>, 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span>, 
  <span class="italic">PER2/3</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">TSH</span>) in our data set, with the exception of 
  <span class="italic">DIO2</span> (
  <a rid="evz044-B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B46">Perfito et al. 2012</a>). There can be several reasons for this, sampling the wrong tissue (hypothalamus is generally preferable for seasonal timing related genes), missing the correct time points or not knowing enough of the methylation dynamics across life time, as discussed below. When looking at 
  <span class="italic">DIO2</span>, which exhibited a vastly different methylation pattern from 
  <span class="italic">RORA</span>, it is possible that we did not sample the right time window for it, or for many other genes, as it is likely that the genes facilitating the photoperiodic response have established their methylation pattern already prior to our first sampling day at the end of March (
  <a rid="evz044-B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B77">Visser et al. 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B64">Stevenson and Prendergast 2013</a>). It is also plausible that certain genes have stable methylation patterns throughout a lifetime as a result of tissue-specific imprinting (
  <a rid="evz044-B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B34">Lokk et al. 2014</a>). Two recent studies on birds measured DNA methylation from blood in single genes twice and found no difference over time in the methylation levels (
  <a rid="evz044-B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B57">Rubenstein et al. 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B58">Saino et al. 2017</a>). In the case of superb starlings (
  <span class="italic">Lamprotornis superbus</span>), glucocorticoid hormone receptor CpG methylation was measured when the individuals were chicks and later on as adults to monitor the temporal pattern and with this sampling scheme they were able to show that early life environmental conditions (i.e., rainfall) had a sex-specific impact on life-history traits (
  <a rid="evz044-B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B57">Rubenstein et al. 2016</a>). In a study on migration phenology in barn swallows (
  <span class="italic">Hirundo rustica</span>), individuals were measured twice as adults in two consecutive years in the breeding range (i.e., after arrival from wintering grounds). This raises the question on whether the observation of stable methylation in 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> poly-q (
  <a rid="evz044-B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B58">Saino et al. 2017</a>) is due to not sampling the right time frame or due to the methylation pattern being stable from early life onward. Thus, predictions of the outcome of methylation change for timing of breeding in great tits and the underlying gene regulation of these functional groups is highly tentative until the link between observed methylation changes and transcriptomic expression has been tested and confirmed in additional tissues (in particular the brain).
