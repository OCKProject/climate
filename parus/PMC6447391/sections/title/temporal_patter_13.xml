 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering that DNA methylation is viewed as a mechanism for gene regulation, most ecological studies examining DNA methylation have only sampled single time points, leaving us with a poor understanding of the temporal stability of DNA methylation (but see e.g., 
  <a rid="evz044-B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B57">Rubenstein et al. 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B58">Saino et al. 2017</a>). To our knowledge, this is the first animal study to examine genome-wide DNA methylation patterns using a repeated measures approach, which up till now has only been conducted in few clinical studies in humans (
  <a rid="evz044-B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B62">Shvetsov et al. 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B63">Simpkin et al. 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B30">Leenen et al. 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B71">Urdinguio et al. 2016</a>). Even in these studies, CpG methylation is typically measured between two time points only, which hinders detection of nonlinear changes in methylation. One exception is (
  <a rid="evz044-B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B63">Simpkin et al. 2015</a>) who measured CpG methylation at three time points (at birth and at ages 7 and 17). They found evidence of both linear and nonlinear patterns in methylation levels of CpG sites associated to birth weight and gestational age across the sampling period. We measured CpG methylation at four time points between March and June and observed both linear and nonlinear changes, as seen for example with 
  <span class="italic">DIO2</span> and 
  <span class="italic">RORA</span>, within this short time period, thereby highlighting the dynamic nature of DNA methylation patterns.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies using repeated measures in humans have identified from 0.5% to 30.1% of analyzed sites changing methylation patterns over time (
  <a rid="evz044-B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B78">Wang et al. 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B40">Martino et al. 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B71">Urdinguio et al. 2016</a>). In this study, we found that 9% of the analyzed CpG sites changed their methylation patterns over time, with an average individual methylation change of 2%. For comparison, 
  <a rid="evz044-B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B39">Martino et al. (2013)</a> reported that in human twins, methylation pattern between birth and 18 months had a mean methylation change of 3.1%. A recent review on the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation in clinical context reported that even low methylation changes at a site in the range of &lt;10% can have a phenotypic effect in nonmalignant diseases (
  <a rid="evz044-B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B30">Leenen et al. 2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A substantial challenge is to understand how much DNA methylation should change in order to have a phenotypic effect. In our case, we often observe that methylation change occurs only in specific time points and in a single, or a few, CpG sites within a gene. Clinical studies on nonmalignant diseases have implicated that even single sites could be important for creating a disease phenotype (
  <a rid="evz044-B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B30">Leenen et al. 2016</a>). In an ecological context, effects of changes in methylation at single CpG site have for example been found for 
  <span class="italic">ERα</span> and yolk testosterone in eastern bluebird (
  <a rid="evz044-B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B5">Bentz et al. 2016</a>) and for 
  <span class="italic">SERT</span> and exploration behavior in urban great tits, although in great tits there was also SNP variation associated with it (
  <a rid="evz044-B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B56">Riyahi et al. 2015</a>). In contrast, in another study on great tits and exploratory behavior, only variation in DNA methylation in sites within the TSS of the 
  <span class="italic">DRD4</span> gene was associated with the phenotype, whereas this was not the case for the sites sampled in the gene body (
  <a rid="evz044-B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B73">Verhulst et al. 2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genome-wide methylation patterns correlated to transcriptome expression from the great tit show that CpG methylation was negatively correlated with gene expression in gene bodies and at TSS in brain tissue (
  <a rid="evz044-B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B14">Derks et al. 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B25">Laine et al. 2016</a>). When both promoter and gene body CpG sites were hypomethylated, expression in the brain was higher (
  <a rid="evz044-B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B14">Derks et al. 2016</a>). Furthermore, differential CpG methylation between brain and whole blood (including both erythrocytes and leucocytes) in these regions had a functional role which was shown by differential patterns of hypo- and hyper-methylation between the tissues in regard to expression patterns in the brain (
  <a rid="evz044-B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B14">Derks et al. 2016</a>). However, although these studies find methylation and expression are correlated, we do not yet have a good understanding of what level of change in methylation, or in which CpG’s in a region, is sufficient to change transcription and thus lead to a phenotypic response. Thus, although it is clear that the environment can leave a mark on an individuals’ DNA methylome (

  <a rid="evz044-B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B57">Rubenstein et al. 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B79">Weyrich et al. 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B16">Gokhman et al. 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B47">Pértille et al. 2017</a>), we need more studies to establish potential causative effects of such methylation changes on the phenotype of organisms.
