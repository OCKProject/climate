 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we investigated temporal within-individual changes in erythrocyte DNA methylation in great tits of genomic selection line for early timing of breeding which were exposed to either a warm or cold treatment. We find that many CpG sites changes methylation levels over the sampling period, but that the overall change is small. There was also substantial heterogeneity across CpG sites within genes in their response to time or treatment. Thus, our work calls for a greater understanding of the relationship between changes in methylation and expression at individual level and across different tissues. Future studies that examine this relationship across time and on the same individual would be very valuable.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is currently great interest in ecological epigenetics and a number of studies on primarily DNA methylation patterns in natural populations have been published over the last few years. However, most studies only sample a single time point and a few targeted CpG sites. Our results highlight that there is large between individual variation in DNA methylation and a strong temporal component to DNA methylation patterns. This, combined with the heterogeneity observed also within genes, suggest that great caution is required when interpreting studies that have sampled few sites at single time points.</p>
