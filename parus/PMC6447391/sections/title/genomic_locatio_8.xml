 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genomic locations of identified CpG sites were annotated using the Great tit genome v1.1 (NCBI). We divided the sites into whether they were located in exons, introns, TSS regions (defined as the region spanning 300-bp upstream and 50-bp downstream of the annotated gene start), or promoters (defined as the region 3 kb upstream of gene start excluding the TSS) using the R packages “GenomicFeatures” (

  <a rid="evz044-B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B28">Lawrence et al. 2009</a>). CpG islands were identified from the great tit genome using CpGplot v EMBOSS: 6.6.0.0 (Alan Bleasby, European Bioinformatics Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SD, UK) using default settings: window size 100, minimum island length 200, minimum observed/expected 0.6, minimum percentage 50. Overlap between identified CpG sites and specified regions, was obtained with BEDtools v.2.26.0. (
  <a rid="evz044-B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B50">Quinlan and Hall 2010</a>) and the sites were assigned to their specific genomic regions. We used the annotation from genomic locations (promoter, TSS, and within gene body as defined above) for assigning the CpG sites to genes for functional analysis, which was done using Cytoscape plugin ClueGo (
  <a rid="evz044-B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B6">Bindea et al. 2009</a>) with chicken (EBI-Quick 31.1.2018) annotation. ClueGo identifies functional groups of genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms and enrichment analysis. As the reference set in the functional analysis and enrichment analysis, we used all genes for which at least one CpG site used in the GPrank analysis was associated with. We determined these genes based on the intersections of the CpG sites and the genomic locations described above (i.e., promoter, TSS, intron, and exon of a gene). To account for nonindependence of CpG sites (i.e., genes having many sites and sites supported by different models), genes were categorized to be time dependent or time dependent with treatment-specific trajectories based on what the CpG site with the highest ranking log BF value associated with the gene was classified to be. For a gene to be categorized as time independent, all CpG sites associated with that gene, regardless of the genomic region, had to be classified as time independent.
