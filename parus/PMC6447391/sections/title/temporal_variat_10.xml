 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In total, we found that 47,922 CpG sites out of 522,643 analyzed sites showed support for a time-dependent methylation pattern (i.e., statistical support for time dependence or time dependence in a treatment-specific manner) and these represent 9% of all the analyzed sites (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Material</a> online). We repeated the clustering using only these sites and found that the samples formed two main clusters based on treatment (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Material</a> online). The effect of the repeated measurements is still visible as samples of the same individual are clustered together. In a similar manner, the effect of siblings split into both treatment groups is still visible as the siblings from the warm treatment cluster together with their cold treatment siblings in to the cold treatment cluster (
