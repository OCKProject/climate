 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The majority of time-dependent (with or without treatment) CpG sites were annotated to introns and exons rather than to promoter or TSS. Although this result is different to that reported in other RRBS data sets in nonmodel organisms (measured at single time point only) (
  <a rid="evz044-B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B45">Pegoraro et al. 2016</a>), this is probably a result of differences in the type of tissue typically examined in different organisms: whole body versus red blood cells. DNA methylation data from red blood cells in chicken also had a pattern similar to this study, that is, with gene region methylation being more abundant than regulatory region methylation although measured only at a single time point (
  <a rid="evz044-B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B47">Pértille et al. 2017</a>). Although more CpG sites were annotated to introns than in exons in sites categorized as time dependent (with or without treatment), the measured methylation levels in the genomic regions were higher in gene bodies compared with promoter regions with very low methylation levels around the TSS, as expected based on previous great tit methylomes (

  <a rid="evz044-B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B25">Laine et al. 2016</a>). Although more of the CpG sites that showed time-dependent patterns were situated within introns compared with exons, methylation level in introns was moderate compared with exons. Both of these observations on intronic CpG sites fit with recent knowledge of intronic CpG sites in regard to regulating gene expression as part of the promoter (
  <a rid="evz044-B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B65">Suzuki and Bird 2008</a>). As an example of a promoter including also the first intron, pyrosequencing of the 
  <span class="italic">DRD4</span> gene in great tit selection lines for exploratory behavior identified most of the variation in DNA methylation within in the first intron, whereas methylation level increased toward the 3′ end of the gene (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that we are mapping genomic locations of time-dependent sites, it is likely that they exhibit a pattern that differs from the usual expectation of identifying differentially methylated sites in TSS or promoter regions. In an investigation of human leukocyte CpG methylation patterns between birth and age at 5, over 6,000 CpG sites were observed changing (
  <a rid="evz044-B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B71">Urdinguio et al. 2016</a>): the sites identified as hypomethylated over time were related to immune system functions and were located in introns, whereas hypermethylated sites were related to development and sequence-specific binding and were located in exons. The time-dependent (without or with treatment effect) CpG sites in the red blood cells in our study were also seen in introns and exons, whereas we observed less than expected sites in TSS compared with other genomic regions. Thus, our result are in line with what is observed in other species where time-dependent changes accumulate in a different manner in different genomic regions (
