 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As discussed above, we acknowledge that red blood cells are not the optimal tissue to understand gene regulatory changes related to decision making and timing of reproduction in the great tit. However, it is not possible to do repeated measures in more relevant tissues, that is, in the hypothalamus–pituitary–gonad–liver axis, which are more directly associated with functions important for timing of reproduction (
  <a rid="evz044-B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B77">Visser et al. 2010</a>). Although tissue specific DNA methylation patterns develop early on (
  <a rid="evz044-B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B32">Li et al. 1992</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B7">Bird 2002</a>), DNA methylation is also accumulated throughout life at CpG sites (
  <a rid="evz044-B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B10">Christensen et al. 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B24">Khor et al. 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B41">Metzger and Schulte 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B47">Pértille et al. 2017</a>) and thus whether environment driven methylation is tissue specific at first, is not well known. Moreover, the correlation in DNA methylation patterns among different tissue can be high (
  <a rid="evz044-B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B34">Lokk et al. 2014</a>). Thus, using a general tissue such as red blood cells can be informative also of methylation patterns in other tissues.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although our sampling design covers a large proportion of the reproductive season it is of course possible that we may have not chosen the right sampling times to detect changes in methylation relevant to timing of reproduction. For example, it may be that the regulatory changes necessary for egg-laying take place over a longer or shorter timespan relative to laying of the first egg (
  <a rid="evz044-B80" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B80">Williams 2012</a>) than what we can detect with our sampling interval. Thus, identifying the reference points for environmental cues and egg-laying would allow for better resolution when designing the sampling scheme.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One strength of our design is the use of individuals from selection lines housed in climate-controlled aviaries. Individual level variation in DNA methylation patterns is high and thus limiting environmentally induced variation in DNA methylation can increase our ability to detect changes relevant to timing of reproduction as all individuals have experienced similar environmental conditions (apart from the treatment effect of temperature of course). In this study, we only examined DNA methylation from the early selection line and from a single generation (F2). Thus, we are not in a position to address potential effects of selection on the DNA methylation patterns between the selection lines or changes across generations that may have occurred during the selection experiment. Thus, to what extent selection has induced changes in the methylation landscape compared with the “ancestral” (wild) great tits is not clear.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our main focus here was on the temporal stability and effects of the temperature treatment on DNA methylation patterns and only indirectly linked to the observed timing of reproduction. We are currently working on taking another analytic approach to more directly identify differently methylated sites and regions between early and late reproducing individuals within the temporal sampling design we have. Thus, the link to timing of breeding for the sites and genes identified here of course remain tentative.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lastly, as we only measured DNA methylation in these samples but not RNA expression we cannot draw firm conclusions of the effects of single sites to gene expression. Although earlier studies have examined how DNA methylation in different genomic regions affects gene expression in the great tit (
  <a rid="evz044-B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B14">Derks et al. 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B25">Laine et al. 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="evz044-B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B73">Verhulst et al. 2016</a>), they do not have a temporal expression data set to compare with temporal methylation. This is the next important step toward verifying whether the temporal trends in methylation are functional.
