The genome-wide methylation level across all the sample time points and individuals for these sites was 13.82% (SD = 0.25). Methylation levels were significantly lower in individuals from warm than in cold treatment in the first three time points (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">supplementary fig. S3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Material</a> online). Mean individual methylation change across all sites was 6.82% (SD = 8.45) and mean methylation change within a site was 18.7% (SD = 18.17). Between treatments, methylation change across time in the CpG sites was slightly lower for warm compared with cold treatment with mean 6.80% (SD = 8.50) versus 6.84% (SD = 8.40) for warm and cold, respectively (delta = 0.04, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 3.1247, df = 1045100,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In total, we found that 47,922 CpG sites out of 522,643 analyzed sites showed support for a time-dependent methylation pattern (i.e., statistical support for time dependence or time dependence in a treatment-specific manner) and these represent 9% of all the analyzed sites (

The effect of the repeated measurements is still visible as samples of the same individual are clustered together. In a similar manner, the effect of siblings split into both treatment groups is still visible as the siblings from the warm treatment cluster together with their cold treatment siblings in to the cold treatment cluster (
