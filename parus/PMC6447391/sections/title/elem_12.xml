 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we examined within-individual temporal changes in DNA methylation in great tit females across the breeding season by analyzing repeated methylation measures using a RRBS approach. We were able to sample 522,643 CpG sites with &gt;10× coverage in all samples and 47,922 of these were found to exhibit time-dependent change either without or with treatment-specific trajectories. In general, the methylation levels and temporal changes were slightly higher in the cold compared with the warm treatment. There is a strong temporal component to DNA methylation patterns across the breeding season as 9% of all sites displayed a temporal pattern and thus changes in DNA methylation at some of these sites could potentially be involved in regulating the onset of reproduction.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temporal Patterns in DNA Methylation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering that DNA methylation is viewed as a mechanism for gene regulation, most ecological studies examining DNA methylation have only sampled single time points, leaving us with a poor understanding of the temporal stability of DNA methylation (but see e.g., 
   <a rid="evz044-B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B57">Rubenstein et al. 2016</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B58">Saino et al. 2017</a>). To our knowledge, this is the first animal study to examine genome-wide DNA methylation patterns using a repeated measures approach, which up till now has only been conducted in few clinical studies in humans (
   <a rid="evz044-B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B62">Shvetsov et al. 2015</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B63">Simpkin et al. 2015</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B30">Leenen et al. 2016</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B71">Urdinguio et al. 2016</a>). Even in these studies, CpG methylation is typically measured between two time points only, which hinders detection of nonlinear changes in methylation. One exception is (
   <a rid="evz044-B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B63">Simpkin et al. 2015</a>) who measured CpG methylation at three time points (at birth and at ages 7 and 17). They found evidence of both linear and nonlinear patterns in methylation levels of CpG sites associated to birth weight and gestational age across the sampling period. We measured CpG methylation at four time points between March and June and observed both linear and nonlinear changes, as seen for example with 
   <span class="italic">DIO2</span> and 
   <span class="italic">RORA</span>, within this short time period, thereby highlighting the dynamic nature of DNA methylation patterns.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies using repeated measures in humans have identified from 0.5% to 30.1% of analyzed sites changing methylation patterns over time (
   <a rid="evz044-B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B78">Wang et al. 2012</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B40">Martino et al. 2013</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B71">Urdinguio et al. 2016</a>). In this study, we found that 9% of the analyzed CpG sites changed their methylation patterns over time, with an average individual methylation change of 2%. For comparison, 
   <a rid="evz044-B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B39">Martino et al. (2013)</a> reported that in human twins, methylation pattern between birth and 18 months had a mean methylation change of 3.1%. A recent review on the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation in clinical context reported that even low methylation changes at a site in the range of &lt;10% can have a phenotypic effect in nonmalignant diseases (
   <a rid="evz044-B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B30">Leenen et al. 2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A substantial challenge is to understand how much DNA methylation should change in order to have a phenotypic effect. In our case, we often observe that methylation change occurs only in specific time points and in a single, or a few, CpG sites within a gene. Clinical studies on nonmalignant diseases have implicated that even single sites could be important for creating a disease phenotype (
   <a rid="evz044-B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B30">Leenen et al. 2016</a>). In an ecological context, effects of changes in methylation at single CpG site have for example been found for 
   <span class="italic">ERα</span> and yolk testosterone in eastern bluebird (
   <a rid="evz044-B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B5">Bentz et al. 2016</a>) and for 
   <span class="italic">SERT</span> and exploration behavior in urban great tits, although in great tits there was also SNP variation associated with it (
   <a rid="evz044-B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B56">Riyahi et al. 2015</a>). In contrast, in another study on great tits and exploratory behavior, only variation in DNA methylation in sites within the TSS of the 
   <span class="italic">DRD4</span> gene was associated with the phenotype, whereas this was not the case for the sites sampled in the gene body (
   <a rid="evz044-B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B73">Verhulst et al. 2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genome-wide methylation patterns correlated to transcriptome expression from the great tit show that CpG methylation was negatively correlated with gene expression in gene bodies and at TSS in brain tissue (
   <a rid="evz044-B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B14">Derks et al. 2016</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B25">Laine et al. 2016</a>). When both promoter and gene body CpG sites were hypomethylated, expression in the brain was higher (
   <a rid="evz044-B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B14">Derks et al. 2016</a>). Furthermore, differential CpG methylation between brain and whole blood (including both erythrocytes and leucocytes) in these regions had a functional role which was shown by differential patterns of hypo- and hyper-methylation between the tissues in regard to expression patterns in the brain (
   <a rid="evz044-B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B14">Derks et al. 2016</a>). However, although these studies find methylation and expression are correlated, we do not yet have a good understanding of what level of change in methylation, or in which CpG’s in a region, is sufficient to change transcription and thus lead to a phenotypic response. Thus, although it is clear that the environment can leave a mark on an individuals’ DNA methylome (
   <a rid="evz044-B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B5">Bentz et al. 2016</a>;

   <a rid="evz044-B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B47">Pértille et al. 2017</a>), we need more studies to establish potential causative effects of such methylation changes on the phenotype of organisms.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genomic Locations of Time-Dependent Sites</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The majority of time-dependent (with or without treatment) CpG sites were annotated to introns and exons rather than to promoter or TSS. Although this result is different to that reported in other RRBS data sets in nonmodel organisms (measured at single time point only) (
   <a rid="evz044-B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B45">Pegoraro et al. 2016</a>), this is probably a result of differences in the type of tissue typically examined in different organisms: whole body versus red blood cells. DNA methylation data from red blood cells in chicken also had a pattern similar to this study, that is, with gene region methylation being more abundant than regulatory region methylation although measured only at a single time point (
   <a rid="evz044-B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B47">Pértille et al. 2017</a>). Although more CpG sites were annotated to introns than in exons in sites categorized as time dependent (with or without treatment), the measured methylation levels in the genomic regions were higher in gene bodies compared with promoter regions with very low methylation levels around the TSS, as expected based on previous great tit methylomes (
   <a rid="evz044-B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B14">Derks et al. 2016</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B25">Laine et al. 2016</a>). Although more of the CpG sites that showed time-dependent patterns were situated within introns compared with exons, methylation level in introns was moderate compared with exons. Both of these observations on intronic CpG sites fit with recent knowledge of intronic CpG sites in regard to regulating gene expression as part of the promoter (
   <a rid="evz044-B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B65">Suzuki and Bird 2008</a>). As an example of a promoter including also the first intron, pyrosequencing of the 
   <span class="italic">DRD4</span> gene in great tit selection lines for exploratory behavior identified most of the variation in DNA methylation within in the first intron, whereas methylation level increased toward the 3′ end of the gene (
   <a rid="evz044-B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B73">Verhulst et al. 2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that we are mapping genomic locations of time-dependent sites, it is likely that they exhibit a pattern that differs from the usual expectation of identifying differentially methylated sites in TSS or promoter regions. In an investigation of human leukocyte CpG methylation patterns between birth and age at 5, over 6,000 CpG sites were observed changing (
   <a rid="evz044-B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B71">Urdinguio et al. 2016</a>): the sites identified as hypomethylated over time were related to immune system functions and were located in introns, whereas hypermethylated sites were related to development and sequence-specific binding and were located in exons. The time-dependent (without or with treatment effect) CpG sites in the red blood cells in our study were also seen in introns and exons, whereas we observed less than expected sites in TSS compared with other genomic regions. Thus, our result are in line with what is observed in other species where time-dependent changes accumulate in a different manner in different genomic regions (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temporal Change in DNA Methylation and Its Potential Role in Timing of Breeding</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study shows that there is potential in using reversible methylation patterns to identify genes responding to environmental cues similar to transcriptomic studies. In particular, we can compare the genes that displayed temporal changes in methylation with those that additionally showed a temperature effect. For example, although the GO-terms in the time-dependent class were mostly involved in developmental and regulatory effects in various tissues, the time-dependent treatment class was involved in chromatin modification, more specifically H3K4 methylation (GO:0042800 and GO:0048188). This chromatin mark has previously been associated with transcriptional activation (
   <a rid="evz044-B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B42">Muramoto et al. 2010</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B33">Liu et al. 2017</a>). Another group (GO:0001223; transcription coactivator binding) contained three genes 
   <span class="italic">ESR1</span>, 
   <span class="italic">POU2F1</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">RORA</span> which provides a potential link between temperature sensing and reproduction. In 
   <span class="italic">ESR1</span>, the estrogen receptor, methylation at the promoter was recently shown to be a prominent mechanism that mediates maternal environmental effects (
   <a rid="evz044-B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B5">Bentz et al. 2016</a>). 
   <span class="italic">RORA</span> is a gene with circadian properties (
   <a rid="evz044-B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B21">Jetten 2009</a>) and 
   <span class="italic">POU2F1</span> is a transcription factor connected to progesterone and glucocorticoids (
   <a rid="evz044-B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B85">Zhao 2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We did not see time-dependent methylation changes in many of the typically investigated candidate genes in relation to timing of reproduction (e.g., 
   <span class="italic">BMAL</span>, 
   <span class="italic">CLOCK</span>, 
   <span class="italic">PER2/3</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">TSH</span>) in our data set, with the exception of 
   <span class="italic">DIO2</span> (
   <a rid="evz044-B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B46">Perfito et al. 2012</a>). There can be several reasons for this, sampling the wrong tissue (hypothalamus is generally preferable for seasonal timing related genes), missing the correct time points or not knowing enough of the methylation dynamics across life time, as discussed below. When looking at 
   <span class="italic">DIO2</span>, which exhibited a vastly different methylation pattern from 
   <span class="italic">RORA</span>, it is possible that we did not sample the right time window for it, or for many other genes, as it is likely that the genes facilitating the photoperiodic response have established their methylation pattern already prior to our first sampling day at the end of March (
   <a rid="evz044-B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B77">Visser et al. 2010</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B64">Stevenson and Prendergast 2013</a>). It is also plausible that certain genes have stable methylation patterns throughout a lifetime as a result of tissue-specific imprinting (
   <a rid="evz044-B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B34">Lokk et al. 2014</a>). Two recent studies on birds measured DNA methylation from blood in single genes twice and found no difference over time in the methylation levels (
   <a rid="evz044-B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B57">Rubenstein et al. 2016</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B58">Saino et al. 2017</a>). In the case of superb starlings (
   <span class="italic">Lamprotornis superbus</span>), glucocorticoid hormone receptor CpG methylation was measured when the individuals were chicks and later on as adults to monitor the temporal pattern and with this sampling scheme they were able to show that early life environmental conditions (i.e., rainfall) had a sex-specific impact on life-history traits (
   <a rid="evz044-B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B57">Rubenstein et al. 2016</a>). In a study on migration phenology in barn swallows (
   <span class="italic">Hirundo rustica</span>), individuals were measured twice as adults in two consecutive years in the breeding range (i.e., after arrival from wintering grounds). This raises the question on whether the observation of stable methylation in 
   <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> poly-q (
   <a rid="evz044-B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B58">Saino et al. 2017</a>) is due to not sampling the right time frame or due to the methylation pattern being stable from early life onward. Thus, predictions of the outcome of methylation change for timing of breeding in great tits and the underlying gene regulation of these functional groups is highly tentative until the link between observed methylation changes and transcriptomic expression has been tested and confirmed in additional tissues (in particular the brain).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations and Caveats</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As discussed above, we acknowledge that red blood cells are not the optimal tissue to understand gene regulatory changes related to decision making and timing of reproduction in the great tit. However, it is not possible to do repeated measures in more relevant tissues, that is, in the hypothalamus–pituitary–gonad–liver axis, which are more directly associated with functions important for timing of reproduction (
   <a rid="evz044-B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B77">Visser et al. 2010</a>). Although tissue specific DNA methylation patterns develop early on (
   <a rid="evz044-B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B32">Li et al. 1992</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B7">Bird 2002</a>), DNA methylation is also accumulated throughout life at CpG sites (
   <a rid="evz044-B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B10">Christensen et al. 2009</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B24">Khor et al. 2016</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B41">Metzger and Schulte 2017</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B47">Pértille et al. 2017</a>) and thus whether environment driven methylation is tissue specific at first, is not well known. Moreover, the correlation in DNA methylation patterns among different tissue can be high (
   <a rid="evz044-B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B34">Lokk et al. 2014</a>). Thus, using a general tissue such as red blood cells can be informative also of methylation patterns in other tissues.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although our sampling design covers a large proportion of the reproductive season it is of course possible that we may have not chosen the right sampling times to detect changes in methylation relevant to timing of reproduction. For example, it may be that the regulatory changes necessary for egg-laying take place over a longer or shorter timespan relative to laying of the first egg (
   <a rid="evz044-B80" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B80">Williams 2012</a>) than what we can detect with our sampling interval. Thus, identifying the reference points for environmental cues and egg-laying would allow for better resolution when designing the sampling scheme.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One strength of our design is the use of individuals from selection lines housed in climate-controlled aviaries. Individual level variation in DNA methylation patterns is high and thus limiting environmentally induced variation in DNA methylation can increase our ability to detect changes relevant to timing of reproduction as all individuals have experienced similar environmental conditions (apart from the treatment effect of temperature of course). In this study, we only examined DNA methylation from the early selection line and from a single generation (F2). Thus, we are not in a position to address potential effects of selection on the DNA methylation patterns between the selection lines or changes across generations that may have occurred during the selection experiment. Thus, to what extent selection has induced changes in the methylation landscape compared with the “ancestral” (wild) great tits is not clear.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our main focus here was on the temporal stability and effects of the temperature treatment on DNA methylation patterns and only indirectly linked to the observed timing of reproduction. We are currently working on taking another analytic approach to more directly identify differently methylated sites and regions between early and late reproducing individuals within the temporal sampling design we have. Thus, the link to timing of breeding for the sites and genes identified here of course remain tentative.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lastly, as we only measured DNA methylation in these samples but not RNA expression we cannot draw firm conclusions of the effects of single sites to gene expression. Although earlier studies have examined how DNA methylation in different genomic regions affects gene expression in the great tit (
   <a rid="evz044-B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B14">Derks et al. 2016</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B25">Laine et al. 2016</a>; 
   <a rid="evz044-B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#evz044-B73">Verhulst et al. 2016</a>), they do not have a temporal expression data set to compare with temporal methylation. This is the next important step toward verifying whether the temporal trends in methylation are functional.
