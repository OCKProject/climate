 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study experimentally demonstrates individual variation in phenotypic plasticity in timing of breeding in response to PPLs, which is associated with an individualized behavioral strategy maintained by natural selection. Relatively fast-exploring birds bred relatively late when PPL was low but shifted forward to breed relatively early when PPL was high (Supplementary fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Assuming that fast explorers are at-risk individuals when predators are actually present (rather than only perceived to be present), these shifts reflect a pattern of adaptive personality-related plasticity in timing of breeding. Exploratory tendency is subject to fluctuating density-dependent selection
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>;
  </span> this key mechanism is thought to explain the coexistence of avian personality types. Our finding that individual plasticity in timing of breeding represents a key component of personality-related life-history strategies thereby offers an explanation for the maintenance of individual plasticity in natural bird populations.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Early breeding increased the number of eggs produced (clutch size), but neither clutch size nor reproductive success (fledging number) varied as function of exploratory tendency despite unambiguous links between timing of breeding and personality in both treatment groups (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Treatment effects on how individuals resolve two interacting trade-offs can explain this apparent paradox. First, great tits face a time-allocation trade-off between foraging (resource acquisition) and avoidance of predation (vigilance)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Increased investment in time allocated to predator avoidance reduces time available for resource acquisition, explaining why the reproductive benefits of breeding early diminished with increased PPL (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Previous work shows that slow explorers are less dominant at clumped food resources, therefore they may particularly benefit from delayed breeding to maximize resource acquisition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Second, behavioral types may differ in how they resolve the trade-off between investments made in current (clutch size) versus future reproduction (longevity, onset of reproductive senescence)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Fast-exploring great tits produced larger clutch sizes compared with slow-exploring great tits breeding at the same date (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) potentially due to a faster pace-of-life
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. However, there were no differences in the number of eggs produced between behavioral types overall, thus, in line with recent meta-analyses
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>, our study does not confirm pace-of-life predictions. In line with the notion that increased investment in time allocated to predator avoidance leaves less time available to allocate towards resource acquisition, PPL also significantly reduced the larger number of eggs produced by fast explorers breeding at the same date as slow explorers. These effects combined explain why behavioral types did not differ in overall reproductive success despite exhibiting PPL-dependent differences in timing of breeding affecting reproductive success. An interesting area of future research would thus focus on directly quantifying how time and energy allocation trade-offs are resolved as a function of PPL in the wild. In addition, further studies that also manipulate actual (rather than only perceived) predation levels are now required to discover any fitness-related consequences of reproductive behavior mis-matching the environment
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>, as well as to fully address the fitness consequences associated with the alternative reproductive strategies revealed in this study. That is, while alternative personality types may indeed have equal reproductive success when predators are absent, the addition of seasonal or personality-related survival costs caused by predation may cause personality-related differences in fitness to arise when predators are present.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Specialist avian predators have previously been hypothesized to induce breeding synchrony
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>, based on observational studies. Our study rejects this prediction experimentally, revealing that predator-induced asynchrony results from personality-related individualized responses to predation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>, Supplementary fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Specifically, different types may compete, with more at-risk individuals breeding earlier in the presence of more predators, allowing them to enjoy the benefits of a temporal mismatch and leaving the others to bear the brunt of the predation timed to coincide with their fledge dates. Limited previous work confirms that individuals differ in the relationship between breeding date and environmental factors, and that selection may favor more plastic individuals
