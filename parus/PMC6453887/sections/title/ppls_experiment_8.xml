  <span class="sup">

  </span> for full details). Four speakers (Shockwave, Foxpro, Pennsylvania, USA) were evenly distributed across each plot in February and removed in July. For the first year of treatment (2013), assignment of treatments to plots was randomized, with the constraint that there be no initial differences between treatments in average breeding density, lay date, latitude, or longitude based on data from previous years. Six plots received a low-PPL treatment and six plots received a high-PPL treatment in the first year; the treatment was switched in half of the plots for the second year (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Assignment of treatments to plots was again randomized, conditional on the same constraints detailed above. In low-PPL plots, speakers were programmed to play songs of a sympatric, non-predator avian species, the Eurasian blackbird (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>). In high-PPL plots, speakers were programmed with calls from sparrowhawks (
  <span class="italic">Accipter nisus</span>; a sympatric, avian predator species). Bird sounds were acquired from the Xeno-Canto database (

All speakers were programed to match the normal vocalization of our playback species: speakers broadcast approximately 60% of the time during the first 3 h after dawn and the last 3 h before dusk (six 6-min song/call bouts per hour) and speakers broadcast approximately 15% of the time during the rest of the daylight hours (1.5 bouts per hour). The amount of silence between playback bouts was determined randomly to avoid habituation. Playback was broadcast at 90 dB (intensity was set to match the normal intensity of bird songs and calls and was measured at 1 m with a sound level meter). Sparrowhawks are resident predators—they stay in the area of their nest and hunt over a wide territory surrounding it

  </span>. This means that presence of a sparrowhawk during the breeding season (like our sound cues) should signal potential predation risk throughout the rest of the season to prey. In addition, a single observation of a predator is known to have a long lasting effect on prey, as it is more difficult to assess absence of a predator, whereas the costs of mis-assessment are higher

  </span>. Therefore, playback was given for 4 consecutive days (on), followed by 4 consecutive days of non-playback (speakers were off), the cycle was repeated throughout the season; this design prevented habituation

  </span> without decreasing the effectiveness of the high-PPL manipulation. Data were not biased by dispersal events as only 0.13% of birds (two individuals) have moved between plots in our years of collecting data (2010–2017), and no birds moved between treatment plots during the years of our study.
