Data were collected in 2013 and 2014 in 12 forest plots that were established in a 10 × 15 km² area south-west of Munich, Germany

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Each plot consisted of 50 nest boxes arranged in a regular grid spanning approximately 9–12 ha. Lay date, clutch size, parental identities, and fledging success were monitored using standard methods (detailed in

  </span>). Adult exploratory behavior was measured for each captured parent when nestlings were 7 or 9 days old, using a cage test adapted from a classic novel environment test

  </span> for a full description of the procedure. Briefly, each individual was recorded for 2 min; the sum of movements between different locations (scores ranged from 2 to 130) was used as a proxy of exploratory behavior. Values were scored later from the recording by an observer blind to the subject’s identity and treatment. This exploration score is a measure of activity that correlates with anti-predator boldness in our population

  </span> thus we have validated its use as a proxy for risk-taking behavior in the face of predation threat. We performed 607 tests on 497 unique (ringed) birds. Of these, 387 were tested in only 1 year and 110 were tested in both years. Of the 110 birds with repeat measures, 29 individuals received the predator treatment both years, 32 received control both years, and 49 received both treatments.
