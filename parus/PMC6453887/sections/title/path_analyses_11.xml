Those tri-variate models included the same fixed and random effects structures as detailed for the bivariate models; as both models estimated covariances among three traits expressed within the same environment, among-individual correlations were calculated from a model estimating all level-specific covariances (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). Path analysis was subsequently applied to the among-individual correlation matrix estimated for each treatment group separately (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). The sem package in R was used to calculate path coefficients (plus standard errors) associated with a model simultaneously hypothesizing that exploratory behavior affected clutch size directly, as well as indirectly by affecting lay date (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The value of 
  <span class="italic">P</span> associated with each path was calculated using 
  <span class="italic">z</span>-tests. We used 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-tests to compare estimates from the two treatment groups.
