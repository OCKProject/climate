  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The eukaryote genome is broadly comprised of exons (coding sequence and untranslated regions, or UTRs), introns (noncoding sequence in a gene) and intergenic regions (noncoding sequence between genes). In the human genome, only ∼1.5% of sequence codes for amino acids, but around 10–15% of sequence is estimated to be functionally constrained, highlighting the evolutionary significance of noncoding sequence (Ponting and Hardison 
   <a rid="b114" ref-type="bibr" href="#b114">2011</a>). Because evolutionary approaches used to estimate functional constraint of sequence are limited by not accounting for sequences that are rapidly evolving and/or sequences that have lineage-specific functions, quantifying the amount of the genome that performs a biological function has proven difficult (Pheasant and Mattick 
   <a rid="b113" ref-type="bibr" href="#b113">2007</a>; Ponting and Hardison 
   <a rid="b114" ref-type="bibr" href="#b114">2011</a>; Mattick and Dinger 
   <a rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" href="#b103">2013</a>). Emerging genomic studies are challenging the traditional view that most of our DNA is ‘junk’ (e.g. Vernot et al. 
   <a rid="b153" ref-type="bibr" href="#b153">2012</a>; Grossman et al. 
   <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2013</a>). Most prominently, the ENCODE Project Consortium recently assigned potential biochemical functions to ∼80% of the human genome (Dunham et al. 
   <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">2012</a>). Although the claim that most of our genome may be functional has attracted criticism, primarily concerning ENCODE's definition of a functional element (e.g. Doolittle 
   <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2013</a>; Graur et al. 
   <a rid="b54" ref-type="bibr" href="#b54">2013</a>), ENCODE's findings have served to highlight how much there is still to learn about how genomes function and the mechanisms underlying evolution. As we still do not have a good understanding of how much of the genome is functional, it is important to remain open-minded (Ball 
   <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2013</a>; Mattick and Dinger 
   <a rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" href="#b103">2013</a>; Mudge et al. 
   <a rid="b106" ref-type="bibr" href="#b106">2013</a>). Even if not currently functional, much of the genome is still likely to represent a pool of variation that may be brought into use in the future, further blurring the boundaries of ‘function’ (Khaitovich et al. 
   <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2006</a>; Wagner 
   <a rid="b157" ref-type="bibr" href="#b157">2011</a>, 
   <a rid="b158" ref-type="bibr" href="#b158">2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite constituting only a small fraction of most genomes, genes and their adjacent regulatory regions have been the usual focus of studies of adaptive variation under the rationale that they are the regions of discernible function. Because nonsynonymous mutations in coding regions of genes alter the amino acid sequence of a protein or a nucleotide sequence of the mature RNA, they can alter a gene product or even eliminate its function (Stern and Orgogozo 
   <a rid="b141" ref-type="bibr" href="#b141">2009</a>). Many genetic studies link specific nonsynonymous mutations (which are usually alleles of relatively large phenotypic effect) to changes in phenotypes. Whilst synonymous mutations by definition do not alter the primary amino acid sequence of a gene product, some perform regulatory roles including transcription enhancement, microRNA targeting and alternative splicing (Goode et al. 
   <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2010</a>; Lin et al. 
   <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">2011</a>). Adaptive phenotypic changes can also be controlled by regulatory mutations that alter gene expression, and can be a predominant source of adaptation (Attanasio et al. 
   <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2013</a>; Fraser 
   <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2013</a>). Whilst regulatory elements often occur near or within their target genes (e.g. 
   <span class="italic">cis-</span>regulatory elements in the upstream 5' untranslated region (UTR), the downstream 3'UTR, the promoter region and within the coding sequence), they can also occur at greater distances (e.g. 
   <span class="italic">trans</span>-regulatory elements); enhancers often lie 10–100 kb from their target genes (Lindblad-Toh et al. 
   <a rid="b94" ref-type="bibr" href="#b94">2011</a>; Attanasio et al. 
   <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent studies suggest that a large proportion of adaptively important regulatory variation may reside in noncoding regions (Gaffney and Keightley 
   <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2006</a>; Goode et al. 
   <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2010</a>; Lin et al. 
   <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">2011</a>; Lindblad-Toh et al. 
   <a rid="b94" ref-type="bibr" href="#b94">2011</a>). For example, comparative analyses of mouse and rat genomes revealed that evolutionarily conserved elements in noncoding sequence were three times more common than those found in coding sequence, and the majority were located in intergenic regions &gt; 5 kb from known genes (i.e. beyond the promoter region) (Gaffney and Keightley 
   <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2006</a>). Similarly, a comparative analysis of 29 mammalian genomes revealed that the majority of evolutionarily constrained elements occurred in intronic (29.7%) and intergenic (38.6%) regions that were not associated with known protein-coding transcripts (Lin et al. 
   <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">2011</a>; Lindblad-Toh et al. 
   <a rid="b94" ref-type="bibr" href="#b94">2011</a>). Genome-wide association studies have also highlighted the evolutionary significance of noncoding sequence, finding as much as 88% of trait-/disease-associated variants lies in noncoding sequence (Altshuler et al. 
   <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2008</a>; Hindorff et al. 
   <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2009</a>). Although nonsynonymous mutations may have, on average, an individually larger effect on phenotype compared with regulatory mutations, the large number of evolutionarily conserved and/or trait-associated variants occurring in intergenic and intronic regions suggests a strong and previously under-appreciated contribution of noncoding sequence to phenotypes (Boyko et al. 
   <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2008</a>; Goode et al. 
   <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2010</a>; Vernot et al. 
   <a rid="b153" ref-type="bibr" href="#b153">2012</a>). Indeed, recent evidence suggests that regulatory changes affecting gene expression may be more important than changes in protein-coding regions in driving rapid evolution (Jones et al. 
   <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2012</a>; Langley et al. 
   <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">2012</a>; Vernot et al. 
   <a rid="b153" ref-type="bibr" href="#b153">2012</a>; Fraser 
   <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2013</a>; Grossman et al. 
   <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A large amount of genetic variation that is present but invisible at the phenotypic level (i.e. cryptic variation) enables populations to adapt faster to environmental change (Le Rouzic and Carlborg 
   <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">2008</a>; Wagner 
   <a rid="b157" ref-type="bibr" href="#b157">2011</a>, 
   <a rid="b158" ref-type="bibr" href="#b158">2012</a>; Masel 
   <a rid="b102" ref-type="bibr" href="#b102">2013</a>). For example, in an experiment involving 
   <span class="italic">Azoarcus</span> derived RNA enzymes (ribozymes), populations containing large amounts of cryptic variation adapted six times faster to a new chemical environment than did populations with little cryptic variation (Hayden et al. 
   <a rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" href="#b61">2011</a>). Accumulated cryptic variants can constitute a kind of genetic ‘charge’ that can be released during periods of environmental stress (Le Rouzic and Carlborg 
   <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">2008</a>; Masel 
   <a rid="b102" ref-type="bibr" href="#b102">2013</a>). The release of charge occurs via the epistatic interactions of evolutionary ‘capacitors,’ which ‘switch on’ cryptic variation under particular circumstances. The most well-known example of an evolutionary capacitor is the chaperone Hsp90 (heat-shock protein 90) which, when down-regulated (e.g. in times of stress) in many organisms (including 
   <span class="italic">Arabidopsis,</span> zebrafish 
   <span class="italic">Danio rerio</span> and wild 
   <span class="italic">Drosophila</span>), releases a variety of different phenotypes that are not expressed under benign conditions (Chen and Wagner 
   <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2012</a>; Masel 
   <a rid="b102" ref-type="bibr" href="#b102">2013</a>). Additional examples in the literature are rare, but a recent study presented evidence for multiple capacitors that reveal subtle quantitative variation in wing morphology in 
   <span class="italic">Drosophila melanogaster</span> (Takahashi 
   <a rid="b143" ref-type="bibr" href="#b143">2013</a>). Although there is still much to be learned, release of cryptic standing genetic variation may constitute a routine mechanism for adaptation (Masel 
   <a rid="b102" ref-type="bibr" href="#b102">2013</a>; Siegal 
   <a rid="b136" ref-type="bibr" href="#b136">2013</a>; Trotter et al.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Epigenetic components of evolutionary potential</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmentally induced, transmissible phenotypic variation has been empirically demonstrated to arise from a diversity of non-Mendelian inheritance mechanisms known as ‘nongenetic inheritance’ (reviewed in Bonduriansky et al. 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2012</a>). This phenomenon comprises all parent–offspring inheritance other than DNA sequence variants and can be classed broadly under ‘epigenetics’ to include any nongenetic mechanisms (somatic, behavioural and cultural inheritance), or DNA proximate molecular-level mechanisms 
   <span class="italic">sensu stricto</span> (Bonduriansky et al. 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2012</a>; Ledón-Rettig 
   <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2013</a>). Here, we focus on molecular-level epigenetic factors that regulate gene expression via biochemical alterations to chromatin structure (e.g. DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications), or through the actions of small noncoding RNAs (Ledón-Rettig 
   <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2013</a>; Schrey et al. 
   <a rid="b133" ref-type="bibr" href="#b133">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once thought to manifest only in transient, exquisite, developmental gene expression programmes that were reset in the germ line, the discovery of transgenerational stability of novel epigenetic states showed that natural variation can exist outside the DNA sequence and cause heritable variation in phenotypes even in the absence of genetic variation (Richards et al. 
   <a rid="b123" ref-type="bibr" href="#b123">2010</a>; Ledón-Rettig 
   <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2013</a>). Viewed as an extension of conventional within-generation phenotypic plasticity, nongenetic inheritance may serve to buffer a population against rapid environmental change (Bonduriansky et al. 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2012</a>; Ledón-Rettig 
   <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2013</a>). Some types of epigenetic change may also promote the eventual transition of adaptive mechanisms from nongenetic alterations to changes in DNA sequence (Flores et al. 
   <a rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43">2013</a>). For example, DNA methylation is known to increase the likelihood of cytosine-to-thymine transitions and thus may increase the likelihood of sequence mutations in regions that are methylated repeatedly across generations (Flores et al. 
   <a rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43">2013</a>). Although lack of empirical data fuels debate regarding long-term evolutionary trajectories, transgenerational epigenetic effects have added another layer of complexity to our understanding of at least short-term adaptive responses to environmental change (Bonduriansky et al. 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2012</a>; Ledón-Rettig 
   <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA methylation has been the most commonly studied epigenetic mechanism (Schrey et al. 
   <a rid="b133" ref-type="bibr" href="#b133">2013</a>). The technique of methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism (MS-AFLP) is currently the most tractable option for identifying and characterizing environmentally dependent epigenetic variation in natural populations (Schrey et al. 
   <a rid="b133" ref-type="bibr" href="#b133">2013</a>; Table
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). Despite some conceptual and technical limitations (reviewed in Schrey et al. 
   <a rid="b133" ref-type="bibr" href="#b133">2013</a>), there is potential for MS-AFLP, or alternative methods (e.g. bisulphite sequencing: Cokus et al. 
   <a rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27">2008</a>; or array-based methods: Marinković et al. 
   <a rid="b101" ref-type="bibr" href="#b101">2012</a>), to be used to characterize epigenetic variation in natural populations and thus identify populations or individuals that have the greatest capacity to rapidly adjust to environment change, at least in the short-term (Liebl et al. 
   <a rid="b91" ref-type="bibr" href="#b91">2013</a>; Schrey et al.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The burgeoning field of ecological epigenetics aims to characterize evolutionary and ecologically important phenotypic variation from nongenetic sources, particularly under rapid environmental change (Bonduriansky et al. 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2012</a>; Ledón-Rettig 
   <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2013</a>; Schrey et al. 
   <a rid="b133" ref-type="bibr" href="#b133">2013</a>). Several studies have examined epigenetic effects in response to environment and as a mechanism for coping with low levels of genetic variation (e.g. Herrera et al. 
   <a rid="b64" ref-type="bibr" href="#b64">2012</a>; Richards et al. 
   <a rid="b124" ref-type="bibr" href="#b124">2012</a>). For example, in a study examining patterns of DNA methylation across an expanding population of the introduced house sparrow 
   <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span> in Kenya, Liebl et al. (
   <a rid="b91" ref-type="bibr" href="#b91">2013</a>) showed that epigenetic mechanisms may increase the flexibility of populations to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Epigenetic diversity was negatively correlated with genetic diversity and positively correlated with inbreeding, suggesting DNA methylation could act as a compensatory mechanism for low standing genetic variation between individuals in recently invaded populations. Limited empirical data concerning the implications of nongenetic inheritance for evolutionary potential currently constrain the general application of epigenetics to conservation. However, there is clearly scope for gathering epigenetic information alongside genetic data to understand better the relative contributions of epigenetic and genetic mechanisms to evolutionary potential in wild populations (Bonduriansky et al. 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2012</a>; Ledón-Rettig 
   <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exploring epigenetic mechanisms can also lead to insights into other important facets of conservation. For example, devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) is a contagious cancer that has devastated Tasmanian devil 
   <span class="italic">Sarcophilus harrisii</span> populations over the last two decades (Lane et al. 
   <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2012</a>). An important part of the vertebrate immune response to infection involves signals from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) that are expressed on the surface of cells and allow the host to identify ‘nonself’ cells that should be destroyed (Bernatchez and Landry 
   <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2003</a>). DFTD evades the devil's immune system by down-regulating MHC expression on the surface of the tumour cells, a mechanism that appears to be controlled by epigenetic, rather than structural modifications (Siddle et al.
