 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rapid adaptive evolution is driven predominantly by changes in gene expression (Jones et al. 
  <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2012</a>; Fraser 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2013</a>) enabled by the presence of substantial variation in gene expression within natural populations (Oleksiak et al. 
  <a rid="b109" ref-type="bibr" href="#b109">2002</a>). Variation in gene expression is routinely approximated by mRNA abundances (the result of transcriptional activity of genes), although, as recently inferred from a comparison of quantitative proteomics and RNA-seq data, expression of proteins may depend primarily on the translational efficiency of specific genes (Taylor et al. 
  <a rid="b144" ref-type="bibr" href="#b144">2013</a>). Expression profiling (simultaneous measurement of RNA production by multiple genes) can be a valuable tool for assessing the combined outcomes of many subtle, complex processes affecting gene expression, including polygenic and epigenetic effects. Gene expression studies can also identify many of the genomic regions involved in phenotypic traits, providing information about molecular mechanisms and pathways involved and, in conjunction with other approaches (e.g. GWAS), enabling the identification of some of the specific underlying genetic variants (Attanasio et al. 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2013</a>; Filteau et al. 
  <a rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" href="#b42">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Traditionally limited to genes known from model organisms (assayed via qPCR analyses of candidate genes or cross-species hybridization on microarrays), gene expression studies were unleashed for use in nonmodel organisms by the advent of high-throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq). Many such studies begin with a 
  <span class="italic">de novo</span> assembly of a transcriptome (a collection of RNA molecules produced by a tissue that are either directly translated to proteins or are apex gene products themselves) (Schliesky et al. 
  <a rid="b131" ref-type="bibr" href="#b131">2012</a>) followed by annotation of exons using the closest available reference genomes (Vijay et al. 
  <a rid="b155" ref-type="bibr" href="#b155">2013</a>). Variation in gene expression of large numbers of individuals is then assessed either directly by RNA-seq and subsequent quantification of reads mapped back to the assembled transcriptome (Smith et al. 
  <a rid="b138" ref-type="bibr" href="#b138">2013</a>) or by designing a custom microarray to quantify the expression of only a subset of genes contained in transcriptome (Renaut and Bernatchez 
  <a rid="b121" ref-type="bibr" href="#b121">2011</a>; Kvist et al. 
  <a rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" href="#b79">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Expression of many genes is highly tissue-specific (Ekblom et al. 
  <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2010a</a>) and can be influenced by environmental conditions (Regier et al. 
  <a rid="b120" ref-type="bibr" href="#b120">2013</a>), previous experience of the organism (Feil and Fraga 
  <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">2012</a>), life-stage (Arbeitman et al. 
  <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">2002</a>) and sex (Vidotto et al. 
  <a rid="b154" ref-type="bibr" href="#b154">2013</a>). Tissue- and environment-specificity currently limit gene expression studies to situations where experimental manipulations in controlled laboratory environment are feasible and animals can be sacrificed for tissues. This makes application of gene expression studies in animal conservation challenging (e.g. only some genes, mainly of general function, would be expressed in blood or small skin tissue samples, the kind regularly obtained by conservation studies from live animals; Ekblom et al. 
  <a rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" href="#b39">2010b</a>). Nevertheless, characterization of transcriptomes will continue to be a valuable method in conservation for the detection of candidate loci for future targeted screening (e.g. Renaut et al. 
  <a rid="b122" ref-type="bibr" href="#b122">2010</a>; Bi et al. 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several challenges are associated with the analysis of gene expression data (reviewed in Harrison et al. 
  <a rid="b60" ref-type="bibr" href="#b60">2012</a>). These include (i) accounting for nonadditive effects of mutations, direction of expression change, gene copy number variation, alternative mechanisms of expression level regulation and environmental effects, and (ii) distinguishing nonadaptive differences in gene expression that are due to genetic drift from adaptive differences that are due to positive selection for advantageous traits (Harrison et al. 
  <a rid="b60" ref-type="bibr" href="#b60">2012</a>). Addressing these challenges will involve development of (i) a robust model of evolution of gene expression and (ii) an appropriate (and possibly tissue-specific) null model of neutral evolution of gene expression (Harrison et al. 
  <a rid="b60" ref-type="bibr" href="#b60">2012</a>). To understand better the role of adaptation and plasticity (genotype-environment effect) in the evolution of highly polygenic traits, it is important to explore gene expression variation from a network perspective (Filteau et al. 
  <a rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" href="#b42">2013</a>), for example, using weighted gene co-expression network approach (WGCNA; Oldham et al. 
  <a rid="b108" ref-type="bibr" href="#b108">2006</a>) or the approach developed by Fraser (
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Notwithstanding these challenges, gene expression studies published in the past few years have made a substantial contribution to our understanding of evolution, including insights into adaptive responses to environmental stressors (crimson spotted rainbowfish: Smith et al. 
  <a rid="b138" ref-type="bibr" href="#b138">2013</a>; the rooted macrophyte 
  <span class="italic">Elodea nuttallii:</span> Regier et al. 
  <a rid="b120" ref-type="bibr" href="#b120">2013</a>), the evolution of life-history traits and life-history trade-offs (Glanville fritillary butterfly 
  <span class="italic">Melitaea cinxia</span>: Wheat et al. 
  <a rid="b160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b160">2011</a>; Kvist et al. 
  <a rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" href="#b79">2013</a>), immunological adaptations (three-spined sticklebacks 
  <span class="italic">Gasterosteus aculeatus</span>: Lenz et al. 
  <a rid="b89" ref-type="bibr" href="#b89">2013</a>), reproductive isolation and ecological speciation (reviewed in Pavey et al. 
  <a rid="b111" ref-type="bibr" href="#b111">2010</a>) and adaptive radiation (cichlid fish: Manousaki et al. 
  <a rid="b99" ref-type="bibr" href="#b99">2013</a>). Genes differentially expressed under different environmental conditions could be involved in adaptation to a particular environmental factor and thus are of interest to conservation projects concerned about adaptations to future environments (Harrison et al. 
  <a rid="b60" ref-type="bibr" href="#b60">2012</a>; Smith et al. 
  <a rid="b138" ref-type="bibr" href="#b138">2013</a>). A combination of genomic approaches applied to ecological model systems of evolutionarily young and ecologically distinct lineages of nonmodel organisms (e.g. Bernatchez et al. 
  <a rid="b170" ref-type="bibr" href="#b170">2010</a>; Jones et al. 
  <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2012</a>) will continue to lead to important insights into the mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution.
