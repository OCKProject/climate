 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Earlier we presented evidence that adaptive variation resides in both coding and noncoding sequence and is predominantly polygenic and regulatory in nature. Further, gene expression can be strongly altered by non-sequence-based epigenetic variation, and even variation invisible at the level of the phenotype (i.e. cryptic variation), or not currently adaptive, may still contribute to a population's evolutionary potential. Much of this complexity is difficult to detect using standard population genomic methods, and limitations of current methods need to be considered when designing the screening approach, and when basing management decisions on genomic data (e.g. by screening coding and noncoding parts of the genome and not routinely biasing management decisions to large-effect loci). Embracing recent advances in other fields (e.g. quantitative genetics, human genetics, epigenetics, expression profiling) and factoring in the contributions of polygenic adaptation, as well as cryptic and epigenetic variation, should result in better-informed applications of conservation genomics and better estimates of evolutionary potential than have been previously possible for most wild organisms.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As we are unlikely to know in advance the best course of conservation action, a risk-management approach is appropriate for making initial decisions (

  <a rid="b159" ref-type="bibr" href="#b159">2011</a>), with subsequent actions subject to an adaptive management framework (i.e. choose the apparent best path, monitor the outcomes, then adjust the path according to outcomes) (Hansen et al. 
  <a rid="b59" ref-type="bibr" href="#b59">2012</a>). Whilst we assemble knowledge and explore the effectiveness of different genomic (and epigenomic) measures of evolutionary potential, deciding what is appropriate for a given project will depend on how well genomic control of relevant adaptive traits is understood, the level of certainty in predicted selective pressures and the genetic architecture of the trait(s) involved (i.e. underlying large-effect or small-effect loci). Below we discuss two broad, complementary genomic approaches that can be employed to greater or lesser extents, depending on the particular management scenario (summarized in Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a>). Here, management scenario encompasses the knowledge of genomics and adaptation of species, predictability of required adaptive response, genetic architecture of the trait(s) involved and specific conservation goal, all within the context of promoting evolutionary potential in wild populations. Our intention is to highlight conservation scenarios in which it may be appropriate to focus on specific, trait-based information and when it might be preferable to focus on genome-wide variation.

   <p>Schematic exploring the relative abilities of two broad genomic approaches to predict evolutionary potential, given specific trait architectures, environmental circumstances and levels of prior genetic knowledge. The two broad approaches (screening genome-wide variation and screening variation at specific large-effect loci) should not be treated as mutually exclusive alternatives, as they can be complementary (e.g. screening genome-wide variation in conjunction with specific loci of interest). For the case of organisms where there is good genetic knowledge available, (A) shows the relative ability to predict evolutionary potential based on variation at trait-specific large-effect loci (red) versus genome-wide variation (blue), with increasing ability to predict the specific required adaptive response. (B) Takes the two extremes of (A) and considers relative ability to predict evolutionary potential for model organisms (blue shaded bar), commercially valuable species (orange shaded bar) and typical species of conservation concern (green shaded bar) under I) uncertain future change and/or multi-facetted adaptive pressures (left panel) and II) under certain future change and/or single selective pressures (right panel). The blue axes plots correspond to relative ability to predict evolutionary potential using variation at trait-specific large-effect loci and the red axes plots correspond to relative ability to predict evolutionary potential using genome-wide variation. Recommendations for when the two different approaches should be employed and examples of the types of conservation goals that could be addressed using the two different approaches are given.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When high-quality genetic information is available in combination with good predictions about the nature of future environmental change, genetic variation associated with relevant traits controlled by a small number of genes may be informative about evolutionary potential (e.g. potential to adapt in response to known selective pressure). There are well-known examples of traits known to be controlled by a small number of large-effect QTLs, including armour plating associated with marine-freshwater divergence in sticklebacks, (Albert et al. 
   <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2008</a>), and flowering time in 
   <span class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> (Salomé et al. 
   <a rid="b128" ref-type="bibr" href="#b128">2011</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Including 
   <span class="italic">a priori</span> identified candidate genes in genomic screens can be beneficial because something is already known about the kinds of adaptive responses the genes are involved in (e.g. ‘bottom-up’ approach 
   <span class="italic">sensu</span> Sork et al. 
   <a rid="b139" ref-type="bibr" href="#b139">2013</a>). Genes predicted to be adaptively important can be selected using prior knowledge available and/or additional complementary approaches (e.g. expression profiling). As coding regions are typically relatively conserved, candidate genes can often be selected using the closest reference genome (Vijay et al. 
   <a rid="b155" ref-type="bibr" href="#b155">2013</a>). Alternatively, loci putatively associated with particular kinds of adaptation can be identified 
   <span class="italic">post hoc</span> from analyses of genomic sequence data (e.g. ‘top-down’ approach 
   <span class="italic">sensu</span> Sork et al. 
   <a rid="b139" ref-type="bibr" href="#b139">2013</a>) (Table
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under a scenario of divergent selection between two large populations that remain connected by moderate to high levels of gene flow (necessary to homogenize the neutral genomic background), anonymous large-effect loci associated with the adaptive divergence can be detected using standard genome-scan methods (Le Corre and Kremer 
   <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2003</a>, 
   <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2012</a>). Such scenarios do exist in nature; for example, whole-genome sequencing of three-spine sticklebacks from replicated pairs of freshwater and marine populations (connected by ongoing gene flow) identified 242 regions that were repeatedly associated with marine-freshwater divergence (Jones et al. 
   <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2012</a>). If it was predicted that a marine stickleback population would be required to adapt to freshwater conditions under environmental change, then considering variation at the 242 regions associated with freshwater adaptation (or ideally a validated subset of loci) may be informative about that population's evolutionary response.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In specific conservation situations analogous to the case just described, it might be appropriate to focus management on specific types of diversity needed to adapt to a current major threat posing immediate extinction risk to the organism. Identification of immunologically important variation (e.g. associated with the major histocompatibility complex in animals) that provides resistance to disease epizootics in the wild could be used to inform selection of resistant or immune individuals for captive breeding, reintroductions and other forms of population genetic augmentation. Key examples might include resistance to chytrid fungus in frogs (Savage and Zamudio 
   <a rid="b130" ref-type="bibr" href="#b130">2011</a>) and facial tumour disease in Tasmanian devils (Lane et al. 
   <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2012</a>). Additional candidates for allele-specific genetic rescue (
   <span class="italic">sensu</span> Allendorf et al. 
   <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2010</a>) might include self- incompatibility loci in plants (Hoebee et al. 
   <a rid="b68" ref-type="bibr" href="#b68">2008</a>), 
   <span class="italic">Pgi</span> in insects (linked to energy metabolism; Wheat et al. 
   <a rid="b160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b160">2011</a>), 
   <span class="italic">Pan</span>I in the cod family (linked to temperature, salinity and water depth; Árnason et al. 
   <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">2009</a>) and, more generally, heat-shock protein genes related to temperature stress (Sørenson et al. 
   <a rid="b199" ref-type="bibr" href="#b199">2003</a>) and circadian genes related to phenological traits (Liedvogel et al. 
   <a rid="b92" ref-type="bibr" href="#b92">2009</a>; Jimenez et al. 
   <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">2010</a>). Although prioritization of specific adaptive variants in conservation management decisions (e.g. selecting individuals for translocations in a way that enriches for genotypes predicted to be adaptively important in the recipient population) may have advantages, it risks depleting populations of other sources of adaptive variation unless measures of broader genome-wide diversity are also considered.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential to use knowledge about the genetics of specific traits to predict evolutionary potential will be greatest when the traits are controlled by a small number of genes. However, the ability to predict a population's evolutionary potential will ultimately hinge on having a reasonable degree of certainty in the predicted consequences of environmental change and an ability to predict with confidence the specific adaptive variant(s) that will be required. An extreme illustration is provided by toxic invasive cane toads (
   <span class="italic">Bufo marinus</span>), which cause almost certain, rapid death in susceptible individuals, leading to massive population declines and local extinctions (Doody et al. 
   <a rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32">2009</a>). Extremely effective biochemical resistance is provided by a few amino acid changes in one domain of one protein (Ujvari et al. 
   <a rid="b151" ref-type="bibr" href="#b151">2013</a>). In the absence of other viable management options, and given the predictable geographical progress of the invader, evolutionary rescue via resistance genes could be planned with some confidence. Despite rare examples such as cane toad invasion, uncertainty about required adaptive response(s) is likely to be much more commonplace, especially because knowledge of what is adaptive today will not necessarily translate into knowledge about what will be important tomorrow (Le Corre and Kremer 
   <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2003</a>; Allendorf et al. 
   <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2010</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Utilizing genome-wide variation to inform estimates of evolutionary potential</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In most conservation situations, genomic knowledge about traits (loci involved, additive genetic (co)variances, genetic correlations and genetic architecture) will be limited, and/or the predictability of environmental change and the required adaptive response(s) will be low. Under this scenario, screening genome-wide variation should be a sensible approach that may provide a generalized measure of evolutionary potential that accounts for the contributions of small-effect loci and cryptic variation and is robust to uncertainty about future change and required adaptive response(s). We use the term ‘genome-wide variation’ in a broad sense to reflect variation sampled representatively across the genome, which could encompass a range of metrics, including allelic diversity, heterozygosity and weighted measures that place greater importance on specific loci of interest within the context of genome-wide variation.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A possible drawback of using genome-wide estimates of evolutionary potential is the inclusion of genetic variation that might be currently nonfunctional, and hence not necessarily informative about evolutionary potential. However, two main lines of evidence support genome-wide measures of variation as appropriate proxies for evolutionary potential. First, limited data from simulation (Caballero and García-Dorado 
   <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2013</a>) and empirical (Coop et al. 
   <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2009</a>) studies suggest that patterns at a large number of random or neutral loci are likely to be correlated with variation at a smaller number of QTL or 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>ST</sub>-outlier loci. Second, and more significantly, for highly polygenic traits, genome-wide variation currently provides the best predictions of phenotypes (Meuwissen et al. 
   <a rid="b105" ref-type="bibr" href="#b105">2013</a>; Yang et al. 
   <a rid="b164" ref-type="bibr" href="#b164">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Screening genetic variation at a large number of genome-wide markers is a method already extensively used in animal and plant breeding to predict phenotypes without specific knowledge of the contributing loci (Meuwissen et al. 
   <a rid="b105" ref-type="bibr" href="#b105">2013</a>). This method (called genomic selection) uses information from all genotyped loci (typically ≫ 10 000 SNPs) to predict breeding values for desired phenotypic traits that may not be evident before an animal/plant reaches minimum breeding age (Meuwissen et al. 
   <a rid="b105" ref-type="bibr" href="#b105">2013</a>; Table
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). Trait value predictions are achieved through comparison with a training population that has been measured for the trait of interest and genotyped using the same set of markers. By using all loci to predict phenotypes, genomic selection can also account for the contributions of small-effect alleles (Meuwissen et al. 
   <a rid="b105" ref-type="bibr" href="#b105">2013</a>; Fig.
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>).
