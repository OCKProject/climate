 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When high-quality genetic information is available in combination with good predictions about the nature of future environmental change, genetic variation associated with relevant traits controlled by a small number of genes may be informative about evolutionary potential (e.g. potential to adapt in response to known selective pressure). There are well-known examples of traits known to be controlled by a small number of large-effect QTLs, including armour plating associated with marine-freshwater divergence in sticklebacks, (Albert et al. 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2008</a>), and flowering time in 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> (Salomé et al. 
  <a rid="b128" ref-type="bibr" href="#b128">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Including 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> identified candidate genes in genomic screens can be beneficial because something is already known about the kinds of adaptive responses the genes are involved in (e.g. ‘bottom-up’ approach 
  <span class="italic">sensu</span> Sork et al. 
  <a rid="b139" ref-type="bibr" href="#b139">2013</a>). Genes predicted to be adaptively important can be selected using prior knowledge available and/or additional complementary approaches (e.g. expression profiling). As coding regions are typically relatively conserved, candidate genes can often be selected using the closest reference genome (Vijay et al. 
  <a rid="b155" ref-type="bibr" href="#b155">2013</a>). Alternatively, loci putatively associated with particular kinds of adaptation can be identified 
  <span class="italic">post hoc</span> from analyses of genomic sequence data (e.g. ‘top-down’ approach 
  <span class="italic">sensu</span> Sork et al. 
  <a rid="b139" ref-type="bibr" href="#b139">2013</a>) (Table
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under a scenario of divergent selection between two large populations that remain connected by moderate to high levels of gene flow (necessary to homogenize the neutral genomic background), anonymous large-effect loci associated with the adaptive divergence can be detected using standard genome-scan methods (Le Corre and Kremer 
  <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2003</a>, 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2012</a>). Such scenarios do exist in nature; for example, whole-genome sequencing of three-spine sticklebacks from replicated pairs of freshwater and marine populations (connected by ongoing gene flow) identified 242 regions that were repeatedly associated with marine-freshwater divergence (Jones et al. 
  <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2012</a>). If it was predicted that a marine stickleback population would be required to adapt to freshwater conditions under environmental change, then considering variation at the 242 regions associated with freshwater adaptation (or ideally a validated subset of loci) may be informative about that population's evolutionary response.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In specific conservation situations analogous to the case just described, it might be appropriate to focus management on specific types of diversity needed to adapt to a current major threat posing immediate extinction risk to the organism. Identification of immunologically important variation (e.g. associated with the major histocompatibility complex in animals) that provides resistance to disease epizootics in the wild could be used to inform selection of resistant or immune individuals for captive breeding, reintroductions and other forms of population genetic augmentation. Key examples might include resistance to chytrid fungus in frogs (Savage and Zamudio 
  <a rid="b130" ref-type="bibr" href="#b130">2011</a>) and facial tumour disease in Tasmanian devils (Lane et al. 
  <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2012</a>). Additional candidates for allele-specific genetic rescue (
  <span class="italic">sensu</span> Allendorf et al. 
  <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2010</a>) might include self- incompatibility loci in plants (Hoebee et al. 
  <a rid="b68" ref-type="bibr" href="#b68">2008</a>), 
  <span class="italic">Pgi</span> in insects (linked to energy metabolism; Wheat et al. 
  <a rid="b160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b160">2011</a>), 
  <span class="italic">Pan</span>I in the cod family (linked to temperature, salinity and water depth; Árnason et al. 
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">2009</a>) and, more generally, heat-shock protein genes related to temperature stress (Sørenson et al. 
  <a rid="b199" ref-type="bibr" href="#b199">2003</a>) and circadian genes related to phenological traits (Liedvogel et al. 
  <a rid="b92" ref-type="bibr" href="#b92">2009</a>; Jimenez et al. 
  <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">2010</a>). Although prioritization of specific adaptive variants in conservation management decisions (e.g. selecting individuals for translocations in a way that enriches for genotypes predicted to be adaptively important in the recipient population) may have advantages, it risks depleting populations of other sources of adaptive variation unless measures of broader genome-wide diversity are also considered.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential to use knowledge about the genetics of specific traits to predict evolutionary potential will be greatest when the traits are controlled by a small number of genes. However, the ability to predict a population's evolutionary potential will ultimately hinge on having a reasonable degree of certainty in the predicted consequences of environmental change and an ability to predict with confidence the specific adaptive variant(s) that will be required. An extreme illustration is provided by toxic invasive cane toads (
  <span class="italic">Bufo marinus</span>), which cause almost certain, rapid death in susceptible individuals, leading to massive population declines and local extinctions (Doody et al. 
  <a rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32">2009</a>). Extremely effective biochemical resistance is provided by a few amino acid changes in one domain of one protein (Ujvari et al. 
  <a rid="b151" ref-type="bibr" href="#b151">2013</a>). In the absence of other viable management options, and given the predictable geographical progress of the invader, evolutionary rescue via resistance genes could be planned with some confidence. Despite rare examples such as cane toad invasion, uncertainty about required adaptive response(s) is likely to be much more commonplace, especially because knowledge of what is adaptive today will not necessarily translate into knowledge about what will be important tomorrow (Le Corre and Kremer 
  <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2003</a>; Allendorf et al. 
  <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2010</a>).
