 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is now understood that many – if not most – complex phenotypic traits are polygenic: they are controlled by a large number of interacting alleles of individual small phenotypic effect (Pritchard et al. 
  <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2010</a>; Le Corre and Kremer 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2012</a>; Rockman 
  <a rid="b126" ref-type="bibr" href="#b126">2012</a>; Travisano and Shaw 
  <a rid="b147" ref-type="bibr" href="#b147">2013</a>). A growing number of studies in humans (Hancock et al. 
  <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2010a</a>,
  <a rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57">b</a>; Tennessen and Akey 
  <a rid="b145" ref-type="bibr" href="#b145">2011</a>; Turchin et al. 
  <a rid="b149" ref-type="bibr" href="#b149">2012</a>; Daub et al. 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2013</a>; Fraser 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2013</a>; Yang et al. 
  <a rid="b164" ref-type="bibr" href="#b164">2013</a>) and model organisms (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span>: Atwell et al. 
  <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">2010</a>; Lee and Mitchell-Olds 
  <a rid="b87" ref-type="bibr" href="#b87">2012</a>; 
  <span class="italic">Drosophila</span>: Burke et al. 
  <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">2010</a>; Langley et al. 
  <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">2012</a>; Mouse: Fraser et al. 
  <a rid="b47" ref-type="bibr" href="#b47">2011</a>; Yeast: Fraser et al. 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2012</a>) have demonstrated the prevalence of polygenic adaptation. Despite this, the majority of commonly used methods for detecting loci putatively under selection and/or linking genotypes to phenotypes or environmental pressures (summarized in Table
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>) are strongly biased to alleles of individual large phenotypic effect (Rockman 
  <a rid="b126" ref-type="bibr" href="#b126">2012</a>; Travisano and Shaw 
  <a rid="b147" ref-type="bibr" href="#b147">2013</a>) (Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polygenic models of adaptation have been under-represented in population genetics, a field that has tended to favour classical sweep models focussing on shifts towards fixation of beneficial alleles at one or a few loci (Pritchard et al. 
  <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2010</a>). Under the polygenic model, short-term adaptation from standing variation occurs via modest shifts in allele frequencies at a large number (100s) of loci (Barton and Keightley 
  <a rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10">2002</a>; Pritchard et al. 
  <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2010</a>). Selection across many loci in response to an environmental change produces a shift towards a new phenotypic optimum, but once the new optimum is reached, selective pressures weaken before alleles are driven to fixation (Chevin and Hospital 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>; Pritchard et al. 
  <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2010</a>). Importantly, where large numbers (&gt;20) of small-effect loci control a given trait, large phenotypic differences at adaptive traits can exist between populations without strong underlying differences in allele frequencies (Le Corre and Kremer 
  <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2003</a>, 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2012</a>). Detecting signatures of polygenic adaptation using single-locus methods becomes increasingly challenging as the number of loci involved increases, particularly in situations where populations are connected by medium to high levels of gene flow and selection is recent or ongoing (Le Corre and Kremer 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2012</a>). Such scenarios are likely to exist for many natural populations, indicated by emerging evidence of polygenic adaptation in wild populations that was undetectable using standard, single-locus methods (e.g. for trees: Ma et al. 
  <a rid="b97" ref-type="bibr" href="#b97">2010</a>; Eckert et al. 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2013</a>; fish: Perrier et al. 
  <a rid="b112" ref-type="bibr" href="#b112">2013</a>; and birds: Robinson et al. 
  <a rid="b125" ref-type="bibr" href="#b125">2013</a>; Santure et al. 
  <a rid="b129" ref-type="bibr" href="#b129">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genome-wide-association studies (GWASs) have revealed many novel variants associated with complex traits, but have not proven a panacea; significantly associated variants are collectively still unable to explain a substantial part of heritable variation in complex traits (Hancock et al. 
  <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2010a</a>; Stranger et al. 
  <a rid="b142" ref-type="bibr" href="#b142">2011</a>; Rockman 
  <a rid="b126" ref-type="bibr" href="#b126">2012</a>). Although limited in their ability to detect the alleles of smallest effect (Le Corre and Kremer 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2012</a>; Rockman 
  <a rid="b126" ref-type="bibr" href="#b126">2012</a>), GWASs and environmental correlation methods can reveal subtle patterns of adaptive divergence that are too weak to be detected using standard genomic methods such as genome-wide selection scans (GWSS) or QTN/QTL programs (Joost et al. 
  <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2007</a>; Coop et al. 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2010</a>; Hancock et al. 
  <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2010a</a>,
  <a rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57">b</a>; Eckert et al. 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2010</a>; Stranger et al. 
  <a rid="b142" ref-type="bibr" href="#b142">2011</a>; Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>). For example, Hancock et al. (
  <a rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57">2010b</a>) inferred rapid adaptation across human populations in response to climate, diet and mode of subsistence (e.g. agriculture, foraging) based on subtle shifts in allele frequencies detected using novel Bayesian environmental correlation methods that also account for population structure (Coop et al. 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most current methods are fundamentally limited in their ability to detect polygenic adaptation because they look for signatures of selection at individual loci, rather than the combined contributions of multiple loci (Pritchard et al. 
  <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2010</a>; Le Corre and Kremer 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2012</a>). Indeed, a large proportion of the ‘missing heritability’ that has plagued GWASs of human complex traits can be ‘found’ by considering all screened SNPs, rather than just those with significant phenotypic associations (Yang et al. 
  <a rid="b162" ref-type="bibr" href="#b162">2010</a>, 
  <a rid="b164" ref-type="bibr" href="#b164">2013</a>). For example, Yang et al. (
  <a rid="b162" ref-type="bibr" href="#b162">2010</a>) increased the explained amount of phenotypic variance in human height from 5% to 45% by considering all SNPs simultaneously, rather than just focusing on the large-effect SNPs that pass stringent significance testing. Yang et al. (
  <a rid="b164" ref-type="bibr" href="#b164">2013</a>) further demonstrated the ubiquity of polygenic adaptation, finding that for 49 human complex traits, an average of one third (range: 8–77%) of phenotypic variance could be explained using &gt;300 000 SNPs on a particular genotyping array. The majority of remaining unexplained variance was likely due to causal variants not included in the SNP array: any ∼1% of the genome explained ∼1% of the heritability, with the implication that whole-genome sequencing data (as opposed to SNP array data) should explain all phenotypic variation in the trait (Yang et al. 
  <a rid="b164" ref-type="bibr" href="#b164">2013</a>). Novel methods are emerging that look for coordinated shifts in allele frequencies across sets of loci, rather than at individual loci (Turchin et al. 
  <a rid="b149" ref-type="bibr" href="#b149">2012</a>; Berg and Coop 
  <a rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13">2013</a>; Daub et al. 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2013</a>; Fraser 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2013</a>). For example, alleles known 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> to be associated with increased height were systematically higher in frequency in northern than in southern European populations, providing one of the first empirical examples of widespread weak selection acting on standing genetic variation (i.e. polygenic adaptation) in humans (Turchin et al. 
  <a rid="b149" ref-type="bibr" href="#b149">2012</a>). An approach that jointly considers all genes involved in a given biological pathway and tests them for signatures of positive selection has also proved a novel and powerful method for detecting polygenic adaptation (e.g. Daub et al. 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2013</a>; Fraser 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although studies considering the combined contributions of multiple loci are rare in nonmodel systems, pioneering examples do exist. For example, Ma et al. (
  <a rid="b97" ref-type="bibr" href="#b97">2010</a>) sought signatures of selection across populations of European aspen 
  <span class="italic">Populus tremula</span>, finding that 20–25% of phenotypic variation in growth cessation (a trait involved in adaptation to different light regimes) could not be attributed to individual SNPs, but could be explained by positive covariance in allelic effects. Similarly, for another well-studied tree species, the loblolly pine 
  <span class="italic">Pinus taeda</span>, Eckert et al. (
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2013</a>) found that for many phenotypic traits, signatures of selection were evident only when loci were considered at the level of functional sets (i.e. across all loci associated with a particular trait). The methods used in both these examples require some prior knowledge of loci underlying traits of interest (e.g. obtained through genome-wide-association studies) and thus may not be currently feasible for many species of conservation concern, for which resources may be limiting. This may change, however, as human genetics advances and new methods for detecting polygenic adaptation are developed.
