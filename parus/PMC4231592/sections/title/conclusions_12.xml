 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we have outlined some of the complexity regarding adaptation genetics and explored limitations and recent advances in the application of genomic tools to conservation. Recent advances in the fields of quantitative and human genetics have revealed that adaptively important variation is dispersed throughout the genome, with regulatory variants and epigenetic mechanisms playing an important role in shaping gene expression and rapid adaptive evolution. Polygenic adaptation is widespread and even cryptic genetic variation that is hidden at the phenotypic level may make an important contribution to evolutionary potential. The complexity of adaptation genetics needs to be appropriately considered when planning genomic screens and subsequently when basing management decisions on genomic data. When the genomic basis of adaptation and future threats are well understood, it may be appropriate to focus management on particular adaptive traits that are likely to be of importance. For more typical conservation situations, we argue that screening genome-wide variation may provide bet-hedging estimates of evolutionary potential that account for small-effect and cryptic variants and are relatively robust to uncertainty about future environments and required adaptive change. Mining such data to understand adaptation within an adaptive management framework of conservation actions, integrating genomic advances into a quantitative genetics framework, empirically testing the effectiveness of genomic measures of evolutionary potential relevant to population persistence, and exploration of the relative contributions of epigenetic and genetic mechanisms to evolutionary potential are exciting fields in the development of conservation genomics.</p>
