 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although infeasible for most wild populations, integrating genomic approaches into an experimental evolution framework (Evolve and Resequence/E&amp;R 
  <span class="italic">sensu</span> Turner et al. 
  <a rid="b150" ref-type="bibr" href="#b150">2011</a>) is a useful approach for elucidating adaptation architecture (Kawecki et al. 
  <a rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" href="#b75">2012</a>; Tobler et al. 
  <a rid="b146" ref-type="bibr" href="#b146">2014</a>). E&amp;R applied to model systems may yield information about the genetic basis of adaptive traits that in some circumstances may be transferable to related taxa and natural systems (Kristensen et al. 
  <a rid="b77" ref-type="bibr" href="#b77">2007</a>). For example, Li et al. (
  <a rid="b90" ref-type="bibr" href="#b90">2013</a>) simulated future climate change scenarios in growth chambers and used GWAS to look for corresponding shifts in the genetic architecture of flowering time in 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> (a trait known to be controlled by a relatively small number of large-effect QTL). The authors were able to identify major QTL influencing the thermal sensitivity of flowering time and to build a genetic model that was able to successfully predict flowering time of given genotypes in their future climate scenarios. Approaches that link genotypes to their environments within an experimental evolution framework can identify the loci that may promote adaptive responses to environmental change. Although there are obvious limitations to applying these experimental approaches directly to many wild populations, there is good scope for application to commercially valuable crop and animal species and potential for some information to transfer to related wild taxa (Li et al. 
  <a rid="b90" ref-type="bibr" href="#b90">2013</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pragmatic conservation does not necessarily require particular phenotypes to be linked to their respective genotypes. Rather, pragmatic conservation requires sequence-based estimates of evolutionary potential to be linked to the likelihood of persistence (i.e. population viability) under future environments (Allendorf et al. 
  <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2010</a>). Understanding how estimates of evolutionary potential translate into population viability is crucial if population viability analyses (PVAs) are to assist management decisions effectively. Although genomics has the potential to provide more representative estimates of evolutionary potential than have been previously feasible, the nature and extent of relationships between genome-wide diversity, fitness and population viability needs to be established (Allendorf et al. 
  <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A feasible approach might be to calibrate genomic estimates of evolutionary potential in nonmodel organisms with estimates from model populations where evolution has been more rigorously measured. Past empirical studies of model organisms (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Drosophila</span>) have looked for correlations between traditional measures of standing genetic diversity (e.g. based on a handful of microsatellite markers) and either fitness and/or evolutionary potential in response to environmental stressors (Reed and Frankham 
  <a rid="b118" ref-type="bibr" href="#b118">2001</a>; Gilligan et al. 
  <a rid="b52" ref-type="bibr" href="#b52">2005</a>; Bijlsma and Loeschcke 
  <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2012</a>). There is scope for these studies to be repeated using genomic sequence data to compare different kinds of measures of genome-wide variation (e.g. unweighted or weighted towards particular adaptive variation) and determine which measures can provide robust predictions of evolutionary adaptation and population persistence. If higher estimates of evolutionary potential based on particular measures of genome-wide variation consistently reflect a higher likelihood of population persistence under multiple, different environmental stressors, then uncertainties surrounding future environmental conditions become less problematic, at least in the context of key conservation management questions concerning evolutionary potential.
