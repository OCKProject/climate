 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The eukaryote genome is broadly comprised of exons (coding sequence and untranslated regions, or UTRs), introns (noncoding sequence in a gene) and intergenic regions (noncoding sequence between genes). In the human genome, only ∼1.5% of sequence codes for amino acids, but around 10–15% of sequence is estimated to be functionally constrained, highlighting the evolutionary significance of noncoding sequence (Ponting and Hardison 
  <a rid="b114" ref-type="bibr" href="#b114">2011</a>). Because evolutionary approaches used to estimate functional constraint of sequence are limited by not accounting for sequences that are rapidly evolving and/or sequences that have lineage-specific functions, quantifying the amount of the genome that performs a biological function has proven difficult (Pheasant and Mattick 
  <a rid="b113" ref-type="bibr" href="#b113">2007</a>; Ponting and Hardison 
  <a rid="b114" ref-type="bibr" href="#b114">2011</a>; Mattick and Dinger 
  <a rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" href="#b103">2013</a>). Emerging genomic studies are challenging the traditional view that most of our DNA is ‘junk’ (e.g. Vernot et al. 
  <a rid="b153" ref-type="bibr" href="#b153">2012</a>; Grossman et al. 
  <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2013</a>). Most prominently, the ENCODE Project Consortium recently assigned potential biochemical functions to ∼80% of the human genome (Dunham et al. 
  <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">2012</a>). Although the claim that most of our genome may be functional has attracted criticism, primarily concerning ENCODE's definition of a functional element (e.g. Doolittle 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2013</a>; Graur et al. 
  <a rid="b54" ref-type="bibr" href="#b54">2013</a>), ENCODE's findings have served to highlight how much there is still to learn about how genomes function and the mechanisms underlying evolution. As we still do not have a good understanding of how much of the genome is functional, it is important to remain open-minded (Ball 
  <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2013</a>; Mattick and Dinger 
  <a rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" href="#b103">2013</a>; Mudge et al. 
  <a rid="b106" ref-type="bibr" href="#b106">2013</a>). Even if not currently functional, much of the genome is still likely to represent a pool of variation that may be brought into use in the future, further blurring the boundaries of ‘function’ (Khaitovich et al. 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2006</a>; Wagner 
  <a rid="b157" ref-type="bibr" href="#b157">2011</a>, 
  <a rid="b158" ref-type="bibr" href="#b158">2012</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite constituting only a small fraction of most genomes, genes and their adjacent regulatory regions have been the usual focus of studies of adaptive variation under the rationale that they are the regions of discernible function. Because nonsynonymous mutations in coding regions of genes alter the amino acid sequence of a protein or a nucleotide sequence of the mature RNA, they can alter a gene product or even eliminate its function (Stern and Orgogozo 
  <a rid="b141" ref-type="bibr" href="#b141">2009</a>). Many genetic studies link specific nonsynonymous mutations (which are usually alleles of relatively large phenotypic effect) to changes in phenotypes. Whilst synonymous mutations by definition do not alter the primary amino acid sequence of a gene product, some perform regulatory roles including transcription enhancement, microRNA targeting and alternative splicing (Goode et al. 
  <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2010</a>; Lin et al. 
  <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">2011</a>). Adaptive phenotypic changes can also be controlled by regulatory mutations that alter gene expression, and can be a predominant source of adaptation (Attanasio et al. 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2013</a>; Fraser 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2013</a>). Whilst regulatory elements often occur near or within their target genes (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">cis-</span>regulatory elements in the upstream 5' untranslated region (UTR), the downstream 3'UTR, the promoter region and within the coding sequence), they can also occur at greater distances (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-regulatory elements); enhancers often lie 10–100 kb from their target genes (Lindblad-Toh et al. 
  <a rid="b94" ref-type="bibr" href="#b94">2011</a>; Attanasio et al. 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent studies suggest that a large proportion of adaptively important regulatory variation may reside in noncoding regions (Gaffney and Keightley 
  <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2006</a>; Goode et al. 
  <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2010</a>; Lin et al. 
  <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">2011</a>; Lindblad-Toh et al. 
  <a rid="b94" ref-type="bibr" href="#b94">2011</a>). For example, comparative analyses of mouse and rat genomes revealed that evolutionarily conserved elements in noncoding sequence were three times more common than those found in coding sequence, and the majority were located in intergenic regions &gt; 5 kb from known genes (i.e. beyond the promoter region) (Gaffney and Keightley 
  <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2006</a>). Similarly, a comparative analysis of 29 mammalian genomes revealed that the majority of evolutionarily constrained elements occurred in intronic (29.7%) and intergenic (38.6%) regions that were not associated with known protein-coding transcripts (Lin et al. 
  <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">2011</a>; Lindblad-Toh et al. 
  <a rid="b94" ref-type="bibr" href="#b94">2011</a>). Genome-wide association studies have also highlighted the evolutionary significance of noncoding sequence, finding as much as 88% of trait-/disease-associated variants lies in noncoding sequence (Altshuler et al. 
  <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2008</a>; Hindorff et al. 
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2009</a>). Although nonsynonymous mutations may have, on average, an individually larger effect on phenotype compared with regulatory mutations, the large number of evolutionarily conserved and/or trait-associated variants occurring in intergenic and intronic regions suggests a strong and previously under-appreciated contribution of noncoding sequence to phenotypes (Boyko et al. 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2008</a>; Goode et al. 
  <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2010</a>; Vernot et al. 
  <a rid="b153" ref-type="bibr" href="#b153">2012</a>). Indeed, recent evidence suggests that regulatory changes affecting gene expression may be more important than changes in protein-coding regions in driving rapid evolution (Jones et al. 
  <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2012</a>; Langley et al. 
  <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">2012</a>; Vernot et al. 
  <a rid="b153" ref-type="bibr" href="#b153">2012</a>; Fraser 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2013</a>; Grossman et al. 
  <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2013</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A large amount of genetic variation that is present but invisible at the phenotypic level (i.e. cryptic variation) enables populations to adapt faster to environmental change (Le Rouzic and Carlborg 
  <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">2008</a>; Wagner 
  <a rid="b157" ref-type="bibr" href="#b157">2011</a>, 
  <a rid="b158" ref-type="bibr" href="#b158">2012</a>; Masel 
  <a rid="b102" ref-type="bibr" href="#b102">2013</a>). For example, in an experiment involving 
  <span class="italic">Azoarcus</span> derived RNA enzymes (ribozymes), populations containing large amounts of cryptic variation adapted six times faster to a new chemical environment than did populations with little cryptic variation (Hayden et al. 
  <a rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" href="#b61">2011</a>). Accumulated cryptic variants can constitute a kind of genetic ‘charge’ that can be released during periods of environmental stress (Le Rouzic and Carlborg 
  <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">2008</a>; Masel 
  <a rid="b102" ref-type="bibr" href="#b102">2013</a>). The release of charge occurs via the epistatic interactions of evolutionary ‘capacitors,’ which ‘switch on’ cryptic variation under particular circumstances. The most well-known example of an evolutionary capacitor is the chaperone Hsp90 (heat-shock protein 90) which, when down-regulated (e.g. in times of stress) in many organisms (including 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis,</span> zebrafish 
  <span class="italic">Danio rerio</span> and wild 
  <span class="italic">Drosophila</span>), releases a variety of different phenotypes that are not expressed under benign conditions (Chen and Wagner 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2012</a>; Masel 
  <a rid="b102" ref-type="bibr" href="#b102">2013</a>). Additional examples in the literature are rare, but a recent study presented evidence for multiple capacitors that reveal subtle quantitative variation in wing morphology in 
  <span class="italic">Drosophila melanogaster</span> (Takahashi 
  <a rid="b143" ref-type="bibr" href="#b143">2013</a>). Although there is still much to be learned, release of cryptic standing genetic variation may constitute a routine mechanism for adaptation (Masel 
  <a rid="b102" ref-type="bibr" href="#b102">2013</a>; Siegal 
  <a rid="b136" ref-type="bibr" href="#b136">2013</a>; Trotter et al. 
  <a rid="b148" ref-type="bibr" href="#b148">2013</a>).
