 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In some conservation situations (akin to panel II in Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a>B), genomic advances may feed well into a quantitative genetics framework and allow for predictions of evolutionary potential and population responses to selection. As we outlined earlier, by supplying relatedness information, dense marker genotyping afforded by genomic advances has made previously unfeasible estimation of key quantitative genetic parameters (e.g. additive genetic (co)variance, genetic correlations) possible for nonmodel populations (Gay et al. 
  <a rid="b50" ref-type="bibr" href="#b50">2013</a>; Robinson et al. 
  <a rid="b125" ref-type="bibr" href="#b125">2013</a>). Marker-based animal models and genomic selection methods are two promising, broad approaches for the estimation of additive genetic variance and genetic correlations in natural populations (Wilson et al. 
  <a rid="b161" ref-type="bibr" href="#b161">2010</a>; Sillanpää 
  <a rid="b137" ref-type="bibr" href="#b137">2011</a>; Hill 
  <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2012</a>; Gay et al. 
  <a rid="b50" ref-type="bibr" href="#b50">2013</a>; Table
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). Such multimarker methods have been used to estimate the additive genetic variance of traits in humans (Yang et al. 
  <a rid="b162" ref-type="bibr" href="#b162">2010</a>, 
  <a rid="b163" ref-type="bibr" href="#b163">2011</a>; Stanton-Geddes et al. 
  <a rid="b140" ref-type="bibr" href="#b140">2013</a>) and in wild bird populations (wing length: Robinson et al. 
  <a rid="b125" ref-type="bibr" href="#b125">2013</a>). In a pioneering study, Robinson et al. (
  <a rid="b125" ref-type="bibr" href="#b125">2013</a>) used thousands of genome-wide SNPs to construct a pairwise relatedness matrix among individuals from an ecological study population of great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>. Estimates of additive genetic variance for a complex quantitative trait (wing length) were derived using the relatedness matrix and then validated using extensive simulations and known pedigree information.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Notwithstanding limitations discussed earlier, the prospect that coancestries (i.e. genetic relationships among individuals), additive genetic (co)variances and genetic correlations could be estimated in natural populations using large-scale genomic data without the need for detailed pedigrees is an exciting one and would open up a raft of possibilities for exploring trait architecture and evolutionary potential in nonmodel systems (de Cara et al. 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">2013</a>; Edwards 
  <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">2013</a>). In quantitative genetics, a population's response to selection at a single trait (i.e. how the mean value of a trait changes across generations in response to selection) is measured using the breeder's equation: 
  <span class="italic">R</span> = 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>
  <span class="italic">S</span>, where 
  <span class="italic">R</span> is the per generation response to selection, 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> is the heritability and S is the selection differential (Lynch and Walsh 
  <a rid="b96" ref-type="bibr" href="#b96">1998</a>). A population's response to selection will thus hinge on both the intensity of selection and on the additive genetic variance associated with the trait of interest. Because in natural systems, selection is likely to act on a set of traits simultaneously, genetic correlations between traits must be accounted for using a multivariate version of the breeder's equation: 
  <span class="italic">R</span> = 
  <span class="italic">G</span>β, where 
  <span class="italic">G</span> is the additive genetic covariance matrix and β is the selection gradient (Lande and Arnold 
  <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">1983</a>; Hill and Kirkpatrick 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2010</a>). Although the breeder's equation has proven a poor predictor of phenotypic trends in wild populations (many explanations are given including poor estimates of additive (co)variances and selection, failure to measure all correlated traits, changing environments), genomics advances may lead to some improvements (Kruuk et al. 
  <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">2008</a>). Genomics has enabled estimates of additive genetic (co)variance and genetic correlations, although selection intensities must still be obtained through estimates of the association between phenotypes and relative fitness (or breeding values 
  <span class="italic">sensu</span> animal and plant breeding), which may often be challenging in wild populations (Lynch and Walsh 
  <a rid="b96" ref-type="bibr" href="#b96">1998</a>; Visscher et al. 
  <a rid="b156" ref-type="bibr" href="#b156">2008</a>). Nonetheless, in conservation situations where the required adaptive response is predictable and phenotypic data for relevant traits and fitness information are attainable, genomic estimates of additive genetic variance and genetic correlations for sets of adaptively important traits could be integrated into a quantitative genetics framework and used to predict a population's response to a particular selective pressure.
