  <p>Schematic of the molecular basis of evolutionary potential. (A) The components of evolutionary potential are divided into its epigenetic (i.e. nongenetic inheritance not attributable to DNA sequence) and genetic (i.e. sequence-based) components. (B) Evolutionary potential is further divided into different types of underlying variation based on function. (C) Examples of the different types of variation are listed. (D) Different types of variation differ in their typical individual effect size on phenotype. (E) The typical ability to detect signals of selection differs between methods, as indicated by the shaded bars. Additional information about the methods in (E) can be found in Table
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>. Signatures of selection on epigenetic variants that are in linkage disequilibrium with sequence-based variations can be indirectly captured by all of these methods.
