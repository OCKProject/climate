  <p>Schematic exploring the relative abilities of two broad genomic approaches to predict evolutionary potential, given specific trait architectures, environmental circumstances and levels of prior genetic knowledge. The two broad approaches (screening genome-wide variation and screening variation at specific large-effect loci) should not be treated as mutually exclusive alternatives, as they can be complementary (e.g. screening genome-wide variation in conjunction with specific loci of interest). For the case of organisms where there is good genetic knowledge available, (A) shows the relative ability to predict evolutionary potential based on variation at trait-specific large-effect loci (red) versus genome-wide variation (blue), with increasing ability to predict the specific required adaptive response. (B) Takes the two extremes of (A) and considers relative ability to predict evolutionary potential for model organisms (blue shaded bar), commercially valuable species (orange shaded bar) and typical species of conservation concern (green shaded bar) under I) uncertain future change and/or multi-facetted adaptive pressures (left panel) and II) under certain future change and/or single selective pressures (right panel). The blue axes plots correspond to relative ability to predict evolutionary potential using variation at trait-specific large-effect loci and the red axes plots correspond to relative ability to predict evolutionary potential using genome-wide variation. Recommendations for when the two different approaches should be employed and examples of the types of conservation goals that could be addressed using the two different approaches are given.</p>
