 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EMERGING CONCEPTS FOR THE LANDSCAPE GENETICS OF INFECTIOUS AGENTS</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While we believe that there remains much unexplored utility in established landscape genetic methods for the study of pathogen dynamics as we have described above, we also note new frontiers with significant potential for expanding research in this area. We complete this review by discussing three particularly promising frontiers.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simultaneously integrating host, vector and landscape variables into studies of pathogen gene flow</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies relating pathogen genetic data directly to the landscape using resistance surfaces are challenged by the mediating influence of distinct host and vector traits, as well as relative differences in the contributions of multiple host and/or vector species to microparasite gene flow. This necessitates frameworks that more holistically incorporate multiple host and vector factors into studies of pathogen gene flow, which can expand the potential insights provided by landscape genetic studies of infectious agents (Figure 
   <a rid="eva12678-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12678-fig-0002">2</a>). Single or multiple host or vector species can be added as “landscape variables” (e.g., as resistance surfaces) in addition to physical landscape and environmental variables to test as factors shaping spatial pathogen genetic structure. Resistance surfaces for tests of microparasite gene flow can represent host/vector distributions or abundance, ideally inferred from empirically derived ecological niche or species distribution models. Optimally, host/vector movement would be represented (Dougherty et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0037">2018</a>), using outputs from agent‐based movement models informed by telemetry or mark‐recapture data, or host/vector landscape genetic data representing spatial patterns of gene flow. We note that the common issue in conventional landscape genetics of spatio‐temporal mismatches between landscape processes and genetic change (Anderson et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0004">2010</a>; Landguth et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0073">2010</a>) would apply even more strongly here. Researchers must simultaneously consider the potentially different spatial and temporal scales over which host and pathogen genetic changes (and potentially those of additional host/vector species) and landscape changes occur. Nonetheless, with careful study design, such an approach has significant potential to unify hosts/vectors and landscape variables under a single analytical framework for explaining and predicting pathogen transmission and spread. Importantly, it allows a flexible framework for both single and multihost/vector systems.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approaches integrating multiple host and vector datasets into landscape genetic studies of infectious agent gene flow have been proposed recently. Leo et al. (
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0082">2016</a>) developed a multitaxa integrated landscape genetic framework for diseases, which simultaneously quantifies the effects of both landscape variables and interspecific codispersal on pathogen gene flow in multi‐host‐vector systems. Few studies include both host and pathogen genetic data in landscape analyses. However, Fountain‐Jones, Craft et al. (
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0049">2017</a>) tested host relatedness, in addition to host demographic and landscape variables, and found this to be an important predictor of pathogen gene flow in a single‐host system of feline immunodeficiency virus in bobcats. A framework for combining multiple host and vector resistance surfaces was recently demonstrated for Chagas disease by Schwabl et al. (
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0114" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0114">2017</a>), involving subsequent validation using landscape genetic simulations. Although their approach does not explicitly include host and vector movement or gene flow, it advocates careful selection of landscape variables based on each host and vector species, informed by previous research. A recent study tested least‐cost path models of water bird movement estimated from ecological niche models, and road networks representing human movement, as potential predictors of avian influenza spread (Young et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0132">2017</a>). Other studies have investigated landscape genetic structure in multiple hosts of the same pathogens, identifying divergent dispersal patterns that could be integrated into studies of pathogen gene flow under such a framework (Rioux Paquette et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0111" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0111">2014</a>; Vander Wal et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0128" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0128">2013</a>). Approaches that consider whole ecological communities have recently been identified as necessary for advancing our understanding of pathogen dynamics (Fountain‐Jones, Pearse et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0051">2017</a>; Johnson, de Roode, &amp; Fenton, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0067">2015</a>). Studies integrating multiple host and vector species into landscape genetic models of spread of infectious agents represent an important step towards such a paradigm.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using molecular markers from infectious agents to detect cryptic landscape‐host processes</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rapid mutation of microparasites relative to their hosts has potential to provide greater power to detect subtle variation in host movement patterns in response to the landscape, as well as earlier detectability of changes in host movements (such as in response to a new barrier) that are yet to be reflected in host genetic structure (Landguth et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0073">2010</a>). In addition, movements of nonreproducing hosts are difficult to detect using host genetic markers, but instead might be inferred using markers from directly transmitted microorganisms. Such an approach has demonstrated the utility of a chronic, relatively apathogenic infection of felids (feline immunodeficiency virus) for identifying demographic structure of mountain lions and recent population history (Biek et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0012">2006</a>), and has identified movement of bobcats across a highway barrier that was not detectable using host markers (Lee et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0078">2012</a>). However, these approaches have not been broadly applied, particularly in the study of landscape effects.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The application of microparasite molecular markers to the study of host movements should be considered with some caveats in mind. As we have discussed previously, host movements and parasite transmission are not necessarily coupled (Mazé‐Guilmo et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0091">2016</a>), and assumptions about how closely parasite gene flow may reflect host movements must be made with care. Also, rapid mutation and rapid dissemination of new alleles (i.e., infectious agent transmission can generally occur much more quickly than host reproduction) largely limit the use of genetic data from the microparasite to the study of very recent or ongoing landscape changes, while older processes are better studied using host genetic data. However, choice of infectious agent based on its characteristics (e.g., mutation rate, prevalence in a population, mode of transmission) may be tailored to the type and age of the host process under study. We thus do not propose that microparasite genetic data alone should be used to study host movements in their entirety, but rather that it may have specific utility as a complementary approach to host markers for providing a more complete analysis of host movement. Such insights might include contacts between specific hosts, potentially including interspecific interactions. As new infectious agents are discovered and their relationships with host movements become better understood, microparasite molecular markers will have increasing utility in landscape genetic research of host populations.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of phylogenetics in understanding landscape influences on pathogen genetic variation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phylogenetic approaches can reconstruct very recent epidemic histories, providing insights into particular transmission events and pathways that may be contextualized temporally and spatially (Corman et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0026">2014</a>; Faria et al.,

   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0050">2017</a>; Fountain‐Jones, Pearse et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0051">2017</a>). The majority of such work has been conducted on RNA viruses owing to their small, rapidly mutating genomes, requiring relatively little sequencing effort to detect contemporary phylogenetic signals. Other pathogens that evolve more slowly, such as bacteria or fungal pathogens, require the sequencing of larger portions of their genomes to capture equivalent phylogenetic signals (Biek, Pybus, Lloyd‐Smith, &amp; Didelot, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0013">2015</a>). While this is becoming increasingly feasible (Kao, Haydon, Lycett, &amp; Murcia, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0069">2014</a>), more complex computational analysis is required to make meaningful conclusions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several approaches may be used for relating phylogenetic information with landscape variables. Neighbour joining trees can identify clusters for quantifying population‐level landscape genetic relationships (Joannon et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0066">2010</a>). The calculation of genetic distances based on maximum likelihood trees (Carrel, Emch, Tung, Jobe, &amp; Wan, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0022">2012</a>; Real et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0105">2005</a>; Young et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0132">2017</a>) results in distance matrices that can be correlated with landscape resistance matrices using conventional landscape genetic approaches. Relaxed random walk phylogeographic approaches (Lemey, Rambaut, Welch, &amp; Suchard, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0081">2010</a>) that can reconstruct pathogen dispersal have been linked to landscape predictors using a “phylogeographic GLM” method (Faria, Suchard, Rambaut, Streicker, &amp; Lemey, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0048">2013</a>; Jacquot, Nomikou, Palmarini, Mertens, &amp; Biek, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0063">2017</a>). The phylogeographic GLM approach has enabled a better understanding of how landscape and hosts can constrain pathogen spread. For example, using the phylogeographic GLM approach on viral genomic data, roads and rivers, coupled with dog distribution, were found to impact rabies spread in Tanzania (Brunker et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0019">2018</a>). However, this approach is limited to discrete sampling locations and is computationally intensive (Dellicour, Rose, &amp; Pybus, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0034">2016</a>). A recent framework by Dellicour et al. (
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0034">2016</a>) modifies the phylogeographic GLM approach to use resistance surfaces to efficiently quantify landscape resistance along transmission pathways inferred by continuous phylogeographic analyses. These landscape resistances are then correlated with temporal estimates of transmission along these routes to estimate how the landscape has shaped rates and directions of pathogen spread. Such approaches are yet to be broadly applied, but appear to be important developments that should see increasing application in the future.
