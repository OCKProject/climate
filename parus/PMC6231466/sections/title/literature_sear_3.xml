 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted a literature search in February 2018 using the ISI Web of Science database with the following terms:
  <div content-type="quotation" id="eva12678-blkfxd-0001" class="disp-quote">
   <p>
    <span class="italic">TS=((“landscape genetic*” OR “landscape genom*”) AND (disease* OR pathogen* OR parasit* OR virus* OR virol* OR epidem* OR infect* OR transmi*))</span>
   </p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The search returned 133 results. We read each article and retained the 51 empirical papers that used landscape genetic methods to address questions related to pathogens (see Supporting Information Appendix 
  <a rid="eva12678-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#eva12678-sup-0001">S1</a>). We excluded reviews (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 15), meeting abstracts (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1), purely methods‐based papers (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6) and articles that identified as or mentioned landscape genetics but did not sufficiently incorporate landscape factors or genetic data into the study (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 32), studies that referred to any of our pathogen‐related search terms without it being a primary motivation for the study (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 21), and studies that used words like “transmit” or “parasite” outside of the context of infectious agents (such as the transmission of behaviours) (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6). One paper was excluded due to a lack of access at our institutions. Studies that qualitatively discussed landscape with respect to genetic variation were kept, although one might argue that landscape genetics requires quantitative testing of landscape effects. We classified each paper according to the type of host system studied (plant, wild animal, domestic animal and human), the type of pathogen studied (bacterium, protozoan, virus, prion, fungus, macroparasite and transmissible cancer) and the source of genetic data (host, pathogen and vector), and we estimated the severity of disease that each studied pathogen causes in its sampled host or vector. We also categorized each article according to its general conceptual approach. Most examples described in this study were found in our literature search, while several other examples were cited by papers from our search and subsequently also discussed here.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following publication of the first study using landscape genetics to investigate disease in 2005, there was little further research in this area until 2009, which saw a rapid increase in the number of publications (Figure 
  <a rid="eva12678-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12678-fig-0001">1</a>a). This increase coincided with two prominent review articles (Archie et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0006">2009</a>; Biek &amp; Real, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0014">2010</a>) that were strong proponents of a landscape genetics approach to disease ecology and expressed optimism about its future use. The rate of publication has remained relatively steady (and arguably low) since then, with none of the subsequent 7 years recording more publications than in 2009, when six papers were published. However, 10 articles using landscape genetics to investigate disease were published in 2017, potentially indicating increasing interest in this area of research.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A majority of studies (27 of 51) used genetic data from the host for comparison with landscape features (Figure 
  <a rid="eva12678-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12678-fig-0001">1</a>b). This is likely because DNA is easier to obtain from larger, free‐living hosts than for pathogens, and methods for genotyping and characterizing host spatial genetic variation are more familiar to landscape geneticists, who predominantly study free‐living organisms (Storfer, Murphy, Spear, Holderegger, &amp; Waits, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0121" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0121">2010</a>). Among pathogens that are associated with a particular animal vector, the vector is often genotyped (9 of 14 studies of vector‐borne diseases), as vectors such as ticks or mosquitos are also easily sampled, and vector gene flow can be used as a proxy for pathogen spread. Vectors can be targeted for population control as a means of limiting pathogen spread, which makes their study of immediate relevance to wildlife and livestock managers (Townson et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0127" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0127">2005</a>). Pathogen genetic data are used in only 16 of 51 pathogen landscape genetic studies, which was somewhat surprising considering that the pathogen is the primary motivation behind many of the reviewed studies. One study included both host and pathogen genetic data (Talbot, Vonhof, Broders, Fenton, &amp; Keyghobadi, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0124" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0124">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Viruses were the most frequently studied type of infectious agent (14 of 51 studies; Figure 
  <a rid="eva12678-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12678-fig-0001">1</a>c). In general, viruses evolve more rapidly than other microparasites, which makes them well‐suited to study of genetic variation for inference of transmission history (Archie et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0006">2009</a>; Grenfell et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0059">2004</a>). However, a majority of landscape genetic studies involving viruses used host genetic data, potentially reflecting the relative difficulty of obtaining viral data, which we discuss later in this section. Instead, the high representation of viruses is largely due to the considerable effort devoted to studying rabies, which comprised half of all landscape genetic studies on viral systems. Rabies is one of the most well‐known wildlife pathogens globally, due to its negative impacts on wildlife, domestic animal and human health (Gordon et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0058">2004</a>). Large outbreaks have occurred in North American and European wildlife in recent years, where considerable resources have been devoted to its management (Holmala &amp; Kauhala, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0062">2006</a>; Slate et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0117" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0117">2009</a>). Animals infected with rabies also often exhibit behavioural changes that may make them easier to identify (Lefèvre et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0079">2009</a>), potentially aiding sampling of infected individuals.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We broadly define three distinct conceptual approaches by which landscape genetics has been used to study infectious agents (Figure 
  <a rid="eva12678-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12678-fig-0001">1</a>d). These are the prediction of agent spread using genetic information from the host or vector; the use of host or vector genetic information to explain existing spatial variation in infection risk or prevalence; and the use of genetic information from the infectious agent to directly study transmission and spread. The remainder of this section will address each of these approaches in turn.
