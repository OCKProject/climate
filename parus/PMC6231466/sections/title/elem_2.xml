  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Literature search</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted a literature search in February 2018 using the ISI Web of Science database with the following terms:
   <div content-type="quotation" id="eva12678-blkfxd-0001" class="disp-quote">
    <p>
     <span class="italic">TS=((“landscape genetic*” OR “landscape genom*”) AND (disease* OR pathogen* OR parasit* OR virus* OR virol* OR epidem* OR infect* OR transmi*))</span>
    </p>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The search returned 133 results. We read each article and retained the 51 empirical papers that used landscape genetic methods to address questions related to pathogens (see Supporting Information Appendix 
   <a rid="eva12678-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#eva12678-sup-0001">S1</a>). We excluded reviews (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 15), meeting abstracts (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 1), purely methods‐based papers (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 6) and articles that identified as or mentioned landscape genetics but did not sufficiently incorporate landscape factors or genetic data into the study (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 32), studies that referred to any of our pathogen‐related search terms without it being a primary motivation for the study (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 21), and studies that used words like “transmit” or “parasite” outside of the context of infectious agents (such as the transmission of behaviours) (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 6). One paper was excluded due to a lack of access at our institutions. Studies that qualitatively discussed landscape with respect to genetic variation were kept, although one might argue that landscape genetics requires quantitative testing of landscape effects. We classified each paper according to the type of host system studied (plant, wild animal, domestic animal and human), the type of pathogen studied (bacterium, protozoan, virus, prion, fungus, macroparasite and transmissible cancer) and the source of genetic data (host, pathogen and vector), and we estimated the severity of disease that each studied pathogen causes in its sampled host or vector. We also categorized each article according to its general conceptual approach. Most examples described in this study were found in our literature search, while several other examples were cited by papers from our search and subsequently also discussed here.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following publication of the first study using landscape genetics to investigate disease in 2005, there was little further research in this area until 2009, which saw a rapid increase in the number of publications (Figure 
   <a rid="eva12678-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12678-fig-0001">1</a>a). This increase coincided with two prominent review articles (Archie et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0006">2009</a>; Biek &amp; Real, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0014">2010</a>) that were strong proponents of a landscape genetics approach to disease ecology and expressed optimism about its future use. The rate of publication has remained relatively steady (and arguably low) since then, with none of the subsequent 7 years recording more publications than in 2009, when six papers were published. However, 10 articles using landscape genetics to investigate disease were published in 2017, potentially indicating increasing interest in this area of research.

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A majority of studies (27 of 51) used genetic data from the host for comparison with landscape features (Figure 
   <a rid="eva12678-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12678-fig-0001">1</a>b). This is likely because DNA is easier to obtain from larger, free‐living hosts than for pathogens, and methods for genotyping and characterizing host spatial genetic variation are more familiar to landscape geneticists, who predominantly study free‐living organisms (Storfer, Murphy, Spear, Holderegger, &amp; Waits, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0121" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0121">2010</a>). Among pathogens that are associated with a particular animal vector, the vector is often genotyped (9 of 14 studies of vector‐borne diseases), as vectors such as ticks or mosquitos are also easily sampled, and vector gene flow can be used as a proxy for pathogen spread. Vectors can be targeted for population control as a means of limiting pathogen spread, which makes their study of immediate relevance to wildlife and livestock managers (Townson et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0127" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0127">2005</a>). Pathogen genetic data are used in only 16 of 51 pathogen landscape genetic studies, which was somewhat surprising considering that the pathogen is the primary motivation behind many of the reviewed studies. One study included both host and pathogen genetic data (Talbot, Vonhof, Broders, Fenton, &amp; Keyghobadi, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0124" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0124">2017</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Viruses were the most frequently studied type of infectious agent (14 of 51 studies; Figure 
   <a rid="eva12678-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12678-fig-0001">1</a>c). In general, viruses evolve more rapidly than other microparasites, which makes them well‐suited to study of genetic variation for inference of transmission history (Archie et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0006">2009</a>; Grenfell et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0059">2004</a>). However, a majority of landscape genetic studies involving viruses used host genetic data, potentially reflecting the relative difficulty of obtaining viral data, which we discuss later in this section. Instead, the high representation of viruses is largely due to the considerable effort devoted to studying rabies, which comprised half of all landscape genetic studies on viral systems. Rabies is one of the most well‐known wildlife pathogens globally, due to its negative impacts on wildlife, domestic animal and human health (Gordon et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0058">2004</a>). Large outbreaks have occurred in North American and European wildlife in recent years, where considerable resources have been devoted to its management (Holmala &amp; Kauhala, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0062">2006</a>; Slate et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0117" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0117">2009</a>). Animals infected with rabies also often exhibit behavioural changes that may make them easier to identify (Lefèvre et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0079">2009</a>), potentially aiding sampling of infected individuals.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We broadly define three distinct conceptual approaches by which landscape genetics has been used to study infectious agents (Figure 
   <a rid="eva12678-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12678-fig-0001">1</a>d). These are the prediction of agent spread using genetic information from the host or vector; the use of host or vector genetic information to explain existing spatial variation in infection risk or prevalence; and the use of genetic information from the infectious agent to directly study transmission and spread. The remainder of this section will address each of these approaches in turn.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Host or vector genetic variation as a predictor of agent spread with respect to landscape</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the spread of many microparasites (particularly directly transmitted forms) is facilitated by movement of free‐living hosts or vectors, the risk of spread of the agent with respect to heterogeneous landscape features can be estimated by relating those features to host/vector gene flow. This approach represents a direct application of the conventional landscape genetic paradigm to the study of disease transmission, where a typical animal landscape genetic study is interpreted in the context of the pathogenic organism. This can provide useful indications of the potential for individuals carrying pathogens to disperse across particular landscape features, which can be used to inform management efforts. For example, DeYoung et al. (
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0036">2009</a>) identified long‐distance gene flow among grey fox populations in Texas that was unrelated to landscape features tested, determining that current rabies oral vaccination plans should be expanded given the high potential for long‐distance host movement. In another rabies study, landscape genetics was used to characterize striped skunk dispersal across riverine and highway barriers to assess their utility as barriers to pathogen spread (Talbot, Garant, Paquette, Mainguy, &amp; Pelletier, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0123" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0123">2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using host or vector genetic data to predict pathogen spread is attractive as it avoids sampling of the agent itself, which may be substantially more difficult, especially in wildlife populations. Identification of infected hosts often requires laboratory testing and may require specific, potentially invasive sampling approaches (e.g., necropsy) for accurate diagnosis. In addition, extensive sampling may be required to obtain adequate sample sizes when prevalence is low and must be conducted strategically to capture spatial heterogeneity. Direct study of pathogens may not be possible when predicting the risk of spread in as‐yet uninfected populations, or where identification of infected individuals is unreliable. However, a direct association of host or vector gene flow with spread of the microparasite should not be assumed given the potential influence of other factors such as other host and/or vector species, environmental persistence, pathogen reproductive mode or simply transmission via movement of nonreproducing hosts (Mazé‐Guilmo, Blanchet, Mccoy, &amp; Loot, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0091">2016</a>; Tesson et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0125" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0125">2016</a>). For example, Lee et al. (
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0078">2012</a>) showed disassociation between host and virus genetic structure owing to host movement events that did not result in host gene flow (reproduction), but did result in transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus in bobcats. Indeed, correlation between host dispersal and parasite genetic structure is often weak (Mazé‐Guilmo et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0091">2016</a>). Therefore, studies using host or vector data alone have limitations for inferring or predicting pathogen spread, or lack thereof, directly. However, host landscape genetic studies can provide indications of the potential risk of spread of infectious agents, and the understanding gained about host movements can inform subsequent studies of pathogen dynamics.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relating spatial heterogeneity in infection risk with host spatial genetic variation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial variation in pathogen prevalence or infection risk can be represented in much the same way as any landscape variable (Escobar et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0045">2017</a>), making spatial data relating to presence of an infectious agent well‐suited for incorporation into host landscape genetic models. While spatial heterogeneity in pathogen prevalence could also be considered a component of the landscape that may influence spatial genetic variation in the host, typically only adaptive loci are investigated in this context. More commonly, host neutral genetic variation is used to explain spatial patterns of infection risk or prevalence. A prominent example is a study of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white‐tailed deer. Blanchong et al. (
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0015">2008</a>) found that populations with lower CWD prevalence showed higher genetic differentiation from those that had high CWD prevalence. This genetic differentiation was found to be associated with roads and rivers, which were likely barriers to both host gene flow and CWD spread. These inferences have subsequently informed and been verified by additional landscape epidemiological research (Robinson, Samuel, Rolley, &amp; Shelton, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0112" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0112">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial heterogeneity in pathogen infection risk can also drive microevolutionary responses in the host (Epstein et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0044">2016</a>; Monello et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0094">2017</a>). Host species are constantly being challenged by parasitic organisms, which, if not overcome, cause disease and can have fitness consequences. This can create strong selection that acts on various genes, and geographic variation in selection at loci that are known to be associated with adaptive immune genes may reflect variation in pathogen pressure, and individual infection or disease risk (Fumagalli et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0054">2011</a>). This variation may be tested for association with environmental features such as temperature, humidity or urbanization (Tonteri, Vasemägi, Lumme, &amp; Primmer, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0126" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0126">2010</a>), enabling insights into how future changes in climate or land use might influence overall pathogen prevalence.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pathogen genetic variation to quantify pathogen transmission and spread</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the sampled disease agent as the source of genetic data is the most direct way to infer pathogen spread across landscapes, but can be challenging to accomplish. Genetic material may be absent from, or uninformative in some infectious agents, such as prions or clonally transmissible cancers, necessitating genetic analysis of the host (Kelly et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0070">2014</a>; Storfer et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0119" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0119">2017</a>). In addition to the aforementioned difficulties with pathogen diagnosis, pathogen nucleic acid can be difficult to isolate from samples taken from the host or vector and would ideally be present in the blood, saliva or other easily collected sample. Samples may also require enrichment to obtain sufficient quantities of genetic material for analysis, which can be difficult to accomplish for many pathogens, particularly viruses. However, genetic information from viruses may be particularly useful for molecular epidemiologic analyses due to their rapid mutation rate that can closely infer transmission history (Archie et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0006">2009</a>; Brunker, Hampson, Horton, &amp; Biek, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0018">2012</a>). Further, viruses are prominent emerging pathogens and have relatively small genomes, aiding whole genome‐analysis. Landscape effects on viral transmission are typically studied using phylogenetic approaches (Fountain‐Jones, Craft et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0049">2017</a>; Joannon, Lavigne, Lecoq, &amp; Desbiez,

   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0132">2017</a>). To date, pathogens with larger and more slowly mutating genomes, such as protozoans (Carrel et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0023">2015</a>; Lo et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0085">2017</a>) and fungi (Brar et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0017">2015</a>; Rieux, De Bellaire, Zapater, Ravigne, &amp; Carlier, 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0109">2013</a>), have been studied using population genetics‐based methods with highly variable microsatellite and SNP loci. New methods based on next‐generation sequencing technologies such as targeted enrichment techniques (Lee et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0077">2017</a>) are helping to address challenges with sequencing viruses and other pathogens, facilitating greater use of pathogen genetic data in future landscape genetic studies.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pathogenicity of an infectious agent and the length of its period of infection are other factors that may determine its utility for landscape genetic study. Highly pathogenic agents (i.e., those that cause a greater severity of disease) are typically of utmost interest due to their potential implications for wildlife conservation, agricultural production and human health. Among the studies identified in our literature search, agents that form chronic infections and have moderate or high pathogenic effects on their sampled host/vector organisms were more frequently investigated (see Supporting Information Appendix 
   <a rid="eva12678-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#eva12678-sup-0001">S1</a>). However, genetically inferring transmission histories of pathogens in host populations experiencing high rates of mortality may be problematic because hosts through which the pathogen has spread may no longer be present in the population and are unable to be sampled. Similarly, acutely infectious agents from which the host recovers after a short period of time may also evade sampling. These characteristics may be less problematic for agricultural populations where morbidity or mortality can be identified and samples collected immediately, but inevitably leave “breaks” in the inferred chain of transmission among wild populations. While complete sampling of wild populations is rarely possible in any case, obtaining adequate sample sizes is easier for apathogenic or low‐pathogenicity agents that form chronic infections and may be sampled at any time postinfection (e.g., feline immunodeficiency virus; Biek et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0012">2006</a>; Lee et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0078">2012</a>; Fountain‐Jones, Craft et al., 
   <a rid="eva12678-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0049">2017</a>). Landscape genetic study of such “model” infectious agents may be used to target specific ecological questions and provide insights into how similarly transmitted agents with higher pathogenicity might spread in the event of an outbreak.
