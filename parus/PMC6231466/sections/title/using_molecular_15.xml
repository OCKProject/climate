 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using molecular markers from infectious agents to detect cryptic landscape‐host processes</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rapid mutation of microparasites relative to their hosts has potential to provide greater power to detect subtle variation in host movement patterns in response to the landscape, as well as earlier detectability of changes in host movements (such as in response to a new barrier) that are yet to be reflected in host genetic structure (Landguth et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0073">2010</a>). In addition, movements of nonreproducing hosts are difficult to detect using host genetic markers, but instead might be inferred using markers from directly transmitted microorganisms. Such an approach has demonstrated the utility of a chronic, relatively apathogenic infection of felids (feline immunodeficiency virus) for identifying demographic structure of mountain lions and recent population history (Biek et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0012">2006</a>), and has identified movement of bobcats across a highway barrier that was not detectable using host markers (Lee et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0078">2012</a>). However, these approaches have not been broadly applied, particularly in the study of landscape effects.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The application of microparasite molecular markers to the study of host movements should be considered with some caveats in mind. As we have discussed previously, host movements and parasite transmission are not necessarily coupled (Mazé‐Guilmo et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0091">2016</a>), and assumptions about how closely parasite gene flow may reflect host movements must be made with care. Also, rapid mutation and rapid dissemination of new alleles (i.e., infectious agent transmission can generally occur much more quickly than host reproduction) largely limit the use of genetic data from the microparasite to the study of very recent or ongoing landscape changes, while older processes are better studied using host genetic data. However, choice of infectious agent based on its characteristics (e.g., mutation rate, prevalence in a population, mode of transmission) may be tailored to the type and age of the host process under study. We thus do not propose that microparasite genetic data alone should be used to study host movements in their entirety, but rather that it may have specific utility as a complementary approach to host markers for providing a more complete analysis of host movement. Such insights might include contacts between specific hosts, potentially including interspecific interactions. As new infectious agents are discovered and their relationships with host movements become better understood, microparasite molecular markers will have increasing utility in landscape genetic research of host populations.
