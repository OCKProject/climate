 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Host or vector genetic variation as a predictor of agent spread with respect to landscape</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the spread of many microparasites (particularly directly transmitted forms) is facilitated by movement of free‐living hosts or vectors, the risk of spread of the agent with respect to heterogeneous landscape features can be estimated by relating those features to host/vector gene flow. This approach represents a direct application of the conventional landscape genetic paradigm to the study of disease transmission, where a typical animal landscape genetic study is interpreted in the context of the pathogenic organism. This can provide useful indications of the potential for individuals carrying pathogens to disperse across particular landscape features, which can be used to inform management efforts. For example, DeYoung et al. (
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0036">2009</a>) identified long‐distance gene flow among grey fox populations in Texas that was unrelated to landscape features tested, determining that current rabies oral vaccination plans should be expanded given the high potential for long‐distance host movement. In another rabies study, landscape genetics was used to characterize striped skunk dispersal across riverine and highway barriers to assess their utility as barriers to pathogen spread (Talbot, Garant, Paquette, Mainguy, &amp; Pelletier, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0123" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0123">2012</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using host or vector genetic data to predict pathogen spread is attractive as it avoids sampling of the agent itself, which may be substantially more difficult, especially in wildlife populations. Identification of infected hosts often requires laboratory testing and may require specific, potentially invasive sampling approaches (e.g., necropsy) for accurate diagnosis. In addition, extensive sampling may be required to obtain adequate sample sizes when prevalence is low and must be conducted strategically to capture spatial heterogeneity. Direct study of pathogens may not be possible when predicting the risk of spread in as‐yet uninfected populations, or where identification of infected individuals is unreliable. However, a direct association of host or vector gene flow with spread of the microparasite should not be assumed given the potential influence of other factors such as other host and/or vector species, environmental persistence, pathogen reproductive mode or simply transmission via movement of nonreproducing hosts (Mazé‐Guilmo, Blanchet, Mccoy, &amp; Loot, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0091">2016</a>; Tesson et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0125" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0125">2016</a>). For example, Lee et al. (
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0078">2012</a>) showed disassociation between host and virus genetic structure owing to host movement events that did not result in host gene flow (reproduction), but did result in transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus in bobcats. Indeed, correlation between host dispersal and parasite genetic structure is often weak (Mazé‐Guilmo et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0091">2016</a>). Therefore, studies using host or vector data alone have limitations for inferring or predicting pathogen spread, or lack thereof, directly. However, host landscape genetic studies can provide indications of the potential risk of spread of infectious agents, and the understanding gained about host movements can inform subsequent studies of pathogen dynamics.
