 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Landscape genetic clustering and assignment methods have largely built upon classical methods from population genetics (e.g., principal components analysis, STRUCTURE, Pritchard, Stephens, &amp; Donnelly, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0103">2000</a>) by incorporating spatial information (e.g., GENELAND, Guillot, Mortier, &amp; Estoup, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0061">2005</a>; sPCA, Jombart, Devillard, Dufour, &amp; Pontier, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0068">2008</a>) and environmental heterogeneity (e.g., constrained ordination, Anderson &amp; Willis, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0005">2003</a>; POPS, Jay, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0064">2011</a>) into estimates of population structure and providing quantitative estimates of ancestry for each individual (François &amp; Waits, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0052">2016</a>). Clustering methods have been relatively popular in studying pathogens and implemented for the inference of landscape barriers affecting both host (Addis, Lowe, Hossack, &amp; Allendorf, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0001">2015</a>; Cote, Garant, Robert, Mainguy, &amp; Pelletier, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0027">2012</a>; Cullingham, Kyle, Pond, Rees, &amp; White, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0030">2009</a>; Frantz, Cellina, Krier, Schley, &amp; Burke, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0053">2009</a>) and microparasite (Brar et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0017">2015</a>; Rieux et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0110">2011</a>) spatial genetic variation. Edge detection methods, such as Monmonier's maximum difference algorithm, (Monmonier, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0095">1973</a>) have also been used to detect landscape barriers to transmission in pathogen studies (Carrel et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0023">2015</a>; Joannon et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0066">2010</a>). Ancestry estimates from model‐based clustering algorithms can assign individuals to their populations of origin, enabling inference of landscape barrier permeability through the identification of migrants and thus estimation of the risk of pathogen spread across the barrier.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the studies implementing clustering and assignment methods did not use approaches that incorporate environmental data. Instead, spatially or nonspatially explicit methods were typically used to identify genetic discontinuities and relationships with landscape barriers were inferred ad hoc, or analyses proceeded to entirely different methods that explicitly include environmental data. Associations between genetic discontinuities and landscape barriers should be considered with care due to the potential effect of intrinsic isolation mechanisms on genetic structure. For instance, studies on apple scab identified two distantly related lineages that are reproductively isolated through host specificity, but which have formed a narrow secondary contact zone in orchards where multiple host species are cultivated (Lemaire et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0080">2016</a>; Leroy, Lemaire, Dunemann, &amp; Le Cam, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0083">2013</a>). Secondary contact zones occurring at equivalent spatial scales to that of landscape heterogeneity may result in genetic discontinuities resembling a barrier effect and thus be misattributed as such.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other applications of clustering methods that explicitly integrate landscape variables, such as detecting environmental niche variation (Pease et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0099">2009</a>) and ancestry–environment relationships (Jay et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0065">2012</a>), remain relatively unexplored among studies of pathogen dynamics. These applications could translate in infectious organisms to the identification of distinct ecotypes or identify landscape features that coincide with infection foci or sources of pathogen spread. However, it must be noted that many of the genetic clustering and assignment methods presented here rely on classical population genetics models that generally do not apply to microorganisms. Therefore, the use of such methods in the study of pathogens is often limited to the inference of pathogen movement using host gene flow, with the exception of some fungal pathogens (Brar et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0017">2015</a>; Rieux et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0110">2011</a>). Some recent methods for identifying spatial population structure are free of classical population genetic assumptions, such as LOCALDIFF (Duforet‐Frebourg &amp; Blum, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0038">2014</a>), EEMS (Petkova, Novembre, &amp; Stephens, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0100" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0100">2016</a>) and MAPI (Piry et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0101">2016</a>), and can be applied to pathogens directly without these potential constraints.
