 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resistance surfaces are commonly used in landscape genetics for modelling hypotheses concerning the influence of landscape features (from GIS landscape variables) on functional connectivity using techniques such as least‐cost paths (Adriaensen et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0002">2003</a>) or circuit theory (McRae, Dickson, Keitt, &amp; Shah, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0092">2008</a>). These techniques produce measures of landscape or “effective” distance among populations or individuals for each hypothesis, which can be tested against observed genetic variation. The primary applications of resistance surface modelling in landscape genetics have been the identification of dispersal corridors and predicting the impacts of landscape and environmental change, such as habitat fragmentation or climate change, on connectivity. Similar to that, landscape genetic resistance surfaces can identify transmission corridors or future patterns of spread (e.g., Streicker et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0122">2016</a>), and such tools have been identified previously as having great utility for pathogen landscape genetic studies (Biek &amp; Real, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0014">2010</a>). However, resistance surface modelling remains infrequently applied among pathogen studies. Careful consideration is required for identifying the most relevant landscape variables to be tested and correctly parameterizing (assigning costs to) the resistance surface(s) so that these variables are represented in a biologically meaningful way. Developing landscape resistance hypotheses for transmitted agents may be more difficult as their interactions with the landscape are often indirect, mediated by the ecology of hosts and vectors. Pathogen ecological niche models offer an empirical approach for constructing resistance surfaces based on ecological factors influencing pathogen prevalence (Escobar et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0045">2017</a>; Fountain‐Jones, Pearse et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0051">2017</a>), but these also may not adequately represent host/vector movements.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our literature search returned only one study that explicitly modelled landscape resistance based on pathogen‐specific biology, testing elevation (as a proxy for temperature) as a predictor of 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spread, in addition to resistance surfaces that modelled human movements and mosquito vector ecology (Lo et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0085">2017</a>). However, several other studies applied resistance surfaces to hosts and vectors. Young et al. (
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0132">2017</a>) tested resistance surfaces based on waterbird niche models against genetic data from avian influenza. Two further examples of resistance surface modelling used host genetic data: Liang, Liu, Liao, and Gong (
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0084">2014</a>) studied landscape resistance of the snail 
  <span class="italic">Oncomelania hupensis</span> to infer transmission of its parasite 
  <span class="italic">Schistosoma japonicum</span>; while Rioux Paquette, Talbot, Garant, Mainguy, and Pelletier (
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0111" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0111">2014</a>) identified likely dispersal corridors for two rabies hosts. Further, Streicker et al. (
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0122">2016</a>) used resistance surfaces to construct least‐cost pathways predicting future spread of vampire bat rabies, and Barton, Gregory, Davis, Hanlon, and Wisely (
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0011">2010</a>) tested landscape resistance to rabies gene flow among striped skunks using landscape variables believed important for host dispersal, as well as landscape variables found to be relevant to other rabies hosts. Resistance surface modelling has thus demonstrated utility in identifying landscape drivers of functional connectivity that can shape pathogen spread and should see increasing use as frameworks for the integration of host, vector and pathogen data continue to develop.
