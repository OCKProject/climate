 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, landscape genetics has been relatively underutilized in disease ecology research. We believe this is partly due to a lack of cross‐disciplinary awareness between the two fields, but also a lack of a clear landscape genetic framework specifically designed for tackling pathogen systems, which are often complex and do not facilitate easy translation of existing landscape genetic tools. However, we note there has been a recent effort to develop new frameworks for such research, expanding the utility of the landscape genetic toolset. These tools will increase our capacity to study complex multihost and host‐vector systems, improving the integration of multiple genetic datasets and accounting for interspecific interactions. Improved understanding of host–parasite associations will facilitate the use of microparasite genetic markers to provide insights into host processes that may be difficult to detect using conventional host landscape genetics. Identification of idealized systems that are designed to target specific ecological questions will also facilitate progress in this field. Recent methods that enable the incorporation of quantitative landscape data into spatio‐temporal phylogenetic reconstructions of recent transmission events, coupled with advances in high‐throughput sequencing, hold great promise for studying how the landscape shapes transmission processes. We believe that these recent developments represent a renewed interest in advancing landscape genetic research in pathogen systems, which we expect will translate to continued growth of research in this area.</p>
