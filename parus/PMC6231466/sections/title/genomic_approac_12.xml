 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While landscape genetics initially was used to investigate spatial genetic patterns using relatively few neutral markers, the more modern advent of landscape genomics allows the study of variation across the entire genome and effectively expands the scope of landscape genetics to include the study of functional, adaptive genetic variation. Next‐generation sequencing (NGS) techniques such as restriction‐site‐associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) require minimal prior knowledge of the genome under study and can genotype thousands of SNPs randomly distributed across the genome. Some of these SNPs will by chance be located within or near (and thus linked to) genes or regulatory regions that are under selection. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) can make use of this information to identify loci linked to phenotypic variation such as disease susceptibility. Genotyping of candidate loci identified using quantitative trait locus mapping and GWAS can be expanded across a large number of individuals using methods such as targeted sequence capture (Grover, Salmon, &amp; Wendel, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0060">2012</a>), and these data can be tested in a landscape genomic framework for associations with environmental variables.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Loci exhibiting a signature of selection can be identified using outlier tests (Excoffier, Hofer, &amp; Foll, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0046">2009</a>; Luu, Bazin, &amp; Blum, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0087">2017</a>), which search for loci with allelic frequencies that are outliers relative to the majority. Such loci are considered potentially under selection and may then be tested 
  <span class="italic">a posteriori</span> for correlations with environmental variables. Newer methods have focused on explicitly incorporating environmental variables into landscape genomic analyses, known as genetic–environment association (GEA) tests (Lotterhos &amp; Whitlock, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0086">2015</a>; Rellstab, Gugerli, Eckert, Hancock, &amp; Holderegger, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0107" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0107">2015</a>). GEA analyses test for correlations between environmental variables and individual genotypes, which eliminates problems due to underlying population structure that must be controlled when using outlier tests. NGS approaches also generate thousands of neutral loci, which provide greater power to detect fine‐scale neutral genetic structure than conventional studies based on relatively few loci (Allendorf, Hohenlohe, &amp; Luikart, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0003">2010</a>). However, for studies with a particular focus on functional genetic variation, NGS approaches can also be adapted specifically for this purpose through targeted sequencing of the exome (Roffler et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0113" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0113">2016</a>) or transcriptome (de Wit &amp; Palumbi, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0035">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While genomic technologies are becoming the norm in microbial research, approaches incorporating landscape (i.e., landscape genomics) have yet to see widespread usage. Current examples focus on established candidate loci from the host known to be relevant to immune function from prior research, such as in commercially important salmon (Larson, Seeb, Dann, Schindler, &amp; Seeb, 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0075">2014</a>; Tonteri et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0126" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0126">2010</a>). Wenzel, Douglas, James, Redpath, and Piertney (
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0130" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0130">2016</a>) used SNPs previously identified to be associated with nematode burden in red grouse (
  <span class="italic">Lagopus lagopus scotica</span>) using GWAS, as well as 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>st</sub> outlier loci, to investigate parasite‐driven genetic structure across a landscape. Garroway et al. (
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0056">2013</a>) used SNPs identified from transcriptome sequencing of great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) to conduct a GEA with respect to avian malaria infection risk and contrasted this with neutral gene flow. Another targeted approach employed exon capture to genotype SNPs that were then subjected to outlier and environmental association tests to investigate variation in pathogen exposure with respect to environment (Roffler et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0113" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0113">2016</a>). The spread of functional alleles has also been incorporated into landscape genetic simulations (Landguth et al., 
  <a rid="eva12678-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12678-bib-0074">2017</a>), enhancing predictions of future pathogen spread and its effects on host populations. This small body of research is promising for expansion of landscape genomic studies designed to couple pathogen‐related functional genetic variation with landscape variables.
