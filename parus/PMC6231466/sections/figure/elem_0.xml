  <p>Papers using landscape genetic approaches for the study of infectious agents. (a) Number of publications per year that met our search criteria. (b) Number of publications using genetic data from each of the host, agent or vector species. (c) Number of publications studying pathogens by type, with genetic data source indicated for each type (“unspecified” typically involves studies of a hypothetical agent or estimates of overall pathogen exposure, such as inferred by immune‐linked loci). (d) Number of publications adopting each of our broadly identified conceptual approaches for applying landscape genetics to the study of pathogens/infectious agents—using host/vector genetics to predict agent spread, using host/vector genetics to explain agent spread/distribution and using pathogen genetics to directly study agent spread</p>
