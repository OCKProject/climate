 <div class="title">Species correlation coefficients for temperature-mass relationships with lifestage sensitivity analysis.</div>
 <p>Results for all species' temperature-mass relationships with additional filtering of specimens based on lifestage. The final dataset (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2A</a>) contained a column with lifestage information for each individual, if it had been recorded. To remove all individuals explicitly identified as non-adults, we filtered that dataset to include only those individuals which had their lifestage recorded as adult, or if no lifestage information was provided. These include (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) spatial collection locations of all individual specimens and linear regression for temperature-mass relationships for three example species, 
  <span class="italic">Martes pennanti</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Tamias quadrivittatus</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Synaptomys cooperi</span>, (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) stacked histograms of all species' correlation coefficients (r) showing statistical significance of relationships and relationships by taxonomic class, and (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) variation in all species' correlation coefficients across number of individuals, collection year temperature range, mass range, mean mass, and absolute mean latitude.
