 <div class="title">Variability of species correlation coefficients across several variables.</div>
 <p>Variation in all species' correlation coefficients (r) across the following variables for each species: (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) number of individuals, (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) difference between hottest and coldest collection year temperatures, (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) mass range, (
  <span class="bold">D</span>) mean mass, and (
  <span class="bold">E</span>) absolute mean latitude. Horizontal lines are correlation coefficients of zero. The x-axes of some plots (
  <span class="bold">A, C, D</span>) are on a log scale to better show spread of values.
