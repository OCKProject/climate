 <div class="title">Species correlation coefficients for temperature-mass relationships with outlier sensitivity analysis.</div>
 <p>Results for all species' temperature-mass relationships with outliers removed. Outliers were considered any individual mass value that was more than three standard deviations away from the fitted relationship value. These include (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) spatial collection locations for all individual specimens and linear regression for temperature-mass relationships for three example species, 
  <span class="italic">Martes pennanti</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Tamias quadrivittatus</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Synaptomys cooperi</span>, (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) stacked histograms of all species' correlation coefficients (r) showing statistical significance of relationships and relationships by taxonomic class, and (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) variation in all species' correlation coefficients across number of individuals, collection year temperature range, mass range, mean mass, and absolute mean latitude.
