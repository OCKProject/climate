 <div class="title">Species correlation coefficients for temperature-mass relationships with species thresholds decreased.</div>
 <p>Results for all species’ temperature-mass relationships for species with at least 15 individuals, range in collection years of at least 10, and range in latitudinal degrees of at least 2.5 (n = 1,455). These include (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) spatial collection locations for all individual specimens and linear regression for temperature-mass relationships for three example species, 
  <span class="italic">Martes pennant</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Tamias quadrivittatus</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Synaptomys cooperi</span>, (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) stacked histograms of all species’ correlation coefficients (r) showing statistical significance of relationships and relationships by taxonomic class, and (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) variation in all species’ correlation coefficients across number of individuals, collection year temperature range, mass range, mean mass, and absolute mean latitude.
