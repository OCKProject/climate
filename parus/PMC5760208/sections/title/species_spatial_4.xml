 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) Spatial collection locations of all individual specimens. All species shown with black points except three species, whose relationships between mean annual temperature and mass are shown at bottom (
  <span class="bold">B–D</span>), are marked with colored points. These species were chosen to represent the range of variability in relationship strength and direction exhibited by the 952 species from the study: 
  <span class="italic">Martes pennanti</span> had a negative relationship with temperature explaining a substantial amount of variation in mass (B; blue points); 
  <span class="italic">Tamias quadrivittatus</span> had no directional relationship between temperature and mass with temperature having little explanatory power (C; yellow points); 
  <span class="italic">Synaptomys cooperi</span> had a strong positive temperature-mass relationship with a correlation coefficient (r) in the 99
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile of all species' values (D; red points). Intraspecific temperature-mass relationships are shown with black circles for all individuals and ordinary least squares regression trends as blue lines. Linear regression correlation coefficients and p-values in upper left hand corner of figure for each species. For remaining species relationships, see
