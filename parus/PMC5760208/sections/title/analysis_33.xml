 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We fit the intraspecific relationship between mean annual temperature and mass for each species with ordinary least squares linear regression (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1B,C,D</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1" href="#fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</a>–
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12" href="#fig1s12">12</a>) using the statsmodels.formula.api module in Python (
  <a rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib85">Seabold and Perktold, 2010</a>). The strength of each species’ relationship was characterized by the correlation coefficient, its significance at alpha of 0.05, and the associated z score. When assessing statistical significance with large numbers of correlations it is important to consider the expected distribution of these correlations under the null model that no correlation exists for any species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We addressed this issue by using false discovery rate control (
  <a rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib5">Benajmini and Hochberg, 1995</a>) implemented with the stats package in R (
  <a rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib77">R Core Team, 2016</a>). This method determines the expected distribution of values for p (or Z) in the case where no relationship exists for individual correlation and adjusts observed values to control for excessive false positives. Specifically, it maintains the Type I error rate (proportion of false positives) across all tests at the chosen value of alpha and therefore gives an accurate estimate of the number of significant relationships (
  <a rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib5">Benajmini and Hochberg, 1995</a>). This allows us to estimate the number of species with true positive and negative correlations (i.e., those that have values that exceed those expected from the null distribution). We then compared the number of species with positive and negative correlation coefficients, and the proportion of those with statistically significant adjusted p-values.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated various potential correlates of the strength of Bergmann's rule. Because it has been argued that Bergmann's rule is exhibited more strongly by some groups than others (
  <a rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib59">McNab, 1971</a>), we examined correlation coefficient distributions within each class and order. Additionally, distributions for migrant and nonmigrant bird species were compared due to conflicting evidence about the impact of migration on temperature-mass relationships (
  <a rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib3">Ashton, 2002</a>). As a temporal lag in size response to temperature is likely due to individuals of a species responding to temperatures prior to their collection year (e.g., 
  <a rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib89">Stacey and Fellowes, 2002</a>), we assessed species' temperature-mass relationships using temperatures from 1 to 110 years prior to collection year. We also examined the relationship between species' correlation coefficients and five variables to understand potential statistical and biological influences on the results. We did so with the number of individuals, temperature range, and mass range to determine if the relationship was stronger when more data points or more widely varying values were available. Because it has been argued that Bergmann's rule is stronger in larger species (
  <a rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib90">Steudel et al., 1994</a>) and at higher latitudes (
  <a rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib40">Freckleton et al., 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib38">Faurby and Araújo, 2016</a>), we examined variability with both mean mass and mean latitude for each species. We also conducted all analyses using latitude instead of mean annual temperature. The reproducible code for these analyses is available (
