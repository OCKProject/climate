 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) Stacked histogram of correlation coefficients (r) for all species' intraspecific temperature-mass relationships. Colored bars show species with statistically significant relationships, both negative (purple) and positive (green), while white bars indicate species with relationship slopes that are not significantly different from zero. Percentages are of species in each group. (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) Stacked histogram of all species' correlation coefficients with bar color corresponding to taxonomic class. Dark vertical lines are correlation coefficients of zero. See
