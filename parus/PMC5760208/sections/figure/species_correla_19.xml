  <div class="title">Species correlation coefficients for temperature-mass relationships with species thresholds increased.</div>
  <p>Results for all species’ temperature-mass relationships for species with at least 60 individuals, range in collection years of at least 40, and range in latitudinal degrees of at least 10 (n = 591). These include (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) spatial collection locations for all individual specimens and linear regression for temperature-mass relationship for an example species, 
   <span class="italic">Martes pennant</span>, (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) stacked histograms of all species’ correlation coefficients (r) showing statistical significance of relationships and relationships by taxonomic class, and (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) variation in all species’ correlation coefficients across number of individuals, collection year temperature range, mass range, mean mass, and absolute mean latitude.
