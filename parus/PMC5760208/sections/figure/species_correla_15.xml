  <div class="title">Species correlation coefficients by bird migratory status.</div>
  <p>Stacked histograms of correlation coefficients (r) from intraspecific temperature-mass relationships for (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) migrant and (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) nonmigrant bird species. Of 750 bird species, 371 migrant species and 243 nonmigrant species were identified from data requested from BirdLife International (
   <a rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib8">Birdlife International, 2017</a>); species with migratory status codes of ‘Altitudinal Migrant’, ‘Full Migrant’, and ‘Nomadic’ were reclassified as migrants and ‘Not a Migrant’ as nonmigrants. Colored bars show species with statistically significant relationships, both negative (purple) and positive (green), while white bars indicate species with relationship slopes that are not significantly different from zero. Percentages are of species in each group. Dark vertical lines are correlation coefficients of zero.
