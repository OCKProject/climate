However, few have considered the likely outcome of predicted extreme conditions and the relative vulnerability of populations in different habitats. Here, we compare phenology and breeding success in great tits and blue tits over a 10 year period, including the extremely harsh conditions during spring 2012, at three sites in eastern England &#x02013; mixed deciduous woodland, riparian and urban habitat. Production, measured as brood biomass, was significantly lower in 2012 compared with the previous 9 years, with the decrease in productivity relatively greatest in woodland habitat. Production was related to hatch delay, i.e. birds not initiating incubation immediately after clutch completion, which was more common in 2012 than in previous years. The best predictor of hatch delay was daytime temperature (not nighttime minimum temperature) and rainfall, which convincingly reflected low growth and activity of caterpillar prey. We found that birds breeding in riparian and urban habitats were less vulnerable to the extremes of weather than those breeding in mixed deciduous woodland.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Research reported here was supported by Anglia Ruskin University and Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.

</named-content> are resident UK breeding birds occupying a great variety of habitats from oak woodlands to urban gardens [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Their propensity to use nest boxes and their relative robustness for small birds has made them ideal species to study and they are some of the most researched birds in the world [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Long term research on great tits in particular has been valuable in exploring the responses of breeding birds to climate change [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the majority of previous work has been conducted in woodland, with relatively little attention being paid to the potential consequences of changing climate on breeding birds in fragmented and urban habitats.</p><p>Although much of the UK was once densely forested, clearance began around 4000 BC and by about one thousand years ago, cover in England was reduced to about 15% [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Great tits and blue tits have adapted rapidly and now occupy a range of wooded habitats. More recently, their environment is undergoing further man-made modification due to climate change. Warmer springs have allowed great tits and blue tits to nest earlier in the year as warmer conditions have shifted the life-cycles of their dominant caterpillar prey [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, in addition to temperature effects, it is also envisioned that climate change is likely to result in unpredictable rainfall patterns in the UK [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Rainfall and temperature are the main drivers of caterpillar reproduction and growth, and variability in their life cycles will inevitably impact birds that prey upon them [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The weather in the UK during the spring of 2012 was exceptionally cold and wet, the year being the wettest in England since records began in 1910 [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this paper, we use 10 years of breeding data to examine the effects of this extreme weather on reproductive success in great tits and blue tits, and explore how their responses differed with habitat type.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Study sites</title><p>Nest boxes were monitored at three UK sites in Cambridgeshire in eastern England: Cambridge University Botanical Garden (CUBG; 52&#x000b0;12&#x02019; N, 0 &#x000b0; 8&#x02019;E), Cow Lane Nature Reserve (CL; 52&#x000b0;20&#x02019; N, 0&#x000b0; 9&#x02019;W) and Brampton Wood Nature Reserve (BW; 52&#x000b0;19&#x02019; N, 0&#x000b0; 16&#x02019;W). The three sites are in the same geographic area, experiencing similar temperatures and rainfall, but differ markedly in habitat structure and flora. The CUBG (40 ha) is a diverse urban habitat including native trees (~14%) and a comprehensive collection of plants from around the world [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. CL (~85 ha) is a restored site of previous extensive gravel extraction alongside the river Great Ouse. Its riparian vegetation is dominated by willows (<named-content content-type="genus-species">

Although nest box occupancy largely reflected population density, all three sites had some nest boxes (CUBG: 48% after 2005, CL: 24% and BW 14% respectively) with holes that excluded great tits.</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Bird data</title><p>Data were collected, for first nesting attempts only, at least weekly from the end of March to July each year. The following parameters were recorded for both species: nest completion, first egg date, clutch completion and size, hatching date, mean nestling body mass (excluding runts) and total brood biomass (including runts) at 11 days of age (day of hatching = 0), and the number of young fledged. Great tits and blue tits both usually lay one egg per day and begin incubation on the day the last egg is laid (which facilitates synchronous hatching). However, incubation can begin with the penultimate egg (or sometimes earlier) or it can be delayed beyond the date of the last egg. Hatch delay was calculated as observed minus expected hatch day, with the expected day being estimated as day of the last egg + 13, assuming that eggs usually hatch on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of incubation [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Body mass was measured using a 50 g spring balance (<italic>Pesola</italic>) or a high precision pocket scale (<italic>Satrue</italic>), and nestlings were ringed with a uniquely numbered British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) ring. Runts (CL and BW) were defined as chicks too small to ring on day 11, and young not found dead in the box after the brood had left, were assumed to have fledged [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A different process for defining runts was required for the CUBG because of the size variation of nestlings at 11 days of age; frequency tables were generated using the masses of all nestlings from all boxes for both species and any nestling in the lowest 5% of these values were deemed to be runts. This calculation equated to any great tit nestling below 9.6 g in weight and any blue tit nestling below 4.4 g being excluded from the mean nestling body mass calculation [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Weather data</title><p>Daily rainfall and temperature data were provided by CUBG. Although 25 km from CL and 29 km from BW, this was the closest data source with the detailed meteorological data required for this analysis. An index of spring warmth, the &#x0201c;warmth sum&#x0201d; was calculated as the sum of maximum daily temperatures from 1 March-25 April, as derived and used by previous investigators [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To consider hatch delay with respect to weather, mean temperature minimum and maximum along with rainfall was calculated for each individual nesting attempt for the week of clutch completion as well as the week prior to, and following clutch completion.</p></sec><sec id="s2.4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analysis of variance and covariance (ANOVA and ANCOVA), regressions and descriptive statistics, undertaken with Minitab Release 16, were used to compare breeding parameters between sites. General linear models (GLM) were used to investigate the influence of year, site, first egg date and hatch delay on three measures of productivity, i.e. brood biomass and mean nestling body mass at day 11, and the number of young fledged. First egg date and hatch delay were treated as continuous variables whereas year and study site were categorical. To investigate the effects of weather conditions, a best subsets regression was used that allowed for year and considered hatch delay in response to rain, daytime maximum and nighttime minimum temperatures during three critical weeks (the week of clutch completion, the week prior to this and the week following it). Best models were selected using the lowest Mallows&#x02019; Cp (a measure of goodness-of-prediction). Nests which survived to each stage of breeding were included in the analyses, hence sample sizes decrease through the season in most cases due to nest failures.</p></sec><sec id="s2.5"><title>Site access and study ethics</title><p>Access to the study sites was granted by the Director of the Cambridge University Botanical Gardens, and the land owners of Cow Lane Nature Reserve (Lafarge) and Brampton Wood Nature Reserve (the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire). The study did not involve any endangered species. The fieldwork involved standard procedures as recommended by the BTO and everyone collecting data were licensed by the BTO and complied with the Codes of Practice as stipulated in the BTO&#x02019;s Ringer&#x02019;s Manual.

For both species, year-to-year variability was least at BW. For great tits, prior to 2012 both measures were also consistently highest at BW and were usually lowest at CUBG (and especially so in 2005). However, in 2012 both measures of nestling mass were relatively low compared to the previous nine years and for BW, significantly lower (ANOVA, p &#x0003c;0.001 for both species). Although not quite so clear cut, blue tit mean mass and biomass were also relatively low in 2012 and especially so for CUBG. Although BW tended to produce heavier blue tit broods, biomass was significantly lower (ANOVA, p &#x0003c;0.005) at this site in 2012 than in previous years and mean nestling mass was the second lowest recorded during the 10 years.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0075536-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0075536.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Overall breeding output of great tits <named-content content-type="genus-species">

However, there were significant differences between first egg dates at the three study sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Over the 10 years of this study, great tits laid their first eggs significantly later at CL (ANCOVA p &#x0003c;0.05) compared with the other two sites. For blue tits, egg laying started significantly earlier at BW (ANCOVA p &#x0003c;0.05) compared with the other two sites.

However, the 2012 hatch dates at BW are 6 days later than the 9 year average and ~8 days later than they would have been if full incubation had begun as is typical on the day of clutch completion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075536-t002">Table 2</xref>). At CL, hatching was delayed a little, occurring ~3 days later than the 9 year average but within ~2 days of when they would have hatched with typical incubation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075536-t002">Table 2</xref>). At CUBG, hatching occurred at a date that suggested incubation had begun on the day of clutch completion which was 2 days earlier than the 9 year average and resulted in hatching that was ~12 days earlier than at BW.

The weather in 2012 was extreme [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and for both species total productivity (brood biomass) was significantly lower in 2012, most strikingly at BW, the site most representative of preferred woodland habitat. Brood biomass is a good indication of the total energy available for reproduction and indicates that the cold, wet conditions in 2012 limited the resources available for brood rearing. The mean weights of nestlings were significantly lower in 2012; nestling weight at fledging is positively related to likely recruitment [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and the low nestling weights in 2012 at BW and CUBG suggest lower likely recruitment. However, where there were small brood sizes (so that more energy was invested in each individual offspring) some of the nestlings reached healthy weights. Particularly for great tits, clutch sizes were small at CL and CUBG in 2012, and nestling weights were similar (CUBG) or greater (CL) than at BW.</p><p>Compared to blue tits, great tits appeared to be more vulnerable to the food shortages in BW, and this may relate to their larger mass (18 g for great tit compared with 11g for blue tit) [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Blue tits, being approximately 60% the mass of great tits, differ in their foraging requirements and appear to be less vulnerable during times of food shortages. Our observations of breeding performance are strongly suggestive of a fundamental difference between BW and the other study sites, with BW birds dependent upon the spring peak in caterpillars, while CL and CUBG birds use a broader resource base. In the urban habitat of CUBG, there is a large diversity of non-native plants and a heterogeneous configuration of flora, which is likely to result in low caterpillar density [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and abundance [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Overall, blue tits have been found to be more selective foragers than great tits during the breeding season in CUBG, feeding more frequently in native deciduous trees and shrubs where they are likely to find more invertebrate food for their nestlings [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Visser et al. [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] argued that quantifying food resources is essential to establishing an understanding of phenology. However, the extremely diverse resources used by populations in riparian and urban habitats are not readily quantified (due to the large numbers of plant species), and breeding pairs may vary in their dependence on Lepidopteran or other insect prey across small spatial scales. Our results showing poor performance in woodland in 2012 supports our impression that there is lower dependence on one or few prey taxa in marginal and urban habitats.</p><p>The breeding season is controlled by a hierarchy of factors, first photoperiod and then temperature [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], with temperature a good predictor of bud burst and caterpillar abundance [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The warm conditions in March 2012 set the breeding season in motion, but then birds found themselves laying eggs in temperatures near freezing. Daytime April temperatures were up to 5 degrees below average in 2012. Breeding birds would be affected both because of cold conditions increasing energy requirements and less food being available [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In 2012 the response to cold conditions was delayed incubation, which created a lag in hatching and fledging. The reason may have been the condition of the laying females, with incubation having energetic consequences [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the outcome was that critical periods for feeding young and fledging chicks were delayed until more prey was, potentially, available. The caterpillar season is prolonged in colder springs [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], with growth rates and developmental times correlated with ambient temperature [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; for example, for <named-content content-type="genus-species">

</named-content> a common prey of birds feeding in woodland habitat, the Q<sub>10</sub> = 3 [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus given the likely effects of the cold conditions on caterpillar availability, the birds at BW probably faced an unprecedented food shortage. Moth recording in our study region showed that 2012 was a poor year with fewer moth species and numbers of individuals recorded than normal, caterpillars being affected by the cold but also perishing in the heavy and frequent rain (Barry Dickerson, Huntingdonshire Moth Recorder, pers. comm.). Our exploration of hatch delay was informative, elucidating how weather disrupted egg-laying and incubation. Our results show that the most significant predictor of hatch delay was not low nighttime temperatures (T<sub>min</sub>) but instead low daytime temperatures (the daily T<sub>max</sub>). Furthermore, although temperature was more significant than rainfall in this study, heavy rainfall can wash caterpillars off leaves thus increasing their scarcity for leaf-foraging predators [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Clutch sizes were larger in the more favourable habitat of BW, and the physiological stress of producing the large clutches may have explained some of our observations of mortality within broods. Food stress in females during egg-laying can result in eggs of diminishing mass which in turn results in a gradation of nestling sizes on hatching [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Competition for scarcer caterpillars between nestlings of different sizes would favour the larger birds and likely result in the death of the smaller ones. The mean weights of nestlings were significantly lower in 2012 and highly variable, with broods at BW showing high variation in the size of nestlings of the same age, even in the same nest. The timing and size of clutches are shaped by natural selection [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] with a pattern identified in which birds laying early are at a selective advantage [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. If constraints during egg-laying become more severe, the birds have the option of trading-off the costs of producing eggs early against initiating incubation before clutch completion [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], with asynchronous hatching of the chicks a possible consequence [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Once egg-laying is initiated, there is said to be little flexibility in the progress of breeding from incubation, through to nestling provisioning and fledging [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Selection for the timing of egg-laying is thus considered of paramount importance, the sole factor determining the timing of nestlings relative to the peak in resource availability. A response has been shown in great tits as the result of changing phenology associated with climate change, with increased strength of directional selection on the timing of breeding [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, if delayed incubation is a viable option, the birds may have more flexibility in the event of catastrophic change in conditions such as those observed in 2012.</p><p>There is growing evidence for adaptive plasticity in blue tits [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and great tits [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] permitting the alignment of hatching and the demands of feeding their brood with the peak availability of caterpillar prey. The birds are more able to delay hatching than to accelerate it through changes in clutch size and incubation [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and this has pushed the date of first eggs earlier. Strong selection may result in microevolution in laying dates, or in phenotypic plasticity, and whether this succeeds in aligning reproductive effort with resource availability depends upon how rapid climate changes may be, and whether the different elements (e.g. bud burst and caterpillar growth) are responding at similar rates [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>There exists a challenge in identifying the extent to which observed incubation delays represent females constrained by food shortages or adaptive plasticity, and our data comparing blue tits and great tits suggests that constraints on females may be part of the explanation of observed laying and incubation behaviour. Arnold et al. [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] showed that a non-heritable trait (nutritional state) affected fitness. Clutch size may also be under directional selection, but it is similarly affected by nutritional state; such proximate constraints may be correlated to fitness. Decisions of individuals &#x02013; in the present study, delays in hatching as the result of delay in initiation of incubation &#x02013; show how a proximate mechanism may contribute to the dynamics of selection, with implications for evolutionary episodes [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and a potentially rapid response to climate change.</p><p>Where populations are under stronger selection, for example dependent on a more specialised diet, then the speed of evolution will be faster, responding to the rapid adaptive response of insect phenology to climate change [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. If we consider brood biomass and mean nestling weights, we see that 2012 was worse for BW but relatively less poor for the other sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We believe this outcome for the woodland breeders may be explained by the constraints of specialising on a relatively narrow prey base, chiefly Lepidopteran larvae. In contrast, a greater variety of habitats at CL (for example, the most successful blue tits foraged in <named-content content-type="genus-species">
<italic>Phragmites</italic>
</named-content> reeds, pers. obs.), and CUBG (urban mosaic habitat) allowed these more generalist foragers to switch between prey, leaving them less vulnerable.</p><p>Changing temperatures have been identified as affecting the timing of the initiation of breeding in great tits, an empirical example of a biological/ecological signature of climate change [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The trends in spring temperature may be a potent selective force on breeding birds [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], but our analysis is illustrative of the complex consequences for ecological processes as the result of climate change [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Not only are milder winters and springs predicted, but also unpredictable storms [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Charmantier et al. [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] noted that while great tits were showing adaptive plasticity in response to warmer springs, they would not be very efficient in developing some alternative plasticity to different environmental conditions or a different rate of change. Plasticity is related to environmental predictability, an important adaptation for small scale environmental heterogeneity [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but the birds are not able to respond to wildly unpredictable events such as those of spring 2012. Our observations suggested that there were responses, notably delays in the initiation of incubation, which could have fitness consequences if the peak in prey availability was shifted to later in the spring. However, conditions were not good for most of the spring of 2012. The weather was again rainy and cold in June at the time of fledging. It would appear that as a result of unprecedented cold, rainy conditions, 2012 was a very bad year for tits for two critical stages important for success - provisioning in the nest and fledging.</p><p>Breeding success of both great tits and blue tits has been shown to be higher in deciduous woodland compared to other habitats with breeding performance particularly problematic in urban habitat [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Studies of energetics in the sites presently being considered have shown that breeding birds work much harder to produce fewer offspring in urban habitats as compared to woodland [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The present study found all of the birds struggling to raise young in 2012, but the variable performance of birds in riparian and urban habitats was not very different from a typical year, whereas the early laying birds breeding at BW performed particularly poorly. We predict that recruitment across these habitats will be low, but with a larger relative production of recruits in marginal habitats, and among the birds laying later in the season.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the Cambridge University Botanical Gardens for site access and supplying meteorological data.
