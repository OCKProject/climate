  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest boxes were monitored at three UK sites in Cambridgeshire in eastern England: Cambridge University Botanical Garden (CUBG; 52°12’ N, 0 ° 8’E), Cow Lane Nature Reserve (CL; 52°20’ N, 0° 9’W) and Brampton Wood Nature Reserve (BW; 52°19’ N, 0° 16’W). The three sites are in the same geographic area, experiencing similar temperatures and rainfall, but differ markedly in habitat structure and flora. The CUBG (40 ha) is a diverse urban habitat including native trees (~14%) and a comprehensive collection of plants from around the world [
   <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>]. CL (~85 ha) is a restored site of previous extensive gravel extraction alongside the river Great Ouse. Its riparian vegetation is dominated by willows (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest boxes (CUBG: 20-44, CL: 50 and BW: 22) were monitored over a ten year period (2003-2012); in the CUBG the number of boxes changed during the time of the study with only 20 boxes from 2003 to 2005, increasing to 44 after 2005. Although nest box occupancy largely reflected population density, all three sites had some nest boxes (CUBG: 48% after 2005, CL: 24% and BW 14% respectively) with holes that excluded great tits.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected, for first nesting attempts only, at least weekly from the end of March to July each year. The following parameters were recorded for both species: nest completion, first egg date, clutch completion and size, hatching date, mean nestling body mass (excluding runts) and total brood biomass (including runts) at 11 days of age (day of hatching = 0), and the number of young fledged. Great tits and blue tits both usually lay one egg per day and begin incubation on the day the last egg is laid (which facilitates synchronous hatching). However, incubation can begin with the penultimate egg (or sometimes earlier) or it can be delayed beyond the date of the last egg. Hatch delay was calculated as observed minus expected hatch day, with the expected day being estimated as day of the last egg + 13, assuming that eggs usually hatch on the 14
   <span class="sup">th</span> day of incubation [
   <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body mass was measured using a 50 g spring balance (
   <span class="italic">Pesola</span>) or a high precision pocket scale (
   <span class="italic">Satrue</span>), and nestlings were ringed with a uniquely numbered British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) ring. Runts (CL and BW) were defined as chicks too small to ring on day 11, and young not found dead in the box after the brood had left, were assumed to have fledged [
   <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>]. A different process for defining runts was required for the CUBG because of the size variation of nestlings at 11 days of age; frequency tables were generated using the masses of all nestlings from all boxes for both species and any nestling in the lowest 5% of these values were deemed to be runts. This calculation equated to any great tit nestling below 9.6 g in weight and any blue tit nestling below 4.4 g being excluded from the mean nestling body mass calculation [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weather data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily rainfall and temperature data were provided by CUBG. Although 25 km from CL and 29 km from BW, this was the closest data source with the detailed meteorological data required for this analysis. An index of spring warmth, the “warmth sum” was calculated as the sum of maximum daily temperatures from 1 March-25 April, as derived and used by previous investigators [
   <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>,
   <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. To consider hatch delay with respect to weather, mean temperature minimum and maximum along with rainfall was calculated for each individual nesting attempt for the week of clutch completion as well as the week prior to, and following clutch completion.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of variance and covariance (ANOVA and ANCOVA), regressions and descriptive statistics, undertaken with Minitab Release 16, were used to compare breeding parameters between sites. General linear models (GLM) were used to investigate the influence of year, site, first egg date and hatch delay on three measures of productivity, i.e. brood biomass and mean nestling body mass at day 11, and the number of young fledged. First egg date and hatch delay were treated as continuous variables whereas year and study site were categorical. To investigate the effects of weather conditions, a best subsets regression was used that allowed for year and considered hatch delay in response to rain, daytime maximum and nighttime minimum temperatures during three critical weeks (the week of clutch completion, the week prior to this and the week following it). Best models were selected using the lowest Mallows’ Cp (a measure of goodness-of-prediction). Nests which survived to each stage of breeding were included in the analyses, hence sample sizes decrease through the season in most cases due to nest failures.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Site access and study ethics</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Access to the study sites was granted by the Director of the Cambridge University Botanical Gardens, and the land owners of Cow Lane Nature Reserve (Lafarge) and Brampton Wood Nature Reserve (the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire). The study did not involve any endangered species. The fieldwork involved standard procedures as recommended by the BTO and everyone collecting data were licensed by the BTO and complied with the Codes of Practice as stipulated in the BTO’s Ringer’s Manual. No additional animal care approval was required.</p>
