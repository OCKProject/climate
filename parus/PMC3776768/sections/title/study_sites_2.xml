 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest boxes were monitored at three UK sites in Cambridgeshire in eastern England: Cambridge University Botanical Garden (CUBG; 52°12’ N, 0 ° 8’E), Cow Lane Nature Reserve (CL; 52°20’ N, 0° 9’W) and Brampton Wood Nature Reserve (BW; 52°19’ N, 0° 16’W). The three sites are in the same geographic area, experiencing similar temperatures and rainfall, but differ markedly in habitat structure and flora. The CUBG (40 ha) is a diverse urban habitat including native trees (~14%) and a comprehensive collection of plants from around the world [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>]. CL (~85 ha) is a restored site of previous extensive gravel extraction alongside the river Great Ouse. Its riparian vegetation is dominated by willows (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest boxes (CUBG: 20-44, CL: 50 and BW: 22) were monitored over a ten year period (2003-2012); in the CUBG the number of boxes changed during the time of the study with only 20 boxes from 2003 to 2005, increasing to 44 after 2005. Although nest box occupancy largely reflected population density, all three sites had some nest boxes (CUBG: 48% after 2005, CL: 24% and BW 14% respectively) with holes that excluded great tits.</p>
