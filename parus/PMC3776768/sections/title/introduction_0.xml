  </div> are resident UK breeding birds occupying a great variety of habitats from oak woodlands to urban gardens [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>]. Their propensity to use nest boxes and their relative robustness for small birds has made them ideal species to study and they are some of the most researched birds in the world [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>,
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>]. Long term research on great tits in particular has been valuable in exploring the responses of breeding birds to climate change [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>-
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. However, the majority of previous work has been conducted in woodland, with relatively little attention being paid to the potential consequences of changing climate on breeding birds in fragmented and urban habitats.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although much of the UK was once densely forested, clearance began around 4000 BC and by about one thousand years ago, cover in England was reduced to about 15% [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. Great tits and blue tits have adapted rapidly and now occupy a range of wooded habitats. More recently, their environment is undergoing further man-made modification due to climate change. Warmer springs have allowed great tits and blue tits to nest earlier in the year as warmer conditions have shifted the life-cycles of their dominant caterpillar prey [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>,
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>,
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>,
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. However, in addition to temperature effects, it is also envisioned that climate change is likely to result in unpredictable rainfall patterns in the UK [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. Rainfall and temperature are the main drivers of caterpillar reproduction and growth, and variability in their life cycles will inevitably impact birds that prey upon them [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>,
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The weather in the UK during the spring of 2012 was exceptionally cold and wet, the year being the wettest in England since records began in 1910 [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. In this paper, we use 10 years of breeding data to examine the effects of this extreme weather on reproductive success in great tits and blue tits, and explore how their responses differed with habitat type.
