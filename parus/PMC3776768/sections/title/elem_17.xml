  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. Potentially worse for the birds at our Cambridgeshire study sites was a warm and dry period during the last two weeks of March which may have encouraged early breeding (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g004" href="#pone-0075536-g004">Figure 4</a>). However, while the first three weeks of April were marginally wetter than average, the following two weeks of 2012 were significantly wetter (ANOVA p&lt;0.001) than in the previous 9 years contributing to a record-breaking wet spring and summer in the UK [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. Furthermore, daytime temperature maximums (T
  <sub>max</sub>) from the first week of April through to the second half of May were significantly lower (ANOVA p&lt;0.001) than in the previous 9 years. Similarly, nighttime temperature minimums (T
  <sub>min</sub>) were below average from the last week of March through to the third week in April.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hatch delay was significantly related to weather conditions, especially temperature (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075536-t004" href="#pone-0075536-t004">Table 4</a>). The correlation was particularly strong for BW where hatch delay was longest in both great tits and blue tits (R
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 72% and 84% respectively). For all models, hatch delay was negatively related to temperature and positively related to rainfall. The best model for each species at each site was obtained by using 3 of the 9 possible predictor variables (rain, day and night temperatures during each of the 3 critical weeks). Of the total of 18 factors identified for both species at the 3 sites, the most frequently selected was T
  <sub>max</sub> (n = 8) which also represents daytime conditions. T
  <sub>min</sub> (nighttime) was the next most frequent (n = 6) followed by rainfall (n = 4).

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pertinent weeks were: i) the week before clutch completion, i.e. during egg laying (E); ii) the week of clutch completion when full incubation should start with the laying of the last egg (C); iii) the week after clutch completion which typically would be the second week of incubation (I). The best models were obtained with 3 of the 9 possible predictor variables; models with the lowest Mallows Cp (M. Cp) values and standard error of regression (S) were selected. For all models, hatch delay was negatively related to temperature and positively related to rainfall.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For BW, there was more of a continuous relationship between hatch delay and temperature with 2012 representing extreme conditions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g005" href="#pone-0075536-g005">Figure 5</a>). The most acute challenge arguably was the result of rainfall; 2012 represented an extreme compared to preceding years due to the exceptional volumes of rain involved. The hatch delay was particularly prolonged for great tits at BW, and this is brought into focus if we consider the different stages of egg presence and development in the nest (laying, delay prior to incubation and incubation) against weather conditions prior to and during these stages (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g006" href="#pone-0075536-g006">Figure 6</a>). During the last two weeks of March, although nighttime temperatures were below average, daytime temperatures were well above average and rainfall was below average. Egg-laying commenced during the first week of April and peaked during the third week by which time nighttime temperatures were below average, daytime temperatures had plummeted and rainfall was building towards a record high. There was a substantial delay before the females began full-time incubation which peaked at the beginning of May (day 31) by which time night temperatures were nearing average and rainfall was diminishing. However, daytime temperatures remained below average until the fourth week of May (day 52). Note also that as the last 20 or so eggs were hatching, temperatures dropped below average once more and rainfall increased considerably.
