 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of variance and covariance (ANOVA and ANCOVA), regressions and descriptive statistics, undertaken with Minitab Release 16, were used to compare breeding parameters between sites. General linear models (GLM) were used to investigate the influence of year, site, first egg date and hatch delay on three measures of productivity, i.e. brood biomass and mean nestling body mass at day 11, and the number of young fledged. First egg date and hatch delay were treated as continuous variables whereas year and study site were categorical. To investigate the effects of weather conditions, a best subsets regression was used that allowed for year and considered hatch delay in response to rain, daytime maximum and nighttime minimum temperatures during three critical weeks (the week of clutch completion, the week prior to this and the week following it). Best models were selected using the lowest Mallowsâ€™ Cp (a measure of goodness-of-prediction). Nests which survived to each stage of breeding were included in the analyses, hence sample sizes decrease through the season in most cases due to nest failures.</p>
