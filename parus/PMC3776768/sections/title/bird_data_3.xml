 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected, for first nesting attempts only, at least weekly from the end of March to July each year. The following parameters were recorded for both species: nest completion, first egg date, clutch completion and size, hatching date, mean nestling body mass (excluding runts) and total brood biomass (including runts) at 11 days of age (day of hatching = 0), and the number of young fledged. Great tits and blue tits both usually lay one egg per day and begin incubation on the day the last egg is laid (which facilitates synchronous hatching). However, incubation can begin with the penultimate egg (or sometimes earlier) or it can be delayed beyond the date of the last egg. Hatch delay was calculated as observed minus expected hatch day, with the expected day being estimated as day of the last egg + 13, assuming that eggs usually hatch on the 14

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body mass was measured using a 50 g spring balance (
  <span class="italic">Pesola</span>) or a high precision pocket scale (
  <span class="italic">Satrue</span>), and nestlings were ringed with a uniquely numbered British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) ring. Runts (CL and BW) were defined as chicks too small to ring on day 11, and young not found dead in the box after the brood had left, were assumed to have fledged [

A different process for defining runts was required for the CUBG because of the size variation of nestlings at 11 days of age; frequency tables were generated using the masses of all nestlings from all boxes for both species and any nestling in the lowest 5% of these values were deemed to be runts. This calculation equated to any great tit nestling below 9.6 g in weight and any blue tit nestling below 4.4 g being excluded from the mean nestling body mass calculation [
