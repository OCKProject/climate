 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study shows that 2012 was a poor year for breeding great tits and blue tits, but further indicates how weather interacts with habitat to determine breeding success. The weather in 2012 was extreme [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>], and for both species total productivity (brood biomass) was significantly lower in 2012, most strikingly at BW, the site most representative of preferred woodland habitat. Brood biomass is a good indication of the total energy available for reproduction and indicates that the cold, wet conditions in 2012 limited the resources available for brood rearing. The mean weights of nestlings were significantly lower in 2012; nestling weight at fledging is positively related to likely recruitment [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>,
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>] and the low nestling weights in 2012 at BW and CUBG suggest lower likely recruitment. However, where there were small brood sizes (so that more energy was invested in each individual offspring) some of the nestlings reached healthy weights. Particularly for great tits, clutch sizes were small at CL and CUBG in 2012, and nestling weights were similar (CUBG) or greater (CL) than at BW.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared to blue tits, great tits appeared to be more vulnerable to the food shortages in BW, and this may relate to their larger mass (18 g for great tit compared with 11g for blue tit) [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>]. Blue tits, being approximately 60% the mass of great tits, differ in their foraging requirements and appear to be less vulnerable during times of food shortages. Our observations of breeding performance are strongly suggestive of a fundamental difference between BW and the other study sites, with BW birds dependent upon the spring peak in caterpillars, while CL and CUBG birds use a broader resource base. In the urban habitat of CUBG, there is a large diversity of non-native plants and a heterogeneous configuration of flora, which is likely to result in low caterpillar density [
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>] and abundance [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. Overall, blue tits have been found to be more selective foragers than great tits during the breeding season in CUBG, feeding more frequently in native deciduous trees and shrubs where they are likely to find more invertebrate food for their nestlings [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>]. Visser et al. [
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>] argued that quantifying food resources is essential to establishing an understanding of phenology. However, the extremely diverse resources used by populations in riparian and urban habitats are not readily quantified (due to the large numbers of plant species), and breeding pairs may vary in their dependence on Lepidopteran or other insect prey across small spatial scales. Our results showing poor performance in woodland in 2012 supports our impression that there is lower dependence on one or few prey taxa in marginal and urban habitats.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The breeding season is controlled by a hierarchy of factors, first photoperiod and then temperature [
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>], with temperature a good predictor of bud burst and caterpillar abundance [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>,
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>]. The warm conditions in March 2012 set the breeding season in motion, but then birds found themselves laying eggs in temperatures near freezing. Daytime April temperatures were up to 5 degrees below average in 2012. Breeding birds would be affected both because of cold conditions increasing energy requirements and less food being available [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2012 the response to cold conditions was delayed incubation, which created a lag in hatching and fledging. The reason may have been the condition of the laying females, with incubation having energetic consequences [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>,
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>]. However, the outcome was that critical periods for feeding young and fledging chicks were delayed until more prey was, potentially, available. The caterpillar season is prolonged in colder springs [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>], with growth rates and developmental times correlated with ambient temperature [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]; for example, for

   </div>
   <span class="italic">
    <div content-type="species" class="named-content">brumata</div>
   </span>
  </div> a common prey of birds feeding in woodland habitat, the Q
  <sub>10</sub> = 3 [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>]. Thus given the likely effects of the cold conditions on caterpillar availability, the birds at BW probably faced an unprecedented food shortage. Moth recording in our study region showed that 2012 was a poor year with fewer moth species and numbers of individuals recorded than normal, caterpillars being affected by the cold but also perishing in the heavy and frequent rain (Barry Dickerson, Huntingdonshire Moth Recorder, pers. comm.). Our exploration of hatch delay was informative, elucidating how weather disrupted egg-laying and incubation. Our results show that the most significant predictor of hatch delay was not low nighttime temperatures (T
  <sub>min</sub>) but instead low daytime temperatures (the daily T
  <sub>max</sub>). Furthermore, although temperature was more significant than rainfall in this study, heavy rainfall can wash caterpillars off leaves thus increasing their scarcity for leaf-foraging predators [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clutch sizes were larger in the more favourable habitat of BW, and the physiological stress of producing the large clutches may have explained some of our observations of mortality within broods. Food stress in females during egg-laying can result in eggs of diminishing mass which in turn results in a gradation of nestling sizes on hatching [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. Competition for scarcer caterpillars between nestlings of different sizes would favour the larger birds and likely result in the death of the smaller ones. The mean weights of nestlings were significantly lower in 2012 and highly variable, with broods at BW showing high variation in the size of nestlings of the same age, even in the same nest. The timing and size of clutches are shaped by natural selection [
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>] with a pattern identified in which birds laying early are at a selective advantage [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>,
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>]. If constraints during egg-laying become more severe, the birds have the option of trading-off the costs of producing eggs early against initiating incubation before clutch completion [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>,
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>], with asynchronous hatching of the chicks a possible consequence [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once egg-laying is initiated, there is said to be little flexibility in the progress of breeding from incubation, through to nestling provisioning and fledging [
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>]. Selection for the timing of egg-laying is thus considered of paramount importance, the sole factor determining the timing of nestlings relative to the peak in resource availability. A response has been shown in great tits as the result of changing phenology associated with climate change, with increased strength of directional selection on the timing of breeding [
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>]. However, if delayed incubation is a viable option, the birds may have more flexibility in the event of catastrophic change in conditions such as those observed in 2012.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is growing evidence for adaptive plasticity in blue tits [
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>] and great tits [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>,
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>,
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>] permitting the alignment of hatching and the demands of feeding their brood with the peak availability of caterpillar prey. The birds are more able to delay hatching than to accelerate it through changes in clutch size and incubation [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>,
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>] and this has pushed the date of first eggs earlier. Strong selection may result in microevolution in laying dates, or in phenotypic plasticity, and whether this succeeds in aligning reproductive effort with resource availability depends upon how rapid climate changes may be, and whether the different elements (e.g. bud burst and caterpillar growth) are responding at similar rates [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>,
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There exists a challenge in identifying the extent to which observed incubation delays represent females constrained by food shortages or adaptive plasticity, and our data comparing blue tits and great tits suggests that constraints on females may be part of the explanation of observed laying and incubation behaviour. Arnold et al. [
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>] showed that a non-heritable trait (nutritional state) affected fitness. Clutch size may also be under directional selection, but it is similarly affected by nutritional state; such proximate constraints may be correlated to fitness. Decisions of individuals – in the present study, delays in hatching as the result of delay in initiation of incubation – show how a proximate mechanism may contribute to the dynamics of selection, with implications for evolutionary episodes [
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>] and a potentially rapid response to climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Where populations are under stronger selection, for example dependent on a more specialised diet, then the speed of evolution will be faster, responding to the rapid adaptive response of insect phenology to climate change [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>,
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>]. If we consider brood biomass and mean nestling weights, we see that 2012 was worse for BW but relatively less poor for the other sites (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g001" href="#pone-0075536-g001">Figure 1</a>). We believe this outcome for the woodland breeders may be explained by the constraints of specialising on a relatively narrow prey base, chiefly Lepidopteran larvae. In contrast, a greater variety of habitats at CL (for example, the most successful blue tits foraged in 
  <div content-type="genus-species" class="named-content">
   <span class="italic">Phragmites</span>
  </div> reeds, pers. obs.), and CUBG (urban mosaic habitat) allowed these more generalist foragers to switch between prey, leaving them less vulnerable.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changing temperatures have been identified as affecting the timing of the initiation of breeding in great tits, an empirical example of a biological/ecological signature of climate change [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>,
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>,
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>,
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>]. The trends in spring temperature may be a potent selective force on breeding birds [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>,
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>,
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>], but our analysis is illustrative of the complex consequences for ecological processes as the result of climate change [
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>,
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">45</a>]. Not only are milder winters and springs predicted, but also unpredictable storms [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>,
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">46</a>]. Charmantier et al. [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>] noted that while great tits were showing adaptive plasticity in response to warmer springs, they would not be very efficient in developing some alternative plasticity to different environmental conditions or a different rate of change. Plasticity is related to environmental predictability, an important adaptation for small scale environmental heterogeneity [
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>], but the birds are not able to respond to wildly unpredictable events such as those of spring 2012. Our observations suggested that there were responses, notably delays in the initiation of incubation, which could have fitness consequences if the peak in prey availability was shifted to later in the spring. However, conditions were not good for most of the spring of 2012. The weather was again rainy and cold in June at the time of fledging. It would appear that as a result of unprecedented cold, rainy conditions, 2012 was a very bad year for tits for two critical stages important for success - provisioning in the nest and fledging.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breeding success of both great tits and blue tits has been shown to be higher in deciduous woodland compared to other habitats with breeding performance particularly problematic in urban habitat [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>,
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>]. Studies of energetics in the sites presently being considered have shown that breeding birds work much harder to produce fewer offspring in urban habitats as compared to woodland [
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>,
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">49</a>]. The present study found all of the birds struggling to raise young in 2012, but the variable performance of birds in riparian and urban habitats was not very different from a typical year, whereas the early laying birds breeding at BW performed particularly poorly. We predict that recruitment across these habitats will be low, but with a larger relative production of recruits in marginal habitats, and among the birds laying later in the season.
