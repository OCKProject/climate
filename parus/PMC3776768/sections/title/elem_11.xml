 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The general trend in the timing of breeding in relation to year-to-year variation in temperature followed the pattern documented previously [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>,
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>,
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>], i.e. first eggs were laid earlier in warmer springs. However, there were significant differences between first egg dates at the three study sites (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g002" href="#pone-0075536-g002">Figure 2</a>). Over the 10 years of this study, great tits laid their first eggs significantly later at CL (ANCOVA p &lt;0.05) compared with the other two sites. For blue tits, egg laying started significantly earlier at BW (ANCOVA p &lt;0.05) compared with the other two sites. Overall, these trends are in keeping with the tendency of great tits to breed earlier in urban areas [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>,
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>], whereas blue tits usually start before great tits in woodland [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>,
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>]. In 2012 both species started to breed earliest at BW, and this was on average the earliest start for blue tits during the entire 10 year study. However, over the period 1 March -25 April for which the spring warmth sum was calculated [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>,
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>] 2012 was by no means warm - indeed it falls in the lower half of the index range (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the early first egg date for great tits at BW during 2012, they were the latest eggs to hatch (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g003" href="#pone-0075536-g003">Figure 3</a>). And although egg-laying by blue tits started earliest at BW in 2012 compared with CL and CUBG (~5 and 11 d respectively), average hatching was within ~4 days at all three sites. A comparison of the three sites (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g003" href="#pone-0075536-g003">Figure 3</a>) elucidates the components of this apparently extended breeding season at BW. On average, great tits laid their first eggs ~5 days earlier than in the previous 9 years for this site and thus the start of incubation and subsequent hatching could also have been early. However, the 2012 hatch dates at BW are 6 days later than the 9 year average and ~8 days later than they would have been if full incubation had begun as is typical on the day of clutch completion (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075536-t002" href="#pone-0075536-t002">Table 2</a>). At CL, hatching was delayed a little, occurring ~3 days later than the 9 year average but within ~2 days of when they would have hatched with typical incubation (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075536-t002" href="#pone-0075536-t002">Table 2</a>). At CUBG, hatching occurred at a date that suggested incubation had begun on the day of clutch completion which was 2 days earlier than the 9 year average and resulted in hatching that was ~12 days earlier than at BW. For great tits at BW in 2012, the period from first egg date to hatch day was ~32 days compared with 22 and 17 days at CL and CUBG respectively.

  </div>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly for blue tits, egg-laying during 2012 was 4 days earlier than the 9 year average at BW and clutch completion was proportionally early compared with previous years (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g003" href="#pone-0075536-g003">Figure 3</a>). However, despite the differential between first laying dates, on average, hatching occurred within 4 days at all 3 sites. As with great tits, although delays with incubation and hatching were minimal in the previous 9 years (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075536-t002" href="#pone-0075536-t002">Table 2</a>), during 2012 there was an average hatch delay of 2 days for blue tits at CL and CUBG but &gt;8 days at BW. Also noteworthy was that all blue tits at BW delayed their hatching by at least 7 days which did not occur at the other sites or for great tits and had not occurred in any of the previous 9 years.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At BW during 2012, egg laying was interrupted by 1-2 days in the case of 2 out of 7 blue tits and 1 out of 17 great tits but the majority of birds laid one egg per day until their clutch was completed and then left cold eggs in the nest to be incubated at a later date. This prolonged stalling of the nesting cycle was unprecedented during the 10 year period of this study at any of the three sites. Typically, full-time incubation usually started for both species within a day or two of clutch completion and hatching usually occurred ~14 d after the start of incubation.</p>
