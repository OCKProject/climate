 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the GLMs investigating the influence of first egg date and hatch delay on productivity, year and site were always significant predictors (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075536-t003" href="#pone-0075536-t003">Table 3</a>). The best fit models were for brood biomass with R
  <span class="sup">2</span> estimates of 52% and 47% for great tits and blue tits respectively. First egg date was significantly, negatively related to brood biomass for great tits and blue tits while hatch delay was significantly, negatively related to brood biomass for great tits. First egg date and hatch delay were significantly, negatively related to the number of young fledged for both species. Both variables were poor predictors of mean nestling weight in both species. Overall, the later the first egg date, and the longer the hatch delay, the lower the brood biomass and the number of young fledged.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, this was not the case for great tits at BW during 2012 when the pattern reversed, all measures of productivity were positively, but not significantly, related to first egg date (linear regression: biomass R

  <span class="sup">2</span> = 28%, F = 3.8, p = 0.08). For great tits at CL during 2012 all measures of productivity were similarly positively related to first egg date and not significant (linear regression p ≥0.164). However, great tit productivity at CUBG followed the overall trends and was negatively related to first egg date (linear regression: biomass R
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 68%, F = 13, p = 0.012), but not significantly so for mean nestling weight and number of young fledged (p ≥0.306). For blue tits during 2012, productivity at CL and CUBG was generally negatively related to first egg date as in the overall analyses above, albeit non-significantly for this year (linear regression p ≥0.098). However, as with the great tits, this relationship was positive at BW, although not significant (linear regression p ≥0.364).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We considered the relationship between first egg date and hatch delay. For great tits during 2003-2011 hatch delay was rare, and there were no consistent trends with the longest hatch delay peaking 20-30
  <span class="sup">th</span> April at all three sites. However, for great tits during 2012 delayed incubation and thus hatch delay was frequent; although there was no consistent trend at CUBG, first egg date and hatch delay were significantly negatively related at CL (linear regression R
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 26%, F = 4.8, p = 0.045) and strongly, negatively related at BW (linear regression R
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 70%, F = 26, p &lt;0.001). For blue tit the relationship between first egg date and hatch delay was negative at the three sites but was not significant (linear regression p ≥0.125), and again the relationship between first egg date and hatch delay during 2012 was generally negative but was not significant (linear regression p ≥0.07)
