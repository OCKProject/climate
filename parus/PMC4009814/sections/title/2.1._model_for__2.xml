  <a rid="B21-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-biology-01-00639">21</a>], the matching between timing of reproduction and the temporal food abundance distribution is not modelled explicitly. Instead we assume that early arriving individuals can access and use these food resources for a longer period of time compared to later arriving individuals, and thereby obtain a higher reproductive output. With a sufficiently early arrival date, we assume individuals have full access to the food resources and with a sufficiently late arrival date we assume reproductive failure due to lack of food resources. In line with these assumptions we model the expected reproductive success 
  <span class="italic">R</span> of an individual as a decreasing, logistic function of arrival date (
