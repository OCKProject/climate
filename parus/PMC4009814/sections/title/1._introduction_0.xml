 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in the timing of arrival of long distance migratory birds at their breeding grounds have been observed in many studies. There is a general pattern of advanced arrival among birds that have their breeding grounds in the Northern hemisphere, and these shifts have in turn been connected to increased temperatures due to climate change [
  <a rid="B1-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-biology-01-00639">1</a>,
  <a rid="B2-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-biology-01-00639">2</a>,
  <a rid="B3-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-biology-01-00639">3</a>,
  <a rid="B4-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-biology-01-00639">4</a>]. Phenological changes in migratory birds have also been related to population trends [
  <a rid="B5-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-biology-01-00639">5</a>,
  <a rid="B6-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-biology-01-00639">6</a>,
  <a rid="B7-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-biology-01-00639">7</a>]. An interesting pattern that has emerged from these observations is that species that show no or only weak phenological change, expressed either as a change in mean/median arrival date [
  <a rid="B6-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-biology-01-00639">6</a>] or degree-days [
  <a rid="B8-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-biology-01-00639">8</a>], have decreased in population size. This has in turn been interpreted as an effect of increased temporal mismatch with food resources [
  <a rid="B8-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-biology-01-00639">8</a>]. Thus, after arrival at the breeding grounds, birds have either little time to complete the necessary steps involved in reproduction, or the offspring’s food demand does not overlap with the peak in availability of high quality food. Reproductive success can be compromised for both these reasons.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reproductive mismatch is however only one of many ways in which environmental change can affect populations of migratory birds, and it has been argued that the whole life cycle of an organism needs to be taken into account when predicting demographic responses to climate change in general [
  <a rid="B9-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-biology-01-00639">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-biology-01-00639">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-biology-01-00639">11</a>]. The NAO index, which correlates with winter survival, was for example found to be a more important factor to explain population declines than breeding success in a Pied flycatcher population breeding in Britain [
  <a rid="B12-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-biology-01-00639">12</a>]. Focusing on a single life-cycle event, such as breeding, in isolation from other events can also be misleading because climate change can affect temperatures unevenly over the season. Studies on Pied flycatchers in The Netherlands have indicated that, although temperature changes late in the season affected the timing of the resource peak, temperatures earlier in the season did not change [
  <a rid="B13-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-biology-01-00639">13</a>]. When changes in different seasonal components are decoupled in this way, negative effects on population trends due to reproductive mismatch may either be reinforced or counteracted by changes in other environmental components affecting e.g., adult survival.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental changes can also have evolutionary consequences and studies have indicated that selective pressures on the phenology of migratory birds have changed [
  <a rid="B5-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-biology-01-00639">5</a>,
  <a rid="B14-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-biology-01-00639">14</a>]. An outstanding question in this context is to what extent species can adapt their phenologies to new climatic conditions and thereby avoid negative demographic consequences. Establishing whether an observed phenological shift is adaptive or not, is however a challenging task. Different approaches to deal with this problem have been proposed. As a first approximation, it has been suggested that the temporal shift in food abundance can be used as a yardstick to evaluate the adaptive value of an observed phenological shift of a consumer species [
  <a rid="B15-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-biology-01-00639">15</a>]. The annual routine approach to modelling phenological adaptation in migratory birds [
  <a rid="B16-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-biology-01-00639">16</a>,
  <a rid="B17-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-biology-01-00639">17</a>,
  <a rid="B18-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-biology-01-00639">18</a>] emphasizes that the optimal phenology depends on the interplay between environmental and physiological state variables over the whole annual cycle. Studies based on evolutionary game theory in turn show that competition for territories can play a crucial role for bird phenology [
  <a rid="B19-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-biology-01-00639">19</a>]. Interestingly, further theoretical work indicates that the degree of competition can affect whether migratory birds adapt their timing of arrival at the breeding grounds according to shifts in temporal food abundance distributions or to changes in pre-breeding conditions [
  <a rid="B20-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-biology-01-00639">20</a>,
  <a rid="B21-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-biology-01-00639">21</a>]. Competition for territories can also influence demographic responses in populations undergoing phenological adaptation. It has for example been shown that in situations where strong competition has selected for early arrival, advanced food resource peaks may well give rise to a temporary increase in population density in migratory birds [
  <a rid="B22-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-biology-01-00639">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In sum, we expect changes in competitive pressures, in conditions for pre-breeding survival, as well as in food resource peaks to have consequences for demographic changes and adaptive phenological responses. The aim of this study is to find out how these factors interact and what their relative roles are. We include these factors in a single framework by combining elements from previous models. The resulting model thus contains pre-breeding survival similar to the implementation by Jonzén 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="B20-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-biology-01-00639">20</a>], and a population dynamics module borrowed from a study by Johansson and Jonzén [
  <a rid="B22-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-biology-01-00639">22</a>]. To study territory competition we furthermore use the model in Johansson and Jonzén [
  <a rid="B21-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-biology-01-00639">21</a>], where this aspect is treated in a more explicit and mechanistic way compared to the other two studies [
  <a rid="B20-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-biology-01-00639">20</a>,
  <a rid="B22-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-biology-01-00639">22</a>]. We also include winter survival and resource abundance as parameters into the models since they can affect competitive pressures indirectly by affecting population densities. Acknowledging the fact that climate change may have uneven effects on different components of the seasonal environment we study scenarios of change where conditions for pre-breeding survival and food resource peak date may change independently of each other.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use the following procedure to study effects of environmental changes on the system [
  <a rid="B22-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-biology-01-00639">22</a>]. First we calculate the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for timing of arrival at breeding grounds, and the corresponding demographic equilibrium. Then we simulate climate change by adjusting the model parameters that represent the onset of benign pre-breeding conditions and the timing of the food abundance peak. Finally we study how these changes affect selection pressures, population densities and age structure. The inclusion of population dynamics into the model allows us to study population dynamic feedback on evolution, an aspect that to large extent has been lacking in previous studies. By considering more ecological factors, this new approach enables closer connections between eco-evolutionary theory and data. We conclude the paper by discussing some empirical findings in the light of our results and promising areas for future research.
