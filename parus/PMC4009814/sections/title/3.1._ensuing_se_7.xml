 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An advanced onset of spring has a strong effect on selection compared to an advanced food peak when spring is already early (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>A), when winter survival is high (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>B), when productivity is high (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>C), when the resource peak is narrow (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>D) and with slow improvement of pre-breeding conditions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>E). In these cases, the selection after only 
  <span class="italic">r</span> has changed is very small (solid lines are close to zero), and the effect of changing 
  <span class="italic">s</span> and 
  <span class="italic">r</span> jointly (green lines) is very similar to changing 
  <span class="italic">s</span> only (blue lines).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under most settings, advanced food peak leads to selection for earlier arrival (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>A–C,E). When the resource distribution is broad, however, advanced food peak can cause selection for a delayed arrival date (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>D). To understand this phenomenon, note that a changed resource peak affects the adaptive landscape not only by affecting the reproductive success of individuals for different arrival dates, but also by changing the reproductive success as such (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f001" href="#biology-01-00639-f001">Figure 1</a>A), which, via effects on population densities, can affect the competitive pressure. At evolutionary equilibrium there is a balance between selection for earlier arrival to increase reproduction and to avoid competition, and selection for later arrival dates to increase survival (cf. Equation 14). When the food peak advances, selection for earlier reproduction increases but population density decreases (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>I). Thereby also the competitive pressure decreases, which in turn weakens selection towards earlier arrival dates. The effect of a food peak shift on selection is relatively weak when the food distribution is wide, but the effect of population densities (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>I) and thereby on competition may still be substantial, which explains why later arrival can be favoured under these circumstances.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally we note that 
  <span class="italic">s</span> has the stronger influence on selection when the ESS is early (compare 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>A–E with 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>A–E). An early ESS can in turn occur either when spring is early or when competition is strong. An early spring leads to a large population, whereas strong competition occurs when the population density is large e.g., due to high winter survival, high productivity, narrow resource distribution or slow rate of improving pre-breeding conditions. Thus, strong influence of 
  <span class="italic">s</span> on selection is also predicted by large population size (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>F–J).

   <p>Selective and demographic responses to changed seasonal environments. The figure shows effects of shifts in the timing of the resource peak (
    <span class="italic">r</span>, purple), in the onset of spring (
    <span class="italic">s</span>, blue) and joint shifts in both these components of the seasonal environment (
    <span class="italic">s</span> and 
    <span class="italic">r</span>, green). The top row of panels (
    <span class="bold">A</span>–
    <span class="bold">E</span>) shows how selection gradients (from Equation 12) changes due to these environmental changes. Note that the selection gradient is equal to zero for the ESS prior to change. The middle row of panels (
    <span class="bold">F</span>–
    <span class="bold">J</span>) shows the relative population change, defined as 
    <span class="italic">n</span>
    <sub>2</sub>
    <span class="sup">*</span>/
    <span class="italic">n</span>
    <sub>1</sub>
    <span class="sup">*</span> where

    <sub>1</sub>
    <span class="sup">*</span> and 
    <span class="italic">n</span>
    <sub>2</sub>
    <span class="sup">*</span> denote the equilibrium density before and after the change, respectively. The bottom row of panels (
    <span class="bold">K</span>–
    <span class="bold">O</span>) shows the relative change in population structure, defined as 
    <span class="italic">f</span>
    <sub>2</sub>/
    <span class="italic">f</span>
    <sub>1</sub> where 
    <span class="italic">f</span>
    <sub>1</sub> and 
    <span class="italic">f</span>
    <sub>2</sub> is the fraction of young at equilibrium before and after change, respectively. Absence of effect corresponds to selection gradients equal to zero, and the relative changes in population density and population structure equal to one. In cases where population density is zero after the change, the lines in corresponding panels are discontinued. The parameters 
    <span class="italic">s</span> and 
    <span class="italic">r</span> were reduced with 0.5 units in the scenarios in which they changed. Parameter values are otherwise as in 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>, and with the vertical solid line indicating the same parameter values across panels.
