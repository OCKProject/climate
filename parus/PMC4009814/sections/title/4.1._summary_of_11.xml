 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our eco-evolutionary approach to studying phenological adaptation in migratory birds contributes with several new insights into how demographic changes relate to phenological shifts in migratory birds. To start with, our analysis allows for a comparison of the effects of advanced onset of spring (decreased 
  <span class="italic">s</span>) and advanced food peak (decreased 
  <span class="italic">r</span>) on total population density. Since advanced onset of spring alone increases pre-breeding survival and advanced food peak reduces reproductive success, the two types of environmental change have opposing effects on population density. When both changes occur in parallel, e.g., reflecting even temperature changes over the season, the net population trend can thus be hard to predict. The model shows, however, that the historical baseline influences which of the two factors has the largest influence. Thus, when the ESS timing of arrival time is early, e.g., due to strong territory competition, the positive effects of improved pre-breeding conditions are strong and we get a net population increase. When the ESS arrival time is late, the negative effects of reduced reproduction are stronger and we get a net population decline.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many cases, our model predicts weak effects of a changed resource peak on population trends (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>F–J). This observation seems to go counter the emphasis on changed resource peaks to explain population trends in migratory birds [
  <a rid="B6-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-biology-01-00639">6</a>]. On the other hand, we can also see from our results that, whereas the positive effects of an advanced onset of spring in our model only increases population densities a little, a changed resource peak can cause strong decreases in population size and even extinctions. In this way, our model support concerns that mismatched reproduction can indeed have serious consequences for populations of bird species. Our model moreover suggests indicators for situations where shifts in the food distribution are expected to have strong negative effects on populations, e.g., low winter survival (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>G), low productivity (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>H), and slow improvement of pre-breeding conditions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>J).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another interesting result is that the fraction of young decreases both when the resource peak advances and when the onset of spring advances. This result is not surprising when one considers the fact that this measure does not inform on the absolute numbers of young: increased reproductive mismatch (decreased 
  <span class="italic">r</span>) reduces the number of young recruited into the population and improved survival due to earlier onset of spring (decreased 
  <span class="italic">s</span>) increases the proportion of adults. On the other hand, this result shows that relating phenological shifts solely to food resource peaks can be misleading when interpreting associated demographic responses [
  <a rid="B9-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-biology-01-00639">9</a>]. Under the assumption that phenological shifts mostly affect demography via reproduction, a reduced fraction of young in a population would be interpreted as a sign of trophic mismatch, whereas in the light of our study, it could well be due to improved pre-breeding conditions. In many cases, our model also predicts a relatively small effect of an advancing food peak on population structure (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>K–O), which reduces the scope for explaining changed population structure with shifts in food resource peaks even further. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When it comes to evolutionary responses to climate change, our analysis highlights the role of pre-breeding survival for phenological adaptation in migratory birds. As it turns out, the survival costs not only modulate responses to changed food peaks, as shown by Jonzén 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="B20-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-biology-01-00639">20</a>], but also act as a key factor for selection on arrival dates on its own. In many cases there is almost no selective response to changes in the resource peak (
  <span class="italic">r</span>), but there are always selective responses when the onset of spring (
  <span class="italic">s</span>) changes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>A–E). According to our model, adaptive changes in arrival times are more likely to be associated with changes in pre-breeding conditions rather than with changes in food peaks.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the predecessors [
  <a rid="B20-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-biology-01-00639">20</a>,
  <a rid="B21-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-biology-01-00639">21</a>,
  <a rid="B22-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-biology-01-00639">22</a>] of the model developed here, competitive pressure was treated as a parameter. In the present model, competitive pressure instead depends on the underlying ecology in the model and the strategies employed by the population. We have thereby closed the eco-evolutionary feedback loop. A first insight from this more complete treatment is that parameters that affect the equilibrium population density, such as winter survival and productivity, by adjusting the competitive pressure, also affect the evolutionarily stable timing of arrival (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>B,C). We have also shown that advancing the resource peak can favour later arrival dates under the influence of eco-evolutionary feedbacks (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>D). This example of selection counter the direction of environmental change underscores the fact that competitive interaction can affect phenological adaptation in non-intuitive ways and contributes a new adaptive mechanism to explain variation in phenological trends.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The enhanced realism in the model analysed here also allows a closer connection to empirical observations, compared to previous models of this kind. Below we compare our model predictions with phenological responses in the Pied flycatcher. Thereafter we discuss different possibilities to further explore this eco-evolutionary approach to studying phenological adaptation in a changing climate.</p>
