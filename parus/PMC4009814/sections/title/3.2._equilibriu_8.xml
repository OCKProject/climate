 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The population grows when spring advances and declines when the food resource peak advances in all scenarios (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>F–J). The effect of changed resource peak is very small for many parameter settings investigated (purple lines are close to 1 in large parts of 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>F–J), however. In these cases, the model predicts a net increase when both factors advance, indicating that the positive effects on population density from the advanced spring overrides the small negative effects of an advanced food peak. More precisely, this occurs when the baseline ESS mean arrival time is early, which, as discussed above, is in turn predicted by large population densities. In cases where changes in 
  <span class="italic">r</span> have the larger effect, namely at low population densities in the baseline (cf. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>F–J), the changes in 
  <span class="italic">r</span> can be very strong however, and lead to strong reductions or even extinctions of the population (
