   <a rid="B21-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-biology-01-00639">21</a>], the matching between timing of reproduction and the temporal food abundance distribution is not modelled explicitly. Instead we assume that early arriving individuals can access and use these food resources for a longer period of time compared to later arriving individuals, and thereby obtain a higher reproductive output. With a sufficiently early arrival date, we assume individuals have full access to the food resources and with a sufficiently late arrival date we assume reproductive failure due to lack of food resources. In line with these assumptions we model the expected reproductive success 
   <span class="italic">R</span> of an individual as a decreasing, logistic function of arrival date (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assume that the population is in a state of ecological and evolutionary (ESS) equilibrium before the environmental change takes place. This equilibrium can thus be interpreted as an historical baseline [
   <a rid="B22-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-biology-01-00639">22</a>]. The purpose of this section is to characterise how this historical baseline depends on model parameters, and thereby to provide the necessary background for understanding the effects of environmental changes described in the result section. The ESS mean arrival time predicted by the model depends on different environmental parameters in broad agreement with previous models [
   <a rid="B20-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-biology-01-00639">20</a>,
   <a rid="B21-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-biology-01-00639">21</a>,
   <a rid="B22-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-biology-01-00639">22</a>]. Timing of arrival is early when spring starts early since that allows the territory game to take place early in the season (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>A). Winter survival and productivity on the breeding grounds increase competition which in turn favours early arrival (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>B,C). Broadening the resource peak (increasing 
   <span class="italic">σ
    <sub>R</sub>
   </span>) causes the ESS timing of arrival to be slightly later (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>D). This pattern can be due to better reproductive conditions for late arriving individuals, as explained by Jonzén 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
   <a rid="B20-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-biology-01-00639">20</a>]. With the parameter settings here, however, individuals arrive before 
   <span class="italic">r</span> (mean timing of arrival is around 0 and 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 1 in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>D), and thus a broader resource peak means fewer resources for reproduction and a lower population size (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f001" href="#biology-01-00639-f001">Figure 1</a>A, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>I). Hence, here the later ESS timing of arrival is due to reduced competition. With a slower improvement of pre-breeding survival (increased 
   <span class="italic">σ
    <sub>S</sub>
   </span>) we also get a later ESS (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>D). This is also an effect of lower competition, due to reduced survival and thereby lower population densities (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>J), since mean timing of arrival occurs after the inflection point 
   <span class="italic">s</span> (note that 
   <span class="italic">s</span> = −1 in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>E, cf. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f001" href="#biology-01-00639-f001">Figure 1</a>B). It should be noted that the shape of the pre-breeding survival curve can affect the relationship between the ESS arrival time and the width of the food distribution, which may have a maximum or a minimum (see [
   <a rid="B20-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-biology-01-00639">20</a>] for details). 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Equilibrium population densities and equilibrium age structure in ESS situations follow in a straightforward manner from the underlying biology. Population density increases with earlier spring (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>F), since survival 
   <span class="italic">S</span> increases, at least slightly, for any given arrival date. Population density also increases with winter survival (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>G) and with productivity (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>H). Population density decreases with width of the food distribution (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>I) and with slower rate of improvement of pre-breeding survival (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>J), since individuals arrive before 
   <span class="italic">r</span> and after 
   <span class="italic">s</span>, as mentioned above. Age structure at ESS is only marginally affected by earlier onset of spring (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>K). This may seem a bit surprising since, at least in the short run, earlier spring favours adult survival, and therefore can be expected to change the age structure. The ESS timing of arrival occurs earlier in the year, however (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f001" href="#biology-01-00639-f001">Figure 1</a>A), which in turn counteracts that effect. Age structure is affected by winter survival and productivity on the other hand. When winter survival increases (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>L) the proportion of adults increases which causes the fraction of young to decrease. In contrast, when productivity increases, the fraction of young increases (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>M) due to an increase in per capita reproduction so that more young are recruited into the population. Broadening the resource peak causes a (weak) decline in fraction of young (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>N), due to the reduction in reproductive success as described above. With a slower rate of improvement of pre-breeding survival the fraction of young decreases however (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>O), due to the reduced survival of adults as described above.
