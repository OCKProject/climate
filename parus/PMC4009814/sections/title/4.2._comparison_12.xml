 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A general result from our study is that ecological differences can cause variation in adaptive phenological responses to climate change. Naturally, species-specific properties will give rise to a certain amount of variation in phenology. Therefore, to reduce confounding factors, our hypotheses should be compared to phenological responses within a single species. Interestingly, breeding populations of pied flycatchers, 
  <span class="italic">Ficedula hypoleuca</span>, have shown markedly different responses to environmental change across Western Europe [
  <a rid="B33-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-biology-01-00639">33</a>]. The pied flycatcher is a long-distance migrant that breeds in Eurasia in summer and overwinters in Africa, south of the Sahara desert [
  <a rid="B34-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-biology-01-00639">34</a>,
  <a rid="B35-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-biology-01-00639">35</a>]. In The Netherlands, population numbers have declined in areas where a large mismatch exists between the timing of egg-laying and peak in food availability [
  <a rid="B36-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-biology-01-00639">36</a>]. The timing of arrival did not change but the laying date has advanced. However, this change has been insufficient to avoid demographic consequences, as shown by declined population numbers [
  <a rid="B5-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-biology-01-00639">5</a>]. Pied flycatchers in Britain also show large declines in population numbers. A study by Goodenough 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="B12-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-biology-01-00639">12</a>] suggested, however, that only part of this decline can be explained by reduced breeding performance. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a study on Pied flycatchers in Finland it was found that laying date was delayed in comparison to measures of spring phenology [
  <a rid="B37-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-biology-01-00639">37</a>]. Judging from these trends, and the fact that clutch sizes also decreased, Laaksonen 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="B37-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-biology-01-00639">37</a>] speculate that some trophic mismatch has occurred. The density of breeding pairs showed a quadratic trend over the study period, however, with a minimum for intermediate years [
  <a rid="B38-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-biology-01-00639">38</a>]. Thus, the increased mismatch has been accompanied by an increase of the population towards the end of the study period.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A first observation we can do from these studies is that the mismatch between laying date and resource food peak alone does not predict trends in population change. This is in line with a general result of our study that the effect of changed food peak date on population densities may vary significantly depending on the historical baseline and on changes in other environmental variables (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of the differences between these responses can also be related to factors that influence demographic responses in our model. For the British population, for example, there is a relatively long time interval between arrival and breeding (around 30 days [
  <a rid="B39-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-biology-01-00639">39</a>]). In relation to our model, this could be interpreted as an historical adaptation to a relative large difference between 
  <span class="italic">s</span> and 
  <span class="italic">r</span>. Under these circumstances, our model predicts a relatively small effect of a changed resource peak on population density (low value of 
  <span class="italic">s</span> in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>F). In the Dutch population in contrast, there is a short time interval between arrival and breeding (around 10 days [
  <a rid="B5-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-biology-01-00639">5</a>]). This is a situation where the model predicts a relatively strong effect (high value of 
  <span class="italic">s</span> in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>F). In this way, the model predictions are in agreement with population decline, depending little on resource peak changes in Britain and depending more on resource peak changes in The Netherlands, as suggested by these studies. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is also interesting to note that one factor that explained the decline in the British population [
  <a rid="B12-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-biology-01-00639">12</a>] was Winter NAO index, which, as suggested by the authors, is likely to influence food availability on the wintering grounds and during migration. This could be interpreted as reduced winter survival or reduced productivity, which in our model also can explain reduced population density (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>G,H).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For early arriving individuals in the Finnish population, reproductive mismatch and increased population density seems to have occurred simultaneously. This may seem strange, but interestingly, temperatures during the early part of their migration have increased as well [
  <a rid="B39-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-biology-01-00639">39</a>], which could be interpreted as reduced survival cost for early arrival, 
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, earlier 
  <span class="italic">s</span> in our model. If the majority of this population arrives early, then this change can indeed explain increased population density in our model (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>Fâ€“J), even when trophic mismatch via advanced food peak occurs simultaneously (advanced 
  <span class="italic">r</span>). In this population, there was also a change in the arrival date for early migrants [
  <a rid="B39-biology-01-00639" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-biology-01-00639">39</a>], which is adaptive according to our model when 
  <span class="italic">s</span> decreases (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f003" href="#biology-01-00639-f003">Figure 3</a>A) and is in line with long term increase of population density as well (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>F).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In sum, we find that a number of observations from these systems are in line with predictions from the model. These comparisons also serve as an illustration for the motivation of our study; namely the need to take the whole life history and a broad set of factors into account when predicting demographic changes involved in phenological shifts in migratory birds.</p>
