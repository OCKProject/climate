  <p>Reproductive output and survival as functions of arrival date. Reproductive output 
   <span class="italic">R</span> is assumed to decrease with arrival date since late arrival implies late breeding in relation to the food peak date. (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) A narrow food abundance distribution gives a sudden reduction (A, solid, blue line) in reproductive output whereas a broad food abundance gives a more gradual reduction (A, dashed, blue line). Survival 
   <span class="italic">S</span> increases with arrival date due to improved environmental conditions (
   <span class="bold">B</span>). The half saturation points, interpreted as food peak date (
   <span class="italic">r</span>) and onset of spring (
   <span class="italic">s</span>), respectively, are marked with solid circles. The rate of improvement may be fast (B, solid, pink line) or slow (B, dashed, pink line). Parameters: 
   <span class="italic">s</span> = −1, 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 1, 
   <span class="italic">S</span>
   <sub>0</sub> = 1, 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <sub>0</sub> = 1; for solid lines 
   <span class="italic">σ
    <sub>R</sub>
   </span> = 0.1 and 
   <span class="italic">σ
    <sub>S</sub>
   </span> = 0.4; for dashed lines 
   <span class="italic">σ
    <sub>R</sub>
   </span> = 0.4 and 
   <span class="italic">σ
    <sub>S</sub>
