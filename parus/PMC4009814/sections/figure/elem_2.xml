 <div class="caption">
  <p>Selective and demographic responses to changed seasonal environments. The figure shows effects of shifts in the timing of the resource peak (
   <span class="italic">r</span>, purple), in the onset of spring (
   <span class="italic">s</span>, blue) and joint shifts in both these components of the seasonal environment (
   <span class="italic">s</span> and 
   <span class="italic">r</span>, green). The top row of panels (
   <span class="bold">A</span>–
   <span class="bold">E</span>) shows how selection gradients (from Equation 12) changes due to these environmental changes. Note that the selection gradient is equal to zero for the ESS prior to change. The middle row of panels (
   <span class="bold">F</span>–
   <span class="bold">J</span>) shows the relative population change, defined as 
   <span class="italic">n</span>
   <sub>2</sub>
   <span class="sup">*</span>/
   <span class="italic">n</span>
   <sub>1</sub>
   <span class="sup">*</span> where 
   <span class="italic">n</span>
   <sub>1</sub>
   <span class="sup">*</span> and 
   <span class="italic">n</span>
   <sub>2</sub>
   <span class="sup">*</span> denote the equilibrium density before and after the change, respectively. The bottom row of panels (
   <span class="bold">K</span>–
   <span class="bold">O</span>) shows the relative change in population structure, defined as 
   <span class="italic">f</span>
   <sub>2</sub>/
   <span class="italic">f</span>
   <sub>1</sub> where 
   <span class="italic">f</span>
   <sub>1</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">f</span>
   <sub>2</sub> is the fraction of young at equilibrium before and after change, respectively. Absence of effect corresponds to selection gradients equal to zero, and the relative changes in population density and population structure equal to one. In cases where population density is zero after the change, the lines in corresponding panels are discontinued. The parameters 
   <span class="italic">s</span> and 
   <span class="italic">r</span> were reduced with 0.5 units in the scenarios in which they changed. Parameter values are otherwise as in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="biology-01-00639-f002" href="#biology-01-00639-f002">Figure 2</a>, and with the vertical solid line indicating the same parameter values across panels.
