 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pygmy rabbits at our study site often were exposed to thermal conditions outside of their TNZ, but we documented seasonal differences in the relationship between temperature and energy expenditure suggesting that rabbits acclimatized to prevailing thermal conditions. Availability of diverse thermal microsites likely reduced the energy costs of thermoregulation, and burrows provided refuge from extreme, above-ground temperatures during both seasons. This buffering was especially important during winter, when both 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>e</sub> and burrow temperatures were below the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>lc</sub>, but the estimated cost of thermoregulation in burrows was lower than above ground. Availability of sheltered microsites above ground during summer resulted in relatively short periods when 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>e</sub> &gt; 35 °C across the landscape, reducing the energetic advantages to using a burrow during that season. This work supports the notion that selective use of burrows can be an effective strategy for mitigating the thermoregulatory costs of inhabiting a strongly seasonal environment.

Notably, we observed identical values of thermal conductance in winter-acclimatized pygmy rabbits as those reported by 
  <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Katzner, Parker &amp; Harlow (1997)</a>. Collectively, these results suggest that pygmy rabbits possess important physiological adaptations that allow them to persist in unfavorable winter climates.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The RMR

  <sub>T</sub> might differ from those documented by 
  <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Katzner, Parker &amp; Harlow (1997)</a> because of differences in body size between our studies (our animals were slightly larger), differences in husbandry, acclimatization to different environmental conditions (summer versus winter), or population-level differences in RMR

  <a rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-72">Swanson, 1991</a>). Use of thermal refuges has an important influence on thermal physiology (
  <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Jackson et al., 2002</a>). Indeed, 
  <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">Jackson, Bennett &amp; Spinks (2004)</a> documented similar thermophysiological characteristics (RMR
  <sub>T</sub>, 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>lc</sub>, and 
  <span class="italic">C</span>) among species of Otomyinae across a mesic-arid gradient, and suggested that these properties reflected similar refuge strategies rather than prevailing environmental conditions. The ability of pygmy rabbits to use burrows may contribute to seasonal constancy of 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>lc</sub> and RMR
  <sub>T</sub> by allowing the animal to use behavioral means of increasing thermal resistance rather than physiological acclimatization alone. Exploring relationships between the use of thermal refuges and seasonal morphological and physiological acclimatization in pygmy rabbits remains a fruitful area for future research.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our data showed that burrows provide important thermal refuge for pygmy rabbits during winter by reducing the energetic costs of thermoregulation relative to above-ground microsites. Winter temperatures at our study site rarely warmed to the TNZ of pygmy rabbits in either microhabitat, but burrows provided buffered microclimates and imposed lower thermoregulatory costs than above-ground rest sites for more than 50% of the monitoring period. Our observations of the role of the burrow as thermal refuge are consistent with the behavior of pygmy rabbits during winter. 
  <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Lee et al. (2010)</a> documented rabbits near burrow openings more frequently during winter than during summer or autumn. 
  <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Milling et al. (2017)</a> noted reductions in winter activity levels with cold temperatures during the night and early morning, and proximity of a burrow was the dominant factor in rest site selection by pygmy rabbits during winter, but not summer. Although proximity to refuge might reflect a heightened perception of predation risk (
  <a rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-16">Crowell et al., 2016</a>), our results suggested that thermal risk might also account for these behaviors during winter.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Burrows do not seem to be as critical for thermal refuge for pygmy rabbits during summer. In fact, we predicted similar thermoregulatory costs in both above- and below-ground rest sites. Although average 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>e</sub> at the study site was typically above estimated 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>uc</sub> for several hours daily, 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>e</sub> at some above-ground microsites was considerably lower and within the TNZ throughout the day because of the shade provided by dense overhead canopy. Shaded microsites and cool soil would negate the need to seek thermal refuge inside a burrow for an animal at rest. During the brief periods when above-ground temperatures exceeded the TNZ, the cost of cooling in the sheltered locations was predicted to be lower than the cost of warming inside the burrow at the same time because the difference in temperature between the burrow and 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>lc</sub> was greater than that between the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>uc</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>e</sub>. Piute ground squirrels (
  <span class="italic">Spermophilus mollis</span>) relied on burrows less in sagebrush steppe than in grassland habitats because the structural complexity of sagebrush offered more thermal heterogeneity and suitable microclimates: instead of using burrows for cooling, ground squirrels stretched out on the ground in the shade (
  <a rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-66">Sharpe &amp; Van Horne, 1999</a>). We observed similar behavior by free-ranging pygmy rabbits: animals were repeatedly found resting in shallow depressions in the soil (i.e., forms) in the shade, presumably as a behavioral thermoregulation strategy (
  <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Milling et al., 2017</a>). Alternatively, burrows may be an important resource for “shuttling” thermoregulation (i.e., moving between patches of optimal and sub-optimal thermal conditions to exploit different resources) that behaviorally ameliorates energy and water costs during periods of very high temperatures (
  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Chappell &amp; Bartholomew, 1981</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-74">Vispo &amp; Bakken, 1993</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">Hainsworth, 1995</a>). The energetic advantages of such fine-scale behavior cannot be quantified in the present study but remains a compelling hypothesis for future investigation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Actual energy expenditure during both seasons likely differs from our estimates in several ways. We suspect that our estimate of thermoregulatory savings from burrow use during winter is conservative because 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>e</sub> does not incorporate wind-induced reductions in thermal resistance that can greatly increase heat loss (i.e., “wind chill factors”; 
  <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">Bakken, 1980</a>). 
  <a rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-62">Rogowitz &amp; Gessaman (1990)</a> documented an interactive effect between wind and temperature on metabolic rate of white-tailed jackrabbits (
  <span class="italic">Lepus townsendii</span>) during the winter, such that exposure to wind radically elevated metabolic rate at low temperatures. Thus, the thermoregulatory cost savings of using a burrow as a thermal refuge during the winter is potentially larger than our model predicts. Even given the uncertainty associated with the propagation of model error on thermoregulatory costs in each of the microhabitats, we believe that our results represent the relative utility of the burrow as a thermal refuge when above-ground climatic conditions are inhospitable. During the summer, the lowest 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>e</sub> values on our study site occurred during the night and early morning and were colder than the burrow and below the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>lc</sub>. Pygmy rabbits are active through the night and crepuscular periods during the summer (
  <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Milling et al., 2017</a>) and are likely capable of substituting some heat produced during locomotion (exercise thermogenesis) for regulatory heat production (
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Humphries &amp; Careau, 2011</a>). Our estimates of energy expenditure are for resting animals, but heat generated during activity might explain why extensive overnight use of burrows during summer has not been observed (
  <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Lee et al., 2010</a>). Similarly, our estimates of energy expenditure in above-ground rest sites are likely conservative. The relationship between energy expenditure and temperature above the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>uc</sub> can be steeper than the relationship below the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>lc</sub> because the process of evaporative cooling itself produces heat (
  <a rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-33">Humphries &amp; Umbanhowar, 2007</a>). Because we were not able to measure RMR above the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>uc</sub>, the true thermoregulatory costs associated with resting above ground at high 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>e</sub> could include an unknown increment of metabolic rate from active evaporative cooling (panting, salivation, etc.). Furthermore, our estimates of energy expenditure do not address evaporative water loss, which is likely also an important factor in the thermal physiology and overall fitness of this species. Nonetheless, because pygmy rabbits demonstrated a high capacity for behavioral thermoregulation (
  <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Milling et al., 2017</a>), the burrow likely did not confer considerable thermoregulatory cost savings over selection of thermally suitable above-ground rest sites.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Burrow use also is influenced by other factors besides behavioral thermoregulation including reproduction and predator avoidance (
  <a rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-60">Rachlow, Sanchez &amp; Estes-Zumpf, 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">Elias et al., 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Camp et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, co-occurring species, such as ground squirrels, weasels, other leporids, reptiles and invertebrates use pygmy rabbit burrows (
  <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Green &amp; Flinders, 1980</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Lee et al., 2010</a>), and it is unclear how these interactions might influence burrow use by pygmy rabbits. Some predators on our study site, such as badgers (
  <span class="italic">Taxidea taxus</span>) and long-tailed weasels (
  <span class="italic">Mustela frenata</span>), are capable of retrieving a pygmy rabbit from a burrow system (
  <a rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-51">Oliver, 2004</a>), and vigilance and detection would be impaired for an animal at rest in a burrow. Our estimation of the thermoregulatory costs associated with resting above and below ground do not allow us to explicitly test hypotheses regarding the specific circumstances under which pygmy rabbits would use burrow systems, but they do provide compelling support for the functional role of a burrow as thermal refuge for the species and how that role might change between seasons.
