 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In mid- and high-latitudes, the thermal environment can vary substantially across spatial and temporal scales, such that ambient conditions can be energetically challenging for animals. For example, black-capped chickadees (
  <span class="italic">Parus atricapillus;</span>
  <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Cooper &amp; Swanson, 1994</a>), least weasels (
  <span class="italic">Mustela nivalis;</span>
  <a rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-9">Casey &amp; Casey, 1979</a>), and red squirrels (
  <span class="italic">Tamiasciurus hudsonicus;</span>
  <a rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-34">Irving, Krog &amp; Monson, 1955</a>) are north temperate endotherms that experience thermal conditions that can impose high thermoregulatory costs during winter. Adaptations to seasonal climate extremes include hibernation or torpor (
  <a rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-22">Geiser &amp; Ruf, 1995</a>), physiological acclimatization (i.e., seasonal changes in insulation or temperature-dependent energy expenditure;

  <a rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-67">Sheriff et al., 2009</a>), and behavioral thermoregulation (i.e., temperature-dependent selection of habitats or use of thermal refuges; 
  <a rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-66">Sharpe &amp; Van Horne, 1999</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-75">Walsberg, 2000</a>). For small endotherms that do not migrate or hibernate, winter can be especially challenging because scarce food resources might not compensate for the increased energy demands of thermoregulation. Thus, changes in space use in response to the thermal environment may allow animals to persist in habitats with unfavorable thermal conditions while minimizing energy expenditure (

  <a rid="ref-81" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-81">Williams, Tieleman &amp; Shobrak, 1999</a>). For many small endotherms, burrows provide thermal refuge critical for maintaining homeothermy and reducing thermoregulatory costs during periods of extreme cold (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An understanding of the relationship between temperature and physiology, and how that relationship changes seasonally, can help define the thermal roles of habitat features such as burrows. For endotherms, the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) is the range of ambient temperatures over which an animal can maintain body temperature (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>b</sub>) through changes in posture, fur or feather orientation, and blood flow at the periphery (
  <a rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-49">McNab, 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-41">Lighton, 2008</a>) without changes in metabolic rate. The TNZ is bounded on the warm end by the upper critical temperature (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>uc</sub>) and on the cool end by the lower critical temperature (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>lc</sub>). As ambient temperature increases above the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>uc</sub>, resting metabolic rate (RMR) increases due to evaporative cooling (i.e., sweating or panting), and as temperature decreases below the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>lc</sub>, RMR increases to maintain 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>b</sub> (
  <a rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-49">McNab, 2002</a>). Energy expenditure within the TNZ is known as thermoneutral or minimal resting metabolic rate (RMR
  <sub>T</sub>) if the animal is inactive. The energetic costs of thermoregulation over the range of temperatures animals experience in their environment can be estimated using data on the TNZ, the RMR
  <sub>T</sub>, and the relationship between RMR and temperatures below the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>lc</sub> and above the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonal physiological acclimatization allows endotherms to reduce thermoregulatory costs imposed by seasonally variable climates. Increased insulation from fat or pelage can reduce the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>lc</sub> in winter relative to summer and lessen the effect of temperature on RMR below the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>lc</sub> (
  <a rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-61">Rogowitz, 1990</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-30">Holloway &amp; Geiser, 2001</a>), resulting in improved energy conservation at cold temperatures. For example, winter-acclimatized snowshoe hares had denser and longer fur, which contributed to a lower 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>lc</sub> and thermal conductance, and helped reduce thermoregulatory costs at a time when food quantity and quality were low (
  <a rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-67">Sheriff et al., 2009</a>). A lower RMR
  <sub>T</sub> in cold-acclimatized animals also would be adaptive in environments where food resources are limited (

  <a rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-67">Sheriff et al., 2009</a>), and a lower RMR
  <sub>T</sub> in summer-acclimatized animals would be advantageous for conserving energy and water and minimizing heat production in hot desert environments (
  <a rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-28">Hinds, 1973</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">Lovegrove, 1987</a>). Some hot-acclimatized endotherms are able to elevate their

  <a rid="ref-83" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-83">Zervanos, 1975</a>), which allows them to maintain homeothermy at higher temperatures without having to rely on evaporative cooling. Thermoregulatory costs can dominate the energy budgets of small mammals in strongly seasonal environments (
  <a rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-70">Speakman, 1997</a>), and seasonal acclimatization strategies and selective use of microhabitats can help reduce the energetic requirements. The costs of thermoregulating in different habitats can affect fitness either incrementally (e.g., by influencing resource acquisition behaviors) or absolutely (e.g., by increasing risk of predation;

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our goal was to understand how a small endotherm, the pygmy rabbit (
  <span class="italic">Brachylagus idahoensis</span>), uses the refuge of a burrow to address thermal challenges in a strongly seasonal environment. Pygmy rabbits are endemic to the arid sagebrush habitats in the Intermountain West (
  <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Green &amp; Flinders, 1980</a>), which is characterized by extreme diurnal and seasonal fluctuations in temperature (
  <a rid="ref-82" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-82">Wise, 2012</a>). Winter temperatures can be as low as −40 °C, and summer temperatures can reach 45 °C (
  <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">Knapp, 1997</a>). Their small size (400–500 g) and high surface area to volume ratio should engender high costs of regulatory heat production in typical winter temperatures, however, because their winter diet can be comprised nearly entirely of sagebrush (
  <a rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-68">Shipley et al., 2006</a>), they are not confronted with the challenge of food scarcity over winter. Furthermore, pygmy rabbits do not hibernate or huddle and leporids in general do not have high levels of body fat for insulation or energy reserves (
  <a rid="ref-79" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-79">Whittaker &amp; Thomas, 1983</a>). Nevertheless, pygmy rabbits can be active at all times of the day throughout the year (
  <a rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-39">Larrucea &amp; Brussard, 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Lee et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Milling et al., 2017</a>). Unlike most lagomorphs in North America, pygmy rabbits are obligate burrowers, and the ameliorated temperatures within burrows likely provide refuge from above-ground thermal conditions (
  <a rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-55">Pike &amp; Mitchell, 2013</a>). However, burrow use by pygmy rabbits is highly variable among seasons (
  <a rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-39">Larrucea &amp; Brussard, 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Lee et al., 2010</a>) and individuals (C. R. Milling, 2015, unpublished data), and may be influenced by a number of other factors including reproductive status and perception of predation risk (
  <a rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-60">Rachlow, Sanchez &amp; Estes-Zumpf, 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Camp et al., 2012</a>). These unique traits make pygmy rabbits a compelling model organism to evaluate the functional roles of burrows as thermal refuges during summer and winter.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the role of burrows for thermoregulation by pygmy rabbits, we had three objectives: (1) measure the relationship between temperature and oxygen consumption during summer and winter using indirect calorimetry; (2) measure the thermal environment within burrows and at above-ground rest sites near burrow systems known to be used by pygmy rabbits during summer and winter; and (3) combine these datasets to estimate the approximate thermoregulatory costs of resting in burrows and above-ground microsites during both seasons. We hypothesized that the relationship between energy expenditure and temperature would vary from summer to winter, reflecting seasonal physiological acclimatization (i.e., changes in insulation) to prevailing thermal conditions, such that thermoregulatory costs would be higher in summer than winter at temperatures below the TNZ. Because burrow use by pygmy rabbits is poorly understood and can be influenced by a variety of factors (e.g., predation risk, reproduction, and thermal constraints), we did not articulate specific hypotheses about how burrow use should differ with thermal conditions. Instead, we sought to quantify the costs associated with thermoregulating inside the burrow relative to above-ground rest sites in both seasons as a first step towards evaluating the costs and benefits of burrow use. However, we did expect that the burrow would serve as a thermal refuge for a greater proportion of time during winter than summer because temperatures can remain well below freezing for extended periods during the winter. We also expected that the thermoregulatory costs associated with resting in the burrow would be lower than above-ground rest sites overnight in winter and during mid-day in summer. Elucidating the role of burrows as thermal refuges for pygmy rabbits contributes to an understanding of the species’ thermal ecology and the functional role of habitat in mitigating physiologically stressful conditions.</p>
