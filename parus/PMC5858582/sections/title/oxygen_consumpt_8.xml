 <div class="title">Oxygen consumption by pygmy rabbits (
  <span class="italic">Brachylagus idahoensis</span>) at different temperatures during summer (open circles, dashed line) and winter (filled circles, solid line).

 <p>The line segments at temperatures below the breakpoint illustrate the relationship between oxygen consumption and temperature below the lower critical temperature, whereas the line segment above the breakpoint shows minimal resting metabolic rate in the thermoneutral zone of summer-acclimatized animals.</p>
