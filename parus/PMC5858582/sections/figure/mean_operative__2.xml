  <p>Temperature was measured during the (A) winter (20 January–19 February, 2015) and (B) summer (5 July–4 August, 2015) in east-central Idaho, USA. Mean temperatures above and below ground remained below the lower critical temperature (blue line) for the duration of winter monitoring. Mean above-ground 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>e</sub> often exceeded the estimated upper critical temperature (green line) and body temperature (orange line) of pygmy rabbits during summer, but there were typically above-ground rest sites available that were cooler than the mean (lowest hourly

   <sub>e</sub> measured by a single operative temperature model; dotted black line).
