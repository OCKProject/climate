During warmer trials (i.e., 25 and 30 °C), animals extended their bodies and assumed a sprawled posture, presumably to maximize contact with the chamber floor. This contrasted with the typical spherical posture during cooler trials. The mean values of thermal conductance for summer- and winter-acclimatized animals was 15.14 ± 1.35 mL O

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The burrow satisfied our definition of thermal refuge for a greater proportion of time during winter than summer. Burrows were thermal refuges on 30 of the 31 days that we monitored temperature during the winter, for an average of 13.4 h per day (sd = 5.5; 55.8% of a 24 h day). Burrows were generally warmer than 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>e</sub> during the overnight and early morning periods, whereas above-ground microsites were warmer than burrows from approximately 0900 to 1800 h. During summer, burrows were thermal refuges on 21 of 31 days for an average of 5.0 h per day (sd = 3.0; 20.6% of a 24 h day). Accounting for the lowest mean temperature measured by a single 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>e</sub> sensor in a given hour, the number of days in which 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>e</sub> exceeded 35 °C (the estimated

   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>e</sub> remained above 35 °C for 2.5 h per day (sd = 2.0; 10.4% of a 24 h day). High temperatures occurred during mid-day (1000–1700 h), likely as a result of solar radiation. During these periods, burrow temperatures averaged 17.7 °C (sd = 1.5) and were 22.5 °C cooler than
