 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained mass and fat measures on 134 adult female mule deer. Migration data were not obtained for all deer due to mortalities, collar failure, or because some deer were not collared during capture. Thus, our total sample for microsatellites analyses examining relationships with migration consisted of 104 and 95 deer for spring and fall migration, respectively. Our total sample for mtDNA analyses consisted of 65 and 59 deer for spring and fall migration, respectively. In addition, two deer did not leave summer range, while collars were still attached and thus were excluded from the fall migration analyses. During spring, deer initiated migration between April 11 and June 1 and terminated migration between April 19 and June 21. During the fall, deer initiated migration between October 4 and November 8 and terminated migration between October 6 and November 14.</p>
