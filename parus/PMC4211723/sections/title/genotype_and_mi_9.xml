 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 134 adult female deer were captured with 30 captured in the NM area, 30 in the NR area, 44 in the RG area, and 30 in the SM area (102 in December, and 79 in March, with 47 caught during both capture periods; see Appendix S5 for details). Deer ranged in age from yearlings to more than 11 years old, with a median age of 5.5 years old (See Appendix S5). All 134 deer were genotyped at 17 loci producing a data set that was 99% complete (data available from the Dryad Digital Repository: 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.3vc1b" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.3vc1b</span>). All markers were in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium, and there was no evidence of linkage (diversity statistics by loci are presented in Appendix S2). The 
  <span class="sc">structure</span>-based analysis of the microsatellites suggested a single, homogenous population was most likely (i.e., had the lowest likelihood score). Based on winter range, 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>IS</sub> values were as follows: NR = −0.05 (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.02), NM = −0.02 (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.16), RG = −0.03 (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.07), and SM = 0.01 (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.31). The 
  <span class="sc">mol_coan</span> analysis produced a matrix of pedigree-like coefficients for all individuals; we note the one suspected mother–daughter pairing had a coefficient of 0.50, suggesting the results were indeed reflective of pedigree data. We sequenced the mitochondrial control region in a subset of animals (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 81). For comparison with data from Latch et al. (
  <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">2009</a>), we parsed the data set down to 545 base pairs (GenBank submission KM061069–KM061151). Examining the mtDNA, 37 unique haplotypes were observed (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a>). The neighbor-joining and Bayesian phylogeny (based on a GTR + I + G substitution model) produced essentially the same topology (Appendix S4): a major split between two clades was highly supported, while a third, more tenuous clade was evident in the neighbor analysis with some support in the Bayesian analysis (posterior probability = 0.60). The three groupings are identified in the haplotype network (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a>).
