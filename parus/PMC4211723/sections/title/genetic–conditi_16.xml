 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fat is an important determinant of fitness for mule deer (Bender et al. 
  <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2007</a>; Johnstone-Yellin et al. 
  <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">2009</a>; Tollefson et al. 
  <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">2010</a>). We identified two genetic markers as having relationships with fat, although the relationships were antagonistic (i.e., one had a positive relationship with fat and the other negative). Similar results have been seen in studies of both the Kentish plover (
  <span class="italic">Charadrius alexandrinus</span> L.; Kupper et al. 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2010</a>) and the blue tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus caeruleus</span> L.; Olano-Marin et al. 
  <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">2011</a>). With the contrasting signals of the two markers, interpretations of what these relationships represent become muddled. Olano-Marin et al. (
  <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">2011</a>) viewed the negative correlation as evidence for direct effects of the neutral loci, with the positive correlation due to inbreeding. Inbreeding in our study area is not supported by the 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>IS</sub> values and difficult to imagine given the population size and deer ecology.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the evidence for a mixing of different mitochondrial lineages and effect sizes, the negative relationship to body fat of RT30 (0.99 probability and nearly double the effect size as all other loci) is the most likely to be genuine. However, given the concern over spurious HFCs, we must still consider the possibility of Type I errors (i.e., false positives). The potential for type I errors is of particular concern when detecting local effects and examining multiple models (Szulkin et al. 
  <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">2010</a>). In light of this concern, we highlight three points of support for the recorded relationship. First, the effect sizes of the significant coefficients were substantially greater than those of the other loci (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">3</a>). Second, we refit all models that had significant coefficients, but with a strong mean 0 multivariate normal prior on the coefficients. This approach shrinks all estimates toward 0, acting as a penalty and reducing the number of significant covariates (Gelman et al. 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2012</a>). In the case of the SLH – fat correlation, all significant results (probability of an effect &gt; 0.95) remained. Lastly, the proximity of a locus in question relative to genes of known effect can be taken as supportive evidence for understanding single-locus HFCs (Von Hardenberg et al. 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2007</a>; Kupper et al. 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2010</a>). Slate et al. (
  <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">2002</a>) observed considerable synteny in ruminants, and more than half of the microsatellites used in their deer linkage map had been used for the same purposes in cow and sheep. When we screened RT30 against the annotated cow genome (using 
  <span class="sc">blast</span>), both primers colocalized with 100% identity to a region with the closest known gene being that of TBC1D1. Interestingly, this gene regulates cell growth and differentiation and has been shown to influence fat metabolism in mice and humans (Stone et al. 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2006</a>; Chadt et al. 
  <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">2008</a>). Given the combination of divergent mtDNA lineages in our study area and panmixia (
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 1), a slight disruption of co-adapted alleles that are linked to fat metabolism could explain the negative correlation between this locus and fat (we emphasize these results represent a small effect as body fat was predicted to decrease body fat by &lt;0.2% in the model). This is predicted to outcome when locally adapted lineages mix, and it has been recently suggested for grizzly bears in an area where they are subject to large-scale human-assisted migration (Shafer et al. 
  <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the above lines of evidence offer support to the effect of RT30 on fat being genuine, given the small number of loci examined, we must remain skeptical about this relationship. Rather, we present these findings as noteworthy and in need of confirmation by studies with larger samples and with genomic methods.</p>
