  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We captured adult (&gt;1 year old) female mule deer using helicopter net gunning in four winter range study areas in the Piceance Basin of Northwestern Colorado (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>). Deer were captured in either December 2010 or March 2011. These dates were chosen because during December, deer have recently migrated from summer range and typically are in their best physical condition, while March represents the end of winter when deer typically are in their worst condition. Deer were transferred to processing sites where we weighed them using a portable scale, estimated body condition by palpating the rump (Cook et al. 
   <a rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13">2001</a>, 
   <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2007</a>, 
   <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2010</a>) and measured the thickness of their subcutaneous rump fat and longissimus dorsi muscle using a portable ultrasound (Stephenson et al. 
   <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">1998</a>, 
   <a rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" href="#b75">2002</a>; Cook et al. 
   <a rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13">2001</a>). The above measurements were used to calculate the percent ingesta-free body fat (hereafter fat) of each deer following Cook et al. (
   <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2010</a>). Deer were fit with store-on-board GPS radio collars (Advanced Telemetry Systems, Isanti MN, USA) set to attempt a relocation on one of three schedules (once every 5 h, once every 60 min, or once every 30 min – meaning the relocation schedules varied by individual). Blood samples were taken for genetic analysis, and DNA was extracted using the DNeasy™ Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microsatellite genotyping and DNA sequencing</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We amplified 17 microsatellite loci using a previously optimized multiplex reaction from Cullingham et al. (
   <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2011a</a>) and single PCRs. The mitochondrial control region was sequenced using both the primers from Latch et al. (
   <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">2009</a>) and LGL215 and ISM015 from Purdue et al. (
   <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">2006</a>). PCR conditions and basic population genetic analyses are available in Appendices S1 and S2.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the microsatellite data, we first used 
   <span class="sc">structure</span> 2.3.3 (Pritchard et al. 
   <a rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" href="#b61">2000</a>) to assess genetic structure (1 000 000 iterations with 25% removed as a burn-in repeated five times for each number of possible populations [
   <span class="italic">k</span>] ranging from 1 to 5). We assumed an admixed model with correlated allele frequencies (Falush et al. 
   <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">2003</a>) and used the LOCPRIOR parameter to allow location information to assist in the clustering. Next, we calculated overall MLH as the average of heterozygosity at each locus and SLH as binary variables indicating heterozygosity (1) or homozygosity (0) at each locus. Pairwise relatedness between all individuals was estimated with the Queller and Goodnight (QG) relationship coefficient using the software 
   <span class="sc">spagedi</span> v.1.3 (Hardy and Vekemans 
   <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2002</a>). We also constructed a coancestry matrix using the software 
   <span class="sc">mol_coan</span> v.3 (Fernandez and Toro 
   <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2006</a>). Here, a simulated annealing approach was used to create virtual common ancestors of the genotyped individuals, producing pedigree-like relationship coefficients. Model parameters consisted of 200 steps with 5000 solutions tested per step, an initial temperature of 0.01 and increase of 0.75. We simulated two previous generations, each consisting of 1000 males and 1000 females.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; conducted on a subset of individuals), we constructed a minimum-spanning tree among haplotypes using 
   <span class="sc">arlequin</span> v. 3.5.1.3 (Excoffier and Lischer 
   <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2010</a>) and edited it with 
   <span class="sc">hapstar</span> v0.7 (Teacher and Griffiths 
   <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">2011</a>). Neighbor-joining analysis using pairwise deletion and both 
   <span class="italic">P</span> and 
   <span class="italic">K2</span> distances was conducted using the software package 
   <span class="sc">mega</span> v.5 (Tamura et al. 
   <a rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" href="#b79">2011</a>). Bayesian analysis was conducted in 
   <span class="sc">mrbayes</span> v.3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 
   <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2001</a>) with a model of nucleotide substitution determined from 
   <span class="sc">modeltest</span> v.3.07 (Posada and Crandall 
   <a rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57">1998</a>). For the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, we used default priors with two independent runs of four chains (three heated) run for 10 000 000 generations, with the first 25% discarded as a burn-in. Confidence in topologies was evaluated based on 1000 bootstrap replicates (for the neighbor joining) or posterior distributions. All three methods were compared to identify common mitochondrial haplogroups.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic correlates to phenotypic traits</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both migration and body condition are phenotypic traits that are important to the fitness of mule deer. However, only condition can be thought of as a proxy for fitness. Thus, we used two separate analytical frameworks to examine genetic correlations with these traits. For migration, we examined the relationship between mitochondrial haplotypes and genetic differentiation to determine whether there was a genetic component to the timing of migration (an isolation-by-ecology analysis, 
   <span class="italic">sensu</span> Shafer and Wolf 
   <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">2013</a>). For body condition, a fitness proxy, we followed the general HFC framework discussed in Chapman et al. (
   <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2009</a>).
  </p>
  <sec class="sec">
   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic–migration correlates</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After GPS radio collars were recovered and data were downloaded, we calculated the initiation and termination dates of spring and fall migration (i.e., the dates at which deer started or finished their migration) in 
    <span class="sc">arcmap</span> 10.1 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA). Migration was demarcated as the time period during which deer travelled between their winter and summer home ranges. Home ranges were determined by outlining a minimum convex polygon around all locations that occurred prior to directed movement, without return, away from the summer or winter range areas.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first examined the relationship between mtDNA haplogroup (derived from haplotype and phylogenetic analyses) and the dates of spring and fall migrations. For this analysis, we corrected the Julian date of migration to the earliest date among all individuals. The resulting data represented a count of the number of days since the earliest arriving or leaving migrant had terminated or initiated their migration. These data were analyzed using negative binomial regression (see Appendix S3 for model formulation). We included covariates for the mtDNA haplogroup to which each deer was assigned (categorical) as well as a covariate for the age of the animal and binary covariates indicating winter range study area (i.e., three separate covariates indicating whether the deer was from a winter range study area [1] or not [0]). Before models were run, correlations among covariates were examined to assess collinearity (no predictors were correlated at |
    <span class="italic">r</span>| &gt; 0.7) and age was standardized 
    <div class="inline-formula">
     <span xlink:href="eva0007-0937-mu1.jpg" mimetype="image" class="inline-graphic" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
    </div>, a common procedure in regression to aid in interpretability of coefficient estimates (Gelman and Hill 
    <a rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27">2007</a>). We fitted all models under a Bayesian framework in JAGS (Plummer 
    <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2012</a>) and 
    <span class="sc">r</span>3.0.1 (R Core Team 
    <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2013</a>), using the ‘rjags’ package (Plummer 
    <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2013</a>). See Appendix S3 for specifics of model runs and assessment of convergence. To assess the fit of the models, we calculated residuals (observed – predicted values) and plotted them against the fitted values to examine any potential patterns in residuals.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Secondly, we examined correlations between genetic relatedness metrics and similarity in migration using Mantel tests. For this analysis, we calculated absolute pairwise distances (calculated in days) between each individual's migration termination or initiation dates leaving us with four matrices representing differences in migration timing for spring and fall. The relationships between relatedness indices (QG and coancestry) and migratory behavior (dates) were evaluated in 
    <span class="sc">r</span>3.0.1 (R Core Team 
    <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2013</a>) using Mantel tests (Mantel 
    <a rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" href="#b42">1967</a>) under 10 000 permutations as implemented by the Ecodist library (Goslee and Urban 
    <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2007</a>). Here, a comparison is made between relatedness and the difference in migration timing, and thus, a negative relationship is expected if there is a genetic signature – that is, more closely related individuals have more similar migration timing. To account for similarities among individuals inhabiting similar areas or grouping together, we ran two partial Mantel tests controlling for the distance between the centroids of individuals' winter range and summer range (Fig. 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>). Significance was assessed by examining 95% confidence intervals.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic–condition correlates</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We next examined whether there was a relationship between either MLH or SLH and condition metrics (mass and fat) using the HFC framework. We fit hierarchical (i.e., random effects) models in a Bayesian framework. The presence or the absence of a relationship was determined by examining the posterior probability distributions of each coefficient to determine the probability that either MLH or heterozygosity at any single locus was related to condition. In all models, we included covariates for either MLH or SLH, the age of the animal, a binary variable for if the data came from a March capture (both mass and fat are expected to be lower in March), and binary variables indicating which of the four winter range areas the deer was captured in (as in the migration analysis, above). We tested between models with solely a linear effect or a quadratic effect of age using the deviance information criteria (DIC; Spiegelhalter et al. 
    <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2002</a>; but with the effective number of parameters calculated as in Plummer 
    <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2012</a>). Identity disequilibrium among loci (i.e., covariance of heterozygosity among loci) was used to infer the validity of MLH correlation: Accordingly, we calculated 
    <span class="italic">g</span>
    <span class="sup">2</span>, where a value of zero means no variance in inbreeding (Szulkin et al. 
    <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">2010</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined the relationship between heterozygosity and mass or fat using linear regression and beta regression, respectively. Mass was natural log-transformed to ensure proper support (i.e., untransformed mass is strictly positive, while linear regression allows for negative values; log transformation addresses this issue), while beta regression was used because it is proper for dependent variables ranging between 0 and 1 as percent body fat does. Because there were multiple condition measures for certain deer (i.e., those captured in both March and December), for both analyses, we allowed the intercept to vary by individual, estimating a population-level intercept (i.e., we fit a random intercept by individual), with all other coefficient values fixed. See Appendix S3 for details of model parameters and convergence assessment. To assess the fit of the models, we calculated residuals (observed – predicted values) and plotted them against the fitted values to examine any potential patterns in residuals.</p>
