 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We amplified 17 microsatellite loci using a previously optimized multiplex reaction from Cullingham et al. (
  <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2011a</a>) and single PCRs. The mitochondrial control region was sequenced using both the primers from Latch et al. (
  <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">2009</a>) and LGL215 and ISM015 from Purdue et al. (
  <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">2006</a>). PCR conditions and basic population genetic analyses are available in Appendices S1 and S2.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the microsatellite data, we first used 
  <span class="sc">structure</span> 2.3.3 (Pritchard et al. 
  <a rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" href="#b61">2000</a>) to assess genetic structure (1 000 000 iterations with 25% removed as a burn-in repeated five times for each number of possible populations [
  <span class="italic">k</span>] ranging from 1 to 5). We assumed an admixed model with correlated allele frequencies (Falush et al. 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">2003</a>) and used the LOCPRIOR parameter to allow location information to assist in the clustering. Next, we calculated overall MLH as the average of heterozygosity at each locus and SLH as binary variables indicating heterozygosity (1) or homozygosity (0) at each locus. Pairwise relatedness between all individuals was estimated with the Queller and Goodnight (QG) relationship coefficient using the software 
  <span class="sc">spagedi</span> v.1.3 (Hardy and Vekemans 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2002</a>). We also constructed a coancestry matrix using the software 
  <span class="sc">mol_coan</span> v.3 (Fernandez and Toro 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2006</a>). Here, a simulated annealing approach was used to create virtual common ancestors of the genotyped individuals, producing pedigree-like relationship coefficients. Model parameters consisted of 200 steps with 5000 solutions tested per step, an initial temperature of 0.01 and increase of 0.75. We simulated two previous generations, each consisting of 1000 males and 1000 females.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; conducted on a subset of individuals), we constructed a minimum-spanning tree among haplotypes using 
  <span class="sc">arlequin</span> v. 3.5.1.3 (Excoffier and Lischer 
  <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2010</a>) and edited it with 
  <span class="sc">hapstar</span> v0.7 (Teacher and Griffiths 
  <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">2011</a>). Neighbor-joining analysis using pairwise deletion and both 
  <span class="italic">P</span> and 
  <span class="italic">K2</span> distances was conducted using the software package 
  <span class="sc">mega</span> v.5 (Tamura et al. 
  <a rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" href="#b79">2011</a>). Bayesian analysis was conducted in 
  <span class="sc">mrbayes</span> v.3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2001</a>) with a model of nucleotide substitution determined from 
  <span class="sc">modeltest</span> v.3.07 (Posada and Crandall 
  <a rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57">1998</a>). For the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, we used default priors with two independent runs of four chains (three heated) run for 10 000 000 generations, with the first 25% discarded as a burn-in. Confidence in topologies was evaluated based on 1000 bootstrap replicates (for the neighbor joining) or posterior distributions. All three methods were compared to identify common mitochondrial haplogroups.
