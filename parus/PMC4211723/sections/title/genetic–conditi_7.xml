 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We next examined whether there was a relationship between either MLH or SLH and condition metrics (mass and fat) using the HFC framework. We fit hierarchical (i.e., random effects) models in a Bayesian framework. The presence or the absence of a relationship was determined by examining the posterior probability distributions of each coefficient to determine the probability that either MLH or heterozygosity at any single locus was related to condition. In all models, we included covariates for either MLH or SLH, the age of the animal, a binary variable for if the data came from a March capture (both mass and fat are expected to be lower in March), and binary variables indicating which of the four winter range areas the deer was captured in (as in the migration analysis, above). We tested between models with solely a linear effect or a quadratic effect of age using the deviance information criteria (DIC; Spiegelhalter et al.

  <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2012</a>). Identity disequilibrium among loci (i.e., covariance of heterozygosity among loci) was used to infer the validity of MLH correlation: Accordingly, we calculated

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined the relationship between heterozygosity and mass or fat using linear regression and beta regression, respectively. Mass was natural log-transformed to ensure proper support (i.e., untransformed mass is strictly positive, while linear regression allows for negative values; log transformation addresses this issue), while beta regression was used because it is proper for dependent variables ranging between 0 and 1 as percent body fat does. Because there were multiple condition measures for certain deer (i.e., those captured in both March and December), for both analyses, we allowed the intercept to vary by individual, estimating a population-level intercept (i.e., we fit a random intercept by individual), with all other coefficient values fixed. See Appendix S3 for details of model parameters and convergence assessment. To assess the fit of the models, we calculated residuals (observed – predicted values) and plotted them against the fitted values to examine any potential patterns in residuals.</p>
