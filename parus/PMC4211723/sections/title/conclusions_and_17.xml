 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have shown fine-scale relationships between genetic variation and phenotypic traits in mule deer that have not been found in previous work on this species. Our study identified fine-scale genetic correlates to both migration timing and body fat that are likely overlooked (and probably unexpected) in this species. These results have potential management implications for mule deer, which are under substantial human pressure from a multitude of stressors (Sawyer et al. 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2006</a>). The genetic polymorphisms in this population that are linked to phenotypic traits related to phenology and metabolic variation could prove important in the face of climate change and other anthropogenic stressors that are likely to affect both optimal timing of migration and the role of fat stores in survival and reproduction. Monitoring hybridization with white-tailed deer should also be considered with respect to the mtDNA effect, as introgression is likely to go from white-tailed to mule deer (Carr et al. 
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">1986</a>) and could alter the adaptive potential. Efforts should be made to better characterize additional drivers behind this phenotypic and genetic variation in an effort to maintain a diversity of phenotypes that might best be able to adapt to novel conditions. Screening for similar associations in more imperiled deer populations (and cervid species) may help shed light on local population dynamics and better inform management decisions.
