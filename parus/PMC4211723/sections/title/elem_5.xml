 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both migration and body condition are phenotypic traits that are important to the fitness of mule deer. However, only condition can be thought of as a proxy for fitness. Thus, we used two separate analytical frameworks to examine genetic correlations with these traits. For migration, we examined the relationship between mitochondrial haplotypes and genetic differentiation to determine whether there was a genetic component to the timing of migration (an isolation-by-ecology analysis, 
  <span class="italic">sensu</span> Shafer and Wolf 
  <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">2013</a>). For body condition, a fitness proxy, we followed the general HFC framework discussed in Chapman et al. (
  <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2009</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After GPS radio collars were recovered and data were downloaded, we calculated the initiation and termination dates of spring and fall migration (i.e., the dates at which deer started or finished their migration) in 
   <span class="sc">arcmap</span> 10.1 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA). Migration was demarcated as the time period during which deer travelled between their winter and summer home ranges. Home ranges were determined by outlining a minimum convex polygon around all locations that occurred prior to directed movement, without return, away from the summer or winter range areas.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first examined the relationship between mtDNA haplogroup (derived from haplotype and phylogenetic analyses) and the dates of spring and fall migrations. For this analysis, we corrected the Julian date of migration to the earliest date among all individuals. The resulting data represented a count of the number of days since the earliest arriving or leaving migrant had terminated or initiated their migration. These data were analyzed using negative binomial regression (see Appendix S3 for model formulation). We included covariates for the mtDNA haplogroup to which each deer was assigned (categorical) as well as a covariate for the age of the animal and binary covariates indicating winter range study area (i.e., three separate covariates indicating whether the deer was from a winter range study area [1] or not [0]). Before models were run, correlations among covariates were examined to assess collinearity (no predictors were correlated at |
   <span class="italic">r</span>| &gt; 0.7) and age was standardized

   </div>, a common procedure in regression to aid in interpretability of coefficient estimates (Gelman and Hill 
   <a rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27">2007</a>). We fitted all models under a Bayesian framework in JAGS (Plummer 
   <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2012</a>) and 
   <span class="sc">r</span>3.0.1 (R Core Team 
   <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2013</a>), using the ‘rjags’ package (Plummer 
   <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2013</a>). See Appendix S3 for specifics of model runs and assessment of convergence. To assess the fit of the models, we calculated residuals (observed – predicted values) and plotted them against the fitted values to examine any potential patterns in residuals.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Secondly, we examined correlations between genetic relatedness metrics and similarity in migration using Mantel tests. For this analysis, we calculated absolute pairwise distances (calculated in days) between each individual's migration termination or initiation dates leaving us with four matrices representing differences in migration timing for spring and fall. The relationships between relatedness indices (QG and coancestry) and migratory behavior (dates) were evaluated in 
   <span class="sc">r</span>3.0.1 (R Core Team 
   <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2013</a>) using Mantel tests (Mantel 
   <a rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" href="#b42">1967</a>) under 10 000 permutations as implemented by the Ecodist library (Goslee and Urban 
   <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2007</a>). Here, a comparison is made between relatedness and the difference in migration timing, and thus, a negative relationship is expected if there is a genetic signature – that is, more closely related individuals have more similar migration timing. To account for similarities among individuals inhabiting similar areas or grouping together, we ran two partial Mantel tests controlling for the distance between the centroids of individuals' winter range and summer range (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>). Significance was assessed by examining 95% confidence intervals.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We next examined whether there was a relationship between either MLH or SLH and condition metrics (mass and fat) using the HFC framework. We fit hierarchical (i.e., random effects) models in a Bayesian framework. The presence or the absence of a relationship was determined by examining the posterior probability distributions of each coefficient to determine the probability that either MLH or heterozygosity at any single locus was related to condition. In all models, we included covariates for either MLH or SLH, the age of the animal, a binary variable for if the data came from a March capture (both mass and fat are expected to be lower in March), and binary variables indicating which of the four winter range areas the deer was captured in (as in the migration analysis, above). We tested between models with solely a linear effect or a quadratic effect of age using the deviance information criteria (DIC; Spiegelhalter et al. 
   <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2002</a>; but with the effective number of parameters calculated as in Plummer 
   <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2012</a>). Identity disequilibrium among loci (i.e., covariance of heterozygosity among loci) was used to infer the validity of MLH correlation: Accordingly, we calculated 
   <span class="italic">g</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>, where a value of zero means no variance in inbreeding (Szulkin et al. 
   <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">2010</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined the relationship between heterozygosity and mass or fat using linear regression and beta regression, respectively. Mass was natural log-transformed to ensure proper support (i.e., untransformed mass is strictly positive, while linear regression allows for negative values; log transformation addresses this issue), while beta regression was used because it is proper for dependent variables ranging between 0 and 1 as percent body fat does. Because there were multiple condition measures for certain deer (i.e., those captured in both March and December), for both analyses, we allowed the intercept to vary by individual, estimating a population-level intercept (i.e., we fit a random intercept by individual), with all other coefficient values fixed. See Appendix S3 for details of model parameters and convergence assessment. To assess the fit of the models, we calculated residuals (observed – predicted values) and plotted them against the fitted values to examine any potential patterns in residuals.</p>
