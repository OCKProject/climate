 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed information on temporal patterns of cloudiness based on the same MODIS sensors as in the case of EVI data, this time using the MOD08 product (collection 5.1, accessed through Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System – LAADS, ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov), which aggregates data into 8‐day statistics, and a 1° grid. This was done to explore whether cloud cover influenced the predictive power of the MODIS satellite data to explain tit reproductive timing. This could conceivably be the case given that cloud will obscure the ground, reducing the number of valid measurements forming the time series used to describe each pixel's green‐up trajectory. This in turn will reduce the confidence in the green‐up date estimates. In order to determine the key time period of cloudiness that may influence the relationship between MODIS vegetation green‐up and tit reproductive phenology, we ran a series of linear regressions testing the relationship between how well tits matched nestbox‐specific green‐up each year and early spring cloudiness (cloud fraction (%)) averaged over different time windows. For each year, the correlation coefficient for the relationship between individual laying date and nestbox‐specific green‐up was calculated, providing an estimate of annual synchrony between tit and vegetation phenology. The cloudiness data had a temporal resolution of 8 days. Average cloudiness was calculated for the 91 different time windows, which ranged between 24 days (3 8‐day periods) and 120 days (15 8‐day periods) in length, within the first 120 days of the year. Linear regressions were used to test the relationship between the annual tit vs. green‐up correlation coefficients and each of the 91 sets of cloudiness measures (
