  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was carried out using a nestbox population of great tits and blue tits at Wytham Woods (51°46′N, 1°20′W), a mixed‐deciduous 385‐ha woodland in Oxfordshire. The canopy composition is primarily oak (
   <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>), ash (
   <span class="italic">Fraxinus excelsior</span>), sycamore (
   <span class="italic">Acer pseudoplatanus</span>), and beech (
   <span class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</span>), with an understory of hawthorn (
   <span class="italic">Crataegus momgyna</span>), hazel (
   <span class="italic">Corylus avellana</span>), elder (
   <span class="italic">Sambucus niger</span>), and field maple (Acer 
   <span class="italic">campestre</span>) (Perrins 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0034">1965</a>). All live oak trees in Wytham with a diameter at breast height of 30 cm of greater (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 5425) were mapped using handheld GPS during February 2011. Wytham is divided into 121 discrete compartment bounded by paths and linear features (mean area = 3.15 ha, standard deviation = 2.90, see Figure S1). At the same time that the oaks were mapped, habitat data were collected for each of the 121 compartments. For each compartment, the proportion of canopy that was composed of each tree species (oak, ash, beech, birch, sycamore, cedar, field maple, fir, hemlock, larch, poplar, pine, spruce, sweet chestnut, willow, other) was estimated by eye, as well as the percentage of overall canopy cover. Similar data were collected for the understory layer (species: hazel, hawthorn, blackthorn, birch, elder, field maple, holly and willow, other). These measures were estimated by experienced forestry ecologists.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Great tit and blue tit breeding data spanning 13 years (2001–2013) were collected as part of the long‐term study of tits in Wytham (see McCleery et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0026">2004</a>; Wood et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0059">2007</a>). We used this timespan because full monitoring of blue tit nests did not begin until 2001. In order to compare effects in the two species, we therefore restricted the great tit data to 2001–2013. There are 1207 nestboxes in Wytham, the locations of which were digitally mapped using a differential GPS system (Wilkin et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0056">2007</a>); 1020 of these are standard boxes used by both tit species (entrance hole diameter: 32 mm), and the remaining 187 have smaller entrance holes (diameter: 26 mm), which prevent great tits from entering. During April and May, all nestboxes are visited weekly to monitor breeding attempts. Tits generally lay one egg a day for approximately 8 days (Perrins 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0034">1965</a>), and therefore, the date when the first egg is laid in a nest (hereafter laying date) can be inferred by counting backwards from the date that the clutch was observed (e.g., a nest with 3 eggs on 3rd April would have a laying date of 1st April). Hatch date is ascertained by visiting all nests on alternate days from the eleventh day after clutch completion until hatching. Parents were captured at the nest while feeding 8‐ to 12‐day‐old nestlings and ringed with a unique metal leg ring or identified if already ringed. Age and sex of parents were established on the basis of plumage characteristics (Svensson 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0048">1994</a>). Only clutches laid within 30 days of the first clutch of the year were used in this study to exclude second breeding attempts by individuals (van Noordwijk et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0031">1995</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caterpillar data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Timing of the population peak in winter moth larvae abundance is measured every year as part of a long‐term study (see Charmantier et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0006">2008</a>). The half‐fall date (the date by which 50% of the seasonal total of larvae has descended to the ground to pupate) was determined for the same four oak trees at a single site in Wytham. This was done by placing two water traps, 100 × 50 cm in size, under each tree. Traps were visited regularly throughout the spring to count and remove fallen winter moth larvae. These data give an indication of the relative timing of the population peak of caterpillar biomass and are strongly correlated with annual variation in great tit timing of breeding (Charmantier et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0006">2008</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used freely available data from the MODIS sensors (NASA 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0030">2008</a>) to determine vegetation spring green‐up dates for Wytham. These sensors are on‐board Terra and Aqua satellites, which were launched in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and acquire multispectral images over the whole Earth surface every 1 to 2 days. All pixels covering Wytham (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 117, see Supplementary Methods and Figure S2) were projected to 240 m resolution on WGS 1984 UTM 30N coordinate system. The enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2) (Jiang et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0022">2008</a>) was then calculated for each pixel in each 8‐day period. For each 240 m pixel and 8‐day period, there were potentially 16 (8 
   <span class="sc">am</span> and 8 
   <span class="sc">pm</span>) available clear cloud‐free observations of the land surface. However, in practice, because of cloud, typically only approximately 4 clear observations of the land surface were available for each 240 m pixel in each 8‐day period. Observations are flagged as “cloudy” or “cloud‐free” by the MOD03 cloud‐detection algorithm. EVI2 on the middle day of each 8‐day period was then estimated as the mean of all available clear observations in the 8‐day period. Very rarely (&lt;0.5%), no clear observations were available for a particular 240 m pixel in an 8‐day period and it was not possible to estimate EVI2 for that time period.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are many methods of calculating spring phenological transition dates from time series of multispectral images for deciduous woodlands (Jönsson and Eklundh 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0023">2004</a>), mostly corresponding to the date at which the rate of change in curvature in a vegetation index (VI) exhibits local minima or maxima (Zhang et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0060">2003</a>). The inflexion point of the piece‐wise logistic curve fitted to VI data (i.e., the point of maximum rate of change) has been shown to be a good indicator of the onset of oak bud‐burst in deciduous woodlands (Soudani et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0046">2008</a>). In this study, we used generalized additive models (GAMs; Hastie and Tibshirani 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0017">1990</a>) to calculate a very similar metric, which were selected because we did not want to impose any prior assumption on the shape of the green‐up curve. A GAM was fitted to the EVI2 data for each pixel individually (EVI2 vs. day of year). The day of vegetation green‐up for each pixel was calculated as the day on which the derivative of this function was maximized (i.e., the day of the greatest rate of change in green‐up per year, see Figure 
   <a rid="ece31745-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31745-fig-0001">1</a>). GAMs were fitted using the R package “mgcv” version 1.8‐4 and differentiated using the function predict.gam of mgcv (Wood 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0058">2011</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cloud cover data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed information on temporal patterns of cloudiness based on the same MODIS sensors as in the case of EVI data, this time using the MOD08 product (collection 5.1, accessed through Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System – LAADS, ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov), which aggregates data into 8‐day statistics, and a 1° grid. This was done to explore whether cloud cover influenced the predictive power of the MODIS satellite data to explain tit reproductive timing. This could conceivably be the case given that cloud will obscure the ground, reducing the number of valid measurements forming the time series used to describe each pixel's green‐up trajectory. This in turn will reduce the confidence in the green‐up date estimates. In order to determine the key time period of cloudiness that may influence the relationship between MODIS vegetation green‐up and tit reproductive phenology, we ran a series of linear regressions testing the relationship between how well tits matched nestbox‐specific green‐up each year and early spring cloudiness (cloud fraction (%)) averaged over different time windows. For each year, the correlation coefficient for the relationship between individual laying date and nestbox‐specific green‐up was calculated, providing an estimate of annual synchrony between tit and vegetation phenology. The cloudiness data had a temporal resolution of 8 days. Average cloudiness was calculated for the 91 different time windows, which ranged between 24 days (3 8‐day periods) and 120 days (15 8‐day periods) in length, within the first 120 days of the year. Linear regressions were used to test the relationship between the annual tit vs. green‐up correlation coefficients and each of the 91 sets of cloudiness measures (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 13 years for each regression). These models were then ordered by 
   <span class="italic">r</span>‐value. The top models for both great tits and blue tits were highly significant (see Table 
   <a rid="ece31745-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece31745-tbl-0004">4</a> and Fig. 
   <a rid="ece31745-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31745-fig-0007">7</a>). In addition, we analyzed data for the whole of Europe in order to quantify cloudiness in areas and seasons relevant to the type of research considered in this study.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical methods</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All analyses were run on the great tit dataset and the blue tit dataset independently. To address our first objective, we used linear models to test the relationship between annual green‐up dates (average green‐up date for all pixels containing more than 50% woodland) and (1) annual caterpillar half‐fall date; (2) annual mean laying date and (3) annual mean hatching date (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 13 years). Linear mixed models (LMMs) were used to address our second objective, exploration of the relationship between within‐year individual variation timing of breeding (laying dates and hatch dates) and nestbox‐specific green‐up dates. Green‐up dates were partitioned into between‐year variation (annual mean green‐up date) and within‐year variation (deviation from annual mean green‐up date), following methods from van de Pol and Wright (
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0037">2009</a>), to control for between‐year effects. We first ran minimal models containing no additional fixed effects to determine the strength of the relationship between vegetation green‐up and timing of breeding. We then ran models that controlled for three known environmental correlates of laying date in our population: altitude (in meters), distance to the edge of the woodland (in meters), and local oak density (number of oak trees within 75 m of a nestbox: see Wilkin et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0056">2007</a>). These environmental factors may themselves explain a portion of the variation in green‐up at any given location – for example, vegetation green‐up is likely to be later at higher altitudes. We therefore wanted to test whether vegetation green‐up explained variation in timing of breeding above and beyond that explained by these known environmental factors. All models also included the random effects of nestbox ID and year. Ideally, female identity should be controlled for in these analyses to account for individuals that breed in successive years being represented in the dataset more than once. However, we did not included this effect in our main models because a significant proportion of breeding attempts failed before the associated female could be identified or the female was not successfully caught. It was inappropriate to exclude these breeding attempts from the analysis because they represented a biased sample of laying dates. Identified females began laying significantly earlier than unidentified females (mean laying date ± SE: great tits: female ID unknown: 21.66 ± 0.27, female ID known: 21.06 ± 0.12, LM: 
   <span class="italic">t</span> = −2.06, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.039, 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 4597; blue tits: female ID unknown: 20.68 ± 0.21, female ID known: 19.21 ± 0.12, LM: 
   <span class="italic">t</span> = −5.89, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001, 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 5221). However, we reran all analyses including female ID as a random factor and present results in the supplementary material (see Table S1). Local oak density was calculated using GIS software (ArcGIS 10.2), by mapping the locations of all oak trees and nestboxes and then calculating the number of oak trees within a 75 m buffer around each nestbox (see Wilkin et al. (
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0056">2007</a>) for details of methodology). A radius of 75 m was used because a previous study on the Wytham great tit population compared the predictive power of oak density within different sized buffers around each box to explain variation in laying date and found that 75 m explained the most variation (Wilkin et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0056">2007</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To address our final objective – establishing whether the relationship between satellite‐derived green‐up and tit phenology varies across the woodland, for each pixel, we calculated the correlation coefficient quantifying the relationship between annual average laying date for that pixel and annual pixel green‐up date. This pixel‐level analysis was restricted to the 67 pixels that were comprised of 50% woodland or more (see Figure S2) in order to reduce the signal interference caused by farmland that borders the woodland. For the great tit analysis, three further pixels were excluded, one because it did not include any great tit breeding attempts, and two, because the correlation coefficients for these pixels were based on only three data points each (i.e., birds only bred in these pixels 3 of 13 years). The remaining 64 pixels each had between 9 and 13 data points (i.e., 9–13 years where great tits bred in a given pixel). Similarly for the blue tit analysis, two pixels were excluded because they were based on three and five data points. The remaining 65 pixels each had between 8 and 13 data points.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether habitat type related to the degree of phenological synchrony between tit and vegetation phenology at the pixel level, we ran linear regressions with the pixel correlation coefficient (laying date vs. green‐up) as the response variable and fixed effects: proportion of pixel canopy comprised of ash, oak, beech, sycamore, and proportion of the understory comprised of hazel, hawthorn, elder, and field maple. These eight species are the dominant vegetation types in Wytham, accounting for 31%, 27%, 14%, and 11% of the canopy vegetation, respectively, and 44%, 33%, 7%, and 6% of the understory vegetation, respectively. Relationships between pixel‐level synchrony and abundance of each of the eight tree and shrub species were tested separately as their relative abundance was not independent of one another. Pixel‐level canopy and understory data were then calculated by overlaying the 240 m MODIS pixels and the habitat compartments (see study site section) using ArcGIS 10.2 software, and weighting compartment habitat values based on the proportion they contributed to the area of a given pixel. These models included all pixels composed of greater than 50% woodland and were weighted based on the total number of breeding attempts in each pixel to account for the variation in confidence in the pixel correlation coefficients. We examined the spatial structure in laying date and phenological synchrony using Mantel correlograms. All analyses were carried out using R version R 3.0.1 (
