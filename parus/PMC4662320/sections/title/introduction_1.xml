 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over recent decades there has been an increasing interest in plant and animal phenology as global warming has caused many life‐history events to shift earlier in time (Parmesan and Yohe 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0033">2003</a>; Root et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0041">2003</a>; Durant et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0012">2007</a>). In temperate environments, characterized by transient peaks in resource availability, timing of reproductive events is a key determinant of reproductive success (Verhulst and Tinbergen 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0052">1991</a>) and may be under strong selection (van Noordwijk et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0031">1995</a>). Research that has explored the mechanisms underlying the advancement of reproductive phenology over time often finds that phenotypic shifts can be explained by individual plasticity alone (Réale et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0038">2003</a>; Charmantier et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0006">2008</a>; Gienapp et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0016">2008</a>). Indeed, there is little evidence that current changes in climate have caused any evolutionary response within natural populations (reviewed in Merilä and Hendry 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0027">2014</a>). While some species and populations are successfully tracking the shifting peak in their food source, others are not, leading to disruption of the synchrony between different trophic levels (Visser et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0053">1998</a>; Thackeray et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0050">2010</a>). One potential cause of this is that climate change can be temporally heterogeneous; for example, temperatures early in the spring when animals make decisions about timing of breeding may advance at a different rate to temperatures later in the season influencing the timing of food abundance (i.e., the selective environment) (Durant et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0012">2007</a>). To better understand these patterns of synchrony and asynchrony between trophic levels, we require a better knowledge of the factors influencing reproductive phenology.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One issue that hampers progress in this field is that insufficient attention has been paid to considering environmental phenology at a scale that is relevant to individual animals. Most studies exploring reproductive phenology to date have treated the environment as equivalent for all individuals within a population (e.g., Réale et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0038">2003</a>; Charmantier et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0006">2008</a>; Moyes et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0028">2011</a>). For example, a single site may be used to derive measures of temperature, or vegetation phenology, which is then related to measures of phenotype across a broader scale (e.g., an entire population). This approach implicitly assumes that environmental cues, to which the organisms respond, are invariant over quite large spatial scales. In reality, animals generally use a restricted amount of space within the range of a population, and significant environmental heterogeneity can mean that individuals with neighboring ranges experience quite different environmental conditions to one another (Hinks et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0018">2015</a>). However, collecting environmental data at a scale that is relevant to the individual animal for entire populations is likely to be highly labor‐intensive, is difficult to scale up, and usually cannot be carried out retrospectively.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One potential solution to this problem is to use remotely sensed satellite data to characterize biophysical properties of environments. Over recent decades, there has been a burgeoning interest in the ecological applications of remote‐sensing data (Roughgarden et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0042">1991</a>; Kerr and Ostrovsky 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0024">2003</a>; Pettorelli et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0035">2005</a>, 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0036">2011</a>; Cleland et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0009">2007</a>; Smith et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0045">2013</a>). Multispectral data, collected by optical sensors on‐board satellites orbiting the earth, can be used to calculate indices of vegetation primary productivity (Reed et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0039">1994</a>). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) are two such measures, which take advantage of the fact that the relative amount of red and near infrared light reflected back to the satellite depends on vegetation cover. Some satellite remotely sensed datasets are available on a global scale, are often free of charge, and are increasingly provided preprocessed and having undergone some degree of quality control. This wealth of data is increasingly being used to gain insight into vegetation dynamics, biodiversity, animal movements, and population dynamics (reviewed in Pettorelli et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0035">2005</a>, 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0036">2011</a>; Hurley et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0021">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The different satellite datasets vary in both their spatial and temporal resolution. When images of the same site are collected frequently enough, they can be used to quantify vegetation phenology measures such as the timing of spring green‐up (e.g., Soudani et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0046">2008</a>; Busetto et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0004">2010</a>; Hufkens et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-1111" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-1111">2012</a>). Such data have been used on a continental scale to show that large‐scale spatial patterns of the onset of plant growth correlate with spatial variation in spring warmth (Chen et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0007">2005</a>). They have also been used on a smaller scale to explore trophic interactions between vegetation and consumers. For example, one study on reindeer (
  <span class="italic">Rangifer tarandus</span>) reported negative correlations between vegetation green‐up and both calf mass and female reproductive success (Tveraa et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0051">2013</a>). To date, most studies that have explored how satellite‐derived vegetation measures relate to life‐history traits of higher trophic levels do so at the population level, either comparing populations to one another or the same population across years (but see Szulkin et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0049">2015</a>). However, the increasing availability of fine spatial (e.g., SPOT, Landsat, or the recently launched Sentinel‐2a) and temporal (e.g., MODIS, future Sentinel 2 constellation) resolution of satellite sensors offers considerable potential for individual‐based studies, which is yet to be fully explored.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we focus on the tri‐trophic system of passerine songbirds feeding on caterpillar prey that in turn feed on the emergent leaves of deciduous tree (see Visser et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0053">1998</a>; Charmantier et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0006">2008</a>), to explore whether satellite data can be used as an appropriate proxy for spatiotemporal variation in resource abundance. Great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) and blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) primarily rear their offspring on lepidopteran larvae, particularly of the winter moth (
  <span class="italic">Operophtera brumata</span>). These caterpillars are only available during a brief period in spring as they time their hatching to exploit newly emerged leaves of their host trees (particularly oaks 
  <span class="italic">Quercus</span> spp.), and then pupate in the soil. In order to maximize their reproductive success, tits must time their breeding so that their peak in food demand, which comes when nestlings are approximately one week old, coincides with the transient peak in caterpillar abundance (Verhulst and Tinbergen 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0052">1991</a>). Onset of laying is considerably plastic, as individual great tits have been shown to track the phenology of their food source over their lifetime (Charmantier et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0006">2008</a>). In temperate deciduous woodlands throughout the Northern Hemisphere, tree phenology is largely determined by winter chilling followed by warming in spring (Hunter and Lechowicz 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0020">1992</a>), but there is also marked within‐population variation at a scale that is relevant to individual birds (Hinks et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0018">2015</a>). To date, this fine‐scale spatial component has largely been ignored in studies of tit phenology (but see Nager and van Noordwijk 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0029">1995</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we used great tit and blue tit breeding data and satellite imagery over a 13‐year period to determine whether between and within‐year variation in reproductive phenology for a single population can be predicted by satellite‐derived vegetation phenology. We judged vegetation phenology to be a suitable proxy for caterpillar phenology as previous work has shown that green‐up measures derived from MODIS data can be a good indicator of the onset of oak bud‐burst in deciduous woodlands (Soudani et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0046">2008</a>), and that the timing of oak budburst at the level of individual trees is a strong predictor of peak in caterpillar availability (Hinks et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0018">2015</a>). We used a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data product, which has a spatial resolution of 240 m and a temporal resolution of 8 days, to derive nestbox‐specific vegetation “green‐up” dates for 1207 nestboxes in a 385‐ha mixed‐deciduous woodland. Our aims in this study were threefold. First, we tested whether annual measures of vegetation green‐up for our study site can be used to predict between‐year variation in the timing of the annual peak in caterpillar abundance and the timing of great tit and blue tit breeding. Second, we quantified the relationship between local vegetation green‐up and tit phenology at the level of individual breeding attempts within years. Finally, we explored whether the strength of this synchrony between tits and their environment varies across the study site, and what may explain this variation, and test how these patterns differed between the two tit species. In addition, we investigated whether the amount of cloud cover over the study site influenced the predictive power of the MODIS satellite data to explain tit reproductive timing.
