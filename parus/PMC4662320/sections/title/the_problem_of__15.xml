 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The problem of scale mismatch</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The question of how variation in life‐history traits and ecological interactions is dependent on the scale at which it is studied is a key issue in ecology (Levin 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0025">1992</a>). A recent study in topi antelopes (
  <span class="italic">Damaliscus korrigum</span>) found that the correlation between animal density and satellite‐derived primary production was dependent on the spatial resolution of the vegetation data (Bro‐Jørgensen et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0003">2008</a>). To date most studies that explore the relationship between bird, oak and caterpillar phenology have performed so at the population scale, where the environment is treated as homogenous across the population (e.g., Perrins 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0034">1965</a>; van Noordwijk et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0031">1995</a>; Charmantier et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0006">2008</a>). Taking an approach that considers the scale at which individuals experience their environment is likely to be key if we are to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes acting on reproductive phenology within populations. Only through gaining this knowledge will we understand the scope for populations to cope with rapidly changing environments (Chevin et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0008">2010</a>). Recent work, that takes this individual‐based approach, has demonstrated that marked spatial variation in oak and caterpillar phenology exists at a scale relevant to individual birds and that great tits are able to fine tune their reproductive phenology to their immediate environment, by responding to environmental cues experienced over a relatively smaller spatial scale (i.e., within tens of meters of the nest) (Hinks et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0018">2015</a>). This demonstrates the power of measuring environmental variation at an appropriate scale to reveal processes masked by population‐level studies. Here, we found similar fine‐scale within‐population spatial variation in timing of breeding, where nestboxes within a few hundred meters of one another were more phenologically synchronized than those further apart. Furthermore, the scale of spatial autocorrelation appears to differ across the population, with timing being relatively homogeneous in some areas of the wood and spatially heterogeneous in others (see Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31745-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31745-fig-0003">3</a>). These complex patterns of variation are likely to reflect similar spatial autocorrelation in the phenology of tits' food source (Hinks et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0018">2015</a>) and resource availability (Wilkin et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0056">2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we use vegetation green‐up date with a spatial resolution of 240 m. (
  <span class="italic">c</span>. 5.8 ha). While this is still significantly larger than the average territory of a breeding great tit or blue tit (
  <span class="italic">c</span>. 1–3 ha, Stauss et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0047">2005</a>), meaning that there is still a degree of scale mismatch, it is likely to be a more ecologically relevant than environmental measurements estimated at the population scale (385 ha). By analyzing variation at this spatial scale, we found that the predictive power of satellite‐derived green‐up data to explain variation in timing of breeding varied across the woodland. In both tit species, neighboring pixels were significantly more similar to one another in terms of strength of phenological synchrony than those further apart. In blue tits, this spatial structure was more complex, with positive autocorrelation occurring at multiple spatial scales. At the pixel scale, blue tits were significantly more synchronized with vegetation green‐up than great tits. This may suggest that there are differences between the two species in the cues used to time laying, or in the scale that these cues are experienced.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that the extent to which great tits and blue tits matched the phenology of the local vegetation was related to habitat type. Pixels where birds were well synchronized with the vegetation green‐up were also those with high oak tree density. In contrast, in very oak‐poor areas of the woodland birds showed little or no synchrony with this measure of vegetation phenology. In Wytham, oak trees support the great majority of caterpillar biomass (Feeny 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0013">1970</a>; Wint 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0057">1983</a>) and great tit and blue tits are rarely seen foraging on beech, ash, or sycamore (Gibb 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0015">1954</a>). It is therefore not surprising that birds nesting in oak‐poor areas are not synchronizing their breeding with the vegetation phenology measures we detect via remote sensing (which will be largely driven by nonoak species). Instead, we might expect that their laying date may covary with the phenology of the few oak trees in the vicinity of their nest, which account for too small a percentage of overall canopy to be contribute significantly to the EVI2 signal. Alternatively, their timing may be synchronized with oak‐rich areas further from the nest (i.e., outside the pixel containing their nestbox). Oaks are a key component of great tit habitat; tits nesting on oak‐rich habitat tend to breed earlier, feed their young on a higher proportion of caterpillars and have higher reproductive success (Wilkin and Sheldon 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0055">2009</a>). It is therefore possible that the relationship we find between phenological synchrony of oak density is to some extent driven by good quality birds, which may be better at timing their breeding, settling in oak‐rich areas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between phenological synchrony and oak prevalence was present in both tit species. Hazel was also a strong predictor of matching in great tits, but a much weaker predictor in blue tits. In early spring, great tits and blue tits vary in their foraging behavior; great tits are mainly observed feeding on and around hazel trees and then move to oak later in the spring, whereas blue tits favor oak throughout the spring and are considered the more specialized of the two species (Gibb 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0015">1954</a>; Stauss et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0047">2005</a>). Our results are in agreement with these observations as the amount of hazel in a pixel covaried with phenological matching in great tits (for whom hazel is a critical component of foraging habitat) but less so in blue tits (for whom hazel is far less important). Taken together, these results suggest that using satellite data with a 240‐m resolution may only be useful where the satellite‐derived green‐up signal is driven predominantly by the type of vegetation used by foraging tits (e.g., homogenous oak stands), rather than oak‐ and hazel‐poor woodlands.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intriguingly, green‐up dates for many of the MODIS pixels intersecting Wytham were in late March to mid‐April, before canopy species, such as oak, come into full leaf (see Figure S3). Similarly, a trend for earlier blue tit egg laying dates to be associated with pixels with higher NDVI values was noted at dates when oaks were still dormant in Southern France (Szulkin et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0049">2015</a>). This suggests that a significant amount of the green‐up signal may be caused by understory or ground‐level vegetation. However, the fact that satellite‐derived green‐up date can be used to predict timing of breeding tits, particularly in oak and hazel‐rich habitats, suggests that these metrics are providing biologically meaningful information about vegetation phenology. Further work is clearly needed to understand precisely which factors contribute to the remotely sensed phenological signal detected in different habitat types. Simply ground‐truthing satellite data using phenological data for individual trees and plants are likely to be logistically very difficult. At the level of individual trees, there is limited spatial autocorrelation in green‐up (E. F. Cole &amp; B. C. Sheldon, unpubl. data), meaning that ground truthing may require sampling hundreds or thousands of trees and shrubs. One potential approach could be to use a combination of detailed habitat data and high‐resolution green‐up data collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to better determine species‐specific green‐up signatures in mixed woodlands.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we used satellite data with the highest spatial resolution available (given the additional requirement for high temporal resolution) for quantifying vegetation phenology in Wytham. The relatively coarse‐grained nature of these data limits the ability to analyze phenological synchrony at the finest scale. While satellite data with high spatial resolution do exist (e.g., Landsat7 up to 15 m resolution), the temporal resolution is too low to retrospectively quantify spring green‐up. It may be possible to increase the spatial resolution of MODIS data using a swath cumulation technique, which uses the finer scale geo‐referencing of the ungridded data from the MODIS sensors (Packalén and Maltamo 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0032">2007</a>; Scambos et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0044">2007</a>), and by combining satellite data from multiple sources. Another potential method of obtaining high‐resolution remotely sensed vegetation phenology data is via frequent surveys using UAVs. These devices are becoming increasingly affordable and have an extremely high spatial resolution (e.g., subdecimeter) (Chabot and Bird 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0005">2013</a>). As technology improves, these types of devices are likely to play an important role in the study of spatial ecology (Anderson and Gaston 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0001">2013</a>).
