 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite data can suffer from multiple sources of error caused by atmospheric and ground conditions and sensor resolution and calibration (Pettorelli et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0035">2005</a>). MODIS EVI2 datasets, in addition to many similar products, have been quality‐controlled and preprocessed to minimize these types of error. However, one factor that limits the reliability of all satellite‐derived multispectral data is the amount of cloud cover. Cloudiness varies considerably across both time and space, with the UK experiencing higher than average cloudiness relative to continental Europe. We used MODIS cloud fraction data to show that early spring cloudiness, which differs between years (see Figure S4), relates to our ability to estimate vegetation green‐up dates from MODIS data. In years with high levels of cloudiness during February and March, we found little or no correlation between individual laying date and nestbox‐specific green‐up, in both great tits and blue tits. However, when early spring cloudiness was low, a much stronger relationship between vegetation and tit phenology was detected. This is likely to reflect the fact that in cloudy years, our estimates of green‐up are less reliable because green‐up trajectories will be based on a smaller number of clear images. Cloud cover is therefore a significant limitation to using satellite data to study animal phenology, and results based on these data should always be interpreted with care.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is encouraging that, despite a mean cloudiness of 79% in January–March at the study site (see Figs. 
  <a rid="ece31745-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31745-fig-0006">6</a>, S4 and S5), the remotely sensed signal of vegetation green‐up was sufficiently strong to reveal significant relationships with animal phenological traits. The pixel‐wise approach taken in this study, where green‐up measures for each 8‐day period are calculated by averaging multiple observations, means that despite high average cloud cover, it is still possible to obtain enough clear looks to estimate a time series of EVI2 for each pixel. Clearly the more cloud‐free observations, the more accurate the estimate of green‐up date will be. Given that Wytham has higher than average cloudiness with respect to the rest of Europe, this study suggests that the potential for using satellite data in predicting small‐scale phenological variation in other long‐term studies in temperate regions may be even greater.
