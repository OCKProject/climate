 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Remotely sensed data are rapidly becoming a key resource in ecological research. Measures of vegetation productivity have proved especially useful, with new uses arising continuously (Kerr and Ostrovsky 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0024">2003</a>; Pettorelli et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0036">2011</a>). These measures can be used to quantify the spatial and temporal aspects of vegetation development, which in turn can be used to predict the population dynamics and life‐history traits of both primary and secondary consumers. Here, we investigate whether satellite‐derived measures of vegetation phenology can be used to predict individual variation in the timing of laying in a blue tit and a great tit population occupying the same woodland. We show that there is significant spatial structure in reproductive phenology within these populations, and that this variation relates to satellite‐derived vegetation green‐up dates, calculated for each individual nest location. In great tits, this relationship remained significant after controlling for altitude, distance from the edge of the woodland and local oak density, which are environmental variables known to influence timing of breeding in tits (and which are likely to influence vegetation phenology). In contrast, timing of reproduction in blue tits was more strongly influenced by local habitat quality (oak density) and altitude, which is likely to be closely related to early spring temperature. Summarizing breeding attempts at the level of individual 240 m pixels, we demonstrate that the extent to which vegetation green‐up and timing of laying are synchronized varies spatially across the study site, and that this variation relates to both canopy and understory composition.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of remotely sensed vegetation data in ecology is often thought to mainly be applicable to herbivorous species (see Pettorelli et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0036">2011</a>), but there are in fact many studies that have successfully used these data to explore ecological questions in nonherbivorous birds and mammals (reviewed in Pettorelli et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0036">2011</a>; Hurley et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0021">2014</a>). This is possible in systems where the availability of prey for the species of interest is strongly influenced by vegetation characteristics. The tri‐trophic food chain of tits, caterpillars, and oak trees is an example of such a system. The peak in winter moth caterpillar biomass is highly dependent on the budburst date of oak trees, its favored host species (van Asch and Visser 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0002">2007</a>). Indeed, a recent study in Wytham found a strong correlation (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.67) between oak bud‐burst date and the date of the peak in caterpillar abundance at the level of individual trees (Hinks et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0018">2015</a>). Furthermore, the same study also found that individual differences in onset of laying by great tits could be predicted by the phenology of the nearest oaks to a nesting site (Hinks et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0018">2015</a>). These findings suggest that the timing of oak spring green‐up can be used as a reliable predictor for when nestling prey is most abundant in the environment.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we used vegetation green‐up dates derived from MODIS satellite data as a proxy for oak tree spring phenology, but acknowledge it is likely to capture green‐up of a range of understory and canopy species. A similar approach has been applied using MODIS's predecessor, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), to relate advancing oak phenology to average timing of breeding in pied flycatchers (
   <span class="italic">Ficedula hypoleuca</span>) across years (Sanz et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0043">2003</a>). This study used data with a spatial resolution of 8 km and therefore could not look at within‐population variation in bird phenology. In addition to providing data with a higher spatial resolution, MODIS sensors collect data with a greater spectral resolution and have improved geo‐location accuracy and atmospheric corrections (Soudani et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0046">2008</a>). There are various different methods of calculating spring phenological transition dates for deciduous woodlands (see Jönsson and Eklundh 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0023">2004</a>), mostly corresponding to the date at which the rate of change in curvature in a vegetation index (VI) exhibits local minima or maxima (Zhang et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0060">2003</a>). These include the date of onset of photosynthetic activity (Zhang et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0060">2003</a>), the date of maximum rate of change in VI (Soudani et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0046">2008</a>; Busetto et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0004">2010</a>), averaged VI in a fixed time window (Sanz et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0043">2003</a>), and the date corresponding to the half‐maxima of a sigmoid curve fitted to the vegetation data (Fisher et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0014">2006</a>). A recent study compared field measurements of tree bud‐burst to several different phenological green‐up parameters, derived from MODIS data, for multiple mixed oak and beech forest stands (Soudani et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0046">2008</a>). It was shown that the inflexion point of the piece‐wise logistic curve fitted to VI data (i.e., the point of maximum rate of change) was the best indicator of the onset of oak and beech bud‐burst in deciduous woodlands. This measure was also influenced less by understory phenology than the date of onset of VI increase (Soudani et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0046">2008</a>). In this study, we used GAMs to calculate a very similar metric, which were selected because we did not want to impose any prior assumption on the shape of the green‐up curve.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, we found that the spatial patterns of pixel green‐up dates varied considerably from year to year (see Figs. 
   <a rid="ece31745-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31745-fig-0004">4</a> and S3). Even though the spring phenology of individual trees and shrubs is likely to be repeatable (Crawley and Akhteruzzaman 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0011">1988</a>; Wesołowski and Rowiński 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0054">2006</a>), the spring green‐up of different tree species is influenced by different environmental factors (e.g., winter chilling, photoperiod), and therefore, species will not always green‐up in the same order relative to each other (Roberts et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0040">2015</a>). In mixed species woodlands, this will likely lead to complex spatial patterns of green‐up that vary across years. Differences between years may also arise due to variation in spring cloudiness, which could conceivably influence the reliability of estimates of green‐up (see 
   <a rid="ece31745-sec-0013" ref-type="sec" href="#ece31745-sec-0013">Discussion</a> below).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The problem of scale mismatch</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The question of how variation in life‐history traits and ecological interactions is dependent on the scale at which it is studied is a key issue in ecology (Levin 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0025">1992</a>). A recent study in topi antelopes (
   <span class="italic">Damaliscus korrigum</span>) found that the correlation between animal density and satellite‐derived primary production was dependent on the spatial resolution of the vegetation data (Bro‐Jørgensen et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0003">2008</a>). To date most studies that explore the relationship between bird, oak and caterpillar phenology have performed so at the population scale, where the environment is treated as homogenous across the population (e.g., Perrins 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0034">1965</a>; van Noordwijk et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0031">1995</a>; Charmantier et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0006">2008</a>). Taking an approach that considers the scale at which individuals experience their environment is likely to be key if we are to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes acting on reproductive phenology within populations. Only through gaining this knowledge will we understand the scope for populations to cope with rapidly changing environments (Chevin et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0008">2010</a>). Recent work, that takes this individual‐based approach, has demonstrated that marked spatial variation in oak and caterpillar phenology exists at a scale relevant to individual birds and that great tits are able to fine tune their reproductive phenology to their immediate environment, by responding to environmental cues experienced over a relatively smaller spatial scale (i.e., within tens of meters of the nest) (Hinks et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0018">2015</a>). This demonstrates the power of measuring environmental variation at an appropriate scale to reveal processes masked by population‐level studies. Here, we found similar fine‐scale within‐population spatial variation in timing of breeding, where nestboxes within a few hundred meters of one another were more phenologically synchronized than those further apart. Furthermore, the scale of spatial autocorrelation appears to differ across the population, with timing being relatively homogeneous in some areas of the wood and spatially heterogeneous in others (see Fig. 
   <a rid="ece31745-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31745-fig-0003">3</a>). These complex patterns of variation are likely to reflect similar spatial autocorrelation in the phenology of tits' food source (Hinks et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0018">2015</a>) and resource availability (Wilkin et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0056">2007</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we use vegetation green‐up date with a spatial resolution of 240 m. (
   <span class="italic">c</span>. 5.8 ha). While this is still significantly larger than the average territory of a breeding great tit or blue tit (
   <span class="italic">c</span>. 1–3 ha, Stauss et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0047">2005</a>), meaning that there is still a degree of scale mismatch, it is likely to be a more ecologically relevant than environmental measurements estimated at the population scale (385 ha). By analyzing variation at this spatial scale, we found that the predictive power of satellite‐derived green‐up data to explain variation in timing of breeding varied across the woodland. In both tit species, neighboring pixels were significantly more similar to one another in terms of strength of phenological synchrony than those further apart. In blue tits, this spatial structure was more complex, with positive autocorrelation occurring at multiple spatial scales. At the pixel scale, blue tits were significantly more synchronized with vegetation green‐up than great tits. This may suggest that there are differences between the two species in the cues used to time laying, or in the scale that these cues are experienced.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that the extent to which great tits and blue tits matched the phenology of the local vegetation was related to habitat type. Pixels where birds were well synchronized with the vegetation green‐up were also those with high oak tree density. In contrast, in very oak‐poor areas of the woodland birds showed little or no synchrony with this measure of vegetation phenology. In Wytham, oak trees support the great majority of caterpillar biomass (Feeny 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0013">1970</a>; Wint 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0057">1983</a>) and great tit and blue tits are rarely seen foraging on beech, ash, or sycamore (Gibb 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0015">1954</a>). It is therefore not surprising that birds nesting in oak‐poor areas are not synchronizing their breeding with the vegetation phenology measures we detect via remote sensing (which will be largely driven by nonoak species). Instead, we might expect that their laying date may covary with the phenology of the few oak trees in the vicinity of their nest, which account for too small a percentage of overall canopy to be contribute significantly to the EVI2 signal. Alternatively, their timing may be synchronized with oak‐rich areas further from the nest (i.e., outside the pixel containing their nestbox). Oaks are a key component of great tit habitat; tits nesting on oak‐rich habitat tend to breed earlier, feed their young on a higher proportion of caterpillars and have higher reproductive success (Wilkin and Sheldon 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0055">2009</a>). It is therefore possible that the relationship we find between phenological synchrony of oak density is to some extent driven by good quality birds, which may be better at timing their breeding, settling in oak‐rich areas.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between phenological synchrony and oak prevalence was present in both tit species. Hazel was also a strong predictor of matching in great tits, but a much weaker predictor in blue tits. In early spring, great tits and blue tits vary in their foraging behavior; great tits are mainly observed feeding on and around hazel trees and then move to oak later in the spring, whereas blue tits favor oak throughout the spring and are considered the more specialized of the two species (Gibb 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0015">1954</a>; Stauss et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0047">2005</a>). Our results are in agreement with these observations as the amount of hazel in a pixel covaried with phenological matching in great tits (for whom hazel is a critical component of foraging habitat) but less so in blue tits (for whom hazel is far less important). Taken together, these results suggest that using satellite data with a 240‐m resolution may only be useful where the satellite‐derived green‐up signal is driven predominantly by the type of vegetation used by foraging tits (e.g., homogenous oak stands), rather than oak‐ and hazel‐poor woodlands.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intriguingly, green‐up dates for many of the MODIS pixels intersecting Wytham were in late March to mid‐April, before canopy species, such as oak, come into full leaf (see Figure S3). Similarly, a trend for earlier blue tit egg laying dates to be associated with pixels with higher NDVI values was noted at dates when oaks were still dormant in Southern France (Szulkin et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0049">2015</a>). This suggests that a significant amount of the green‐up signal may be caused by understory or ground‐level vegetation. However, the fact that satellite‐derived green‐up date can be used to predict timing of breeding tits, particularly in oak and hazel‐rich habitats, suggests that these metrics are providing biologically meaningful information about vegetation phenology. Further work is clearly needed to understand precisely which factors contribute to the remotely sensed phenological signal detected in different habitat types. Simply ground‐truthing satellite data using phenological data for individual trees and plants are likely to be logistically very difficult. At the level of individual trees, there is limited spatial autocorrelation in green‐up (E. F. Cole &amp; B. C. Sheldon, unpubl. data), meaning that ground truthing may require sampling hundreds or thousands of trees and shrubs. One potential approach could be to use a combination of detailed habitat data and high‐resolution green‐up data collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to better determine species‐specific green‐up signatures in mixed woodlands.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we used satellite data with the highest spatial resolution available (given the additional requirement for high temporal resolution) for quantifying vegetation phenology in Wytham. The relatively coarse‐grained nature of these data limits the ability to analyze phenological synchrony at the finest scale. While satellite data with high spatial resolution do exist (e.g., Landsat7 up to 15 m resolution), the temporal resolution is too low to retrospectively quantify spring green‐up. It may be possible to increase the spatial resolution of MODIS data using a swath cumulation technique, which uses the finer scale geo‐referencing of the ungridded data from the MODIS sensors (Packalén and Maltamo 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0032">2007</a>; Scambos et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0044">2007</a>), and by combining satellite data from multiple sources. Another potential method of obtaining high‐resolution remotely sensed vegetation phenology data is via frequent surveys using UAVs. These devices are becoming increasingly affordable and have an extremely high spatial resolution (e.g., subdecimeter) (Chabot and Bird 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0005">2013</a>). As technology improves, these types of devices are likely to play an important role in the study of spatial ecology (Anderson and Gaston 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0001">2013</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sources of error in satellite data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite data can suffer from multiple sources of error caused by atmospheric and ground conditions and sensor resolution and calibration (Pettorelli et al. 
   <a rid="ece31745-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0035">2005</a>). MODIS EVI2 datasets, in addition to many similar products, have been quality‐controlled and preprocessed to minimize these types of error. However, one factor that limits the reliability of all satellite‐derived multispectral data is the amount of cloud cover. Cloudiness varies considerably across both time and space, with the UK experiencing higher than average cloudiness relative to continental Europe. We used MODIS cloud fraction data to show that early spring cloudiness, which differs between years (see Figure S4), relates to our ability to estimate vegetation green‐up dates from MODIS data. In years with high levels of cloudiness during February and March, we found little or no correlation between individual laying date and nestbox‐specific green‐up, in both great tits and blue tits. However, when early spring cloudiness was low, a much stronger relationship between vegetation and tit phenology was detected. This is likely to reflect the fact that in cloudy years, our estimates of green‐up are less reliable because green‐up trajectories will be based on a smaller number of clear images. Cloud cover is therefore a significant limitation to using satellite data to study animal phenology, and results based on these data should always be interpreted with care.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is encouraging that, despite a mean cloudiness of 79% in January–March at the study site (see Figs. 
   <a rid="ece31745-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31745-fig-0006">6</a>, S4 and S5), the remotely sensed signal of vegetation green‐up was sufficiently strong to reveal significant relationships with animal phenological traits. The pixel‐wise approach taken in this study, where green‐up measures for each 8‐day period are calculated by averaging multiple observations, means that despite high average cloud cover, it is still possible to obtain enough clear looks to estimate a time series of EVI2 for each pixel. Clearly the more cloud‐free observations, the more accurate the estimate of green‐up date will be. Given that Wytham has higher than average cloudiness with respect to the rest of Europe, this study suggests that the potential for using satellite data in predicting small‐scale phenological variation in other long‐term studies in temperate regions may be even greater.
