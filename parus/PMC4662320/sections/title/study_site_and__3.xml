 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was carried out using a nestbox population of great tits and blue tits at Wytham Woods (51°46′N, 1°20′W), a mixed‐deciduous 385‐ha woodland in Oxfordshire. The canopy composition is primarily oak (
  <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>), ash (
  <span class="italic">Fraxinus excelsior</span>), sycamore (
  <span class="italic">Acer pseudoplatanus</span>), and beech (
  <span class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</span>), with an understory of hawthorn (
  <span class="italic">Crataegus momgyna</span>), hazel (
  <span class="italic">Corylus avellana</span>), elder (
  <span class="italic">Sambucus niger</span>), and field maple (Acer 
  <span class="italic">campestre</span>) (Perrins 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0034">1965</a>). All live oak trees in Wytham with a diameter at breast height of 30 cm of greater (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 5425) were mapped using handheld GPS during February 2011. Wytham is divided into 121 discrete compartment bounded by paths and linear features (mean area = 3.15 ha, standard deviation = 2.90, see Figure S1). At the same time that the oaks were mapped, habitat data were collected for each of the 121 compartments. For each compartment, the proportion of canopy that was composed of each tree species (oak, ash, beech, birch, sycamore, cedar, field maple, fir, hemlock, larch, poplar, pine, spruce, sweet chestnut, willow, other) was estimated by eye, as well as the percentage of overall canopy cover. Similar data were collected for the understory layer (species: hazel, hawthorn, blackthorn, birch, elder, field maple, holly and willow, other). These measures were estimated by experienced forestry ecologists.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Great tit and blue tit breeding data spanning 13 years (2001–2013) were collected as part of the long‐term study of tits in Wytham (see McCleery et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0026">2004</a>; Wood et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0059">2007</a>). We used this timespan because full monitoring of blue tit nests did not begin until 2001. In order to compare effects in the two species, we therefore restricted the great tit data to 2001–2013. There are 1207 nestboxes in Wytham, the locations of which were digitally mapped using a differential GPS system (Wilkin et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0056">2007</a>); 1020 of these are standard boxes used by both tit species (entrance hole diameter: 32 mm), and the remaining 187 have smaller entrance holes (diameter: 26 mm), which prevent great tits from entering. During April and May, all nestboxes are visited weekly to monitor breeding attempts. Tits generally lay one egg a day for approximately 8 days (Perrins 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0034">1965</a>), and therefore, the date when the first egg is laid in a nest (hereafter laying date) can be inferred by counting backwards from the date that the clutch was observed (e.g., a nest with 3 eggs on 3rd April would have a laying date of 1st April). Hatch date is ascertained by visiting all nests on alternate days from the eleventh day after clutch completion until hatching. Parents were captured at the nest while feeding 8‐ to 12‐day‐old nestlings and ringed with a unique metal leg ring or identified if already ringed. Age and sex of parents were established on the basis of plumage characteristics (Svensson 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0048">1994</a>). Only clutches laid within 30 days of the first clutch of the year were used in this study to exclude second breeding attempts by individuals (van Noordwijk et al.
