 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Timing of the population peak in winter moth larvae abundance is measured every year as part of a long‐term study (see Charmantier et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0006">2008</a>). The half‐fall date (the date by which 50% of the seasonal total of larvae has descended to the ground to pupate) was determined for the same four oak trees at a single site in Wytham. This was done by placing two water traps, 100 × 50 cm in size, under each tree. Traps were visited regularly throughout the spring to count and remove fallen winter moth larvae. These data give an indication of the relative timing of the population peak of caterpillar biomass and are strongly correlated with annual variation in great tit timing of breeding (Charmantier et al.
