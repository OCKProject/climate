 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All analyses were run on the great tit dataset and the blue tit dataset independently. To address our first objective, we used linear models to test the relationship between annual green‐up dates (average green‐up date for all pixels containing more than 50% woodland) and (1) annual caterpillar half‐fall date; (2) annual mean laying date and (3) annual mean hatching date (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 13 years). Linear mixed models (LMMs) were used to address our second objective, exploration of the relationship between within‐year individual variation timing of breeding (laying dates and hatch dates) and nestbox‐specific green‐up dates. Green‐up dates were partitioned into between‐year variation (annual mean green‐up date) and within‐year variation (deviation from annual mean green‐up date), following methods from van de Pol and Wright (
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0037">2009</a>), to control for between‐year effects. We first ran minimal models containing no additional fixed effects to determine the strength of the relationship between vegetation green‐up and timing of breeding. We then ran models that controlled for three known environmental correlates of laying date in our population: altitude (in meters), distance to the edge of the woodland (in meters), and local oak density (number of oak trees within 75 m of a nestbox: see Wilkin et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0056">2007</a>). These environmental factors may themselves explain a portion of the variation in green‐up at any given location – for example, vegetation green‐up is likely to be later at higher altitudes. We therefore wanted to test whether vegetation green‐up explained variation in timing of breeding above and beyond that explained by these known environmental factors. All models also included the random effects of nestbox ID and year. Ideally, female identity should be controlled for in these analyses to account for individuals that breed in successive years being represented in the dataset more than once. However, we did not included this effect in our main models because a significant proportion of breeding attempts failed before the associated female could be identified or the female was not successfully caught. It was inappropriate to exclude these breeding attempts from the analysis because they represented a biased sample of laying dates. Identified females began laying significantly earlier than unidentified females (mean laying date ± SE: great tits: female ID unknown: 21.66 ± 0.27, female ID known: 21.06 ± 0.12, LM: 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = −2.06, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.039, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 4597; blue tits: female ID unknown: 20.68 ± 0.21, female ID known: 19.21 ± 0.12, LM: 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = −5.89, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 5221). However, we reran all analyses including female ID as a random factor and present results in the supplementary material (see Table S1). Local oak density was calculated using GIS software (ArcGIS 10.2), by mapping the locations of all oak trees and nestboxes and then calculating the number of oak trees within a 75 m buffer around each nestbox (see Wilkin et al. (
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0056">2007</a>) for details of methodology). A radius of 75 m was used because a previous study on the Wytham great tit population compared the predictive power of oak density within different sized buffers around each box to explain variation in laying date and found that 75 m explained the most variation (Wilkin et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0056">2007</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To address our final objective – establishing whether the relationship between satellite‐derived green‐up and tit phenology varies across the woodland, for each pixel, we calculated the correlation coefficient quantifying the relationship between annual average laying date for that pixel and annual pixel green‐up date. This pixel‐level analysis was restricted to the 67 pixels that were comprised of 50% woodland or more (see Figure S2) in order to reduce the signal interference caused by farmland that borders the woodland. For the great tit analysis, three further pixels were excluded, one because it did not include any great tit breeding attempts, and two, because the correlation coefficients for these pixels were based on only three data points each (i.e., birds only bred in these pixels 3 of 13 years). The remaining 64 pixels each had between 9 and 13 data points (i.e., 9–13 years where great tits bred in a given pixel). Similarly for the blue tit analysis, two pixels were excluded because they were based on three and five data points. The remaining 65 pixels each had between 8 and 13 data points.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether habitat type related to the degree of phenological synchrony between tit and vegetation phenology at the pixel level, we ran linear regressions with the pixel correlation coefficient (laying date vs. green‐up) as the response variable and fixed effects: proportion of pixel canopy comprised of ash, oak, beech, sycamore, and proportion of the understory comprised of hazel, hawthorn, elder, and field maple. These eight species are the dominant vegetation types in Wytham, accounting for 31%, 27%, 14%, and 11% of the canopy vegetation, respectively, and 44%, 33%, 7%, and 6% of the understory vegetation, respectively. Relationships between pixel‐level synchrony and abundance of each of the eight tree and shrub species were tested separately as their relative abundance was not independent of one another. Pixel‐level canopy and understory data were then calculated by overlaying the 240 m MODIS pixels and the habitat compartments (see study site section) using ArcGIS 10.2 software, and weighting compartment habitat values based on the proportion they contributed to the area of a given pixel. These models included all pixels composed of greater than 50% woodland and were weighted based on the total number of breeding attempts in each pixel to account for the variation in confidence in the pixel correlation coefficients. We examined the spatial structure in laying date and phenological synchrony using Mantel correlograms. All analyses were carried out using R version R 3.0.1 (
