 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of remotely sensed vegetation data in ecology is often thought to mainly be applicable to herbivorous species (see Pettorelli et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0036">2011</a>), but there are in fact many studies that have successfully used these data to explore ecological questions in nonherbivorous birds and mammals (reviewed in Pettorelli et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0036">2011</a>; Hurley et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0021">2014</a>). This is possible in systems where the availability of prey for the species of interest is strongly influenced by vegetation characteristics. The tri‐trophic food chain of tits, caterpillars, and oak trees is an example of such a system. The peak in winter moth caterpillar biomass is highly dependent on the budburst date of oak trees, its favored host species (van Asch and Visser 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0002">2007</a>). Indeed, a recent study in Wytham found a strong correlation (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.67) between oak bud‐burst date and the date of the peak in caterpillar abundance at the level of individual trees (Hinks et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0018">2015</a>). Furthermore, the same study also found that individual differences in onset of laying by great tits could be predicted by the phenology of the nearest oaks to a nesting site (Hinks et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0018">2015</a>). These findings suggest that the timing of oak spring green‐up can be used as a reliable predictor for when nestling prey is most abundant in the environment.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we used vegetation green‐up dates derived from MODIS satellite data as a proxy for oak tree spring phenology, but acknowledge it is likely to capture green‐up of a range of understory and canopy species. A similar approach has been applied using MODIS's predecessor, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), to relate advancing oak phenology to average timing of breeding in pied flycatchers (
  <span class="italic">Ficedula hypoleuca</span>) across years (Sanz et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0043">2003</a>). This study used data with a spatial resolution of 8 km and therefore could not look at within‐population variation in bird phenology. In addition to providing data with a higher spatial resolution, MODIS sensors collect data with a greater spectral resolution and have improved geo‐location accuracy and atmospheric corrections (Soudani et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0046">2008</a>). There are various different methods of calculating spring phenological transition dates for deciduous woodlands (see Jönsson and Eklundh 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0023">2004</a>), mostly corresponding to the date at which the rate of change in curvature in a vegetation index (VI) exhibits local minima or maxima (Zhang et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0060">2003</a>). These include the date of onset of photosynthetic activity (Zhang et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0060">2003</a>), the date of maximum rate of change in VI (Soudani et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0046">2008</a>; Busetto et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0004">2010</a>), averaged VI in a fixed time window (Sanz et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0043">2003</a>), and the date corresponding to the half‐maxima of a sigmoid curve fitted to the vegetation data (Fisher et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0014">2006</a>). A recent study compared field measurements of tree bud‐burst to several different phenological green‐up parameters, derived from MODIS data, for multiple mixed oak and beech forest stands (Soudani et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0046">2008</a>). It was shown that the inflexion point of the piece‐wise logistic curve fitted to VI data (i.e., the point of maximum rate of change) was the best indicator of the onset of oak and beech bud‐burst in deciduous woodlands. This measure was also influenced less by understory phenology than the date of onset of VI increase (Soudani et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0046">2008</a>). In this study, we used GAMs to calculate a very similar metric, which were selected because we did not want to impose any prior assumption on the shape of the green‐up curve.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, we found that the spatial patterns of pixel green‐up dates varied considerably from year to year (see Figs. 
  <a rid="ece31745-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31745-fig-0004">4</a> and S3). Even though the spring phenology of individual trees and shrubs is likely to be repeatable (Crawley and Akhteruzzaman 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0011">1988</a>; Wesołowski and Rowiński 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0054">2006</a>), the spring green‐up of different tree species is influenced by different environmental factors (e.g., winter chilling, photoperiod), and therefore, species will not always green‐up in the same order relative to each other (Roberts et al. 
  <a rid="ece31745-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31745-bib-0040">2015</a>). In mixed species woodlands, this will likely lead to complex spatial patterns of green‐up that vary across years. Differences between years may also arise due to variation in spring cloudiness, which could conceivably influence the reliability of estimates of green‐up (see 
  <a rid="ece31745-sec-0013" ref-type="sec" href="#ece31745-sec-0013">Discussion</a> below).
