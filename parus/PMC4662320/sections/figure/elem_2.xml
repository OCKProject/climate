 <div class="caption">
  <p>Spatial variation in mean laying date for all nestboxes 2001–2013 for (A) great tits and (B) blue tits. Dot size represents the number of years each box was occupied. As the blue tit breeding attempts were spread over a greater number of nestboxes (see methods section), dot size for blue tits is enlarged (×1.5) for illustrative purposes. Correlogram demonstrating positive and negative spatial autocorrelation at multiple spatial scales for (C) great tits and (D) blue tits (run on nestboxes occupied 7 or more times). Closed squares indicate significant autocorrelation (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05) and open squares nonsignificant values. Data corrected for annual and female‐specific effects.
