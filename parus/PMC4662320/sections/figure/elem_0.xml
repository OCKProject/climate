  <p>Method for calculating pixel‐specific vegetation green‐up dates: (A) 117 MODIS pixels (240 m × 240 m) which intersect with Wytham (gray dots show nestboxes); enhanced vegetation index was calculated for each pixel for every 8‐day period, (B) an example generalized additive model (GAM) curve fitted to the EVI2 data for a single pixel, and (C) plot showing the change in EVI2 over time for the same data, the arrow indicates maximum rate of change, and the vegetation green‐up date. Dashed lines in (B) and (C) show 95% confidence intervals.</p>
