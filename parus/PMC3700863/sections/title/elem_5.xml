 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Average monthly climate data (precipitation, minimum, and maximum temperature) were retrieved from 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.worldclim.org</span> with a 2.5 arc-minutes grid resolution (∼5 km×5 km resolution) for the current and future time periods (2020, 2050, and 2080). Nineteen bioclimatic variables were generated for the current and future conditions by using average monthly climate data, and the software ArcGIS v. 10.0 and DivaGIS

  <a rid="pone.0068037-Hijmans1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Hijmans1">[35]</a>. Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3 (HADCM3) was used as our global climate model to simulate the impact of the IPPC third assessment storylines A2a and B2a 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Collins1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Collins1">[36]</a> on future climate conditions. All these layers were masked on an area between 26°E and 45°E and 36°N and 42°N, which includes the entire territory of Turkey.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A series of a correlation tests were conducted and correlation matrices were generated for all 19 bioclimatic variables using the software ENMTools 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Warren1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Warren1">[37]</a> in order to eliminate bioclimatic variables that include redundant information for the models. This software helps assess the identity and similarity of ecological niches or variables. Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.75 was used as a threshold to pair highly correlated bioclimatic variables 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Rissler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Rissler1">[38]</a>. Eight biologically meaningful variables were chosen as a result of this treatment, and were used in all subsequent analyses (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0068037-t003" href="#pone-0068037-t003">Table 3</a>). For migratory species, instead of the two variables BIO1 (Annual Mean Temperature) and BIO14 (Precipitation of Driest Month), their correlated variables BIO10 (Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter) and BIO18 (Precipitation of Warmest Quarter), were used respectively as they are more directly associated with the warmer summer season when these migratory species are actually present. Using these eight bioclimatic variables, projections for 2020, 2050, and 2080 time periods were produced.
