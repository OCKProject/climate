 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The binary presence/absence maps of each species were produced for the time periods current, 2020, 2050 and 2080, using the Maxent probabilities and 10 percentile training presence logistic thresholds as a cut-off parameter 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Raes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Raes1">[40]</a>. In order to produce species richness (biodiversity) maps for each modelled scenario and time period, all binary maps from each speciesâ€™ biogeographic group were combined. ArcGIS v. 10.0 software and scripts prepared in Python programming language 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Keiolu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Keiolu1">[41]</a> were used while combining the maps. This made it possible to construct maps depicting the possible loss or gain of species in a particular area (pixel) over time.
