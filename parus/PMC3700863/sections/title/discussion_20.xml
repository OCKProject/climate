 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both climate scenarios have similarities with regard to the potential impacts of climate change upon resident and summer migrant breeding birds in Turkey. For the resident species, seasonality of temperature, seasonality of precipitation, annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, and precipitation of the driest month were identified as the most important bioclimatic variables that affect the presence or absence of the selected songbird species. Mean temperature and precipitation of the warmest quarter, and seasonality of precipitation were the most important bioclimatic variables for summer migratory species. These results are in line with past findings, which indicate that temperature, food and water source availability contribute significantly to songbird migration and survival

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the species analyzed within the scope of this study exhibit a clear tendency for overall displacements towards the north. However, the magnitude of these displacements varies amongst species and between the two climate scenarios examined. The greatest range shifts expected, on the range of several hundred kilometres, are for the Great Tit, Rock Sparrow, White-spectacled Bulbul, and Eastern Rock Nuthatch among the resident species, and Rufous-tailed Scrub-robin and Subalpine Warbler among the migratory species we studied. These results analyzed in conjunction with the data on species’ expansions might provide some additional insights. For instance, Great Tit, while increasing its range about 50%, exhibits a large shift in its centroid (∼468 km), indicating that its numbers will deteriorate in its current range. Hence displacement might be a threat for Great Tit, although its range is not necessarily decreasing. The case is even worse for Eastern Rock-nuthatch whose range is predicted to decrease by about 50%, with a coupled big shift between its centroid locations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model results suggest that some songbird species will show different patterns than other songbirds and not all studied species are likely to experience niche reductions. This could be due to multiple reasons. First, the reaction of individual species to climate change depends on their adaptive potential and also the current and potential future rate of change in climate, which are not the same between regions 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-BarbetMassin2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-BarbetMassin2">[44]</a>. Second, Turkey is a key area for geographical variation of bird populations, as the birds of the Western Palearctic found in various habitats such as European deciduous forests, Mediterranean scrub and wetlands, Arabian semi-desert, Caucasian Mountains and central Asian steppes all meet in Turkey 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Roselaar1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Roselaar1">[27]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Kirwan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Kirwan1">[28]</a>. These subpopulations are observed all over the country, which spans a diverse range of climate. For example, one of the study species, Crested Lark 
  <span class="italic">Galerida cristata</span>, has five subspecies recorded in Turkey: 
  <span class="italic">G. c. meridionalis</span> is observed in the Aegean and the Mediterranean regions, 
  <span class="italic">G. c. subtaurica</span> in the Central Anatolia and Eastern Anatolia regions, 
  <span class="italic">G. c. caucasica</span> in the coastal zone of the Black Sea, 
  <span class="italic">G. c. cinnamomina</span> around Hatay Province, and 
  <span class="italic">G. c. zion</span> in southeastern Turkey. All of these subspecies’ inhabit areas that have almost completely different bioclimatic features. If our objectives in this study were to consider and identify possible dispersal changes at the subspecies level, we would have probably observed more significant changes than what we detected at the species level.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, in migratory species, there is a decrease in no modelled presence (from 44% for current to 18–20% for future periods). A decrease is also predicted in the areas which contain 15 to 20 resident species (from 73% to 65%) and five to nine migratory species analysed (from 6% to 3%). This indicates clear and predictable range shifts for the migratory species we studied, as these birds look for specific bioclimatic features either for breeding or wintering 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Jonzn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Jonzn1">[45]</a>. Therefore even small changes in local climate scenarios are expected to affect most of the common migratory species we studied.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two (under B2a) or three (under A2a) of the 20 resident and five of the nine migratory studied species in both scenarios are predicted to experience contractions in their total occupied area. Furthermore, nearly 42% and 46% of future modelled presence for resident and migratory species, respectively, will occur in areas that do not contain the same species today. These results show that songbird species will need to shift their ranges in order to adapt to climate change and the phenological changes are likely to cause changes in distributions, as observed in other species 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Root1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Root1">[5]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Walther1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Walther1">[9]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Both2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Both2">[20]</a>. An assumption of our analyses was that every species could migrate independently between different areas. Hence, if an area is bioclimatically suitable for a species, the species is considered to be able to migrate into that new area with 100% dispersal ability. On the other hand, if the climatic conditions are not ideal for a species, a species is expected to immediately abandon a certain area. However, areas that fulfil all the necessary climatic conditions for a species might not meet other crucial conditions for a species’ existence, such as food and roosts, or these areas may not have suitable vegetation due to the presence of cities, fields, and other human-dominated habitats. Hence, our models project the best-case scenarios in terms of species distributions. These major range shifts may be impossible if there is no suitable habitat available in species’ future ranges, a likely scenario given the rapid expansion of humanity’s footprint in Turkey at the expense of wildlife

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential reductions in the extent of some species’ breeding distributions will put a number of species at risk of extinction in the region. Moreover, some species’ potential future distributions do not overlap with their current distributions. This will lead to significant population decreases and put additional species at risk of extinction, especially if the dispersal capabilities of these species are limited. These include migratory species such as Cretzschmar's Bunting, Mountain Chiffchaff, Greenish Warbler, and Subalpine Warbler. On the other hand, potential expected distributions of some of the species examined indicate dramatic expansions. Those species that extend their breeding distributions and colonize new areas could pose competitive risks for already resident species that show more or less stable distributions. These risks include competition for high quality habitat and nesting sites, and reduced breeding success due to increased competition and insufficient food resources 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Both2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Both2">[20]</a>. Therefore, while the sensitive species will be affected negatively, the dominant and expanding ones are likely to benefit from these new climatic conditions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results demonstrate that climate change in Turkey will not affect every species in the same manner. Overall, there is not a significant decrease in the area occupied by the resident species we analysed, but there is substantial species turnover. The maximum decrease in area occupied for a resident species we analysed is projected for Eastern Rock Nuthatch, with a decrease of 44% in scenario B2a. However, the distributions of three summer migratory species, Common Rosefinch, Greenish Warbler, and Subalpine Warbler, are expected to decline by more than 50% by 2080. Among these species, Subalpine Warbler is expected to suffer the most drastic range reductions; our models indicate &gt;90% decline in its current breeding area by the year 2050 in both scenarios and &gt;99% by 2080 in scenario B2a. If roosting and habitat limitations are considered, the actual decrease in occupied areas will likely be higher than the models suggest, so the breeding populations of the Subalpine Warbler in Turkey may go extinct by 2080. On the other hand, three resident species (Eurasian Jackdaw, House Sparrow, and White-spectacled Bulbul) and four migratory species (Rufous-tailed Scrub-robin, Red-rumped Swallow, Olive-tree Warbler, Masked Shrike) are project to have more than 150% and 100% increases in their distributions, respectively. The highest increase in a resident species is expected for White-spectacled Bulbul (992%), and in a migratory species, for Rufous-tailed Scrub-robin (315% in scenario A2a). Both species are found in the typical hot Mediterranean climate in southern Turkey, and with increasing temperatures, these species are expected to expand their ranges in Turkey four to eleven-fold.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study has shown that there will be extensive turnover across Turkey in the species composition of bird communities, with some species declining and others expanding their ranges. The outputs of our species models show that summer migratory species whose breeding areas are in the northern (Common Rosefinch, Mountain Chiffchaff, and Greenish Warbler
  <span class="italic">)</span> and western (Subalpine Warbler) parts of Turkey will progressively lose suitable climate space. Alternatively, species that have restricted breeding areas in the southern parts of the country will have the potential to expand their ranges to the northwestern parts of the study area. It is also likely that some Middle Eastern species currently not found in Turkey may expand their ranges into Turkey in response to climate change. The consequences of climate change in terms of movement between different geographic regions are, therefore, variable.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the lack of sufficient data, our study was able to model the potential future distributions of only 29 of Turkey’s 151 known bird passerine species. Approximately 360 bird species out of 470 are regularly found in Turkey and among these are many European bird species that are expected to change their distributions due to climate change 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Schaefer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Schaefer1">[46]</a>. Due to the low numbers of amateur and professional ornithologists in Turkey, most bird species do not have sufficient distributional data to enable the analyses we have undertaken. An urgent priority is to increase ornithological research in Turkey and make better use of data collected by amateur but experienced birdwatchers 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-ekerciolu3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-ekerciolu3">[47]</a>, whose numbers are steadily increasing in the country. Our study is an important first step for similar future investigations that will have access to bigger data sets in Turkey and in the region.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the country level, some of the modelled species are expected to be highly sensitive to climate change. For these species, more detailed monitoring is required to verify the predictions of our models. Conservation management and regulations may need to be strengthened for these species, in order to continue their existence in Turkey. Increasing and restoring potential habitats by expanding protected areas will help in maintaining the populations of some species. Translocation may be another method to decrease the vulnerability of these species. However, translocations are unlikely to be feasible except in a few cases, and for the species in our study area with predominantly western and northern distributions, the disappearance of climatically suitable habitat will pose a major risk of extinction.</p>
