  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We modelled the distributions of resident (non-migratory) and migratory songbirds, using presence-only data from the Kuşbank database (“Birdbank”, 
   <a rid="pone.0068037-Kubank1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Kubank1">[30]</a>), which holds over 430,000 records of the birds of Turkey. These publicly-available data consist of observations collected by ornithologists and amateur birdwatchers. Bird records are publicly seen and validated by the administrators and the rest of Turkey’s birdwatching community. Providers of unusual records are asked to provide detailed supporting information to be reviewed by experts, in a manner similar to Cornell University’s e-bird 
   <a rid="pone.0068037-Wood1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Wood1">[32]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When we undertook our analyses, the number of songbird species submitted to Kuşbank was 151 and the corresponding number of records was over 152,000. Among these, a total of 57,149 records corresponding to 29 (20 resident/non-migratory and nine summer migratory) songbird bird species were selected for modelling. We used the following criteria for selecting species for analysis.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We limited our analysis to species with sufficient occurrence data. Only species with more than 25 data points were chosen for modeling. 15 species were excluded due to this criterion. Another requirement was for the existing records of a species to be relatively evenly distributed throughout the study area. Almost half of the songbird species and their records are artificially concentrated in some popular and frequently visited sites in or around the cities. These species had to be excluded from the analyses, as the use of these records would create a strong bias. After this initial round of species selection, we validated the data for possible misidentification and tried to reduce possible biases. An assumption of our analyses is that because songbirds are mobile species, each species has the ability to move independently between different areas. We first homogenized the sampling effort by removing the records from existing local Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS) and ringing (banding) stations. Therefore, we reduced a possible source of bias due to excessive number of records at some sites. For migratory species, we excluded the records outside the breeding season (April 15–July 30), as these migration records likely represent non-breeding ranges. To cope with excessively harsh climatic conditions during winter, some resident bird species can exhibit medium- to large-scale changes in their ranges, exhibit nomadism, and roost in other locations than those they prefer during breeding. Therefore, all winter observations, between December 1st and January 31th, were excluded from our analyses. Finally, the records of three cryptic species (Olive-tree Warbler 
   <span class="italic">Hippolais olivetorum</span>, Greenish Warbler 
   <span class="italic">Phylloscopus trochiloides</span>, and Mountain Chiffchaff 
   <span class="italic">Phylloscopus sindianus</span>) were validated based on the observations of experienced birdwatchers only. These cryptic species are difficult to differentiate and require extensive experience to identify. After selecting the data to minimize bias, models were run for the remaining species, and the results were compared with already known species distribution maps

   <a rid="pone.0068037-Kirwan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Kirwan1">[28]</a>. Following visual inspection, the species whose models did not match their known distributions were excluded from the subsequent analyses.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate envelope was built with the data on species and climate. The locations of particular species were used as dependent variables, and various climatic data were used as independent variables. Subsequently, the relationship between a species’ known distribution and various climatic variables were quantified.</p>

   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent</span>), a maximum entropy modelling method, was used to estimate species actual geographic distributions based on presence data. Maxent is a general-purpose algorithm that can generate predictions or inferences from an incomplete set of information. Predictive maps generated by Maxent express suitability of each grid cell as a function of the environmental variables in that grid cell 
   <a rid="pone.0068037-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Phillips1">[39]</a>. The models were run with the default settings of Maxent: auto features, 10,000 background points, regularization multiplier = 1.0, maximum iterations = 1000 and convergence threshold = 0.00005. To assess the importance of each predictor variable, the jackknifing procedures were implemented in Maxent. The area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) was used to assess overall model performance, where an AUC score of 0.5 indicates a random prediction, and a score of 1 a perfect prediction. In order to assess the robustness of the model to sampling variation, 25% of the presence data from the original dataset were chosen randomly to test the model while the remaining 75% were used in training it.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The binary presence/absence maps of each species were produced for the time periods current, 2020, 2050 and 2080, using the Maxent probabilities and 10 percentile training presence logistic thresholds as a cut-off parameter 
   <a rid="pone.0068037-Raes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Raes1">[40]</a>. In order to produce species richness (biodiversity) maps for each modelled scenario and time period, all binary maps from each species’ biogeographic group were combined. ArcGIS v. 10.0 software and scripts prepared in Python programming language 
   <a rid="pone.0068037-Keiolu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Keiolu1">[41]</a> were used while combining the maps. This made it possible to construct maps depicting the possible loss or gain of species in a particular area (pixel) over time.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Presence or absence of a species in a cell is indicated by 1 or 0, respectively. In order to create presence overlap maps for different time periods, current data were multiplied by predicted future data for each cell. In these maps, the locations where a species is present both in current and predicted time periods is indicated by 1. The percentage of presence overlap was calculated by dividing the count of locations where species were found to be present in predicted future presence maps by the presence counts in the current maps. Python scripts in ArcGIS were also used for making these calculations 
   <a rid="pone.0068037-Keiolu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Keiolu1">[41]</a>. In addition, zonal centroids of the presence models were calculated using ArcGIS 10.0 both in current and predicted time periods. The analyses approximate the geometry of each zone by creating an ellipse fixed at the centroid of each zonal spatial shape and include the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of each zone.
