 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate envelope was built with the data on species and climate. The locations of particular species were used as dependent variables, and various climatic data were used as independent variables. Subsequently, the relationship between a species’ known distribution and various climatic variables were quantified.</p>

Maxent is a general-purpose algorithm that can generate predictions or inferences from an incomplete set of information. Predictive maps generated by Maxent express suitability of each grid cell as a function of the environmental variables in that grid cell 
  <a rid="pone.0068037-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0068037-Phillips1">[39]</a>. The models were run with the default settings of Maxent: auto features, 10,000 background points, regularization multiplier = 1.0, maximum iterations = 1000 and convergence threshold = 0.00005. To assess the importance of each predictor variable, the jackknifing procedures were implemented in Maxent. The area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) was used to assess overall model performance, where an AUC score of 0.5 indicates a random prediction, and a score of 1 a perfect prediction. In order to assess the robustness of the model to sampling variation, 25% of the presence data from the original dataset were chosen randomly to test the model while the remaining 75% were used in training it.
