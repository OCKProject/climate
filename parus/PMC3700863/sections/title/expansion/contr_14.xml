 <div class="title">Expansion/contraction pattern of the species by years in scenario a. resident species, A2a b. resident species, B2a c. migratory species, A2a d. migratory species, B2a (the bars above zero point indicate expansion of species).</div>
 <p>Bar heights were determined by calculating the total grid area of a speciesâ€™ predicted presence for both the current and future time periods. Bars above or below the x-axis represent the expansion or contraction in the distribution area of a particular species, respectively.</p>
