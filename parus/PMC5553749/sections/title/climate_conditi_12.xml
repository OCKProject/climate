  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. In addition, habitat quality at stopover sites can also be affected by precipitation that falls in the winter and spring (November–May). Rainfall in arid and/or desert regions within the flyway may have a disproportionate effect on survival, and variation in precipitation in the desert region of the western flyway was associated with variation in the annual survival of Swainson’s Thrush [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. We predicted that westerly (U) and southerly (V) wind speeds and the number of storm nights on the migratory flyway during the migratory period (April–May) would have negative effects, and that precipitation in either the desert region or arid region of the flyway would have positive effects on the annual survival of chats (“Model set 4”; Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Modeled climate data on the migration route was also obtained from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis database using RNCEP [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. Precipitation data were extracted from “arid” (N = 52) and “desert” (N = 23) zones within the western flyway [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>], whereas wind speed data was extracted from the entire flyway (N = 49; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>).
