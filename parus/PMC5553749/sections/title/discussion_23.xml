 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Large-scale climatic phenomenon such as ENSO have profound impacts on regional weather conditions, including temperature, rainfall patterns, and wind conditions. These climate regimes influence the survival and breeding phenology of neotropical migratory birds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>] Temperature and precipitation have major implications on foliage productivity and insect abundance, which in turn can affect the survival of migrating songbirds during all stages of their annual cycle [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. Adverse wind conditions and extreme storm events, in comparison, can either cause direct mortality or result in higher energetic cost for migrating individuals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. In this study, we found evidence that the annual adult survival rate of a neotropical migrant, the western yellow-breasted chat, was negatively and most strongly associated with westerly wind speed during the spring migration from the central west coast of Mexico to southwestern Canada. Further, the frequency of storm events in their spring migration route had a negative effect on their annual survival, whereas GDD from January to May on their breeding ground had a positive effect.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The negative effect of wind conditions was either as a result of higher average westerly wind speed or the high frequency of storm events on the migration route of yellow breasted chats. These two climate indices were correlated, and both described variation in annual apparent survival, making it hard to distinguish between the effects of extended periods with high crosswinds and the effects of less frequent extreme events. Previous studies have similarly shown that wind conditions during migration negatively influenced the annual apparent survival of other migratory birds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>], including yellow warblers (
  <span class="italic">Setophaga petechial</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]), and chimney swifts (
  <span class="italic">Chaetura pelagica</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]). Our 15 years of long-term study corroborated the findings of other shorter term studies that varied from 3 to 9 years (7, 10). Favourable tailwind conditions facilitate migratory flight, and thereby allow birds to expend less energy per unit distance. On the other hand, turbulences and strong winds against the direction of their flight path can result in less efficient migratory flights, leading to greater energy expenditure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. Adverse wind conditions deplete their energy reserves, potentially rendering individuals to either die of exhaustion or become more susceptible to depredation risks. Although most migrants stay grounded until windstorms have abated, individuals in the midst of migrating are at most risk of perishing or becoming displaced from these extreme storm events. The effects of windstorms are likely even more detrimental to the survival of migrants when they are flying across long stretches of landmass or waterbodies without suitable stopover sites (9). In the case of chats, the Great Basin, the Sonoran Desert, and the Gulf of Mexico may all act as migratory barriers.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternative explanation for the negative association between westerly wind speed and annual apparent survival is that strong westerly crosswinds cause migrating chats to stray off course and breed elsewhere, likely in the eastern or southern parts of their breeding range (7, 49). When faced with prevailing crosswinds, migrants may be pushed off their flight path, or compensate by reorienting their flight to offset the drift in order to remain philopatric to their breeding site at the cost of higher energy expenditure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>]. Migrants are more likely to opt for the latter strategy in situations where being blown off course means encountering inhospitable terrains such as oceans and deserts [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. In our study, chats that experienced strong westerly crosswinds on the pacific flyway could potentially afford to deviate eastward and still encounter potentially suitable stopover or breeding sites. Alternatively, chats may have also settled for more southern breeding grounds when unable to overcome the strong winds or storms, leading to individuals from the Okanagan (northern edge population) to shift further south in years where migratory conditions were unfavourable. This potential population dynamic shift can be confirmed by conducting similar survival estimates in the other populations across its range. Recent technological advances allowing tracking of small birds (e.g. MOTUS towers [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>]) may provide an opportunity to assess how chats and other species on different flyways respond to variation in wind conditions during flight [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study provided evidence that GDD on the breeding ground prior to the breeding season had a positive effect on the annual survival of chats. GDD has strong influences on primary productivity and insect biomass [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>], and has been shown to be a key driver of avian distribution and diversity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. Plant productivity positively predicts insect abundance [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>], which in turn, affects the breeding phenology and success of insectivorous passerines, including dusky flycatchers (
  <span class="italic">Empidonax oberholseri</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]), tit species (
  <span class="italic">Parus</span> spp. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>]), and horned larks (
  <span class="italic">Eremophila alpestris</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>]). Further, increased plant growth means denser foliage, potentially allowing for nests to be better concealed from predators and harsh weather [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>]. In years where GDD promoted ample food source and possibly better nest concealment in our study area, adult chats may have perceived the breeding habitat as high quality, and as a result demonstrated higher site fidelity.
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Abundant rainfall facilitates plant growth and insect biomass, and thereby has the potential to increase the survival of birds that use these areas for breeding, overwintering, or refueling during migration [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. The productivity of neotropical migrants breeding in the Pacific northwest of North America was higher in El Niño years (−ve SOI values), which are associated with wetter springtime weather along the Pacific slope from southern California to central Mexico [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. Contrary to those studies, we found little to suggest that ENSO or precipitation levels contributed to the the annual survival of chats. Similarly, other studies also found no evidence for ENSO or rainfall effects on the survival of American redstarts (
  <span class="italic">Setophaga ruticilla</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>]) and yellow warblers [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>] (but see LaManna et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]). An explanation for this lack of evidence could be that in years where primary productivity was poor along the migratory route, chats made more punctuated migratory bouts, enabling them to require lower fat store accumulation at stopover sites, as opposed to opting for the long-jump strategy which would demand greater metabolic expense. On its wintering ground, sites with declining Enhanced Vegetation Index (a proxy for plant productivity) had reportedly a positive impact on the within-winter survival of chats [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>]. This suggests that chats have adapted well to wintering habitat types characterized by relatively low plant productivity (e.g. lowland shrub-steppe and scrub habitat), and that while strong ENSO phases and greater precipitation may promote vegetation growth in these habitats, the cascading impact on chat survival is not significant.
