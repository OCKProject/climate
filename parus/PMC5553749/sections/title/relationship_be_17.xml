 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ENSO conditions over the course of the year, measured using the average SOI from May to April (SOI
  <sub>MAY–APR</sub>), was postively correlated with average westerly wind speeds and the frequency of storms in April and May (U-wind
  <sub>APR–MAY</sub>, r = 0.605, p = 0.02; Storm
  <sub>APR–MAY,</sub> r = 0.522, p = 0.06). SOI
  <sub>MAY–APR</sub> was not significantly correlated with any of the other climate variables (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S2). Breeding season climate variables (GDD
  <sub>JAN–MAY</sub>, Precipitation
  <sub>OCT–APR</sub>, Precipitation
  <sub>MAY–JUL</sub>) were not significantly intercorrelated (all r &lt; 0.45, Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S2). Precipitation on the wintering grounds from May to November was correlated with precipitation on the wintering grounds from December to April (r = 0.816, p = 0.004). Unsurprisingly, average westerly wind speeds on the migration flyway in April and May increased as the frequency of storms increased (r = 0.841, p = 0.002), and precipitation in desert regions of the migration flyway from November to May was highly correlated with precipitation in arid regions of the flyway (r = 0.927, p &lt; 0.001). Across periods the only climate variables that were significantly intercorrelated were precipitation on the breeding grounds from May to July and the frequency of storms on migration (r = 0.615, p = 0.02, Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S2).
