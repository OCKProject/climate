  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. However, the direction and degree to which ENSO is affected by climate change are unclear [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>]. We found that the frequency of storm events was negatively associated with chat survival, whereas GDD had a positive association. Both of those climate indices are expected to increase with climate change; whether the effects of one factor would offset the effects of another is unknown. Therefore, given such uncertainties, we are currently unable to predict with confidence the mechanistic effects of climate change on the population dynamics of chats. The interplay between these climate factors within the context of climate change will need to be further explored to elucidate how neotropical migrant bird survival will respond to a changing climate. We also recommend conducting a similar study for multiple chat populations across its range, allowing for a more complete and broader picture of the population dynamics with respect to climate conditions. Furthermore, understanding the cumulative effects of climate change and other anthropogenic threats such as habitat loss and man-made migration hazards will be critical to prioritize appropriate strategies for chats and other neotropical migratory passerines.
