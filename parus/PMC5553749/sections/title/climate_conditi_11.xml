 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ENSO has divergent effects on precipitation in western Mexico: El Niño is associated with more rainfall during the winter/spring in northwestern Mexico, whereas La Niña is associated with more summer monsoon rainfall in southwestern Mexico [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. Rainfall is expected to influence biological productivity on the wintering grounds, and as a result affect the overwinter survival and mass gain of migratory birds prior to spring migration [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. We therefore predicted that precipitation level on the wintering grounds during the monsoon and/or the late winter would influence the survival of chats (“Model set 3”; Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Modeled rainfall data on the wintering grounds was obtained from the National Center of Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis database, as provided by the NOAA-CIRES Climate Diagnostic Center at Boulder, CO, USA, using R package RNCEP [
