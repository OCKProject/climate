 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Annual apparent survival of chats was not related to the average ENSO conditions experienced over the course of the year. The model that included the SOI
  <sub>MAY-APR</sub> term received less support than the model indicating that annual apparent survival was constant, and the beta estimate for the SOI
  <sub>MAY–APR</sub> term had 95% CI intervals that spanned zero (−0.28 ± 0.20, −0.68 to 0.12).
