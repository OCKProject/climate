  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The yellow-breasted chat is a neotropical migratory songbird with a transcontinental distribution extending from southern Canada, the United States, Mexico, to Central America (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The western 
   <span class="italic">auricollis</span> subspecies has a fragmented breeding distribution in the west, which includes our study area in the south Okanagan valley of British Columbia, Canada, at the northern tip of the geographic range for this subspecies (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Genetic evidence indicates that the western subspecies overwinters on the westcoast of Mexico (southern Baja California, Sinaloa to Oxaca) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. Chats in the south Okanagan valley nest in low elevation (&gt;500 m) riparian thickets dominated by wild rose (

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. Their diet consists primarily of insects, but also includes fruits and rose petals [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. We colour-banded, monitored, and resighted birds breeding in the Okanagan valley from Penticton (49º 27′ N, 119º 36′ W) to Osoyoos (49º 1′ N, 119º 26′ W) on the USA border, a distance of 66 km between 2001 and 2015. To ensure that resighted individuals were accurately determined, colour combos were confirmed upon multiple observations and by at least two observers (see McKibbin and Bishop [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>] for details). Birds were sexed and aged (second-year [SY] or after second-year [ASY]) based on plumage characteristics and molt limits [

  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated apparent annual adult survival from 2001 to 2015 using the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model. We calculated the probability of an adult returning to the study site (ϕ) after controlling for the probability that banded individuals were resighted or recaptured, hereafter described as resighting probability (
   <span class="italic">ρ</span>), using program MARK 5.1 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. Probability of return (ϕ) reflects both survival and emigration, and our apparent annual survival estimates therefore underestimate annual survival. The global model that allowed adult survival to vary as a function of gender, age and year and the resighting probability to vary as a function of gender and year fit the data well and showed no evidence of overdispersion (median procedure, ĉ &lt; 1).
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first determined the best model structure for the resighting rate, and then modeled survival rates with candidate models containing gender, age, year, and all possible interactions (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). We then developed a series of candidate model sets to examine whether annual apparent survival varied with annual ENSO (Model set 1), breeding ground conditions (Model set 2), winter conditions (Model set 3), or migration conditions (Model set 4). Model set 2 included models with both Precipitation
   <sub>OCT–APR</sub>, Precipitation
   <sub>MAY–JUL</sub>, and GDD, the precipitation variables combined or alone, and GDD alone, in addition to the best model in the earlier temporal analysis (n = 6 models). Model set 3 included models with Precipitation
   <sub>MAY–NOV</sub> or Precipitation
   <sub>DEC–APR</sub> and the best model in the earlier temporal analysis (n = 3 models). Both variables were not included because they were highly correlated. Model set 4 included models with both U + V-wind, U and V-wind alone, the number of storm nights in April and May, Precipitation
   <sub>NOV–MAY</sub> on either the desert or arid region of the migratory flyway, and the best model from the earlier temporal analysis (n = 7 models). Finally, we asked whether overall ENSO conditions or conditions on the breeding grounds, wintering grounds or on migration best described variation in annual apparent survival. In this candidate set we included the top model in each of Model sets 1–4 and the best model in the earlier temporal analysis. We used a hierarchical modelling approach so that we can evaluate climate effects that operate in a single season allowing comparison with other studies focused on one season alone, and then compete the best models from within each season to assess which period plays the most important role in explaining variation in annual survival. With the exception of the annual SOI, all climate variables were standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing the standard deviation allowing estimated effect sizes to be compared directly. At each stage of the analysis we used Akaike’s Information Criterion to rank competing models. Model weights and beta estimates of effect sizes were used to compare models and assess the importance of individual climate variables.
