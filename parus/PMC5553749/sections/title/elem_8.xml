  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ENSO is known to influence a broad spectrum of climate factors in North America including precipitation anomalies in Mexico and southern California [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>], temperature fluctuations [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. Climate indices describing ENSO conditions (e.g. El Niño-Southern Oscillation Precipitation Index [ESPI], Southern Oscillation Index [SOI]) have been found to influence the survival rate of several neotropical migrants (e.g. Swainson’s Thrush 
   <span class="italic">Catharus ustulatus</span> [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]). We examined the combined effects of ENSO on the survival rate of chats using the average SOI from May to April (“Model set 1”; Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). SOI is a standard index that measures large-scale fluctuations in air pressure occurring between the western and eastern tropical Pacific, and provides a robust index for tracking ENSO phases. We obtained standardized monthly SOI values from the Climate Prediction Center:

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Precipitation and temperature in the Pacific northwest are influenced by ENSO. When ENSO is in its strong phase (i.e. El Niño), jet stream becomes diverted into California, resulting in low precipitation and increased frequency of summer droughts in the Pacific Northwest [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. Growing degree days (GDD), a measure of heat accumulation, and precipitation level both influence primary productivity and insect emergence [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. We therefore predicted that precipitation in two periods (October–April and May–July) and GDD prior to start of breeding (January–May) would have positive effects on the survival of chats (“Model set 2”; Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Climate variables on the breeding ground of south Okanagan valley were extracted and averaged from two local weather stations: “Penticton A” (WMO ID: 71889; 49

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ENSO has divergent effects on precipitation in western Mexico: El Niño is associated with more rainfall during the winter/spring in northwestern Mexico, whereas La Niña is associated with more summer monsoon rainfall in southwestern Mexico [

Modeled rainfall data on the wintering grounds was obtained from the National Center of Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis database, as provided by the NOAA-CIRES Climate Diagnostic Center at Boulder, CO, USA, using R package RNCEP [

Rainfall in arid and/or desert regions within the flyway may have a disproportionate effect on survival, and variation in precipitation in the desert region of the western flyway was associated with variation in the annual survival of Swainson’s Thrush [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. We predicted that westerly (U) and southerly (V) wind speeds and the number of storm nights on the migratory flyway during the migratory period (April–May) would have negative effects, and that precipitation in either the desert region or arid region of the flyway would have positive effects on the annual survival of chats (“Model set 4”; Table
