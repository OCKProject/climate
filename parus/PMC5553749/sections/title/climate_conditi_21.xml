 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wind speed on the migration flyway during April and May was negatively associated with the annual apparent survival of chats (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Three models in Model set 4 that examined migration effects on annual survival received strong support, and all three models included terms associated with wind speed and/or frequency of storm events (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). The top model in Model set 4, that included only the westerly wind speed term 
  <span class="bold">(</span>U-wind
  <sub>APR–MAY</sub>), received over 20 times the support of the null model. Beta estimates for the U-wind term had confidence intervals that did not span zero (−0.36 ± 0.13, −0.61 to −0.1). The second ranked model that received a similar level of support contained the Storm
  <sub>APR–MAY</sub> term, and the third ranked- model included both the U-wind
  <sub>APR–MAY</sub> and the V-wind
  <sub>APR–MAY</sub> terms. Models with terms associated with precipitation at stopover habitat in desert or arid regions of the migration flyway received negligible support (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>).
