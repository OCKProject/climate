 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Precipitation and temperature in the Pacific northwest are influenced by ENSO. When ENSO is in its strong phase (i.e. El Niño), jet stream becomes diverted into California, resulting in low precipitation and increased frequency of summer droughts in the Pacific Northwest [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. Growing degree days (GDD), a measure of heat accumulation, and precipitation level both influence primary productivity and insect emergence [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>], and in turn food availability for animals in subsequent trophic levels [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. We therefore predicted that precipitation in two periods (October–April and May–July) and GDD prior to start of breeding (January–May) would have positive effects on the survival of chats (“Model set 2”; Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Climate variables on the breeding ground of south Okanagan valley were extracted and averaged from two local weather stations: “Penticton A” (WMO ID: 71889; 49
