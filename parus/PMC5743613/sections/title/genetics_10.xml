 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genomic data were included in the VORTEX simulations (Pellegrino, Boatti et al. 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0047">2015</a>). The genomic dataset was used to estimate the genomic development of the population under the simulated conditions. VORTEX made it possible to estimate whether genomic data were likely to be lost or not over the course of 100 years.
