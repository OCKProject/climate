 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mortality rate differs greatly among juvenile birds (&lt;1‐year old) and adult birds, and between populations. Therefore, population‐specific mortality rates were used if available (Table 
  <a rid="ece33629-sup-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33629-sup-0006">S2</a>). When population‐specific mortality rates could not be obtained, simulations were run both at a lower mortality rate (Juvenile mortality = 70%, Adult mortality = 35%) and at a higher mortality rate (Juvenile mortality = 75%, Adult mortality = 38%).
