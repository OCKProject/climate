 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The overall abundance of Little Owls in Europe is predicted to decline over the next 100 years. Both VORTEX and RAMAS/GIS found that populations further to the north are more likely to decline and potentially go extinct than populations further to the south. This is in agreement with the results from the habitat suitability analysis that annual mean temperature is a positive predictor of Little Owl presence. When comparing with population data from the BirdLife International (
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0006">2015</a>), this is in agreement with the current estimated long‐term population trends. Here, southeastern populations were estimated to be overall stable, while most northwestern populations were expected to decline. The data presented here suggest that the declining population trend will continue and affect populations throughout the entire distributional range. It is, however, important to stress that the results presented here only are as valid as the input parameters. They should therefore only be used as guidelines with regards to general trends.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In these simulations, the European population of Little Owls was considered a complex of interconnected populations and subpopulations of which some might persist as true metapopulations. This might be true for parts of the European population (Nieuwenhuyse et al., 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>). But in central and western Europe, the populations are likely subdivided into smaller and potentially isolated units than the ones used in the models. Therefore, the results might be overly optimistic with regards to population size and overstate the role of dispersal and genetic exchange between de facto isolated populations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When managing populations of Little Owl within Europe, population size is an important factor if wanting to preserve genetic diversity and evolutionary potential. Depending on the actual survival rates of the population, our analysis indicated that there must be capacity for a minimum of 1,000 individuals to preserve 95% genetic diversity over 100 years, and between 4,500–30,000 individuals if 99% genetic diversity is to be maintained. Several populations within Europe count &lt;1,000 individuals (including the Danish, Polish, Austrian, and Swiss populations), and few are estimated to count more than 30,000 (BirdLife International, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0006">2015</a>). In order to prevent genetic loss from the smallest and most isolated populations, concrete actions to increase gene flows (of which active translocation of individuals between populations would be the most simple but also the most artificial and increase in population size or connection of populations through habitat improvements the most costly but least artificial method) might therefore be necessary.
