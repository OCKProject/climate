 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the population viability software RAMAS/GIS and RAMAS Metapop (Akçakaya &amp; Root, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0003">2013</a>), a PVA was conducted on the Little Owl on a continent scale with the aim of evaluating the population trend and the future distribution of the species in different European regions and on the continent as a whole. The RAMAS software makes it possible to include spatial data into the PVA. RAMAS/GIS was used for modeling the initial species distribution, and RAMAS Metapop incorporated both the initial distribution found in RAMAS/GIS and included population‐specific life history data and stochastic events.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each simulation was repeated 100 times over a time span of 100 years. As described below, the simulated scenarios tested population viability under varying initial population sizes and survival rates.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A stage‐structured model of survival and fecundity was used. The stages included were a fledgling (0‐ to 1‐year olds), a juvenile (1‐ to 2‐year olds), and an adult stage (2 and older). A total of 83% of all juveniles were assumed to reproduce, while 100% of the adults were assumed to reproduce (Møller, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0039">2006</a>; Nieuwenhuyse et al.,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When calculating the mean fecundity on basis of nest surveys, it is important to take the survival rates into account (Akçakaya, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0002">2000</a>). A Little Owl lays on average 3.87 eggs (Table 
   <a rid="ece33629-sup-009" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33629-sup-009">S5</a>), and on average, 40.14% of these will fail in surviving to fledgling stage (Nieuwenhuyse et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>). This results in a mean fecundity of 2.32 fledglings. The mean fecundity was used in all populations for which the actual fecundity had not been recorded. When possible, the actual fecundity was used (Table 
   <a rid="ece33629-sup-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33629-sup-0006">S2</a>, observed clutch size times 0.598). The same applies for the survival rates (Table 
   <a rid="ece33629-sup-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33629-sup-0006">S2</a>). If no specific survival rate was known, the mean survival rate was used (Fledglings 26.8%, juvenile and adult owls 67.0%; Table 
   <a rid="ece33629-sup-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33629-sup-0006">S2</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the actual survival rate was unknown, simulations were run with the mean survival rates, with a lowered survival (25% for fledglings, 62% for juveniles and adults) and an increased survival (30% for fledglings, 70% for juveniles and adults).</p>

The distance matrix and the formula above were used to calculate dispersal distances. In Little Owls, ringing data have recorded the maximum dispersal distance of juvenile owls to 182, 190, 220, 230, 270, and 600 km (Nieuwenhuyse et al.,

   <sub>max</sub> is thus set at 250 km. The average dispersal distance of the Little Owl was calculated to 8.7 km (based on the average dispersal distance in Table 10.5 in Nieuwenhuyse and Bekaert (
