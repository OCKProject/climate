 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless of the initial population size and mortality rate, the abundance of the metapopulation decreased over the course of 100 years. Patch occupancy dropped continuously when simulating low survival and stabilized after 25 years when simulating high survival (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece33629-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33629-sup-0004">S4</a>). The initial population size did affect the number of patches occupied after 100 years (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece33629-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33629-sup-0004">S4</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of populations remaining extant for more time steps increased as the survival rates increased (Figure 
  <a rid="ece33629-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33629-fig-0003">3</a>). Populations further to the south had a greater chance of remaining extant than populations further to the north (with the exception of populations 6–11 which were extant more often than extinct). The terminal percent decline is the risk that population abundance will drop by a certain percentage after 100 years, while the terminal explosion risk is the probability that population abundance will surpass a certain threshold after 100 years. Looking at the terminal percent decline, we found a great risk of population decline (Figure 
  <a rid="ece33629-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33629-fig-0004">4</a>). At high survival rate, the metapopulation abundance is likely to drop by 20% and has a 50% risk of declining by 55% (Figure 
  <a rid="ece33629-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33629-fig-0004">4</a>c,d). At average survival rates, the population will likely drop by 40% and has a 50% risk of declining by 75% (Figure 
  <a rid="ece33629-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33629-fig-0004">4</a>a,b). At low survival rates, the European population of Little Owls has a 10% risk of overall extinction and is likely to experience a 60% decline, with a 50% risk of a decline of 90% or more in overall abundance (Figure 
  <a rid="ece33629-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33629-fig-0004">4</a>e,f). The terminal explosion risk showed that both the initial population size and the survival rate affect the threshold value (Figure 
  <a rid="ece33629-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33629-fig-0005">5</a>).

   <p>The local population occupation duration. The figure shows the number of time steps a given population was occupied during the 100‐year period. The mean of all replications, along with the std. average, and the minimum and maximum values are provided. The different scenarios are as follows: (a) Low initial population size, mean survival. (b) High initial population size, mean survival. (c) Low initial population size, high survival. (d) High initial population size, high survival. (e) Low initial population size, low survival.

   <p>The terminal percent decline is the probability that the metapopulation abundance will have declined by a specific percentage at the end of the simulations. It thus depicts the risk that the final abundance will be less numerous than the original population, and by how much it is likely to drop. For example, in (a), there is an 80% risk of a 60% population decline and a 20% risk of a 90% decline. The extinction risk is noted above the graph when estimated to be &gt;0. The different scenarios are as follows: (a) Low initial population size, mean survival. (b) High initial population size, mean survival. (c) Low initial population size, high survival. (d) High initial population size, high survival. (e) Low initial population size, low survival. (f) High initial population size, low survival</p>
