 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Ceiling density type was chosen (exponential growth until carrying capacity (the ceiling) is reached), and Allee effects included. Allee effects describe the situation where individual fitness is correlated with population density (Courchamp, Clutton‐Brock, &amp; Grenfell, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0012">1999</a>; Stephens, Sutherland, &amp; Freckleton, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0061">1999</a>). The Allee parameter was set to 100 if 
  <span class="italic">K</span> &gt; 100, meaning that at population densities of 100 individuals or less, the fecundity and survival will be halved. The Allee parameter was reduced to 10 if 
  <span class="italic">K</span> &lt; 100. Density dependency was set to affect all life stages and to affect both fecundity and survival.
