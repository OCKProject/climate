 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A general linear model (GLM) was performed in R in order to determine the explanatory variables that had a significant influence on the presence–absence of the Little Owl. General linear models (GLM) can be used to determine the environmental factors that shape a species’ distribution and thereby quantify the species niche (Austin, Nicholls, &amp; Margules, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0005">1990</a>; Vetaas, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0068">2002</a>). The datasets used in the GLM are described below and include both climatic data, data on habitat characteristics, and information on human activities.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to determine the factors most influential on the distributional pattern of the Little Owl on a macroscopic landscape scale, the probability of presence in 5 × 5 km squares was modeled with logistic regression analysis as a function of the data described below (Franklin, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0022">1995</a>). All continuous variables were checked for normality. If a variable was not normally distributed, it was log transformed.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To avoid including highly correlated variables in the regression, both the Pearson correlation and the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) were calculated using R 3.1.2. The VIF reports how much of the variability of a given explanatory value is already explained in the model due to correlation (Craney &amp; Surles,
