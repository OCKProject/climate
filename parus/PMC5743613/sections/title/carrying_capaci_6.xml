 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A theoretical K was estimated for all regions included in the simulations. It was estimated from data on population density and the area of interest (Table 
  <a rid="ece33629-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33629-sup-0005">S1</a>). This K was used in the simulation where the initial population size was varied.
