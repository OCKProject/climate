 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A stage‐structured model of survival and fecundity was used. The stages included were a fledgling (0‐ to 1‐year olds), a juvenile (1‐ to 2‐year olds), and an adult stage (2 and older). A total of 83% of all juveniles were assumed to reproduce, while 100% of the adults were assumed to reproduce (Møller, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0039">2006</a>; Nieuwenhuyse et al., 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When calculating the mean fecundity on basis of nest surveys, it is important to take the survival rates into account (Akçakaya, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0002">2000</a>). A Little Owl lays on average 3.87 eggs (Table 
  <a rid="ece33629-sup-009" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33629-sup-009">S5</a>), and on average, 40.14% of these will fail in surviving to fledgling stage (Nieuwenhuyse et al., 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>). This results in a mean fecundity of 2.32 fledglings. The mean fecundity was used in all populations for which the actual fecundity had not been recorded. When possible, the actual fecundity was used (Table 
  <a rid="ece33629-sup-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33629-sup-0006">S2</a>, observed clutch size times 0.598). The same applies for the survival rates (Table 
  <a rid="ece33629-sup-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33629-sup-0006">S2</a>). If no specific survival rate was known, the mean survival rate was used (Fledglings 26.8%, juvenile and adult owls 67.0%; Table 
  <a rid="ece33629-sup-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33629-sup-0006">S2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the actual survival rate was unknown, simulations were run with the mean survival rates, with a lowered survival (25% for fledglings, 62% for juveniles and adults) and an increased survival (30% for fledglings, 70% for juveniles and adults).</p>
