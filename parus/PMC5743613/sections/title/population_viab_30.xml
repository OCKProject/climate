 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most farmland birds are highly mobile in contrast to the modestly mobile Little Owl. Here, population viability was modeled on a continental scale for a modestly mobile vertebrate species vulnerable to isolation and fragmentation. The populations toward the south were more likely to stay occupied and had an overall higher final population abundance than populations further to the north. No matter the initial population size and survival rate the population will decline by at least 20% in the best case scenario and 60% in the worst case scenario. At high survival rates, roughly one‐fourth of the subpopulations had gone extinct by the end of the 100 years, while a low survival resulted in close to half of the subpopulation being extinct. Altering the mortality also affected the local occupancy, with more patches being occupied for longer at high survival rates. Present population declines and disappearances have been explained by decreasing habitat quality and lack of food (Nieuwenhuyse et al.,

  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0073">2009</a>). Being associated with farmland habitats, the declining population trend is not surprising. Whereas many species of birds linked to a forest habitat have increased over the last decades, birds associated with farmland areas have largely declined (Fuller, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0023">2000</a>; Klvanova, Vorisek, Gregory, Van Strien, &amp; Meyling, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0032">2009</a>, PECBMS, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0045">2007</a>; Reif, Storch, Voříšek, Šťastný, &amp; Bejček, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0055">2008</a>). Within Europe, the greatest decline in farmland species between 1980 and 2005 was found in northern Europe, followed by western Europe, while the least decline was seen in southern Europe (PECBMS, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0045">2007</a>). The decline is more severe in western European countries compared to eastern European countries formerly part of the USSR (Donald, Green, &amp; Heath, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0016">2001</a>). Several widespread farmland species generally considered common (large range and listed as Safe by the IUCN) have experienced dramatic declines, including the Willow Tit 
  <span class="italic">Parus montanus</span> and the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker 
  <span class="italic">Dendrocopos minor</span> (PECBMS, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0045">2007</a>). And as the agricultural production is expected to double from year 2000 to 2050, the intensification of agricultural lands is likely to continue (Tilman, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0065">1999</a>). It is therefore of utmost importance to identify indicator species whose population trend reflect the trend of the overall farmland biodiversity. With its large dietary range (including everything in the size range from ants to young rabbits; Nieuwenhuyse et al., 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>) and its dependency on a multitude of alternative foraging habitats over the years and as weather change (Sunde et al., 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0063">2014</a>), the Little Owl is likely a good indicator species of abundance and diversity of these prey in farmland habitats.
