 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The already declining population of Little Owls in Europe is likely to continue declining over the next 100 years. The Little Owl prefers warmer areas where the average annual rainfall is low and avoids areas with high tree cover, sparsely vegetated areas, and grassland. Populations further to the north, where the climate is colder, are more likely to decline and disappear than populations further to the south, and the Turkish population will remain the population stronghold over the next 100 years. In order to be genetically viable and minimize the loss of genetic diversity, the individual populations should have a carrying capacity of at least 1,000–30,000 individuals, depending on the actual mortality rates of the populations.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic viability</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PVA in VORTEX suggested that not all populations in Europe are likely to remain extant and retain 99% of the initial genetic variability over the next 100 years. The Balkan population was genetically viable, as were the Spanish and the Italian populations. The Portuguese and Danish populations were not viable in the long run.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The northern European population is estimated to count a maximum of 118,000 individuals. The population is therefore vulnerable to losing a significant amount of genetic diversity. A part of the northern population has already been investigated for loss of genetic diversity, namely the Danish population. A low historic genetic variability was found, and an even lower genetic variability was found in the population at present (Pertoldi et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0050">2012</a>). Further, PVA on the Danish population predicts it to perish within the near future (Andersen et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0004">2015</a>). An increased mortality level decreased the stochastic growth rate by approximately a factor 10. It would thus be very useful to determine the actual mortality rate of the Portuguese population, in order to determine the actual state of the population. The Portuguese population is at present considered to be stable but fluctuating in size (BirdLife International, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0006">2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the Balkan population counts 24,000–65,000 individuals, the population can be considered genetically viable. The Balkan population consists of the Cypriote population of 4,000–10,000 individuals, the Greek population of 5,000–15,000 individuals, and the Romanian population of 15,000–40,000 individuals (BirdLife International, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0006">2015</a>). Even if considering the low population estimates, both the Romanian and the Greek populations are likely to maintain their genetic diversity if managed as demographically independent populations. The Cypriote population, however, might not in itself be considered a genetically viable management unit if counting only 4,000 individuals. Being an island population located approximately 75 km from mainland Europe, the Cypriote population is effectively isolated from the mainland population. Nevertheless, as the population has survived on the island for centuries, long‐term genetic drift is not likely to pose a great threat to the population. The Italian populations can be considered genetically viable independently of each other and be managed as separate demographic units without risking the loss of a significant amount of genetic diversity. The Spanish population can be considered both genetically viable and demographically independent concerning population management. The MVP(K)s presented here are in line with the MVP(K) found for 28 species of birds, averaging 6,667 individuals (Reed, O'Grady, Brook, Ballou, &amp; Frankham, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0054">2003</a>). Reed et al. (
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0054">2003</a>), however, did not consider genetic viability but only extinction risk and defined MVP as the minimum K that would decrease the risk of extinction below 1%. A study on Harbor Seals 
   <span class="italic">Phoca vitulina</span> found the MVP(K) required to maintain 95% genetic diversity to be 75 individuals, while 200 individuals are required to maintain 99% genetic diversity (Olsen et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0044">2014</a>). They found that 1,000 individuals are required to ensure a 1% or less risk of extinction.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both climatic factors and landscape structure affected the large‐scale distribution of the Little Owl. This result conforms well to population studies that have found that the reproductive output of Little Owls is limited by excessive rainfall, which may relate to decreased availability of large insects in the breeding season (Bultot et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0011">2001</a>; Nieuwenhuyse et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>; Tome et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0067">2008</a>). Buildup urban areas have also previously been found to correlate positively with the presence of Little Owl, although only when the buildup areas were at a low intensity (Nieuwenhuyse &amp; Bekaert, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0042">2002</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Little Owl is associated with the agricultural landscape. Surprisingly, either arable land, mixed agriculture, or permanent crops had a significant influence on the spatial distribution of the Little Owl on a European scale. Previous studies found that both orchards and meadows had a positive influence on the presence of Little Owl (Nieuwenhuyse &amp; Bekaert, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0042">2002</a>; Nieuwenhuyse et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>; Zabala et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0071">2006</a>). Increasing tree cover did on the other hand affect the Little Owl negatively, which also conforms well with several investigations showing that Little Owls avoid forested areas (Gottschalk et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0026">2011</a>; Nieuwenhuyse et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>; Sunde, Thorup, Jacobsen, &amp; Rahbek, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0063">2014</a>), possibly because of increased predation risk from other raptorial birds such as Tawny Owls (
   <span class="italic">Strix aluco</span>; Michel, Jiménez‐Franco, Naef‐Daenzer, &amp; Grüebler, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0038">2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predictive power of the GLM was relatively low, which resulted in a habitat suitability model that did not register the nuance in the highly suitable areas. This might be related to the large scale and large range at which the regression model was built. It could also be due to the scale at which the Little Owl is registered is larger than Little Owl home range. A study on Eurasian Eagle Owls, 
   <span class="italic">Bubo bubo,</span> examined the distribution of the owl on three spatial scales (Martínez, Serrano, &amp; Zuberogoitia, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0036">2003</a>). A GLM was built for each scale, and Martínez et al. (
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0036">2003</a>) found that their models were best at predicting the presence/absence of the Eurasian Eagle Owl at home range scale and below. The model build at landscape scale only accounted for 25.97% of the deviance in the distribution. The Eurasian Eagle Owl depended more on small‐scale features such as nesting and feeding grounds than on landscape ecology (Martínez et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0036">2003</a>). This could be the case for the Little Owl as well. As an obligate cavity breeder, the Little Owl can only settle in areas where nesting cavities are present. At a large scale, it was not possible to include the presence of nesting cavities in the analysis. A study of habitat preference of the Little Owl and the Long‐eared Owl 
   <span class="italic">Asio otus</span> in Spain also looked at different scales (Martínez &amp; Zuberogoitia, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0037">2004</a>). Again, the presence of both species was best described at the nest‐site or home range scale, whereas the landscape scale model had the least predictive power. The presence of Little Owl was especially correlated with arid plantations, which is where the Little Owl primarily finds nesting cavities in this area (Martínez &amp; Zuberogoitia, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0037">2004</a>), further confirming that Little Owl distribution might be closely linked to features on a home range scale rather than landscape scale. Throughout its range, the Little Owl is found within different habitat types (Nieuwenhuyse et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>). The incidence that the Little Owl prefers different habitat types with different areas of the study range might also explain the low explanatory power of the model, and it would be interesting to see if the analysis performed better on a smaller part of the range.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only little over 20% of the variation in Little Owl distribution could be explained by the GLM on a macroscale using landscape and climatic factors. This might be because habitat preference of owl species is best described at a home range scale within a smaller geographical range (Martínez &amp; Zuberogoitia, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0037">2004</a>; Martínez et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0036">2003</a>). Thus, when wanting to describe habitat preference and to further manage and conserve owls, it is important to look at a smaller scale and range. The macroscale approach did not catch important parts of the landscape features important to the Little Owl; therefore, it is advisable to work at a microscopic landscape scale.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population viability and spatial distribution</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most farmland birds are highly mobile in contrast to the modestly mobile Little Owl. Here, population viability was modeled on a continental scale for a modestly mobile vertebrate species vulnerable to isolation and fragmentation. The populations toward the south were more likely to stay occupied and had an overall higher final population abundance than populations further to the north. No matter the initial population size and survival rate the population will decline by at least 20% in the best case scenario and 60% in the worst case scenario. At high survival rates, roughly one‐fourth of the subpopulations had gone extinct by the end of the 100 years, while a low survival resulted in close to half of the subpopulation being extinct. Altering the mortality also affected the local occupancy, with more patches being occupied for longer at high survival rates. Present population declines and disappearances have been explained by decreasing habitat quality and lack of food (Nieuwenhuyse et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>; Thorup et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0064">2010</a>; Zmihorski et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0072">2006</a>, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0073">2009</a>). Being associated with farmland habitats, the declining population trend is not surprising. Whereas many species of birds linked to a forest habitat have increased over the last decades, birds associated with farmland areas have largely declined (Fuller, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0023">2000</a>; Klvanova, Vorisek, Gregory, Van Strien, &amp; Meyling, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0032">2009</a>, PECBMS, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0045">2007</a>; Reif, Storch, Voříšek, Šťastný, &amp; Bejček, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0055">2008</a>). Within Europe, the greatest decline in farmland species between 1980 and 2005 was found in northern Europe, followed by western Europe, while the least decline was seen in southern Europe (PECBMS, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0045">2007</a>). The decline is more severe in western European countries compared to eastern European countries formerly part of the USSR (Donald, Green, &amp; Heath, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0016">2001</a>). Several widespread farmland species generally considered common (large range and listed as Safe by the IUCN) have experienced dramatic declines, including the Willow Tit 
   <span class="italic">Parus montanus</span> and the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker 
   <span class="italic">Dendrocopos minor</span> (PECBMS, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0045">2007</a>). And as the agricultural production is expected to double from year 2000 to 2050, the intensification of agricultural lands is likely to continue (Tilman, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0065">1999</a>). It is therefore of utmost importance to identify indicator species whose population trend reflect the trend of the overall farmland biodiversity. With its large dietary range (including everything in the size range from ants to young rabbits; Nieuwenhuyse et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>) and its dependency on a multitude of alternative foraging habitats over the years and as weather change (Sunde et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0063">2014</a>), the Little Owl is likely a good indicator species of abundance and diversity of these prey in farmland habitats.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implications for management and conservation status</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The overall abundance of Little Owls in Europe is predicted to decline over the next 100 years. Both VORTEX and RAMAS/GIS found that populations further to the north are more likely to decline and potentially go extinct than populations further to the south. This is in agreement with the results from the habitat suitability analysis that annual mean temperature is a positive predictor of Little Owl presence. When comparing with population data from the BirdLife International (
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0006">2015</a>), this is in agreement with the current estimated long‐term population trends. Here, southeastern populations were estimated to be overall stable, while most northwestern populations were expected to decline. The data presented here suggest that the declining population trend will continue and affect populations throughout the entire distributional range. It is, however, important to stress that the results presented here only are as valid as the input parameters. They should therefore only be used as guidelines with regards to general trends.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In these simulations, the European population of Little Owls was considered a complex of interconnected populations and subpopulations of which some might persist as true metapopulations. This might be true for parts of the European population (Nieuwenhuyse et al., 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>). But in central and western Europe, the populations are likely subdivided into smaller and potentially isolated units than the ones used in the models. Therefore, the results might be overly optimistic with regards to population size and overstate the role of dispersal and genetic exchange between de facto isolated populations.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When managing populations of Little Owl within Europe, population size is an important factor if wanting to preserve genetic diversity and evolutionary potential. Depending on the actual survival rates of the population, our analysis indicated that there must be capacity for a minimum of 1,000 individuals to preserve 95% genetic diversity over 100 years, and between 4,500–30,000 individuals if 99% genetic diversity is to be maintained. Several populations within Europe count &lt;1,000 individuals (including the Danish, Polish, Austrian, and Swiss populations), and few are estimated to count more than 30,000 (BirdLife International, 
   <a rid="ece33629-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0006">2015</a>). In order to prevent genetic loss from the smallest and most isolated populations, concrete actions to increase gene flows (of which active translocation of individuals between populations would be the most simple but also the most artificial and increase in population size or connection of populations through habitat improvements the most costly but least artificial method) might therefore be necessary.
