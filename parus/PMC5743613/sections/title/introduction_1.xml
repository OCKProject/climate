 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human land use alters natural landscapes all over the world, and in Europe, 75% of all land is covered by either rural or urban areas, the main land uses being agriculture and forestry (FAO, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0020">2014</a>). Farmland areas traditionally support a large number of species living in or in close proximity to farmland areas (Fuller, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0023">2000</a>). But over the last 60 years, the agricultural landscape has undergone a substantial change in order to increase productivity (Fuller, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0023">2000</a>). The habitat changes have led to a severe decline in several species associated with the agricultural landscape, and among farmland birds, the main drivers of the decline have been habitat fragmentation, agricultural intensification, and land abandonment (Fuller et al., 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0024">1995</a>; Newton, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0041">2004</a>; Sotherton, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0060">1998</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat fragmentation might divide populations that were once continuous into either metapopulations, populations that occasionally exchange individuals and genes, or to completely disconnected populations with no gene exchange at all. A metapopulation consists of several populations connected by dispersal. Local populations might go extinct, but the patches remain part of the metapopulation due to the chance of recolonization (Hanski &amp; Gilpin, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0027">1991</a>). When making management decisions it is important to determine whether the individual subpopulations are demographically and/or genetically viable on their own or as part of a metapopulation. In order to forecast the outcomes of different management scenarios including the status quo, estimates of minimum viable population size (MVP) and minimum carrying capacity that can sustain the population demographically and genetically are essential decision tools. Population viability analysis (PVA) can be used to estimate the viability, the MVP, and extinction risk of populations (Boyce, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0009">1992</a>). PVAs are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and different softwares can encompass many types of information alongside life history data, including genetic data (VORTEX), spatial information (RAMAS), species interactions, and disease spread (Akcakaya,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One species affected by the changed agricultural regime is the Little Owl 
  <span class="italic">Athene noctua</span> (Framis, Holroyd, &amp; Manosa, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0021">2011</a>; Thorup, Sunde, Jacobsen, &amp; Rahbek, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0064">2010</a>). The Little Owl has a wide range extending from northern Africa to southern Scandinavia and from the west coast of Europe to the east coast of Asia (Cramp, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0013">1977</a>; Génot, Juillard, &amp; Nieuwenhuyse, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0025">1997</a>). Several subspecies of the Little Owl exist, and population genetic studies suggest that several genetic populations can be found in Europe (Cramp, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0013">1977</a>; Pellegrino, Boatti et al., 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0047">2015</a>; Pellegrino, Negri et al., 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0048">2015</a>). It can be found in many types of habitats including agricultural fields, orchards, open woodland, and steppes and tend to avoid closed forest and heavily buildup areas (Exo, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0019">1992</a>; Génot et al., 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0025">1997</a>; Gottschalk, Ekschmitt, &amp; Wolters, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0026">2011</a>; Nieuwenhuyse &amp; Bekaert, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0042">2002</a>; Tome, Catry, Bloise, &amp; Korpimaki, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0067">2008</a>; Zabala et al., 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0071">2006</a>). The Little Owl is sedentary, and juveniles usually settle within 20 km of their nesting place (Bønløkke et al., 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0008">2006</a>; Nieuwenhuyse, Génot, &amp; Johnson, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>). Little owls depend on cavities for breeding, and lack of breeding cavities is known to limit population growth (Exo, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0019">1992</a>; Nieuwenhuyse et al., 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0043">2008</a>). Another factor presently limiting the species is the decreasing area of suitable habitat for both feeding and breeding (Šálek &amp; Schröpfer, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0057">2008</a>; Santos &amp; Suarez,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the Little Owl as a model species, we aim at providing information valuable for the management of Little Owl populations across Europe. We achieve this aim by compiling information on both population viability, genetic viability, and habitat suitability. First, population and genetic viability are estimated using the PVA program VORTEX. We aim to estimate whether the populations corresponding to the genetic units defined by Pellegrino, Boatti et al. (
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0047">2015</a>) are sufficiently large to ensure long‐term population viability. In order to do this, we will estimate the genetic MVP of each of the six population clusters and compare the MVP to the actual population sizes. If the MVP is equal to or smaller than the actual population size, the population may be considered genetically viable over the next 100 years. A time frame of 100 years is commonly used for PVA and is suitable for organisms with shorter lifespans (Boyce, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0009">1992</a>; Murn &amp; Botha, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0040">2017</a>; Walters, Crowder, &amp; Priddy, 
  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0069">2002</a>). If the MVP is larger than the actual population size, the population may not be viable. Second, we wish to look at Little Owl distribution at a macroscopic landscape scale across the European range. Using habitat suitability analysis, we aim to investigate the factors most important for the presence of the Little Owl at a European scale. Finally, we used the PVA program RAMAS is used to predict the possible future distribution and population trend of the Little Owl within Europe when including demographic knowledge alongside spatial information.
