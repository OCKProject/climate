  <a rid="ece33629-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33629-bib-0056">2008</a>) to find the allelic frequencies within each population defined in the study of Pellegrino, Boatti et al. (

These populations were a Portuguese, a Spanish, a French–Danish–the Netherlands population cluster (in this region Little Owls occur in a number of more or less isolated populations, but for convenience, it will be termed “population” in the following), an Italian population divided into a southern and northern population and a Greek–Romanian–Cypriote population.
