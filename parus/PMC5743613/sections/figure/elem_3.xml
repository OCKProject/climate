  <p>The terminal percent decline is the probability that the metapopulation abundance will have declined by a specific percentage at the end of the simulations. It thus depicts the risk that the final abundance will be less numerous than the original population, and by how much it is likely to drop. For example, in (a), there is an 80% risk of a 60% population decline and a 20% risk of a 90% decline. The extinction risk is noted above the graph when estimated to be &gt;0. The different scenarios are as follows: (a) Low initial population size, mean survival. (b) High initial population size, mean survival. (c) Low initial population size, high survival. (d) High initial population size, high survival. (e) Low initial population size, low survival. (f) High initial population size, low survival</p>
