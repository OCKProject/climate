 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected in two seasons in the same year (2009), which by including both pre breeding (April-early May) and post breeding (late May-June) seasons maximizes the chances of recording early breeding resident and late breeding migrant species. The birds present between 1500 m and 2400 m a.s.l. were recorded on the northern side of the mountains at four localities in both valleys because they are wetter than the south-facing slopes and have luxuriant vegetation suitable for birds [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref053">53</a>]. The sampling was done every 100 m, with records collected at ten altitudes at each locality. There was one fixed circle at each altitude. Each circle had a 50 m radius. Thus, all together the birds observed in 10 circles each with a 50 m radius at each locality on each sampling occasion were recorded (i.e. 10 circles x 4 localities x 2 times = 80 circles in total).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sampling was done in subtropical forest, shrubs, soil cliff and rocky area. As all sampling sites were chosen far from areas of human settlement, we completely excluded agricultural fields, orchards gardens and houses. Sampling at Chandragiri, Phulchowki and Tistung started at the edges of the forest and at Simbhanjyang in the forest in order to avoid settlements.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The locations of these circles were fixed with the help of an altimeter, Garmin GPS and a topographic map. Bird counting started normally early in the morning and continued to mid-morning each day. During data collection, three minutes were spent adjusting to the location and the next 20 minutes to counting birds in each circle at a particular altitude using the fixed point counting method [

  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref056">56</a>]. We used a two man direct observation technique and vocal recording to identify and count the number of species of birds [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref057">57</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref059">59</a>] using 10 x 42 mm binoculars plus recordings of their songs for verifying the canopy dwelling species [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref060">60</a>]. In this study, we did not include high flying species like soaring raptors, swifts and swallows because of the difficulty of identifying and attributing an altitude.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were identified in the field with the help of standard bird guide books [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref061">61</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref062">62</a>]. Breeding birds were later confirmed with the help of additional literature [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref052">52</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref061">61</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref066">66</a>]. Their conservation status was obtained from books [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref067">67</a>] and online databases [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref068">68</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref069">69</a>]. During the bird count, we also recorded the altitude (in meters above sea level), slope (angle between the horizontal line and inclination of the place in degrees), proportional canopy cover of forest, presence of litter or forest humus and forest and shrubby areas in each of the circles sampled (in proportions). The proportion of the area covered by forest canopy was visually estimated. Altitude was measured with an altimeter and slope with a compass clinometer. Presence or absence of forest, shrubby areas, litter and forest edge, in each circle sampled, were visually recorded. Presence was given a value of one and absence as zero. In our study, 'forest' was precisely classified as an area of land covered with trees or other woody vegetation and 'shrubs' was classified as a land covered with medium sized woody plants with multiple stems and usually under 6 meters tall [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref070">70</a>]. The time of sampling was recorded as either time 1 (pre breeding, April-early May) or time 2 (post breeding season, late May-June).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We classified different bird guilds on the basis of their feeding habits [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref062">62</a>]. They were insectivorous, omnivorous, frugivorous, herbivorous, carnivorous and nectivorous. We analyzed differences in the proportions of insectivorous, omnivorous and frugivorous birds as described below. The other guilds (herbivorous = 7 species, carnivorous = 6 species and nectivorous = 2 species) were not tested due to their low occurrence in the dataset.
