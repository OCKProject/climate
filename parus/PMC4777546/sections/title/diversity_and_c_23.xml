 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study aimed at finding the factors affecting the distribution of birds in different places in central Nepal and provides crucial background data for identifying important bird rich areas. In turn, it will indirectly help in formulating management plans and also in defining priority areas for bird conservation. Our study indicates that the Kathmandu valley is richer in birds than the Palung valley. At Phulchowki, however, we recorded one globally near-threatened and nationally critically endangered species, the Laggar Falcon (
  <span class="italic">Falco jugger</span>). There are also nationally endangered species at this site such as the Red-headed Trogon (
  <span class="italic">Harpactes erythrocephalus</span>), Blue-naped Pitta (
  <span class="italic">Pitta nipalensis</span>), White-throated Bulbul (
  <span class="italic">Alophoixus flaveolus</span>) and Purple Cochoa (
  <span class="italic">Cochoa purpurea</span>), as reported by Baral and Inskipp [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref047">47</a>]. The number of important species of birds recorded at Phulchowki well justifies its important bird area (IBA) status [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Nepalese endemic species, Spiny babbler (
  <span class="italic">Turdoides nipalensis</span>), was recorded at Chandragiri, as reported in a previous study [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref052">52</a>]. Although a road was constructed in this area, which resulted in a recent increase in number of visitors, Chandragiri still remains a very important habitat for birds due to presence of thick forest on its north facing slopes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared to the number of species of birds recorded for the whole of Nepal (877 bird species) [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref033">33</a>], the number of endangered species reported in this study is quite low because most of the endangered species of birds in Nepal occur at either low altitudes or in high altitudinal zones and this study focused on intermediate altitudinal zones [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref047">47</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref065">65</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref077">77</a>]. The low number of endangered birds could also partly be a result of our sampling technique, which was not intensive enough to record species that are very rare. In addition to this, as rare species are very elusive in nature, more effort is needed to spot them the field. Thus, the point count sampling technique used in this study is not appropriate for recording rare species [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref078">78</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Insectivore birds were the dominant and carnivores the rarest guild recorded in this study, which is similar to figures for the total bird species recorded in Nepal [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref040">40</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref077">77</a>] and other areas [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref079">79</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref080">80</a>]. Another reason for recording a very high proportion of insectivorous birds may be the exclusion of different soaring raptors and other high flying birds such as swallows (
  <span class="italic">Hirundo</span> spp.), martins (
  <span class="italic">Delichon</span> sp.) and crows (
  <span class="italic">Corvus</span> spp.) due to the difficulty of identifying the exact species. The family patterns of the birds recorded in this study is comparable to that for total bird species of Nepal [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref040">40</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref077">77</a>].
