 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of this study support the expectation that altitude is a major determinant of species richness and composition of bird communities in areas that vary greatly in altitude and is strongly associated with the distribution of different feeding guilds within the area. The greatest diversities of birds were recorded on steep slopes with heterogeneous habitats, which provide many habitats for birds. In addition, we demonstrate that different habitat characteristics, such as forest edges and shrubs, are strongly associated at local spatial scales with the distributions of species, but not species richness. This indicates that while habitat conditions are important determinants of the distributions of specific species, the number of niches are more likely to be determined by larger scale characteristics such as landscape level habitat heterogeneity and altitude.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, to protect bird diversity in the mid-hills of central Nepal, we should maintain there a diversity of habitats (viz. forest, shrubs, open land, etc.) and especially protect the heterogeneous habitats on steep slopes, as these habitats are the most species rich.</p>
