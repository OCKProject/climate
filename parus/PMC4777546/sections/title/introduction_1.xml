  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref002">2</a>] as they respond to habitat structure [

  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref004">4</a>]. The distribution of many species of birds is affected by habitat fragmentation and reflects inter-specific dynamics and population trends associated with habitats [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref005">5</a>]. Bird communities can be used to indicate the quality of habitats and thus can help guide management at regional and landscape levels [

  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref021">21</a>]. A study of the global patterns in bird diversity [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref022">22</a>] indicates that bird diversity on mountains in high rainfall regions decreases with altitude whereas on mountains in dry areas it is unimodal.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although bird diversity and distribution are well studied in Europe [

  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref028">28</a>], there are very few similar studies for Asia in general [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref029">29</a>] or the Himalayan region [

  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref039">39</a>]. Exploring the determinants of diversity in the Himalayas is important as in that region is the greatest variation in altitude anywhere in the world (i.e., 60 m to 8848 m) [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref009">9</a>]. In a recent checklist for Nepal, a total of 871 species of birds are recorded including nine that are legally protected by the government of Nepal, 37 species that are globally threatened and 149 species that are nationally threatened [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref040">40</a>]. It is thus considered as one of the most important places in the world for studying patterns in the distribution and diversity of species along altitudinal gradients [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref041">41</a>]. The distribution of birds in the Himalayan region is associated with climatic factors (temperature, precipitation, seasons, area of landmasses, etc.) [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref042">42</a>], and various kinds of anthropogenic activities, such as forest encroachment, livestock grazing, over extraction of forest products, forest fires, etc.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most vulnerable areas in Nepal are low lying areas in the Terai, Siwalik Hills, Mahabharat and its valleys. These areas are densely populated [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref043">43</a>] with high levels of anthropogenic activity, such as slash and burn cultivation, livestock grazing, habitat encroachment, etc. To properly protect the diversity of birds in these areas, it is important to understand the factors that determine the distribution of birds in the mid-hills of Nepal. There are very few protected areas in this region, even though it has a rich biota [

  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref044">44</a>]. It is expected that such a study will help in determining the ecology of threatened species of birds in this region (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref045">45</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref046">46</a>]). Therefore, this study is designed to explore the factors affecting diversity and distribution of birds on different forested hills in Nepal. Specifically, we attempted to answer the following questions: (1) What is the pattern of distribution of birds in hilly regions in Nepal? and (2) What are the factors influencing the distribution of the birds? In order to answer the above questions, data on the composition of bird communities were collected along an altitudinal gradient at four places in two valleys in central Nepal. We also collected data on a range of environmental variables at all sites in order to determine their association with bird diversity and species composition of bird communities.
