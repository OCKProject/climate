 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was carried out in fully or partly managed community forests outside protected areas. We obtained permission for studying birds from different village development committees, the Dovan Khola Community Forest user groups (for the Kot-thumki forest) in Tistung, the Daman village development committee for Simbhanjyang, the Thankot village development committee for Chandragiri Sachet Mahila Community forest in Chandragiri and the Godawari village development committee for the Phulchowki community forest. This study did not involve the collection of any endangered or protected species. We recorded the species and counted the numbers of birds from a distance so specific permission was not required.</p>
