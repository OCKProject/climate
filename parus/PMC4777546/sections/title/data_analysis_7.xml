 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the effect of landscape heterogeneity on bird distribution and different feeding guilds of birds, we scanned maps of the area (1:125000) and calculated length of all the edges between different habitats within a 100 m circle around each sampling point using NIS software. Habitat categories on the map were forested area, open places and water bodies. However, there were no agricultural fields, orchards gardens and houses as our sampling sites were far from settlements. We then used this data to calculate the weighted edge density according to Hargis et al. [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the effect of spatial position of each sampling point on species richness and species composition and proportions of insectivorous, omnivorous and frugivorous birds, we calculated the Euclidean distance between all pairs of points using either the data on species composition or species richness. Species richness is defined as number of bird species present in a plot and species composition as the percentage (%) of various bird species in relation to the total in a given area. We also calculated geographic distances between all pairs of plots. We used the Mantel test as implemented in the package Vegan in R with 1000 permutations to calculate the correlation between geographic distance and distance in species richness and composition. In the case of a significant effect of geographic distance, geographic position of the sampling points was used as a covariate in the subsequent analyses.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify the determinants of bird species richness, we used a generalized linear mixed effect model (GLMER) with Poisson distribution and log link function. The analyses were carried out using LME4 package in R [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref072">72</a>]. The figures were drawn using STATISTICA [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref073">73</a>]. Specifically, we tested the effect of altitude and the following local habitat characteristics: slope, forest canopy, shrub canopy, time of sampling, presence/absence of forest edge, presence/absence of litter and landscape heterogeneity. Locality and when sampled were used as random factors in the models. Significant habitat characteristics were selected using a forward step-wise selection procedure. Inclusion of a term into the model was assessed using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) as implemented in R [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a similar GLMER model to study the effect of habitat characteristics on occurrence of different feeding guilds. We linked the number of insectivorous and non-insectivorous birds at each location using a c-bind function and tested the effect of the predictors assuming binomial distribution of the dependent variable. Similarly, we tested the effects of predictors on the proportions of omnivorous and frugivorous birds. The results thus indicate the effects of different habitat characteristics on proportion of these guilds in the bird community.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multivariate tests of species composition were carried out using a unimodal technique because we have only presence/absence data [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref075">75</a>] and the gradient length was quite long (3.35). Therefore, we used Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) to show the relationship between bird species and environmental variables. The significance of the predictors was tested using a Monte Carlo permutation test. All tests were carried out using Canoco 5.01 [
  <a rid="pone.0150498.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref076">76</a>]. For these data, we used locality and recording time as covariates and tested the effect of altitude, and the local habitat characteristics: slope, forest canopy, shrub canopy, time of sampling, presence/absence of forest edge, presence/absence of litter and landscape heterogeneity. Significant habitat characteristics were selected using a forward step-wise selection procedure [
