 <div class="title">The association between species richness, proportion of omnivorous, frugivorous and insectivorous species and species composition, altitude and habitat characteristics.</div>
 <p>For species richness and proportions of the different feeding guilds, locality and time of sampling (pre- or post-breeding) were used as random effects in the models and tested using GLMER. For species composition, locality and time of sampling were used as covariates and the associations determined using CCA. Longitude, latitude and their interaction were used a covariates in cases of a significant association with space on the given dependent variables as identified by a Mantel test. Only variables selected as significant by a step wise selection are presented.</p>
