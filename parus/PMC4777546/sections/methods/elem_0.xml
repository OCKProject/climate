  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was carried out in fully or partly managed community forests outside protected areas. We obtained permission for studying birds from different village development committees, the Dovan Khola Community Forest user groups (for the Kot-thumki forest) in Tistung, the Daman village development committee for Simbhanjyang, the Thankot village development committee for Chandragiri Sachet Mahila Community forest in Chandragiri and the Godawari village development committee for the Phulchowki community forest. This study did not involve the collection of any endangered or protected species. We recorded the species and counted the numbers of birds from a distance so specific permission was not required.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study areas were located in the central mid-hills of the Himalayas in Nepal, which are located in two valleys, each with two localities. Two localities were in the Palung valley (Tistung, 27°39'N-85°05'E and Simbhanjyang, 27°33N-85°04'E) and two in the Kathmandu valley (Chandragiri, 27°40'N 85°12'E and Phulchowki, 27°34'N-85°23'E) in Nepal (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150498.g001" href="#pone.0150498.g001">Fig 1</a>). Phulchowki hill is an Important Bird Area (IBA) and one of the 27 IBAs in Nepal (see [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref047">47</a>]. An IBA is an area recognized as being highly important for the conservation of birds. Tistung and Simbhaynjyang are partially managed by a community forest and Chandragiri is fully managed by a community. Local people in community forest user groups are partially supervised by district forest offices and manage the natural resources of forested areas at particular locations. In both valleys 80% of the annual precipitation (about 1950 mm at Palung and 1639 mm at Kathmandu) falls during the monsoon season (June-September). However, short showers are common throughout the year. During January-February, snowfall is common 2300 meters above sea level (m a.s.l.) in both valleys. Kathmandu valley is between 1300 m and 2760 m a.s.l. and Makwanpur valley between 950 and 2582 m a.s.l. The average monthly maximum and minimum temperatures range between 14.8 and 2.4°C in winter and 22.3 and 14°C in summer at Palung, and 17.5 and 4.1°C in winter and 25.8 and 18.3°C in summer at Kathmandu, respectively [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref048">48</a>]. Both these valleys are densely populated and subsistence agriculture is common at lower altitudes (between 1500 and 1700 m a.s.l. at Chandragiri and Tistung) and a major part of local livelihood. Forests are severely affected by human intervention in all the areas studied [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected in two seasons in the same year (2009), which by including both pre breeding (April-early May) and post breeding (late May-June) seasons maximizes the chances of recording early breeding resident and late breeding migrant species. The birds present between 1500 m and 2400 m a.s.l. were recorded on the northern side of the mountains at four localities in both valleys because they are wetter than the south-facing slopes and have luxuriant vegetation suitable for birds [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref053">53</a>]. The sampling was done every 100 m, with records collected at ten altitudes at each locality. There was one fixed circle at each altitude. Each circle had a 50 m radius. Thus, all together the birds observed in 10 circles each with a 50 m radius at each locality on each sampling occasion were recorded (i.e. 10 circles x 4 localities x 2 times = 80 circles in total).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sampling was done in subtropical forest, shrubs, soil cliff and rocky area. As all sampling sites were chosen far from areas of human settlement, we completely excluded agricultural fields, orchards gardens and houses. Sampling at Chandragiri, Phulchowki and Tistung started at the edges of the forest and at Simbhanjyang in the forest in order to avoid settlements.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The locations of these circles were fixed with the help of an altimeter, Garmin GPS and a topographic map. Bird counting started normally early in the morning and continued to mid-morning each day. During data collection, three minutes were spent adjusting to the location and the next 20 minutes to counting birds in each circle at a particular altitude using the fixed point counting method [

During the bird count, we also recorded the altitude (in meters above sea level), slope (angle between the horizontal line and inclination of the place in degrees), proportional canopy cover of forest, presence of litter or forest humus and forest and shrubby areas in each of the circles sampled (in proportions). The proportion of the area covered by forest canopy was visually estimated. Altitude was measured with an altimeter and slope with a compass clinometer. Presence or absence of forest, shrubby areas, litter and forest edge, in each circle sampled, were visually recorded. Presence was given a value of one and absence as zero. In our study, 'forest' was precisely classified as an area of land covered with trees or other woody vegetation and 'shrubs' was classified as a land covered with medium sized woody plants with multiple stems and usually under 6 meters tall [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref070">70</a>]. The time of sampling was recorded as either time 1 (pre breeding, April-early May) or time 2 (post breeding season, late May-June).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We classified different bird guilds on the basis of their feeding habits [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref062">62</a>]. They were insectivorous, omnivorous, frugivorous, herbivorous, carnivorous and nectivorous. We analyzed differences in the proportions of insectivorous, omnivorous and frugivorous birds as described below. The other guilds (herbivorous = 7 species, carnivorous = 6 species and nectivorous = 2 species) were not tested due to their low occurrence in the dataset.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the effect of landscape heterogeneity on bird distribution and different feeding guilds of birds, we scanned maps of the area (1:125000) and calculated length of all the edges between different habitats within a 100 m circle around each sampling point using NIS software. Habitat categories on the map were forested area, open places and water bodies. However, there were no agricultural fields, orchards gardens and houses as our sampling sites were far from settlements. We then used this data to calculate the weighted edge density according to Hargis et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref071">71</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the effect of spatial position of each sampling point on species richness and species composition and proportions of insectivorous, omnivorous and frugivorous birds, we calculated the Euclidean distance between all pairs of points using either the data on species composition or species richness. Species richness is defined as number of bird species present in a plot and species composition as the percentage (%) of various bird species in relation to the total in a given area. We also calculated geographic distances between all pairs of plots. We used the Mantel test as implemented in the package Vegan in R with 1000 permutations to calculate the correlation between geographic distance and distance in species richness and composition. In the case of a significant effect of geographic distance, geographic position of the sampling points was used as a covariate in the subsequent analyses.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify the determinants of bird species richness, we used a generalized linear mixed effect model (GLMER) with Poisson distribution and log link function. The analyses were carried out using LME4 package in R [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref072">72</a>]. The figures were drawn using STATISTICA [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref073">73</a>]. Specifically, we tested the effect of altitude and the following local habitat characteristics: slope, forest canopy, shrub canopy, time of sampling, presence/absence of forest edge, presence/absence of litter and landscape heterogeneity. Locality and when sampled were used as random factors in the models. Significant habitat characteristics were selected using a forward step-wise selection procedure. Inclusion of a term into the model was assessed using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) as implemented in R [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref074">74</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a similar GLMER model to study the effect of habitat characteristics on occurrence of different feeding guilds. We linked the number of insectivorous and non-insectivorous birds at each location using a c-bind function and tested the effect of the predictors assuming binomial distribution of the dependent variable. Similarly, we tested the effects of predictors on the proportions of omnivorous and frugivorous birds. The results thus indicate the effects of different habitat characteristics on proportion of these guilds in the bird community.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multivariate tests of species composition were carried out using a unimodal technique because we have only presence/absence data [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref075">75</a>] and the gradient length was quite long (3.35). Therefore, we used Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) to show the relationship between bird species and environmental variables. The significance of the predictors was tested using a Monte Carlo permutation test. All tests were carried out using Canoco 5.01 [

For these data, we used locality and recording time as covariates and tested the effect of altitude, and the local habitat characteristics: slope, forest canopy, shrub canopy, time of sampling, presence/absence of forest edge, presence/absence of litter and landscape heterogeneity. Significant habitat characteristics were selected using a forward step-wise selection procedure [
