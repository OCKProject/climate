  <p>Relationships between a female's probability of giving birth to a foal surviving to late summer (September 1) in focal year 
   <span class="italic">t</span> and (a) female quality, and (b) female age in year 
   <span class="italic">t</span>, according to its reproductive status (“foal” or “no foal”) the previous year (
   <span class="italic">t</span> − 1). Here, 
   <span class="italic">t</span> refers to the focal year (i.e., foal birth year). Models included local density, band size, band sex ratio, winter severity, and female quality or female age set to their mean values as fixed effects and horse identity as a random factor (

   <sub>horse</sub> = 113, 
   <span class="italic">n</span>
   <sub>observations</sub> = 496). The solid lines and the shaded areas depict relationships predicted by the selected models and their 95% confidence intervals, respectively
