 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The probability to wean a foal (i.e., foal surviving to the next summer) for females having a live foal at the end of the summer was best described by the model including female quality, female age, winter severity after birth, local density, band size and band sex ratio (conditional

  <a rid="ece33082-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33082-sup-0001">S4</a>b for details on model selection). The variables included in the selected model had the highest predictor weights (Table 
  <a rid="ece33082-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33082-tbl-0002">2</a>), except for the reproductive status the previous year that was not included in the selected model even with a high predictor weight.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">No cost of previous reproduction on weaning success was detected for females having a live foal at the end of the summer. Good‐quality and young females showed a higher probability to wean a foal than poorer quality females (Table

  <a rid="ece33082-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33082-fig-0004">4</a>a, b). Also, the probability to wean a foal increased as winter severity after birth decreased (Table 
  <a rid="ece33082-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33082-tbl-0003">3</a>b, Figure 
  <a rid="ece33082-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33082-fig-0004">4</a>c), as local density decreased (Table

  <a rid="ece33082-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33082-fig-0004">4</a>d), and as band size and sex ratio decreased (Table
