 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population and life‐history data collection began with a partial census in the summer of 2007. From 2008 onward, systematic yearly ground censuses were performed during the mid–late breeding season (July to September). Daily walking censuses focused on one of seven sections, allowing complete coverage of the island in 1 week. The location of bands (i.e., breeding groups), bachelor groups, and lone individuals were recorded to within 5 m using a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS). At every encounter, multiple photographs were taken in addition to recording each horse's coloration, facial features, distinguishing marks, sex, age category (foal, yearling, 2–3 years old, or older), reproductive status, and group membership. Identifications were later confirmed in the laboratory using a photographic database. Sampling was performed under University of Saskatchewan Animal Care Protocol 20090032 and under guidance of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.</p>

  <span class="italic"> </span>380, 437, 503, 448, 534, 559, 552, and 457, respectively. The entire dataset included 874 individuals including 600 foals born since 2007. From 2008 to 2015, more than 33,000 locations of horses were collected, and the likelihood of missing a horse if it was alive was very low (resighting probability across year: 0.994 for females and 0.992 for males). Hence, if a horse was not observed during an entire field season it was considered dead.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using birth records and morphology we were able to accurately attribute birth year for individuals born after 2007 or first observed as yearlings and young adults (≤3 years old) in 2007 or 2008. For individuals first observed as adults (aged 4+ years) in 2007 and 2008 (53.1% of the females considered in this study), birth year was assumed to be 2002 and 2003, respectively. Note that winter 2002–2003 was characterized by a high mortality rate (with more than 280 carcasses found during the following summer), limiting our underestimation of the age of the individuals first seen as adult as we expected that many of the older adults may have died in 2002–2003. Our inability to age females first observed as adult accurately (
  <span class="italic">n </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>60) was a weakness of the data; however, in order to limit any biases resulting from underestimating age at death, we ignored females that died within 2 years after first being observed as an adult (
  <span class="italic">n </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>7). We retained for analyses only sexually mature females (3+ years old) with data available (as adult) for at least two successive years. Consequently, all females included in the analyses lived to at least 4 years of age. Further, to allow including longevity, age at last breeding, and success at last breeding event in a metric of quality, we only retained females that died over the study period (between 2007 and 2015) and were known to have reproduced at least once. By doing so we acknowledge that females dying old may have died at an underestimated age compared to females dying young; however, whereas reduced variability in longevity may limit our ability to detect an effect of quality it should not lead to false pattern. In total, our dataset contained 496 observations (births with foals surviving to end of summer, or not) from 113 females (4.39 ± 1.83 [(

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Probability of giving birth to a foal (that successfully lived to September 1) and probability of weaning (survival to age 1) was assessed by observing females during our field season, which occurred during the mid–late breeding season (July–August). A female observed nursing a foal was characterized as having reproduced that year, and if the foal was still alive the following summer then the females was characterized as having weaned (recruited) the foal.</p>
