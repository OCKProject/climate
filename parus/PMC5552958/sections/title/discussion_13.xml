 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the probabilities of giving birth to a foal that survived to the end of summer and weaning a foal overwinter to the next summer depended on intrinsic, environmental, and social factors. This is the first time these three categories of factors have been coupled in the same analysis to test for their effect on the costs of reproduction. Female quality and female age interacted with reproductive status in the previous year (P1, P2), highlighting their role in modulating the costs of reproduction on future reproduction, while no effect of social or environmental covariates was found (contradicting P3 to P7).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Sable Island horses, the costs of reproduction were modulated by a female's individual quality. Good‐quality females showed higher probabilities of giving birth regardless of their reproductive status the previous year; whereas the probability to reproduce of poorer quality females was negatively affected by reproduction the previous year (Figure 
  <a rid="ece33082-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33082-fig-0002">2</a>a). This suggests that good‐quality females were able to compensate for the costs of reproduction with no carryover effect on next reproduction; while in poorer quality females, reproduction entailed costs on their future reproduction. Restricting analyses on reproducing females, no such effects were detected on the probability of weaning, and previously reproductive females had the same probability to wean their foal. Higher probability of weaning was found for higher quality and younger females (Figure 
  <a rid="ece33082-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33082-fig-0004">4</a>a, b). As with female quality, female age also modulated the cost of reproduction. Higher probabilities of giving birth (but not weaning an offspring) were found for prime‐aged females (P2) only if they had not reproduced the previous year, suggesting higher costs of reproduction for prime‐aged females; while particularly low probabilities were found for older females that did not previously reproduce (Figure 
  <a rid="ece33082-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33082-fig-0002">2</a>b).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Female intrinsic variables as well as environmental and/or social factors influenced both the probability of giving birth and weaning an offspring. Indeed, the probability of giving birth increased with increasing local density and band size, and females in bands with a sex ratio biased toward males showed a higher probability of giving birth. The positive relationship found between winter severity and probability of giving birth suggests that contrary to expectation, the probability of giving birth was not constrained by winter severity before birth. Alternatively, higher overwinter foal mortality due to harsh winter conditions may enhance the probability of giving birth the following year by lowering abortion rates. However, the probability to wean the foal decreased as local density and band size increased. These effects of local density, band size, and band sex ratio highlighted the importance of considering social factors while studying the probability of giving birth and weaning an offspring.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Group size can have contrasting effects on reproductive success. For example, living in larger groups was shown to negatively affect reproductive success in black howler monkeys (
  <span class="italic">Alouatta pigra</span>; van Belle &amp; Estrada, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0004">2008</a>), and to lower birth rates (but not offspring survival or interbirth interval) in Sichuan snub‐nosed monkeys (
  <span class="italic">Rhinopithecus roxellana</span>; Zhao, Li, &amp; Watanabe, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0079">2011</a>) and long‐tailed macaques (
  <span class="italic">Macaca fascicularis</span>; van Noordwijk &amp; van Schaik, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0050">1999</a>). Such negative consequences of group size have been attributed to the costs of sociality and in particular to increases in intragroup competition (van Noordwijk &amp; van Schaik, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0050">1999</a>). However, living in large groups can also be advantageous. For instance, in a population of feral horses in the Llanos of Venezuela, Pacheco and Herrera (
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0053">1997</a>) noted a positive correlation between the number of females in a band and the number of foals per female born during the study. On Sable Island, Welsh (
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0076">1975</a>) highlighted a reduced number of births per female in small bands. As large bands form over long periods of time, we can expect that larger bands are more likely to be held by high‐quality, dominant and experienced stallions in feral horses. Indeed, bands increase in size during a stallion's early years of tenure (Welsh, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0076">1975</a>) and harem size is at its maximum for stallions between 6 and 9 years of age (Kaseda &amp; Khalil, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0036">1996</a>). In Sable Island horses, the positive association between the probability to give birth and band size could be due to the presence of such dominant stallion, if these lead to lower harassment rates for females from outsider males, or the ability of experienced stallions to acquire resources or sheltering areas. Surprisingly, the reverse trend was found for the probability to wean the foal, highlighting that band size effect might be more complex and that factors affecting foal survival and female's probability to reproduce are different.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that the probability of giving birth increased as band sex ratio became more biased toward adult males. The same relationship was found in two primate species (Fedigan &amp; Jack, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0017">2011</a>; Treves, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0071">2001</a>). The lower probability of giving birth in female‐biased bands might be due to increased female–female competition and aggression. Furthermore, the presence of more subadult and adult males in the group may lower the probability of take over from outsider males (Fedigan &amp; Jack, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0017">2011</a>; Treves, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0071">2001</a>). Consequently, band stability seems to be a key factor influencing birth rate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The probability of giving birth increased as local density increased. This finding is the opposite of what we expected in the presence of density‐dependent pressure (Gaillard, Festa‐Bianchet, Yoccoz, Loison, &amp; Toigo, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0020">2000</a>). This counterintuitive result could be due to the benefits of being part of a large, presumably more stable band and held by an experienced stallion. Alternatively, such a pattern could be due to the process of domestication/feralization, where artificial selection for high reproductive performance in domestic species could cause females to trade their own survival for investment in reproduction under high density as found in Camargue horses (Grange, Duncan, &amp; Gaillard, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0025">2009</a>). The probability to subsequently wean the foal, however, decreased as local density increased highlighting a negative density‐dependent foal survival.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Costs of reproduction have been found in many species (Gittleman &amp; Thompson, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0023">1988</a>; Speakman, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0062">2008</a>), yet in some cases they have been difficult to detect (Toïgo et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0070">2002</a>; Weladji et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0075">2008</a>). As high‐quality females and/or females in suitable environmental and social conditions may be better at coping with the costs of reproduction than poor‐quality individuals and/or females living in less suitable conditions, heterogeneity in individual quality or environmental factors may be to blame for difficulties in detecting costs of reproduction. The probability of giving birth and of weaning increased with maternal quality in previously reproductive females, suggesting a greater cost of reproduction in poor‐quality females and highlighting the importance of female quality. In our specific case, without the addition of female quality, no costs of reproduction would have been detected (∆AIC
  <sub>c</sub> to null model &lt;2.0). Such links between individual quality and the costs of reproduction have been found in other studies (Hamel, Craine, &amp; Towne, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0029">2012</a>; Hamel, Cote et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0028">2009</a>, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0027">2010</a>; Lescroel et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0037">2009</a>; Robert et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0057">2012</a>), and individual quality should, therefore, be taken into account while studying reproductive costs.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is well established that the probability to reproduce and breeding success in females is not constant across ontogeny (McNamara &amp; Houston, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0043">1996</a>). In several species, including horses, the relationship between the probability to reproduce or breeding success and female age has a typical bell shape, with prime‐aged females having the highest probabilities (Beauplet, Barbraud, Dabin, Kussener, &amp; Guinet, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0002">2006</a>; Garrott et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0021">1991</a>; Rauset et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0055">2015</a>; Rughetti, Dematteis, Meneguz, &amp; Festa‐Bianchet, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0060">2015</a>; Tettamanti et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0069">2015</a>). In Sable Island horses such a relationship was found, but only for females that did not reproduce the previous year. The difference between previously reproducing and nonreproducing females suggests that the cost of reproduction depends on a female's age, with prime‐aged females bearing higher costs of reproduction. Age‐dependent cost of reproduction was reported in several species, with higher costs of reproduction found in younger (i.e., first breeding) and/or older individuals (red deer, 
  <span class="italic">Cervus elaphus</span> [Clutton‐Brock, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0011">1984</a>]; lesser snow geese, 
  <span class="italic">Anas caerulescens caerulescens</span> [Viallefont, Cooke, &amp; Lebreton, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0073">1995</a>]; greater flamingos, 
  <span class="italic">Phoenicopterus ruber roseus</span> [Tavecchia, Pradel, Boy, Johnson, &amp; Cezilly, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0067">2001</a>]; Soay sheep, 
  <span class="italic">Ovis aries</span> [Tavecchia et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0066">2005</a>]; Weddell seals, 
  <span class="italic">Leptonychotes weddellii</span> [Hadley, Rotella, &amp; Garrott, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0026">2007</a>]; and wolverines [Rauset et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0055">2015</a>]). The probability of giving birth after a nonbreeding event is low in older animals (more than 10 years old; Figure 
  <a rid="ece33082-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33082-fig-0002">2</a>a), and this decrease in fecundity and reproductive success in older individuals (i.e., senescence) is commonly observed in iteroparous species (Clutton‐Brock, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0011">1984</a>). However, contrary to expectations we did not find higher costs of reproduction in older (potentially senescent) females, and females that did actually reproduce after 10 years of age were more likely to reproduce again the following year compared to previously nonbreeding females. Similar results have been found in chamois (Morin, Rughetti, Rioux‐Paquette, &amp; Festa‐Bianchet, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0045">2016</a>), where a strong tendency for some older females to reproduce successfully in consecutive years has been reported. Selective disappearance of the lower quality females through time could explain these patterns (Hamel, Cote et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0028">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We did not find evidence for effects of either environmental (winter severity, location) or social (local density, band size, local and band sex ratio) factors in modulating costs of reproduction. Costs of reproduction on both female survival (Festa‐Bianchet et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0018">1998</a> in bighorn sheep; Tavecchia et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0066">2005</a> in Soay sheep; Robert et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0057">2012</a> in Monteiro's Storm‐Petrel) and future reproduction (Clutton‐Brock, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0011">1984</a> in red deer; Rauset et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0055">2015</a> in wolverines) were associated with environmental variation in other studies. For instance, reproductive costs were mediated by environmental harshness in a long‐lived seabird species, with unsuccessful breeders being more sensitive to oceanographic variation than more successful individuals (Robert et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0057">2012</a>). Moreover, reproductive costs on future reproduction were found to vary with population density in red deer (Clutton‐Brock, 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0011">1984</a>) and mountain goats (Hamel, Cote et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0027">2010</a>). However, our results are similar to a study in female Weddell seals (
  <span class="italic">Leptonychotes weddellii</span>), where even in a highly variable environment, reproductive costs on future reproduction did not appear to vary substantially from year to year nor according to summer sea‐ice conditions (Hadley et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0026">2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study highlights the importance of considering intrinsic, environmental, and social factors while investigating reproductive costs. We found that female quality and age were modulating costs of reproduction. Hence, in Sable Island horses, individual heterogeneity appears to be a key factor for costs of reproduction whereas social and environmental factors appear to play a lesser role. The presence of such effects may influence the probability of detecting costs of reproduction and should therefore be taken into account when possible. We call for additional research contrasting the effects of individual heterogeneity, environmental and social conditions on costs of reproduction.</p>
