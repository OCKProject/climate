 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sable Island National Park Reserve (43°55′ N; 60°00′ W) is a vegetated sandbar located 275 km southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia (Appendix 
  <a rid="ece33082-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33082-sup-0001">S1</a>). It is 49 km long and 1.3 km wide at its broadest point. The climate is temperate oceanic with warm summers and cool, wet and windy winters. Topography is characterized by sandy beaches, rolling heath meadows, and sand dunes that reach heights up to 30 m. The island's vegetation is dominated by marram grass (
  <span class="italic">Ammophila breviligulata</span>). The availability of freshwater as well as vegetation quality decrease from west to east (Contasti et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0013">2012</a>; Rozen‐Rechels et al., 
  <a rid="ece33082-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0059">2015</a>). Horses in the west and central parts of the island have access to several permanent freshwater ponds, whereas horses in the east must excavate wells for access to freshwater. Introduced to Sable Island in the mid‐1700s, the horses are now the island's only terrestrial mammal (apart from a very limited human presence). While removals and supplementation occurred periodically over the last centuries, the population became legally protected from human interference in 1961 and has been unmanaged since then (Christie,
