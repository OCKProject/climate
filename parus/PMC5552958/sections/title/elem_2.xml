  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sable Island National Park Reserve (43°55′ N; 60°00′ W) is a vegetated sandbar located 275 km southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia (Appendix 
   <a rid="ece33082-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33082-sup-0001">S1</a>). It is 49 km long and 1.3 km wide at its broadest point. The climate is temperate oceanic with warm summers and cool, wet and windy winters. Topography is characterized by sandy beaches, rolling heath meadows, and sand dunes that reach heights up to 30 m. The island's vegetation is dominated by marram grass (
   <span class="italic">Ammophila breviligulata</span>). The availability of freshwater as well as vegetation quality decrease from west to east (Contasti et al., 
   <a rid="ece33082-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0013">2012</a>; Rozen‐Rechels et al., 
   <a rid="ece33082-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0059">2015</a>). Horses in the west and central parts of the island have access to several permanent freshwater ponds, whereas horses in the east must excavate wells for access to freshwater. Introduced to Sable Island in the mid‐1700s, the horses are now the island's only terrestrial mammal (apart from a very limited human presence). While removals and supplementation occurred periodically over the last centuries, the population became legally protected from human interference in 1961 and has been unmanaged since then (Christie,

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population and life‐history data collection began with a partial census in the summer of 2007. From 2008 onward, systematic yearly ground censuses were performed during the mid–late breeding season (July to September). Daily walking censuses focused on one of seven sections, allowing complete coverage of the island in 1 week. The location of bands (i.e., breeding groups), bachelor groups, and lone individuals were recorded to within 5 m using a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS). At every encounter, multiple photographs were taken in addition to recording each horse's coloration, facial features, distinguishing marks, sex, age category (foal, yearling, 2–3 years old, or older), reproductive status, and group membership. Identifications were later confirmed in the laboratory using a photographic database. Sampling was performed under University of Saskatchewan Animal Care Protocol 20090032 and under guidance of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.</p>

    <span class="italic"> </span>380, 437, 503, 448, 534, 559, 552, and 457, respectively. The entire dataset included 874 individuals including 600 foals born since 2007. From 2008 to 2015, more than 33,000 locations of horses were collected, and the likelihood of missing a horse if it was alive was very low (resighting probability across year: 0.994 for females and 0.992 for males). Hence, if a horse was not observed during an entire field season it was considered dead.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using birth records and morphology we were able to accurately attribute birth year for individuals born after 2007 or first observed as yearlings and young adults (≤3 years old) in 2007 or 2008. For individuals first observed as adults (aged 4+ years) in 2007 and 2008 (53.1% of the females considered in this study), birth year was assumed to be 2002 and 2003, respectively. Note that winter 2002–2003 was characterized by a high mortality rate (with more than 280 carcasses found during the following summer), limiting our underestimation of the age of the individuals first seen as adult as we expected that many of the older adults may have died in 2002–2003. Our inability to age females first observed as adult accurately (
    <span class="italic">n </span>=
    <span class="italic"> </span>60) was a weakness of the data; however, in order to limit any biases resulting from underestimating age at death, we ignored females that died within 2 years after first being observed as an adult (
    <span class="italic">n </span>=
    <span class="italic"> </span>7). We retained for analyses only sexually mature females (3+ years old) with data available (as adult) for at least two successive years. Consequently, all females included in the analyses lived to at least 4 years of age. Further, to allow including longevity, age at last breeding, and success at last breeding event in a metric of quality, we only retained females that died over the study period (between 2007 and 2015) and were known to have reproduced at least once. By doing so we acknowledge that females dying old may have died at an underestimated age compared to females dying young; however, whereas reduced variability in longevity may limit our ability to detect an effect of quality it should not lead to false pattern. In total, our dataset contained 496 observations (births with foals surviving to end of summer, or not) from 113 females (4.39 ± 1.83 [(

From an analysis using the dataset considered herein (not shown), we knew that body condition of adult females did not significantly change over a field season. Mean lifetime body condition of adult females was calculated as the average body condition obtained in different years (number of years with available body condition scores per female: (

    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0028">2009</a>), Hamel, Gaillard et al. (
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0030">2009</a>) could be used to obtain a multivariate metric of quality in adult females, we tested if most of the covariation among four life‐history traits expected to be linked to lifetime fitness was captured by a single axis using a principal component analysis (PCA) with the R (R Development Core Team, 2010) ade4 package (Dray &amp; Dufour, 
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0015">2007</a>). These traits were longevity, mean adult body condition, success at last breeding before death [three modalities: no reproduction code 0, reproduction but offspring died before the next summer code 1, and reproduction with offspring that survived code 2] and age at last reproduction). Longevity is often associated with performance in other life‐history traits (Nussey, Kruuk, Donald, Fowlie, &amp; Clutton‐Brock, 
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0051">2006</a>) and is a commonly used trait to assess individual quality (Moyes et al., 
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0046">2009</a>; Espie, James, Oliphant, Warkentin, &amp; Lieske,

    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0074">2006</a>). Even if correlated, age at death and age at last reproduction differ for 28% of the females with a mean difference of 2.5 ± 1.05 years (maximum = 7 years). Specifically, we hypothesized that females who maintain high condition will also live longer, reproduce at a later age, and wean foals at an older age; whereas low condition females will either not live to an old age, or not attempt reproduction or successfully wean a foal when they do so. In contrast to other systems (e.g., Moyes et al., 
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0046">2009</a>), a clear threshold appeared when plotting the proportion of variation in traits accounted for by the successive principal components (PCs; see Appendix 
    <a rid="ece33082-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33082-sup-0001">S2</a>), with the first axis accounting for ~50% of the total variation. As predicted, covariation among the four traits was positive (Table 
    <a rid="ece33082-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33082-tbl-0001">1</a>). Following Hamel, Cote et al. (
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0028">2009</a>), Hamel, Gaillard et al. (
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0030">2009</a>), we therefore interpreted an individual's score on this PC as a description of its quality. High‐quality individuals were thus characterized by higher body condition, greater longevity, and having a higher probability of successfully breeding at their last attempt and of reproducing at an older age. As expected from an axis reflecting individual quality, PC1 was strongly correlated to a proxy of lifetime fitness (Wilson &amp; Nussey, 
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0078">2010</a>), with higher quality females showing a higher number of reproductive events through the study period (linear regression:

    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0034">1997</a>) index as a proxy for winter severity. As described in Manning, Medill, and McLoughlin (
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0039">2015</a>), this was calculated as the geometric mean of daily NAO values from 1 January to 31 March, and developed into a continuous index using a 
    <span class="italic">Z</span>‐score (standard normal random variable). The data were extracted from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (available at: 
    <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products</span>). On Sable Island, negative NAO index values generally reflect mild winter conditions characterized by high daily minimum and maximum temperatures, low number of days with frost, and low precipitation; while positive NAO index values reflect harsh winter conditions (see Appendix 
    <a rid="ece33082-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33082-sup-0001">S3</a> for details). Because location on Sable Island is correlated with horse habitat quality (Contasti et al., 
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0013">2012</a>; Rozen‐Rechels et al., 
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0059">2015</a>), we also considered each individual's median longitude during summer census surveys as a measure of local environmental quality.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We considered band size and band sex ratio, as well as local (area) sex ratio and density as extrinsic social variables. Local density was calculated as the number of individuals (excluding foals) within 8,000 m of an individual's summer centroid location divided by the vegetated surface area (km
    <span class="sup">2</span>) within that buffer which is the area used by horses for foraging (number of horses per km
    <span class="sup">2</span> of vegetated area; see Marjamäki, Contasti, Coulson, &amp; McLoughlin, 
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0040">2013</a> for more details). Local density was then calculated as a function of vegetated area (km
    <span class="sup">2</span>) preventing any bias induced by the presence of unequal surface of available area 
    <span class="italic">versus</span> sea water inside the individual buffers. Local density was higher in the west compared to the east, and was highly correlated with habitat quality, with the best quality habitat supporting the highest densities (van Beest et al., 
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0003">2014</a>). We estimated band size as the mean number of individuals (excluding foals) present in an individual's band during the summer. We calculated local and band sex ratios as the number of males aged 3 years or more divided by the total number of individuals aged 3 or more within 8,000 m of an individual's summer centroid location (local sex ratio) or in the individual's band (band sex ratio), respectively (Manning et al., 
    <a rid="ece33082-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0039">2015</a>). Sex ratio therefore ranges from one when only males are present to zero when only females are present.

To test for costs of reproduction, reproductive status the previous year (produced a foal observed in July–August in the previous summer or not) was included as a fixed effect. To test for the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic variables on costs of reproduction, fixed effects also included female age (fitted as a continuous variable with a quadratic effect to allow for nonlinear relationships), female quality, median location in summer (standardized to a mean of 0 and 
   <span class="italic">SD</span> of 1), band size, local abundance in summer (standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1), local and band sex ratios, winter severity (winter NAO) before conception, during pregnancy and the first winter of the foal (only for models on the probability of weaning) as well as their two‐way interactions with reproductive status the previous year. More complex interactions were not considered to avoid overparameterization of our models. Horse identity was included as a random effect in all models to account for repeated measurements. Because local density and mean summer location were highly correlated (Pearson's product–moment correlation: correlation = 0.70, 
   <span class="italic">n </span>=
   <span class="italic"> </span>496,

   <span class="italic">df</span> = 494, 
   <span class="italic">p </span>&lt;
   <span class="italic"> </span>.001), both factors were not included in the same model to avoid issues of colinearity. Because the relationship between female age and probability to give birth or wean a foal is not expected to be linear in feral horses (Garrott, Eagle, &amp; Plotka, 
   <a rid="ece33082-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0021">1991</a>), we added a second‐order polynomial term to allow for such nonlinearity. Note that band size and local density were not correlated (Pearson's product–moment correlation: correlation = –0.02,

   <span class="italic"> </span>496,

   <a rid="ece33082-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0041">2015</a>). The best models were then selected using the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AIC
   <sub>c</sub>), which reflects the best compromise between model precision and accuracy (Burnham &amp; Anderson, 
   <a rid="ece33082-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0007">2002</a>; Symonds &amp; Moussalli, 
   <a rid="ece33082-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0065">2011</a>). According to the rule of parsimony, we selected the simplest model within 2.0 AIC
   <sub>c</sub> of the top model (Burnham &amp; Anderson, 
   <a rid="ece33082-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0007">2002</a>). We also calculated evidence ratio (ER) and AIC
   <sub>c</sub> weights (AIC
   <sub>c</sub>Wts) as a measure of the likelihood that a given model was the best among the set of fitted models. Using the sum of the AIC
   <sub>c</sub>Wts (termed the predictor weight), we estimated the relative importance of each variable and interactions according to Symonds and Moussalli (
   <a rid="ece33082-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33082-bib-0065">2011</a>). The predictor weight can be interpreted as being equivalent to the probability that the predictor is a component of the best model. For all selected logistic models we calculated the conditional and marginal coefficient of determination (
   <span class="italic">pseudo R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>). The marginal coefficient of determination represents the variance explained by fixed factors and conditional coefficient of determination interprets as variance explained by both fixed and random factors (Nakagawa &amp; Schielzeth,
