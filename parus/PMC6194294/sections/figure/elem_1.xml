  <p>(a) Relationship between time of the day and breath rate (BR) of all the species considered in this study (
   <span class="italic">N </span>=
   <span class="italic"> </span>879 individuals from 69 species). We used raw data as in the corresponding model. (b) Relationship between body mass and BR (
   <span class="italic">N </span>=
   <span class="italic"> </span>69 species). Finally, we show (c) differences in BR among diet groups. In (b) and (c), we used the residuals of the first model, that is, data standardized by temporal variation, as in the corresponding models. In all cases, we plotted the model‐predicted values, controlling for phylogenetic relationships between species and the other factors, to improve the appearance and smoothness of the plots
