 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impact of anthropogenic disturbance is increasingly evident around the world (Seto et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0056">2012</a>), but our knowledge on how it impacts species phenotypes and genotypes is still rather limited (Johnson &amp; Munshi‐South, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0033">2017</a>). Previous research has shown that species usually show no or limited responses to anthropogenic disturbance (Bonier, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0006">2012</a>; Chavezzichinelli et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0015">2010</a>; Hudin et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0028">2018</a>; Sepp et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0055">2018</a>). In line with these results, the pace‐of‐life hypothesis predicts no differences in stress responses between urban and rural habitats (Sepp et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0055">2018</a>), but previous studies have been inconsistent in confirming this point with regard to BR variation, a proxy of acute stress responses to handling (Charmantier et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0014">2017</a>; Senar et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0054">2017</a>; Torné‐Noguera et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0063">2014</a>). Our results, using hundreds of individuals from over a hundred species of passerines, demonstrate that there were no differences in BR, both between and within species, among natural, rural, and urban locations. Therefore, we expand previous findings to a broader geographic area and confirm this hypothesis at the community level.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Superficially, it would seem reasonable that the positive correlation between BR and time of day might be due to an increase in body temperature with ambient temperature. However, body temperature and BR have been shown to be uncorrelated (Carere &amp; van Oers, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0011">2004</a>). An alternative mechanism could be that hormonal changes lead to increasing organismal responsiveness, in addition to a decrease in energy reserves, across the day (Romero &amp; Remage‐Healey, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0052">2000</a>; Weaver et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0066">2018</a>). Further research would be needed to ascertain the exact drivers of this increase in BR across the day. We also recorded a significant negative relationship between body mass and BR, although this pattern was not consistent within species. This suggests that while body mass is an accurate predictor of BR across species, in a similar fashion to the strong and positive relationship between body mass and metabolic rate (Londoño et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0037">2015</a>), it may be not so relevant to explain within‐species, or between‐individual, variation.
