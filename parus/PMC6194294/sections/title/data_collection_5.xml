 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected data on BR and body mass from all individuals. Once the bird was extracted from the net, we kept it in a bag for at least 5 min until we took the bird out. Although not all individuals spent the same time in the nets, all individuals were given a similar period of time to rest inside the cloth bag, so that we obtained a standard and comparable measure from all individuals. We noted the time (number of hours since dawn), season (rainy or dry), and species identity. We then measured BR following Torné‐Noguera et al. (
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0063">2014</a>). We placed the bird on its back with its head held between the index and central fingers and tarsi held with the other hand. In doing so, birds could not see the face of the person holding it. We then counted the number of breast movements over 30 s. While recording BR, we kept our movements and speech to a minimum. Finally, we measured the body mass using a digital balance to the nearest 0.1 g. We only measured healthy birds and observed no harm to them by the capture and measuring process.
