 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vertebrates display stress responses to cope with harmful and unpredictable stimuli (i.e., stressors) (Romero, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0051">2004</a>). Across their evolution, natural stressors, to which vertebrates have had time to adapt, have shaped these responses. However, since the industrial revolution, anthropogenic disturbance has become a key source of stress for wildlife (Wingfield, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0070">2013</a>). During the last decades, such stressors have become widespread due to a fast and exponential increase in anthropogenic disturbance around the world (Hendry, Gotanda, &amp; Svensson, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0026">2017</a>; Vitousek, Mooney, Lubchenco, &amp; Melillo, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0065">1997</a>). These impacts are particularly evident as a result of the progressive transformation of natural habitats, which includes drastic changes in abiotic factors, habitat structure, food quality and quantity, and human population density and activity. This increase in anthropogenic disturbance is known to drive a homogenization effect on biodiversity (McKinney, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0041">2006</a>) and to select certain phenotypes able to cope with these new stressors (Alberti, Marzluff, &amp; Hunt, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0002">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yet, not all species respond in the same way to anthropogenic disturbance. Previous research has suggested that generalist species are less sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance than specialists due to their higher physiological tolerance (Bonier, Martin, &amp; Wingfield, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0007">2007</a>). Hence, as natural habitats are urbanized, some species are lost (McKinney, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0042">2008</a>), whereas others display physiological responses to cope with these novel environments (Chevin, Lande, &amp; Mace, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0016">2010</a>; see also Isaksson, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0029">2015</a>). Inspired by previous research on rural–urban differences, the pace‐of‐life hypothesis suggests that individuals colonizing urban environments show a particular suite of life history traits (i.e., high investment in self‐maintenance and low investment in reproduction), but also predicts no change in stress responses (Sepp, McGraw, Kaasik, &amp; Giraudeau, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0055">2018</a>). Accordingly, most research on the topic has shown that species display limited or no changes in stress responses when exposed to anthropogenic disturbance (Bonier, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0006">2012</a>; Chavezzichinelli et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0015">2010</a>; Hudin et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0028">2018</a>; Sepp et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0055">2018</a>). This has raised the question whether urban areas are not particularly stressful habitats, or at least similarly stressful compared to natural environments, for the species able to colonize them.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breath rate (BR), measured as the number of breaths per time unit, namely the number of breast movements indicative of inspirations and expirations, is an indicator of acute stress responses to handling in passerines (Carere &amp; van Oers, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0011">2004</a>). Stress responses are usually quantified through corticosterone levels in blood (Fokidis, Orchinik, &amp; Deviche, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0022">2009</a>), feathers (Bortolotti, Marchant, Blas, &amp; German, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0008">2008</a>), and feces (Casas et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0012">2016</a>), but these approaches are time‐consuming and costly. In contrast, measuring BR is an inexpensive and direct method that can be used as a rapid assessment tool. Although no study has established a direct link between corticosterone levels and BR, there is a clear link between BR and a brain center that plays a key role in generalized alertness, attention, and stress (Yackle et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0071">2017</a>; see also Noble, Goolsby, Garraway, Martin, &amp; Hochman, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0043">2017</a>). Moreover, behavioral traits can show higher individual repeatability than hormone levels, which have been shown to be extremely variable (Holtmann, Lagisz, &amp; Nakagawa, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0027">2017</a>; Weaver, Gao, &amp; McGraw, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0066">2018</a>). However, to completely understand BR, it is necessary to control for several related factors. Body mass strongly influences metabolism (Speakman, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0059">2005</a>) and likely determines interspecific differences in BR, as it determines basal metabolic rates (Londoño, Chappell, Castañeda, Jankowski, &amp; Robinson, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0037">2015</a>). Stress responses also show considerable daily and seasonal temporal variability (Romero &amp; Remage‐Healey, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0052">2000</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous research has shown inconsistent results when assessing changes in BR in response to urbanization, with different studies showing increased BR toward more urbanized areas (Charmantier, Demeyrier, Lambrechts, Perret, &amp; Grégoire, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0014">2017</a>; Torné‐Noguera, Pagani‐Núñez, &amp; Senar, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0063">2014</a>) or no significant differences in stress responses to handling between rural and urban birds (Senar et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0054">2017</a>). However, this evidence is limited to a single species (great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) and to a limited geographic region (SW Europe). Additional research using more species in different habitats or regions is therefore necessary to confirm these patterns. This knowledge gap on the consequences of urbanization is particularly evident in Southeast Asia, one of the most diverse and densely populated areas of the world (Chace &amp; Walsh, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0013">2006</a>), and a region in which urbanization rates are currently very high (Seto, Güneralp, &amp; Hutyra, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0056">2012</a>). Here, we analyzed for the first time BR variation at a community level, specifically measuring BR in eight subtropical passerine assemblages in natural, rural, and urban locations that strongly differ in species composition.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, diet has a relevant role in determining species capacity to colonize urban areas (Coogan, Raubenheimer, Zantis, &amp; Machovsky‐Capuska, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0017">2018</a>), and diet restriction and change are known to induce increased stress responses (Skinner et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0057">2016</a>; Will et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0068">2015</a>). Changes in diet composition have been described to impact fatty acid composition and oxidative stress across urbanization gradients (Isaksson, Andersson, Nord, von Post, &amp; Wang, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0030">2017</a>). We thus hypothesized that while omnivores would be able to handle stress associated with anthropogenic disturbance, more specialized groups, such as herbivores and insectivores, would be more affected by these stressors. We label this idea as the “diet‐induced stress response hypothesis.” We predicted that birds with herbivore and insectivore diets would show relatively higher BR at handling than omnivores.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, although the pace‐of‐life hypothesis predicts no impact of urbanization on stress responses, it also suggests substantial behavioral changes that may result in decreased fear (or increased risk taking) toward humans (Sepp et al., 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0055">2018</a>; see also Griffin, Netto, &amp; Peneaux, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0024">2017</a>). Thus, acknowledging that urban species may be well habituated to anthropogenic disturbance, and given that BR is collected while handling the birds, we predicted that urban species would display decreased BR when compared with species inhabiting rural and natural habitats. We labeled this alternative hypothesis as the “habituation‐induced stress response hypothesis.”
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we tested whether diet specialization (“diet‐induced stress response hypothesis”) or behavioral habituation to human disturbance (“habituation‐induced stress response hypothesis”) are the main drivers of variability in acute stress responses of passerines.</p>
