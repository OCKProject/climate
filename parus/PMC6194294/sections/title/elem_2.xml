  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We banded a total of 963 individuals from 114 passerine bird species using mist nets in eight locations at Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province (SW China) from March 2016 to February 2017 (Table 
   <a rid="ece34460-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34460-tbl-0001">1</a>; Figure 
   <a rid="ece34460-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34460-fig-0001">1</a>). We chose these locations because they show enough variation in species composition, elevation, and habitat disturbance to effectively test our predictions. We also recaptured 57 individuals, which we measured again (see Section 
   <a rid="ece34460-sec-0010" ref-type="sec" href="#ece34460-sec-0010">2.2</a> for detailed information). These data were used to compute repeatability of BR. We followed a constant banding effort scheme in four locations located in Guangxi (Mango Fields, Medicinal Botanical Garden, Gaofeng Forest, and Longshan NR). These locations are located at low elevation (range: 82–234 m; Table

   <a rid="ece34460-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece34460-sup-0001">S1</a>). We visited each of these locations at least one time every 2 months. Mist nets were set for two consecutive days at dawn and monitored for 6 hr each day. Nets were checked every hour. Fieldwork was interrupted in July and August due to unusually high temperatures (up to 50°C), which implied a risk for birds' lives and anomalous conditions that could bias our results. The other four locations were located at high elevation (range: 734–2,377 m) in Damingshan (Guangxi) and three locations at Gaoligong Mountains (Yunnan) (Saige Valley, Luzhang, and Yaojiaping NR) (Table

   <a rid="ece34460-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece34460-sup-0001">S1</a>). In these remote locations, we followed a more intensive banding procedure due to time constraints (see Section 
   <a rid="ece34460-sec-0003" ref-type="sec" href="#ece34460-sec-0003">3</a> for a comparison of BR values between these two protocols). Mist netting was performed from dawn to dusk during several consecutive days (from 1 week to 1 month) during the dry season (from October to February). Both areas are characterized as “subtropical” in the Koppen climate classification. Here, there are two seasons, which are usually referred to as rainy (May–October) and dry (November–April) (Zheng,

   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0040">2001</a>). We used the level of human occupancy and activity as main criteria to categorize locations in relation to anthropogenic disturbance (Table

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected data on BR and body mass from all individuals. Once the bird was extracted from the net, we kept it in a bag for at least 5 min until we took the bird out. Although not all individuals spent the same time in the nets, all individuals were given a similar period of time to rest inside the cloth bag, so that we obtained a standard and comparable measure from all individuals. We noted the time (number of hours since dawn), season (rainy or dry), and species identity. We then measured BR following Torné‐Noguera et al. (
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0063">2014</a>). We placed the bird on its back with its head held between the index and central fingers and tarsi held with the other hand. In doing so, birds could not see the face of the person holding it. We then counted the number of breast movements over 30 s. While recording BR, we kept our movements and speech to a minimum. Finally, we measured the body mass using a digital balance to the nearest 0.1 g. We only measured healthy birds and observed no harm to them by the capture and measuring process.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were classified according to their diet using EltonTraits 1.0 database (Wilman et al., 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0069">2014</a>). Diet categories were assigned depending on the most common food types ingested by each species and included omnivore, plant seed eating, frugivore–nectarivore or insectivore. We pooled frugivore–nectarivore diets and plant seed‐eating species as herbivores because their sample sizes were low. In relation to migratory status, we classified each species as migrant or resident according to the descriptions provided by the Handbook of the Birds of the World (del Hoyo, Elliott, Sargatal, Christie, &amp; de Juana,

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We evaluated the influence of temporal variation on BR. To do this, we computed a linear mixed‐effects model (LME) using nlme v3.1‐131 (Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, &amp; Sarkar, 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0048">2017</a>), with log‐transformed BR individual values as the dependent variable, season (rainy or dry) as the fixed factor, and time of day (number of hours since dawn) (g) as a covariate. We included species identity and location as random factors. We only used one measurement per individual (the first when there was more than one) and excluded species with less than two individuals. Thus, we reduced our sample to 879 individuals from 69 species. We extracted residuals from this model to carry out further analyses. We also assessed whether the two different protocols influenced our results after controlling for these factors. We used an analysis of variance with standardized BR values (i.e., residuals from the first model) as the dependent variable and field protocol (constant effort vs. intensive banding) as the fixed factor. Additionally, sex and age factors may influence BR (Markó et al., 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0039">2013</a>; see also Holtmann et al., 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0027">2017</a>), but our inability to determine sex and age of all individuals prevented us from controlling for these factors. Regardless, high overlap and similar variability in BR values between identifiable sex and age classes suggest that overall these factors had a small effect on our results (Supporting Information Appendix 
   <a rid="ece34460-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece34460-sup-0003">S3</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We computed individual repeatability of BR, using rptR v0.9.2 (Stoffel, Nakagawa, &amp; Schielzeth, 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0061">2017</a>), as a way to determine its temporal consistency (i.e., whether BR was consistent across time and whether relevant individual differences existed). We computed repeatability using individual identity as the grouping factor and included time of the day as a covariate and season as the fixed factor (given that these individuals were recaptured at different moments of the day and the year). We used two measurements per individual and only included species with at least two individuals. As a result, we considered 50 individuals from 11 species.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species turnover was very high (only 19 of 69 species were present in more than one location), and species composition was, therefore, unique in each location (Supporting Information Appendix 
   <a rid="ece34460-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece34460-sup-0002">S2</a>). Although there was considerable intraspecific variability, trait variation across localities was mostly due to species turnover rather than to intraspecific variation (following Lepš, de Bello, Šmilauer, &amp; Doležal, 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0036">2011</a>). Thus, we used BR measurements from individuals in the location where a species had the largest numbers and excluded the rest of individuals of that species in other locations (Supporting Information Appendix 
   <a rid="ece34460-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece34460-sup-0002">S2</a>). We had to exclude “Damingshan” as a location because it had very small sample size after this procedure (
   <span class="italic">N </span>=
   <span class="italic"> </span>2). In doing so, we were able to carry out phylogenetically controlled analyses, given that species could not be repeated in more than one location.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We quantified the phylogenetic signals (Pagel's λ, Pagel, 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0046">1999</a>) of BR, body mass, and their regression residuals using 
   <span class="italic">phytools</span> v0.6 (Revell, 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0050">2012</a>). We downloaded 10,000 trees of 69 species from avian “tree of life” (Jetz, Thomas, Joy, Hartmann, &amp; Mooers, 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0032">2012</a>) and generated a maximum clade credibility tree using TreeAnnotator v1.8.2 of the BEAST software (Drummond &amp; Rambaut, 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0020">2007</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the relative importance of habitat type and diet on interspecific variation of BR, we used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models in the package MCMCglmm (Hadfield, 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0025">2010</a>). We included body mass, migratory status, and elevation in this model because these factors may influence interspecific variation in stress responses (see, e.g., Londoño et al., 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0037">2015</a>). We ran 750,000 iterations and fixed a thinning interval of 300 and a burn‐in of 75,000 with a Gaussian distribution. We ran the models three times and checked that the Gelman–Rubin statistic was less than 1.02 (Gelman &amp; Rubin, 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0023">1992</a>). Visual inspection of the MCMC trace plots revealed a low degree of autocorrelation and appropriate model convergence (Hadfield, 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0025">2010</a>). We used average standardized BR values as the response variable. We included body mass (g), diet (herbivore, insectivore, or omnivore), habitat (natural, rural, or urban), elevation (m), and migratory status (resident or migrant) as fixed variables. Body mass was log‐transformed to improve model convergence. We dummy‐coded diet and habitat groups as three‐level variables, and each of the levels of these two groups was manually modified as references in separate models. Finally, we ranked candidate models according to their DIC values (deviance information criterion) (Spiegelhalter, Best, Carlin, &amp; Van Der Linde, 
   <a rid="ece34460-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0060">2002</a>). The model with the lowest DIC value was considered the best and is shown in the Section

To do this, we compared BR between rural and urban habitats, but within species. We only included species with more than five individuals in each location, and we combined our two urban locations to increase the sample size. As a result, we included rufous‐capped babbler

   <span class="italic">Orthotomus sutorius</span> (insectivore), red‐whiskered bulbul 
   <span class="italic">Pycnonotus jocosus</span> (omnivore) and scaly‐breasted munia 
   <span class="italic">Lonchura punctulata</span> (herbivore). We used an ANCOVA approach, with standardized BR of individuals as the response variable, habitat as the fixed variable, and log‐transformed body mass as a covariate. We ran a separate model for each species.
