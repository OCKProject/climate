 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tropical and subtropical environments are characterized by a striking biodiversity. This great variety of species is of special interest from many perspectives, and research carried out in this area may produce divergent results compared to studies carried out in temperate regions (Stutchbury &amp; Morton, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0062">2001</a>). In this study, consistent with the pace‐of‐life hypothesis, we found that rural and urban areas can harbor a rich and relatively healthy diversity of wildlife fairly resilient to anthropogenic disturbance (Acevedo‐Whitehouse &amp; Duffus, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0001">2009</a>; Oliveira Hagen, Hagen, Ibáñez‐Álamo, Petchey, &amp; Evans, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0044">2017</a>; Pagani‐Núñez, He, Wu, Peabotuwage, &amp; Goodale, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0045">2017</a>). Yet, we also found that herbivores showed higher BR than omnivores, which suggests that stress responses can be diet‐mediated. Although we were not able to determine the underlying mechanism for this result here, further research should assess whether nutritional (Machovsky‐Capuska, Senior, Simpson, &amp; Raubenheimer, 
  <a rid="ece34460-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34460-bib-0038">2016</a>) or niche constraints (i.e., decreased niche width or increased niche overlap) drive this increased BR of herbivores.
