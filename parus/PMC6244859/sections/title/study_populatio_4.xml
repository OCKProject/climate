 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Foraging blue tits, great tits, and willow tits were video recorded in northern Finland sites along two temperature isotherms: (1) in Oulu, Hietasaari (65°01′N, 25°28′E), Oulu, Sanginjoki (64°95′N, 26°01′E), and Sonkajärvi (63°40′N, 27°31′E), and (2) at Ranua (65°92′N, 26°56′E) further in the north. Data from Oulu and Sonkajärvi were collected in 2010–2012 and data from Ranua in 2011–2012. Feeding sites were similar in terms of safe areas for reaching the feeders and for foraging. Thus, we consider the feeding sites to be equal in terms of predation risk effects on foraging and vigilance behaviour (Hogstad
