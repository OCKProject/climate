 <p>(A) Mean activity score for each population type (GRZ strain included). Whiskers delineate the upper and lower 95% confidence limit. Letters indicate significant differences based on Tukey-corrected post-hoc tests. (B) Average change in activity score over the course of day for males and females (including 95% confidence bands outlined in grey) and (C) for each population type. Slope coefficients and corresponding p-values are given in Table 2 for the long-lived and short-lived population types. Slope value of activity throughout the day for the GRZ strain is −0.131 (
