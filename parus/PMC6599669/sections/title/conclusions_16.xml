 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, our results demonstrate individual, sex and population dependent variation in certain life-history and behavioral traits in 
  <span class="italic">N. furzeri</span>, supporting multi-level approaches to elucidate the ecology and evolution that underpin phenotypic diversity. The absence of an association between activity level and life-history aspects of pace-of-life on the individual level is inconsistent with the POLS framework. On the population level, however, the POLS framework does not seem to apply given that no differences in life-history strategies between populations could be confirmed. Despite a large number of studies within the POLS framework, many failed to identify a stable correlation between activity and life-history, which causes scientists to question its generality. Consequently, an evaluation and refinement of the framework is essential (

  <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Dammhahn et al., 2018</a>). Unlike average activity level, diurnal activity change was associated with pond permanence and sex. Furthermore, our findings support that consistent inter-individual differences in diurnal activity pattern might reflect a long overlooked dimension of animal personality. Although correlation between diurnal activity pattern and life-history was not confirmed in this study, we argue that trait covariation could be species specific and future efforts should examine if diurnal activity change could be integrated in the POLS framework in other systems to more closely approximate real-life situations and better understand behavioral diversity and its fitness consequences.
