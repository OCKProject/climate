 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All statistical analyses were conducted in R 3.3.1 (
  <a rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-47">R Development Core Team, 2008</a>) at a significance level of alpha = 0.05. For all analyses, model assumptions including distributional fit and homogeneity of variances were verified graphically.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maturation time, juvenile growth, adult body size and peak fecundity (i.e., maximum clutch size per female over the observation period) were analyzed by means of univariate mixed-effect models with Gaussian error distribution using the lme4 package (
  <a rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-6">Bates et al., 2017</a>). Maturation time was analyzed for males and females separately as maturation time was scored differently between sexes. To improve distributional fit, male maturation time was log-transformed; however, we note that the assumption of residual normality could not be entirely met for male maturation, so results should be interpreted with care. Population type (long-lived, short-lived, inbred) and—identity were added to the model as fixed and random effect respectively. For juvenile growth and adult body size, sex and the interaction of sex with population type were added as additional fixed effects. In addition, analyses of maturation time, juvenile growth and peak fecundity were also run with adult body size as covariate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fecundity was analyzed using mixed-effects modelling with Poisson distribution (lme4 package). Population type, age and age
  <span class="sup">2</span> (
  <span class="italic">z</span>-transformed) were added as fixed effects to the model since fecundity often increases with age in younger animals and decreases again when animals senesce. Fish and population identity were added to the model as random effects. In addition, an observation-level random effect was modelled to accommodate overdispersion.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Significance of the fixed effect was tested using parametric bootstrapping with 1,000 simulations using the afex package (
  <a rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-56">Singmann et al., 2017</a>), and post-hoc differences between population types were assessed by means of Tukey-corrected pairwise comparisons using the lsmeans package (
  <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">Lenth &amp; Love, 2017</a>). Population-level variation (significance of the random term) was determined by means of log-likelihood ratio tests using the rptR package (
  <a rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-60">Stoffel, Nakagawa &amp; Schielzeth, 2018</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A multilevel random regression approach (lme4 package) with Gaussian error distribution was adopted to analyze activity data and estimate individual behavioral repeatability, following the method outlined by 
  <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">Araya-Ajoy, Mathot &amp; Dingemanse (2015)</a>. Activity level was 
  <span class="italic">Z</span>-transformed and we included a random intercept for population identity, fish identity and the interaction between fish identity and observation day (further on referred to as series), as well as a random slope with respect to moment of day (referring to morning, afternoon and evening, coded as −1, 0 and 1 respectively) at both the fish identity and series hierarchical levels. Covariance between the random intercepts and the slopes of the behavioral reaction norms was allowed. Moment of day (
  <span class="italic">Z</span>-transformed), population type and sex—including their full interaction—were added as fixed effects and also the interaction between moment of day and observation day was added. Slope coefficients of activity during the day for each population and both sexes were calculated using the phia package (
  <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">De Rosario-Martinez &amp; Fox, 2015</a>). Significance of the fixed effects was tested using parametric bootstrapping with 1,000 simulations (afex package), and post-hoc differences were assessed using Tukey-corrected pairwise comparisons (lsmeans package). Repeatability of reaction norm intercepts (i.e., individual average activity level) was calculated as the among-individual variance in intercepts divided by the summation of the among-individual variance in intercepts and the within-individual variance in intercepts among series. Repeatability of reaction norm slopes (i.e., individual diurnal activity change) was calculated as the among-individual variance in slopes divided by the summation of the among-individual variance in slopes and the within-individual variance in slopes among series. See 
  <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">Araya-Ajoy, Mathot &amp; Dingemanse (2015)</a> for a more elaborate discussion on how to calculate repeatability of reaction norm intercepts and slopes. Parametric bootstrapping with 1,000 iterations was used to obtain the 95% confidence interval for the repeatability estimates to determine if repeatability differs significantly from zero (i.e., when 95% CI does not span zero).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Life-history and activity level correlation at the population level was analyzed for both sexes separately by randomly sampling 70% of the original data per population for a total of 1,000 times, each time calculating the pearson-correlation coefficient between maturation time, juvenile growth rate and adult body size (and total fecundity for females) on the one hand and total activity score (summated across the 12 sample bursts) on the other hand. The result was considered significant if the middle 95% of the distribution excluded zero. At the individual level, correlation patterns between life-history and activity level (approximated by total activity score, summated across the 12 sample bursts; i.e., at the unpartitioned phenotypic level) were assessed by means of pearson-correlation tests for both sexes separately. Correlation between life-history and diurnal activity change (at the individual level trait value, i.e., as individual random slopes with respect to moment of day, extracted as best linear unbiased predictors, BLUPs, from the above mixed model) at the population and individual level was analyzed using a similar approach (pearson-correlation tests). It should be noted that using BLUPs is an anti-conservative approach as this method does not carry forward the inherent error around the predictions of individual-level estimates to the subsequent correlation tests (see 
  <a rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-27">Houslay &amp; Wilson, 2017</a>).This method, however, allows for a uniform testing of life-history and activity correlations of all traits on both the individual and population level.
