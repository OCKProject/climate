 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results demonstrate sex-specific variation in adult body size and diurnal activity change among populations that originate from ponds that differ in permanence. Overall, our results did not demonstrate a relationship between life-history and behavior at any level of biological organization as postulated by the POLS. In addition, there was no pond permanence-dependent divergence in maturation time, juvenile growth rate, fecundity and average activity level. Variation at the population-level is assumed to be genetically underpinned, as populations differ even after at least three generations of breeding under common garden laboratory conditions. Furthermore, the fact that individuals differed consistently in locomotor activity and diurnal activity change is reflective of personality variation and consistent inter-individual variation in behavioral patterns respectively.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With respect to life-history, 
  <span class="italic">N. furzeri</span> fish with short life expectancy (short-lived ponds) differed in adult body size from fish with long life expectancy (long-lived ponds) and there was a trend towards faster female maturation for shorter-lived fish. Faster maturation of populations from short-lived ponds (arid region) allows individuals to produce the next generation of drought resistant eggs before early drying of ponds and earlier than populations from longer-lived ponds (wet region). Especially in short-lived ponds, demographic modelling illustrates that early maturation can be an important determinant of long term population growth rates for organisms with a life cycle similar to that of 
  <span class="italic">N. furzeri</span> (
  <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">Pinceel et al., 2016</a>). In addition, life-history theory predicts a higher maturation rate to be offset by a reduced adult body size (
  <a rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-26">Hollis, Keller &amp; Kawecki, 2016</a>). Although there was a trend for faster maturation of females from short-lived ponds and females from short-lived ponds were smaller as adults than females from long-lived ponds, an opposite association was found for male maturation time and males from different population types did not differ in adult body size. These sex-associated differences illustrate the importance of including both sexes when studying life-history responses. Whereas the negative association between female maturation rate and adult body size is broadly supported in literature, this is far less so for males (
  <a rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-26">Hollis, Keller &amp; Kawecki, 2016</a>). Likely, there are additional fitness advantages associated with early male maturation, such as accommodating aggressive male competition for mates (
  <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Reichard, Polačik &amp; Sedláček, 2009</a>) that drive selection for early maturation. Should competition for mating opportunities be stronger in long-lived ponds due to, for instance, the occasional occurrence of multiple age cohorts within the same pond (
  <a rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-49">Reichard et al., 2017</a>) then early maturation could entail a reproductive advantage (
  <a rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-26">Hollis, Keller &amp; Kawecki, 2016</a>). Alternatively and non-mutually exclusive, maturation time might be correlated with traits that were not assessed in the current study, such as sex-specific immunological traits, that may underlie sex-related differences in maturation time.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consistent with an earlier study by 
  <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Blažek et al. (2016)</a>, our results only partly support associations between pond permanence and life-history trait variation. While fish from short- and long-lived populations differed in adult body size, no such differences in juvenile growth rate and fecundity emerged. Possibly, fish from these habitats are already at their physiological limit and developmental constraints prevent individuals from short-lived pools to invest even more energy in rapid somatic growth and higher reproductive output (
  <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Blažek et al., 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-21">Grégoir et al., 2018</a>). If a trade-off between investing in current versus future reproduction exists, then the POLS predicts variation in life-history to co-evolve with behavioral traits that mediate life-history traits involved in this trade-off (
  <a rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-48">Réale et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Dammhahn et al., 2018</a>). However, in addition to lack of differences in growth rate and fecundity, our results did not demonstrate divergence in average activity level that can be associated with pond permanence. Also, the average activity level did not differ between sexes, which contradicts the prediction that males and females are positioned at the fast and slow end of the pace-of-life continuum, respectively (
  <a rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-16">Debecker et al., 2016</a>). Furthermore, our results do not confirm a link between activity level and life-history traits. This implies that fish from different population types and sexes can accelerate maturation in the absence of activity changes under 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> feeding conditions. While a positive correlation between activity level and adult female body size was found on the individual level, this result may represent a false positive given that a large number of correlation tests were conducted (Type I error). It should be noted that, because correlation analyses with BLUPs are anti-conservative, we cannot exclude that some relationships are not detected using this approach. Therefore, future research could aim for test designs that are adapted to the use of a multivariate mixed modelling approach as a data hungry but more powerful approach (
  <a rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-27">Houslay &amp; Wilson, 2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike average activity level, our results show pond permanence-dependent divergence in diurnal activity change. Fish originating from short-lived ponds with a short life expectancy exhibit a decline in activity towards the evening. Such a diurnal activity pattern was absent in fish from long-lived ponds and, hence, the presence of this diurnal pattern coincides with pond permanence and life expectancy. Populations with a fast pace-of-life are expected to exhibit a higher metabolic rate than slow-paced populations (
  <a rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-48">Réale et al., 2010</a>). Since individuals with a high metabolic rate are confronted with higher levels of oxidative damage due to an increased production of reactive oxygen species, the decrease in activity throughout the day may reflect a homeostatic need (
  <a rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-34">Larcombe et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-61">Stuber et al., 2015</a>). Inactivity or sleep was, for instance, demonstrated to have a restorative function in mice (
  <a rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-71">Xie et al., 2013</a>). Clear life-history divergence among populations from ponds that differ in permanence could, however, not be confirmed in this study. Therefore, we cannot conclude that a fast pace-of-life underlies diurnal activity patterns in 
  <span class="italic">Nothobranchius</span> killifish. Future research should complement the behavioral analyses with physiological data to further explore this hypothesis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to divergence in diurnal activity change with respect to pond permanence, our results also demonstrate sex-specific differences in diurnal activity pattern with males becoming less active towards the evening while females maintain the same activity level throughout the day. Daily arrhythmicity, or around-the-clock activity, has been described in a range of species. Next to differences in metabolic rate as a potential explanation for this variation, several hypotheses have been framed to explain daily arrhythmicity (
  <a rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-11">Bloch et al., 2013</a>). Among these, reproductive behavior has been described as a potential determinant of daily arrhythmicity. For instance, reproductive queens of different hymenopteran species are active around the clock to maximize their fecundity (
  <a rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-29">Johnson et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-11">Bloch et al., 2013</a>). Sex-dependent differences in sleep and sleep-like behavior have also been illustrated in bird species including great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) (
  <a rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-61">Stuber et al., 2015</a>) and blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) (
  <a rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-59">Steinmeyer et al., 2010</a>) and could be the result of sexual selection. Although activity was not monitored at night and only at select points during the day in the current study, the apparent absence of a decline in activity over the course of the day in females might be an adaptive strategy to maximize reproductive output by being available for reproduction throughout the whole day. However, if this is the case, a similar pattern would be expected for males. For instance, males of the polygynous pectoral sandpiper (
  <span class="italic">Calidris melanotos</span>) have been shown to increase their activity to increase the amount of sired offspring (
  <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Lesku et al., 2012</a>). Such a strategy could, however, not be confirmed in the current study. Since 
  <span class="italic">N. furzeri</span> males are highly conspicuous to visual predators due to their bright colors, the observed decline in activity may be an adaptation to minimize the risk of avian predation. Wild populations of 
  <span class="italic">N. furzeri</span> are reported to be strongly female biased, which could be caused by preferential bird predation on males (
  <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Reichard, Polačik &amp; Sedláček, 2009</a>). Adaptive inactivity might, therefore, represent an energy-conserving strategy when the costs of being active exceed the benefits (
  <a rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-55">Siegel, 2009</a>). Whereas 
  <span class="italic">Nothobranchius</span> killifish exhibit stable locomotor rhythms and are diurnal (i.e., they exhibit nocturnal periods of inactivity) (
  <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">Lucas-Sánchez et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-39">Lucas-Sánchez et al., 2014</a>), future research should aim to assess day-round (24 h) patterns of activity to get a more complete image of daily activity changes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Behavioral patterns like diurnal activity change have recently been suggested as overlooked dimensions of within-species behavioral diversity and circadian behavioral variation has been argued to be a novel axis of animal personality (
  <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">Dingemanse et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-46">Randler, 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">Alós, Martorell-Barceló &amp; Campos-Candela, 2017</a>). Describing natural variation in diurnal activity patterns is an important step in attempting to elucidate its ecological function and evolutionary architecture (
  <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Lima et al., 2005</a>). Our results demonstrate repeatable inter-individual differences in activity and diurnal activity change for the killifish 
  <span class="italic">N. furzeri</span>. In human psychology, variation in diurnal activity patterns has often been associated with variation in personality and life style (
  <a rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-1">Adan et al., 2012</a>). While variation in diurnal activity change is of interest in various sectors (clinic, academic, labour) (
  <a rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-1">Adan et al., 2012</a>), it remains understudied in ecology and evolutionary biology (
  <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">Helm &amp; Visser, 2010</a>). How variation in diurnal activity change relates to variation in traditional personality traits such as boldness and exploration behavior in animals and its integration in the POLS framework opens an interesting avenue for research and should be subject to further investigation (
  <a rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-46">Randler, 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-61">Stuber et al., 2015</a>). For instance, 
  <a rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-68">Tudorache et al. (2018)</a> demonstrated that circadian rhythmicity at the molecular, endocrine and behavioral level was strongly associated with risk-taking behavior as a proxy for coping style in zebrafish (
  <span class="italic">Danio rerio</span>). Proactive fish were shown to display a robust rhythm with a large amplitude, whereas circadian rhythmicity was largely lacking in reactive fish. As argued by the authors of the study, this finding suggests that circadian rhythmicity could be an integral part of individual life-history strategies. Only four studies, three on birds (
  <a rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-59">Steinmeyer et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-62">Stuber et al., 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-61">Stuber et al., 2015</a>) and one on fish (
  <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">Alós, Martorell-Barceló &amp; Campos-Candela, 2017</a>), assessed repeatability as a measure for the consistency of between-individual differences in diurnal activity change. Our study delivers an effective ‘proof of principle’ for the existence of repeatable inter-individual variation in average activity levels and diurnal activity change in 
  <span class="italic">N. furzeri</span>, which could be reflective of personality variation. Although we could not show correlation between diurnal activity pattern and life-history, diurnal activity change differed between sexes and between fish with different life expectancy along a pond permanence gradient. Nevertheless, given these results and given that diurnal activity change could potentially be a system- or species-specific integrated component of POLS, we argue that it would be interesting for future studies to include activity patterns as these could further add to the realism of pace-of-life studies. If that is the case, only a complete documentation of where such correlations occur or do not occur will give sufficient insight into the underlying mechanism that determines the occurrence of such correlations. In addition, we note that, given that only four natural populations could be used in this study, it would be interesting for future studies to include more populations along the pond permanence gradient in the field to increase data resolution and to add more realism to the experimental setup, while relating life-history and behavioral expression to direct measurements of pond permanence.
