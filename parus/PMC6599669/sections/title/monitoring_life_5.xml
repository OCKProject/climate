 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body size was determined at two, 16 and 94 days post-hatching. To this end, individual fish larvae were transferred to a petri dish and photographed from above. Size-calibrated photographs were analyzed using open source image processing software ImageJ 1.50i (
  <a rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-53">Schneider, Rasband &amp; Eliceiri, 2012</a>). Juvenile growth rate was determined as the difference in body size between the age of two and 16 days while adult body size was approximated as the size at an age of 94 days, at which all fish were sexually mature. Juveniles were checked on a daily basis for any signs of male nuptial coloration. The first day at which these signs appeared was used to score the age of sexual maturity in males. Female maturation time was defined and assessed as the first time an egg was deposited.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Starting at an age of 8 weeks—and for a total of 15 spawning events—breeding pairs were assembled for each population. Males and females were paired (novel partner each spawning event) and placed in 1L plastic jars with sterilized sand as a spawning substrate to allow for egg deposition. Excess males or females were paired with a non-experimental fish of the same age and population. After 1 h of spawning, sand was sieved and the amount of eggs was assessed as a measure for female fecundity. Fish were allowed to spawn two to three times per week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). During the two-week period when activity data was collected (see below), fish were paired only on Monday and Friday.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At an age of 90 days, the activity level of each individual was monitored by a single observer (E Thoré) during three daily sample bursts every Wednesday and Thursday in two consecutive weeks (amounting to a total of 12 sample bursts) (fish: 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 121, total observations: 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,426). Daily sample bursts (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1D</a>) were organized as follows: morning (start at 8h45), afternoon (start at 12 h 45) and evening (start at 16 h 45), each lasting on average 2 h 30 min, during which individuals were repeatedly scanned for 20 consecutive ‘active or passive’ observations. Fish were scored active and assigned a score of ‘1’ when swimming and passive (score of ‘0’) if they remained motionless during the first three seconds after being spotted—method after 
  <a rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-9">Biro &amp; Adriaenssens (2013)</a>. Per sample burst, a total activity score was calculated for each individual by taking the sum of the collected scores (maximum score 20, minimum score 0). During the four observation days, tanks were visually separated from each other by means of plastic opaque dividers to prevent social interaction during the activity assays.
