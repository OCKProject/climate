 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a total of five 
  <span class="italic">N. furzeri</span> populations, of which four natural-derived 
  <span class="italic">N. furzeri</span> populations (see 
  <a rid="table-1" ref-type="table" href="#table-1">Table 1</a>) that originate from habitats along an aridity gradient (see 
  <a rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-65">Terzibasi et al., 2008</a>) (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplemental-information" href="#supplemental-information">Supplemental Information</a> for results on the homozygous laboratory strain GRZ, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 24). Two populations (NF222 and NF414, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 28 and 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 24 respectively) originate from a relatively arid region from central Mozambique where inundations are typically short (i.e., short life expectancy). This is supported by datalogger measurements which were used to estimate pool inundations from 2011 to 2012 (
  <a rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-64">Terzibasi et al., 2013</a>). The two other populations (NF2 and NF121, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 27 and 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 18 respectively) originate from a more humid region in southern Mozambique, where inundations last longer (i.e., longer life expectancy) (
  <a rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-65">Terzibasi et al., 2008</a>). From here onwards, these habitats will be referred to as short-lived and long-lived ponds, respectively. All populations were reared for at least three generations under optimal common garden conditions in the lab prior to the start of the experiment.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fish were hatched in 2L tanks by submerging eggs and peat in dechlorinated tap water (7.8 pH, 600µS/cm conductivity) at a temperature of 14 °C—method based on 
  <a rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-45">Polačik, Blažek &amp; Reichard (2016)</a>. Two days post-hatching, fish larvae were transferred to individual 250 mL glass jars to allow individual monitoring. Starting at an age of four days up until one month, individual fish were housed in 1L plastic, transparent jars after which they were individually transferred to 2L plastic, transparent tanks until the end of the experiment. Each tank was provided with a small piece of filter wool (Belcopet NV, Brugge, Belgium) to sustain necessary microbiota for a good water quality. During the experiment, fish were kept in a climate-controlled room at a constant air temperature of 24 °C (water temperature 21.6 °C ± sd 0.75) and a 14 h: 10 h day:night regime. Twice per week, tanks were cleaned and the water was refreshed to ensure a constant and good water quality. Tanks were repositioned in a random fashion after every cleaning session to prevent site-specific habituation whilst allowing for visual contact between individuals of both sexes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fish larvae were fed twice a day (8am and 5pm) an 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> quantity of 
  <span class="italic">Artemia fransiscana</span> nauplii (Ocean Nutrition, Essen, Belgium). After three weeks their diet was supplemented with small live 
  <span class="italic">Chironomus</span> larvae (Aquaservice, Antwerp, Belgium). At an age of one month, only live 
  <span class="italic">Chironomus</span> larvae were provided every morning (8am) and evening (8pm) in an 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> quantity to ensure a continuous supply of live food.
