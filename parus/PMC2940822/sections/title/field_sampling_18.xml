 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To capture lizards we used arrays of pitfall traps and drift fencing. All samples for this study were collected between October 2000 and September 2005. Each array had seven 19-liter buckets buried in the ground with the lip of the bucket flush with the ground to act as a pitfall trap

  <a rid="pone.0012767-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Campbell1">[60]</a>. Buckets were arranged in a “Y” configuration and buried approximately 7.5 m apart. Between the buckets, short drift fencing (0.5 m tall) consisting of erosion cloth acted to intercept reptiles moving through the habitat and directed them towards the buckets. Shade and moisture were provided for each bucket to maximize the chance of survival for reptiles, amphibians, or small mammals that were trapped. Pitfall traps were checked daily for a week at one-month intervals

  <a rid="pone.0012767-Langkilde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Langkilde1">[62]</a> and a small sample from the tip of the tail was taken. Toes and tail tips were stored in 70% ethanol at 4°C or −80°C depending on storage space.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To capture birds, we used mist-nets. Trapping occurred from August 2004 to May 2006. Generally, we would open mist-nets (9–12 m long, 30 cm mesh) at sunrise and close them as the temperature increased to a potentially unsafe level in mid-morning. We targeted wrentits by playing male territorial songs with portable speakers placed at the base of the net. Once a bird was caught in the net, it was immediately removed and a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service band was placed on its leg. We also took measurements of culmen length (mm), culmen width (mm), unflattened wing chord length (cm), tail length (cm), tarsus length (cm) and mass (g). Culmen length was taken from the anterior end of the nares to the tip of the beak using calipers. For genetic samples, we punctured the brachial vein on the wing of each bird with a small gauge needle and collected the blood that pooled there with a small capillary tube. Bleeding usually stopped after 10 seconds which yielded approximately 100 µl of blood. Blood was then placed in avian blood buffer

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All samples used in this study came from animals that were captured, handled, and released according to relevant national and international scientific guidelines. We used common field and handling methods that minimize stress and long-term effects of capture. We also researched methods alternative to toe-clipping of reptiles and determined that there were no less harmful yet permanent ways of marking individuals 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Langkilde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Langkilde1">[62]</a>. We obtained approval for our animal capture protocol from the UCLA Office of the Protection of Animals (OPRS).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We extracted genomic DNA with the Qiagen DNA mini kit (Qiagen Inc.). DNA samples were stored in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0) at −20°C. We used six to eight microsatellite markers for each species (

  <a rid="pone.0012767-Zamudio1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Zamudio1">[67]</a>). We used flourescently-labeled forward microsatellite primers when available. Alternatively, we used a three-primer genotyping protocol, where the forward microsatellite primer had an M13 sequence attached to the 5′ end (
  <div content-type="gene" class="named-content">5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3′</div>) and a third primer with the complementary M13 sequence was dye-labeled

  <a rid="pone.0012767-Schuelke1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Schuelke1">[69]</a>. The forward, reverse and M13-dye primers were then used in a three-primer PCR protocol using Multiplex Mix (Qiagen Inc.) and 0.01% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) to generate microsatellite alleles which are flourescently labeled. Genotypes were run on an ABI 3700 sequencer and alleles were visualized using GENEMAPPER (Applied Biosystems, Inc.).
