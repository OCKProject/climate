  <sub>ST</sub> values indicated many significant genetic differences between patches for all four species (84% of comparisons were significant for side-blotched lizards, 89% for fence lizards, 87% for skinks, and 71% for wrentits; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0012767.s001" href="#pone.0012767.s001">Table S1</a>). Average pairwise F
  <sub>ST</sub> between patches was highest in the wrentit at 0.095 (range 0.012–0.299). Among lizards, the level of differentiation was highest for side-blotched lizards, with an average pairwise F
  <sub>ST</sub> of 0.073 (range −0.006–0.200), and very similar for western skinks (mean F
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.040, range 0.003–0.104) and western fence lizards (mean F
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.040, range 0.003–0.095). As a baseline comparison from continuous habitat, when we computed genetic distances between the sampling arrays within large and core patches and between several other sites outside of our urban study area (but within the park, see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s4" href="#s4">Methods</a>), we found lower average F
  <sub>ST</sub> for all three lizard species (side-blotched lizards, 0.02; western fence lizard, 0.016; western skinks, 0.013), and fewer significant pairwise F
  <sub>ST</sub> (side-blotched lizards, 12.5%; western fence lizards, 16.7%; western skinks, 30%; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0012767.s002" href="#pone.0012767.s002">Table S2</a>). For wrentits, genetic samples were also collected from two coastal canyons outside of our study area, and the F
  <sub>ST</sub> between these two sites was non-significant (F
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.026). Significant genetic distances between patches could also be caused by isolation by geographic distance. We found no significant correlations between genetic distance (F
  <sub>ST</sub>) and geographic distance in any of the four species, suggesting no pattern of isolation by distance (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0012767-t002" href="#pone-0012767-t002">Table 2</a>). However, partial Mantel tests showed that genetic distances for all four species were significantly correlated with highway presence, roads presence, and time since isolation (patch age) when geographic distance was held constant (
