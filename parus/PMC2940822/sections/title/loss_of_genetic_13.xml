 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using three different methods, traditional pair-wise genetic distance analysis (F
  <sub>ST</sub>; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0012767.s001" href="#pone.0012767.s001">Table S1</a>), landscape genetic analysis (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1b</a>), and Bayesian genetic clustering (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g002" href="#pone-0012767-g002">Fig. 2</a>), we found significant genetic differences between sample locations in all four species. Moreover, the three methods showed strikingly similar and strong genetic effects of fragmentation. All four species exhibited the largest genetic divergence over the oldest (based on building dates, see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s4" href="#s4">Methods</a>) and widest expanse of urban areas surrounding and including Highway 23 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1b</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pairwise F
  <sub>ST</sub> between habitat patches showed that the genetic divergence was significant, especially given the short amount of time that the habitat fragments have been isolated from each other and from core areas. For all four species, average F
  <sub>ST</sub> values within continuous habitat were 2.5 to 3.6 times lower than in fragmented habitat, and the majority of comparisons were non-significant (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0012767.s002" href="#pone.0012767.s002">Table S2</a>). This suggests that microsatellite allele frequencies within and between habitat patches are changing on a very short time scale. Several other reptile and amphibian studies have found similar genetic divergences on similar time scales. For example, genetic divergence between fragmented populations of two gecko species in Australia was higher than divergence between samples in un-fragmented landscapes 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Hoehn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Hoehn1">[35]</a>. In that study, forested habitat patches were fragmented beginning around 1900 by wheat fields, which can be dry and barren during the non-growing season. In our study, however, the intervening landscape is concrete, asphalt, buildings, or urban yard landscaping, and although fragmentation began in the 1940s, many patches were only 50–75% isolated until 1980, making the isolation more recent. The long-lived tuatara (
  <span class="italic">Sphenodon punctatus</span>) was shown to have small yet significant genetic structuring (overall R
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.012) over less than 500 meters on a recently fragmented island 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Moore1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Moore1">[18]</a>. Overall divergence was driven by one remnant forest fragment which was most isolated by island topography. Therefore, it was unclear that human activity, in this case pasture cleared for livestock grazing, was the cause of the genetic divergence. The eastern red-backed salamander (
  <span class="italic">Plethodon cinereus</span>), an even smaller and less mobile animal then the lizards we investigated, had pairwise F
  <sub>ST</sub> between patches similar in value to the lizards in our study 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Noel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Noel1">[14]</a>. In that study, habitat fragmentation was also caused by 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> Century urbanization.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For birds, few studies have shown large pairwise F
  <sub>ST</sub> between patches on such a small scale. For example, a study of the capercaillie (
  <span class="italic">Tetrao urogallus</span>) in the Black Forest in Germany showed significant pairwise F
  <sub>ST</sub> between sites, ranging from 0.007 to 0.036 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Segelbacher1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Segelbacher1">[36]</a>. In their study area, which was approximately 10 times the size of ours, suitable forest habitat was fragmented by other forest types and grassland, as opposed to by residential and commercial development. A study 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Barnett1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Barnett1">[37]</a> of white-ruffed manikins (
  <span class="italic">Corapipo altera</span>) showed similar results to the capercaillie. There was some genetic structuring shown between remnant forest fragments, however all significant pairwise F
  <sub>ST</sub> could be attributed to one forest fragment. In addition, pairwise F
  <sub>ST</sub> between forest fragments ranged from 0.001 to 0.029 for manikins, whereas in our study the pairwise F
  <sub>ST</sub> were approximately 10 times higher. Finally, a study of great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) in forest parks within the city of Barcelona found many significant pairwise F
  <sub>ST</sub> between parks (average 0.067), but the parks actually had higher genetic diversity than the surrounding forest, and there was significant gene flow both between parks and from the parks to the forest 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Bjorklund1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Bjorklund1">[38]</a>. Overall, there are few comparable studies of avian fine-scale genetic structure, particularly in urban landscapes, but wrentits in southern California appear to have the highest amount of genetic structure documented to date.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Bayesian clustering analysis confirmed the loss of genetic connectivity for each species in our study area. Similar analyses in other bird studies have consistently shown that one genetic cluster is most likely 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Segelbacher1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Segelbacher1">[36]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Barnett1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Barnett1">[37]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Mylecraine1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Mylecraine1">[39]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Veit1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Veit1">[40]</a>, with only the great tit study finding two clusters 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Bjorklund1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Bjorklund1">[38]</a>. For the lizards, in many of the small patches most or all individuals were given close to 100% assignment to that patch (e.g. S3 for side-blotched lizards, S5 and S7 for fence lizards, and S6 for skinks; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g002" href="#pone-0012767-g002">Figure 2</a>), which suggests a remarkable amount of genetic isolation within patches over relatively short geographic and temporal scales (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0012767.s006" href="#pone.0012767.s006">Table S6</a>). The short dispersal distances for all four species suggest that gene flow even within the natural landscape may be limited (for lizards, we did find a few significant F
  <sub>ST</sub> values between sampling sites within continuous habitat), and therefore may be extremely restricted in a fragmented landscape. In one of the few other studies using Bayesian genetic clustering analysis, red-backed salamanders (
  <span class="italic">Plethodon cinereus</span>) were found to have two genetic clusters on either side of a large highway running through the urbanized study area 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Marsh1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Marsh1">[41]</a>. Our genetic clustering results suggest that the intense fragmentation from urbanization may be a particularly strong barrier to animal movement and gene flow for all four species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Along with significant divergence between patches, we also found significant correlations between specific causes (roads) and measures (patch age) of fragmentation and genetic divergence in all four species (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0012767-t002" href="#pone-0012767-t002">Table 2</a>). Further, our landscape genetic results revealed that the areas surrounding and including Highway 23 in the city of Thousand Oaks, which are the oldest and most densely urbanized, consistently had the highest peaks of differentiation, again for all four species (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1b</a>). The concordance of these results for all four species is remarkable given their differences in mobility, ecology, and taxonomy. A second area of high genetic divergence in the eastern portion of our study area, also characterized by a major road surrounded by a wide swath of residential development, was shared by two species, wrentits and skinks. Other species have also shown fine-scale genetic changes related to roads and fragmentation in this region. Coyotes and bobcats exhibited significant genetic differentiation across Highway 101, the largest highway in the study area 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Riley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Riley1">[42]</a>. It is unknown if the species in our study would cross such a large barrier, but with short dispersal distances and small home range sizes, those events would likely be rare. Similarly, in smaller and less mobile species, a loss of genetic connectivity and diversity was found in two Jerusalem crickets (
  <span class="italic">Stenopelmatus ‘santa monica’</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Stenopelmatus ‘mahogani’</span>) across the same region 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Vandergast1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Vandergast1">[16]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Vandergast2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Vandergast2">[43]</a>. Genetic divergence in Jerusalem crickets was significantly associated with urban development and the presence of highways within the Simi Hills.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The significant genetic divergence and loss of genetic diversity over short geographic and temporal scales in these four vertebrates suggest that the urban matrix is relatively impenetrable for these animals. Anecdotal observations suggest that 
  <span class="italic">S. occidentalis</span>, but not 
  <span class="italic">P. skiltonianus</span> or 
  <span class="italic">U. stansburiana</span>, will move through or persist in the residential areas of the urban matrix (RNF personal observation). However, reliable data on the urban movement and habitat use of these species does not exist. In fact, knowledge about use of the urban matrix by native animal species is extremely limited in general, but would be very valuable for understanding the conservation and management implications of urbanization. Urbanized areas may be dangerous places for these small vertebrates. Residential neighborhoods often introduce predators such as domestic cats, which may regularly prey on native vertebrates 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Chace1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Chace1">[44]</a>. Of course residential areas also include roads, which lizards and birds may actively avoid, or which may be a significant source of mortality
