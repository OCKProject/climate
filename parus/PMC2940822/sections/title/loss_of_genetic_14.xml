 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the landscape is fragmented and gene flow is restricted, as we have shown for these four species, genetic diversity may be reduced in populations within smaller or more isolated habitat patches. Although we found no relationships between patch age and genetic diversity, we found significant relationships between genetic diversity measures and patch size or isolation for all four species. All three lizards had increased relatedness in smaller patches and with increasing patch isolation (

  <a rid="pone.0012767-Sumner2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Sumner2">[50]</a>. In wrentits, although we did not find increased within-patch relatedness, we found lowered heterozygosity (H
  <sub>e</sub>) and fewer alleles (N
  <sub>A</sub>) in smaller patches (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g003" href="#pone-0012767-g003">Fig. 3a</a>). Decreased gene flow can result in decreased H
  <sub>e</sub> and N
  <sub>A</sub> in small patches as alleles are lost over the generations. This effect tends to be gradual and may not threaten populations in the short term, however, inbreeding within habitat patches tends to happen quickly and can lead to inbreeding depression 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Keller3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Keller3">[51]</a>. Lizard relatedness values suggest that inbreeding is occurring within smaller and more isolated patches. The difference between taxa may be attributed to the increased effective isolation of lizards on suitable habitat patches as a result of more restricted dispersal ability compared to wrentits. Our results suggest that populations within smaller and more isolated patches may have an increased risk of harmful genetic effects and, over the long-term, even extirpation. In fact, the absence of individuals from certain study patches (e.g. skinks and fence lizards absent from S4; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0012767-t001" href="#pone-0012767-t001">Table 1</a>) suggests that populations that were presumably present at the time of patch isolation may have been extirpated.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a relatively short time, we have documented significant genetic divergence between isolated patches and decreased genetic diversity in all four species. However, although time since isolation (patch age) was strongly correlated with genetic divergence between patches, the effects on genetic diversity in these animals were significantly related to patch size and degree of patch isolation, but not to patch age. This would suggest that the habitat is still relatively suitable in habitat fragments, resulting in relatively stable populations that are not going through bottlenecks, such that more time since isolation is not as important a factor. But patches that are smaller from the outset simply cannot support as large a population, and therefore are more subject to the deleterious effects of genetic drift, specifically the loss of genetic diversity. Patches that are more isolated may in turn be less likely to receive new dispersers, i.e. they would benefit less from the “rescue effect” that could offset reductions in genetic diversity 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Hanski2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Hanski2">[52]</a>. Presumably patches that were both small and isolated would suffer the most ill effects.
