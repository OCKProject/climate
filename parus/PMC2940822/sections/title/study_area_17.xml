 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Southern California is characterized by a Mediterranean climate with cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Vegetation consisted of coastal sage scrub, chaparral, riparian habitat, and oak woodlands. Our study site is within SMMNRA, the USA's largest urban national park (154,095 acres or 623.6 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>; 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nps.gov/samo/parkmgmt/statistics.htm" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.nps.gov/samo/parkmgmt/statistics.htm</span>), which is located in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, California, USA (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1a</a>). Approximately half of the land within the park boundary is privately owned, although some public acquisitions continue. Habitat patches within our study area were within 12.5 kilometers (km) of each other but were separated by roads of all sizes, housing, and commercial development (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1a</a>). Most building started in the middle of the 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> Century, and none of the habitat patches have been completely isolated for longer than 43 years (

  <a rid="pone.0012767-Southern1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Southern1">[58]</a>). Two major freeways (101 and 23) and many busy four-lane roads run through the study area (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1a</a>). The peak average daily traffic in this area is approximately 180,000 cars per day for the 101 Freeway and 90,000 cars per day for Highway 23 (Caltrans, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ca.dot.gov" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ca.dot.gov</span>). Both freeways are mostly surrounded by commercial and residential development. Within the study area there are large core areas of relatively undisturbed habitat, although some low-impact human recreation does occur. Within the urban mosaic, habitat patches were surrounded by high- or low-density housing, highways and other roads, golf courses and other landscaped areas.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected samples from habitat fragments which we characterized as “small” (75–450 ha) or “large” (3200–4400 ha) and from larger areas of continuous habitat which we called “core” areas (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1a</a>). There were 7 small patches (S1-S7), 3 large patches (L1-L3) and 2 core areas (C1 and C2). Patch area (m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) and degree of isolation (PROX) were calculated using FRAGSTATS 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-McGarigal1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-McGarigal1">[59]</a>. PROX is the sum of patch area divided by the nearest edge-to-edge distance squared between all of the patches within a defined search radius and the focal patch. PROX approaches 0 if the patch has no neighbors within the search radius (a 20 km radius encompassed our entire study site) specified in FRAGSTATS, therefore patches with smaller PROX numbers are more isolated. Building dates for roads, housing developments, and commercial areas were used to calculate the ages (in years) at which patches were 100% isolated up to the time of trapping for this study (patch age; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0012767-t001" href="#pone-0012767-t001">Table 1</a>). Patches were considered 100% isolated when they were completely surrounded on all edges by either commercial buildings, housing, or roads or a combination of these. We also made a matrix of patch ages (for pair wise comparisons) by calculating the number of years that each patch was separated from each other patch.
