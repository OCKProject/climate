  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Southern California is characterized by a Mediterranean climate with cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Vegetation consisted of coastal sage scrub, chaparral, riparian habitat, and oak woodlands. Our study site is within SMMNRA, the USA's largest urban national park (154,095 acres or 623.6 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>; 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nps.gov/samo/parkmgmt/statistics.htm" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.nps.gov/samo/parkmgmt/statistics.htm</span>), which is located in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, California, USA (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1a</a>). Approximately half of the land within the park boundary is privately owned, although some public acquisitions continue. Habitat patches within our study area were within 12.5 kilometers (km) of each other but were separated by roads of all sizes, housing, and commercial development (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1a</a>). Most building started in the middle of the 20
   <span class="sup">th</span> Century, and none of the habitat patches have been completely isolated for longer than 43 years (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0012767-t001" href="#pone-0012767-t001">Table 1</a>; 
   <a rid="pone.0012767-Southern1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Southern1">[58]</a>). Two major freeways (101 and 23) and many busy four-lane roads run through the study area (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1a</a>). The peak average daily traffic in this area is approximately 180,000 cars per day for the 101 Freeway and 90,000 cars per day for Highway 23 (Caltrans, 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ca.dot.gov" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ca.dot.gov</span>). Both freeways are mostly surrounded by commercial and residential development. Within the study area there are large core areas of relatively undisturbed habitat, although some low-impact human recreation does occur. Within the urban mosaic, habitat patches were surrounded by high- or low-density housing, highways and other roads, golf courses and other landscaped areas.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected samples from habitat fragments which we characterized as “small” (75–450 ha) or “large” (3200–4400 ha) and from larger areas of continuous habitat which we called “core” areas (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1a</a>). There were 7 small patches (S1-S7), 3 large patches (L1-L3) and 2 core areas (C1 and C2). Patch area (m
   <span class="sup">2</span>) and degree of isolation (PROX) were calculated using FRAGSTATS 
   <a rid="pone.0012767-McGarigal1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-McGarigal1">[59]</a>. PROX is the sum of patch area divided by the nearest edge-to-edge distance squared between all of the patches within a defined search radius and the focal patch. PROX approaches 0 if the patch has no neighbors within the search radius (a 20 km radius encompassed our entire study site) specified in FRAGSTATS, therefore patches with smaller PROX numbers are more isolated. Building dates for roads, housing developments, and commercial areas were used to calculate the ages (in years) at which patches were 100% isolated up to the time of trapping for this study (patch age; 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0012767-t001" href="#pone-0012767-t001">Table 1</a>). Patches were considered 100% isolated when they were completely surrounded on all edges by either commercial buildings, housing, or roads or a combination of these. We also made a matrix of patch ages (for pair wise comparisons) by calculating the number of years that each patch was separated from each other patch.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Field sampling</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To capture lizards we used arrays of pitfall traps and drift fencing. All samples for this study were collected between October 2000 and September 2005. Each array had seven 19-liter buckets buried in the ground with the lip of the bucket flush with the ground to act as a pitfall trap 
   <a rid="pone.0012767-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Fisher1">[55]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0012767-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Campbell1">[60]</a>. Buckets were arranged in a “Y” configuration and buried approximately 7.5 m apart. Between the buckets, short drift fencing (0.5 m tall) consisting of erosion cloth acted to intercept reptiles moving through the habitat and directed them towards the buckets. Shade and moisture were provided for each bucket to maximize the chance of survival for reptiles, amphibians, or small mammals that were trapped. Pitfall traps were checked daily for a week at one-month intervals 
   <a rid="pone.0012767-Busteed1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Busteed1">[22]</a>. Each reptile was identified to species and snout to vent length was measured in mm. Each individual was assigned a unique number, was permanently marked by toe clipping 
   <a rid="pone.0012767-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Donnelly1">[61]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0012767-Langkilde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Langkilde1">[62]</a> and a small sample from the tip of the tail was taken. Toes and tail tips were stored in 70% ethanol at 4°C or −80°C depending on storage space.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To capture birds, we used mist-nets. Trapping occurred from August 2004 to May 2006. Generally, we would open mist-nets (9–12 m long, 30 cm mesh) at sunrise and close them as the temperature increased to a potentially unsafe level in mid-morning. We targeted wrentits by playing male territorial songs with portable speakers placed at the base of the net. Once a bird was caught in the net, it was immediately removed and a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service band was placed on its leg. We also took measurements of culmen length (mm), culmen width (mm), unflattened wing chord length (cm), tail length (cm), tarsus length (cm) and mass (g). Culmen length was taken from the anterior end of the nares to the tip of the beak using calipers. For genetic samples, we punctured the brachial vein on the wing of each bird with a small gauge needle and collected the blood that pooled there with a small capillary tube. Bleeding usually stopped after 10 seconds which yielded approximately 100 µl of blood. Blood was then placed in avian blood buffer 
   <a rid="pone.0012767-Seutin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Seutin1">[63]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All samples used in this study came from animals that were captured, handled, and released according to relevant national and international scientific guidelines. We used common field and handling methods that minimize stress and long-term effects of capture. We also researched methods alternative to toe-clipping of reptiles and determined that there were no less harmful yet permanent ways of marking individuals 
   <a rid="pone.0012767-Langkilde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Langkilde1">[62]</a>. We obtained approval for our animal capture protocol from the UCLA Office of the Protection of Animals (OPRS).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We extracted genomic DNA with the Qiagen DNA mini kit (Qiagen Inc.). DNA samples were stored in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0) at −20°C. We used six to eight microsatellite markers for each species (

Alternatively, we used a three-primer genotyping protocol, where the forward microsatellite primer had an M13 sequence attached to the 5′ end (
   <div content-type="gene" class="named-content">5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3′</div>) and a third primer with the complementary M13 sequence was dye-labeled

   <a rid="pone.0012767-Schuelke1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Schuelke1">[69]</a>. The forward, reverse and M13-dye primers were then used in a three-primer PCR protocol using Multiplex Mix (Qiagen Inc.) and 0.01% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) to generate microsatellite alleles which are flourescently labeled. Genotypes were run on an ABI 3700 sequencer and alleles were visualized using GENEMAPPER (Applied Biosystems, Inc.).

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic divergence</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the program ARLEQUIN to estimate pair-wise F
    <sub>ST</sub> values between patches using the infinite-allele model and 1000 permutations for significance 
    <a rid="pone.0012767-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Schneider1">[73]</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0012767-Weir1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Weir1">[74]</a>. We also calculated pair-wise F
    <sub>ST</sub> between arrays within large and core patches with ARLEQUIN to show genetic divergence between sampling sites that were located within a patch of continuous habitat. For this calculation we also included some sampling sites from core areas of continuous habitat that were outside of the Simi Hills (our study area), but within SMMNRA, with an average of 4.28 km (range 1.8–6.6 km) separating these sites.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine patterns of sample clustering based on genetic similarity, we used the program STRUCTURE v. 2.3.1 
    <a rid="pone.0012767-Pritchard1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Pritchard1">[75]</a>. We chose the LOCPRIOR model

We ran seven runs each of K = 1 to K = number of sample sites (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1a</a>) for each species. We compiled results from our STRUCTURE runs with the program STRUCTURE HARVESTER (Dent Earl,

To determine the most likely K, we calculated the posterior probabilities of the mean of seven runs at each K (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Isolation by distance, as revealed by a correlation between pairwise genetic and geographic (Euclidean) distances using a Mantel test, was performed using IBDWS 3.14 
    <a rid="pone.0012767-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Jensen1">[77]</a>. IBDWS uses a Reduced Major Axis (RMA) regression to estimate the slope and intercept of the isolation by distance relationship.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test for the effect of major roads, highways, and patch age on genetic divergence, we performed partial Mantel tests 
    <a rid="pone.0012767-Legendre1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Legendre1">[78]</a> in IBDWS 3.14. Partial Mantel tests determined correlations of roads presence (RDS), highway presence (HWY), and patch age of isolation (AGE) on a genetic divergence matrix, while holding geographic distance constant. Tests were performed separately, one for each of these three variables, and all animals that were captured within a patch were used to calculate a patch average genetic divergence (F
    <sub>ST</sub>; as calculated in ARLEQUIN, see above). The presence of major roads and the presence of Highway 23 were used separately in the analysis because the highway in our study area is larger and has more traffic than other roads. Also, several habitat fragments are only separated by major roads. Age of isolation was chosen because this measure incorporates not only when roads and freeways were built, but also when residential and commercial developments were erected.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We mapped genetic distance on the landscape using Alleles in Space (AIS) and the landscape shape interpolation 
    <a rid="pone.0012767-Miller2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Miller2">[79]</a>. We used a Delaunay triangulation-based connectivity network to identify midpoints between our sample sites, then the raw genetic distance (D
    <sub>ij</sub>) at each midpoint was calculated 
    <a rid="pone.0012767-Miller2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Miller2">[79]</a>. This genetic distance measure is similar to Nei's standard genetic distance (D
    <sub>s</sub>; 
    <a rid="pone.0012767-Nei1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Nei1">[80]</a>), where D
    <sub>ij</sub> is 0 if individuals are completely genetically identical, and D
    <sub>ij</sub> is 1 if individuals are completely genetically dissimilar. We did not calculate the residual genetic distance, because we did not find a significant isolation by distance effect in the Simi Hills samples for any species (see 
    <a ref-type="sec" rid="s2" href="#s2">Results</a>). By this method, a landscape of genetic distances between sampling sites are expressed as “surface heights” and are displayed as a 3-dimensional graph. To better visualize the AIS height output, we imported the output file into ArcGIS 9.3 (ESRI Corporation, Redlands, CA) and created a 2-dimensional color hot-spot map overlaid on the geographic study area. Colors correspond to “heights” of genetic distance between points (e. g.

    <a rid="pone.0012767-Peakall1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Peakall1">[81]</a> to calculate the genetic diversity indices of within-patch expected heterozygosity (H

    <sub>A</sub>), and relatedness (R

    <a rid="pone.0012767-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Lynch1">[82]</a>. We used the Lynch &amp; Ritland (1999) estimator of relatedness because it has been shown to perform well in simulations for a wide range of marker data and population structure 
    <a rid="pone.0012767-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Thomas1">[83]</a>. We performed a rarefaction analysis using the web-based program RERAT 
    <a rid="pone.0012767-Schwacke1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Schwacke1">[84]</a> which uses multiple simulations to determine the change in relatedness values as additional microsatellite loci are added. In RERAT, we performed 100 simulations and used the Lynch and Ritland (1999) relatedness analysis for each of the four species. For lizards, cores and large patches had three pitfall trap arrays while small patches had one (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1a</a>). To reduce bias because of array clustering, we calculated pair wise relatedness of all individuals caught in the same array, and then used the mean of those within-array measures to calculate within patch relatedness.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the program STATA 9 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to transform variables until they approached normal distributions and then to examine the relationship between the indices of genetic diversity and the size, degree of isolation, and age of the habitat patches. We used unpaired t-tests (with unequal variance when necessary) and Bonferroni corrections to compare genetic diversity measures between small and large/core habitat patches. Degrees of freedom for t-tests were calculated using the Satterthwaite (1946) method 
    <a rid="pone.0012767-Satterthwaite1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Satterthwaite1">[85]</a>. We lumped large patches and core areas for this analysis because, for these small species, population size is likely equivalently large in the large patches and the core areas, and because the numbers of sites were relatively small for core areas (n = 2) and large patches (n = 3). To test for a relationship between patch isolation and genetic diversity, we used linear regression to examine the relationship of the genetic diversity indices with the size, pair wise age of isolation, and proximity (PROX) of the habitat patches, where the degree of isolation of a patch is the inverse of proximity. Spearman's rank correlations were used to test for significant associations between patch age and genetic diversity.
