 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat loss and the resulting fragmentation can have many impacts on wildlife populations. However, the effects of fragmentation may vary based on many factors including the size, configuration, and age of habitat patches, the vagility of the species in question, and the characteristics of the matrix between patches. Urban development may represent a particularly intense form of fragmentation for many animals. Species that are particularly sensitive to urban development may be quickly lost from urban areas

  <a rid="pone.0012767-Case1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Case1">[3]</a>. For species that remain widely distributed across fragmented landscapes, connectivity and gene flow between populations may be reduced, leading to longer-term problems such as inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity, and even local extinction

  <a rid="pone.0012767-Reed3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Reed3">[7]</a>. If local extinction occurs, then more isolated patches will be harder to re-colonize 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Frankham1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Frankham1">[4]</a>. In addition, the loss of genetic diversity within isolated patches can lead to a decrease in a species' ability to adapt to environmental change

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An increasing number of studies of the genetic effects of fragmentation have occurred in the past decade or so, although 30–40% of these have not shown significant effects and many are in non-urban landscapes such as fragmented forests 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Keyghobadi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Keyghobadi1">[10]</a>. Urbanization is a common cause of fragmentation, and conservation efforts point to the extreme land use changes associated with urbanization as one of the largest threats to biodiversity 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Miller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Miller1">[11]</a>. However, to date, fine-scale (within 5–10 km) genetic effects of urban fragmentation have been documented for few species

  <a rid="pone.0012767-Magle1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Magle1">[17]</a>, and many studies find little effect

  <a rid="pone.0012767-Sumner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Sumner1">[19]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Richmond1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Richmond1">[20]</a>. Moreover, studies of the genetic effects of fragmentation are overwhelmingly on a single species, and we know of no studies where genetic patterns were compared in the same urban landscape for species from different broad taxa, such as reptiles (Class 
  <span class="italic">Reptilia</span>) and birds (Class 
  <span class="italic">Aves</span>), and with radically different means of locomotion, such as flying and crawling.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated the genetic effects of urban fragmentation on three lizards, the side-blotched lizard (
  <span class="italic">Uta stansburiana</span>), western skink (
  <span class="italic">Plestiodon skiltonianus</span>) and western fence lizard (
  <span class="italic">Sceloporus occidentalis</span>), and one bird, the wrentit (
  <span class="italic">Chamaea fasciata</span>) in Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA), a national park near Los Angeles. The three lizard species have widespread distributions in California 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Stebbins1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Stebbins1">[21]</a>, are small in size, are still relatively common and widespread in natural habitat throughout the area 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Busteed1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Busteed1">[22]</a>, and have low dispersal capabilities 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Doughty1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Doughty1">[23]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Doughty2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Doughty2">[24]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Fitch1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Fitch1">[25]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Massot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Massot1">[26]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Sinervo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Sinervo1">[27]</a>. Side-blotched lizards and fence lizards are both in the family 
  <span class="italic">Iguanidae</span>, but side-blotched lizards are considerably smaller and prefer more open habitat. Western skinks are in a distantly-related different family (
  <span class="italic">Scincidae</span>) and locally prefer grassland habitat, although all three species are broadly sympatric in the region.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wrentits are small birds (approximately 15 g) with a distribution that is limited to the west coast of North America and follows the scrub and chaparral habitat that they prefer
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Geupel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Geupel1">[28]</a>. Wrentits are monogamous, hold small (1–2.5 acres), year-round multi-purpose territories 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Geupel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Geupel1">[28]</a>, and have short dispersal distances 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Baker1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Baker1">[29]</a>. Wrentits are obviously very different phylogenetically and ecologically from the lizards and also have the ability to fly, which could potentially increase their movement across the landscape. A bird isolated in a habitat fragment could presumably simply fly over urban areas to disperse to other suitable habitats, thereby preventing genetic divergence between patches. However, because wrentits have short dispersal distances, small territories, and relatively specific habitat requirements, it is possible that wrentits could be affected by habitat fragmentation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The landscape of southern California continues to be rapidly altered by urbanization and the resulting habitat loss and fragmentation, even though it is part of the California Floristic Province and is one of Conservation International's world biodiversity hotspots (
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Cincotta1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Cincotta1">[30]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Myers1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Myers1">[31]</a>, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.biodiversityhotspots.org</span>). Because it is in the Los Angeles area, SMMNRA is under intense development pressure and urbanization might increase to as much as 47% of the area by 2050, whereas only 11% was urbanized in 2000 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Syphard1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Syphard1">[32]</a>. Given the low vagility of these four focal species, it is possible that movement out of suitable habitat across a highly urbanized landscape is rare. This isolation could increase the genetic divergence between populations living in fragments and also decrease genetic variability within fragments. If urbanization is not an impenetrable barrier to movement, migration between patches by individuals could mitigate negative genetic effects

  <a rid="pone.0012767-Hanski1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Hanski1">[34]</a>. Understanding plant and animal responses to habitat destruction and fragmentation will be important for maintenance of this important biodiversity hotspot, especially in the face of unknown consequences of global climate change.
