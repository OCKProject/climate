 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean heterozygosity (H
  <sub>e</sub>) and the mean number of effective alleles (N
  <sub>A</sub>) were not significantly lower in smaller patches for any of the four species (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0012767.s004" href="#pone.0012767.s004">Table S4</a>). However, relatedness was higher in small patches for all three lizard species (side-blotched lizard difference = 0.03, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 4.1, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.003, d.f. = 6.2; fence lizard difference = 0.02,

Rarefaction analysis indicated that the number of loci used produced consistent average relatedness results for all species and that the addition of the last locus added a 0.5% (fence lizards), 0.8% (side-blotched lizards), 1.4% (western skinks), and 0.1% (wrentits) change in relatedness estimates.
