 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the program GENALEX 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Peakall1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Peakall1">[81]</a> to calculate the genetic diversity indices of within-patch expected heterozygosity (H
  <sub>e</sub>), observed heterozygosity (H
  <sub>o</sub>), number of effective alleles (N
  <sub>A</sub>), and relatedness (R
  <sub>LR</sub>) 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Lynch1">[82]</a>. We used the Lynch &amp; Ritland (1999) estimator of relatedness because it has been shown to perform well in simulations for a wide range of marker data and population structure 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Thomas1">[83]</a>. We performed a rarefaction analysis using the web-based program RERAT 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Schwacke1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Schwacke1">[84]</a> which uses multiple simulations to determine the change in relatedness values as additional microsatellite loci are added. In RERAT, we performed 100 simulations and used the Lynch and Ritland (1999) relatedness analysis for each of the four species. For lizards, cores and large patches had three pitfall trap arrays while small patches had one (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012767-g001" href="#pone-0012767-g001">Fig. 1a</a>). To reduce bias because of array clustering, we calculated pair wise relatedness of all individuals caught in the same array, and then used the mean of those within-array measures to calculate within patch relatedness.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the program STATA 9 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to transform variables until they approached normal distributions and then to examine the relationship between the indices of genetic diversity and the size, degree of isolation, and age of the habitat patches. We used unpaired t-tests (with unequal variance when necessary) and Bonferroni corrections to compare genetic diversity measures between small and large/core habitat patches. Degrees of freedom for t-tests were calculated using the Satterthwaite (1946) method 
  <a rid="pone.0012767-Satterthwaite1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012767-Satterthwaite1">[85]</a>. We lumped large patches and core areas for this analysis because, for these small species, population size is likely equivalently large in the large patches and the core areas, and because the numbers of sites were relatively small for core areas (n = 2) and large patches (n = 3). To test for a relationship between patch isolation and genetic diversity, we used linear regression to examine the relationship of the genetic diversity indices with the size, pair wise age of isolation, and proximity (PROX) of the habitat patches, where the degree of isolation of a patch is the inverse of proximity. Spearman's rank correlations were used to test for significant associations between patch age and genetic diversity.
