 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are increasingly cited as threats to wildlife, livestock and humans alike 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Daszak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Daszak1">[1]</a> and can be a major threat to geographically isolated or critically endangered wild bird populations 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Friend1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Friend1">[2]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Bunbury1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Bunbury1">[3]</a>. Parasites are integral components of healthy ecosystems, but while impacts on individuals are well recognised [e.g. 4,5] consequences at the population level are poorly understood. Assessing the population impacts of disease, particularly those caused by emerging pathogens, within wildlife populations is problematic because little is known of the background species complement of their parasites and because the detection and diagnosis of disease in most wildlife species is challenging. Also, there usually is a paucity of host population data before and after disease emergence. Consequently, documented population declines of common or widespread avian populations due to infectious disease are rare 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Hochachka1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Hochachka1">[6]</a>, . Here we combine systematic large-scale monitoring schemes to quantify the incidence of an emerging disease in three widespread passerine bird species and its population impacts.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Trichomonas gallinae</span> is a common protozoan parasite of pigeons (Columbiformes) which principally infects the upper alimentary tract where it can cause the disease, necrotic ingluvitis 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Forrester1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Forrester1">[9]</a>. Epizootic mortality in columbiform species has been previously reported 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Forrester1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Forrester1">[9]</a> and the parasite infrequently infects other avian taxa such as birds of prey and songbirds 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Anderson1">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-National1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-National1">[11]</a>. Trichomonosis has been postulated to be a factor contributing to the extinction of the passenger pigeon 
  <span class="italic">Ectopistes migratorius</span>
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Stabler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Stabler1">[12]</a> and has been shown to be a significant cause of nestling mortality in the island-endemic pink pigeon 
  <span class="italic">Nesoenas mayeri</span>
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Bunbury1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Bunbury1">[3]</a> and in the Iberian Peninsula population of the Bonelli's eagle 
  <span class="italic">Hieraaetus fasciatus</span>
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Hfle1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Hfle1">[13]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Real1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Real1">[14]</a>. Both of these small populations are considered to be endangered and, for both, mortality due to trichomonosis has been highlighted as a conservation concern.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Opportunistic surveillance of bird deaths in Britain since 2000 has shown a seasonal pattern in finch mortality driven primarily by low-levels of salmonellosis (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g001" href="#pone-0012215-g001">Fig. 1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Pennycott1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Pennycott1">[15]</a>). In autumn 2005, the number of unsolicited reports of bird mortality increased markedly and early investigations identified infection with a trichomonad parasite 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Holmes1">[16]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Pennycott2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Pennycott2">[17]</a>. The geographic spread of these reports was uneven and here we take advantage of long-term volunteer monitoring of garden bird occurrence to (i) quantify disease incidence in three species of common garden bird: greenfinch 
  <span class="italic">Carduelis chloris</span>, chaffinch 
  <span class="italic">Fringilla coelebs</span> and dunnock 
  <span class="italic">Prunella modularis</span>; (ii) demonstrate a spatially contemporaneous decline in the occurrence of frequently affected bird species in gardens; and (iii) combine this with national monitoring of bird abundance to show that this decline was followed by significant reductions in regional breeding populations. Public reporting of wild bird carcasses has been utilised as a surveillance tool for West Nile virus and Usutu virus elsewhere 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Eidson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Eidson1">[18]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Chvala1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Chvala1">[19]</a> and volunteer networks were successfully instituted in North America to elicit reports of diseased birds in order to characterise the spread of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis in the house finch 
  <span class="italic">Carpodacus mexicanus</span>
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Dhondt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Dhondt1">[20]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Altizer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Altizer1">[21]</a>. This is the first time, however, as far as we are aware, that such quantitative monitoring of disease incidence and its population impact has been undertaken using established survey networks.
