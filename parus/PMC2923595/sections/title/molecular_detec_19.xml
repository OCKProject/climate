 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A nested PCR protocol was designed to increase the sensitivity of detection of trichomonad parasite DNA in template DNA extracted from lesions sampled post mortem and to provide a diagnostic tool for cases where autolysed carcass condition precluded 
  <span class="italic">Trichomonas</span> sp. culture. Trichomonad small subunit (SSU) rRNA primers (forward -
  <div content-type="gene" class="named-content">TACTTGGTTGATCCTGCC</div> and reverse - 
  <div content-type="gene" class="named-content">TCACCTACCGTTACCTTG</div>) from 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Cepicka1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Cepicka1">[43]</a> were used for the first reaction. The PCR product nucleotide sequence was obtained from a pure trichomonad culture obtained from an affected greenfinch. Nested primers, TN3 forward (
  <div content-type="gene" class="named-content">ATAGGACTGCAAAGCCGAGA</div>) and TN4 reverse (
  <div content-type="gene" class="named-content">TGATTTCACCGAGTCATCCA</div>), were then designed using Prime3 online software 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Rozen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Rozen1">[44]</a>. Primers were supplied by Eurofins MWG Operon (UK).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first stage used 2 µL of 10X PCR buffer (Qiagen), 0.1 µL of 5 U/µL HotStar Taq Plus DNA Polymerase (Qiagen), 2 µL template DNA, 0.4 µL of 10 mM each dNTP mix (Qiagen), 0.4 µL of 100 µM forward and reverse primer and molecular grade water to complete the 20 µL reaction. After an initial 5 min denaturation at 94°C, 40 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min and 72°C for 2 mins were carried out, followed by a 5 min extension at 72°C using a thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR System 9700, Applied Biosystems, UK).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reaction mixture for the second amplification was the same as for the first, except for the use of the nested primers. The amplification mix comprised 19 µl of mix and 1 µl of PCR product template from the first amplification round. After an initial 5 min denaturation at 94°C, 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 sec, 50°C for 45 sec and 72°C for 45 sec were carried out, followed by a 7 min extension at 72°C. Each amplification contained a negative control, consisting of water and a positive control of purified DNA obtained from cultured trichomonad parasites from a greenfinch. Amplified PCR products were visualised under UV light after ethidium bromide staining of a 3% agarose gel and the expected product size (circa 200 bps) was confirmed using Easy Ladder I (Bioline). PCR products were submitted for sequencing at Cogenics (UK) using the ABI 3730 xl platform with the TN3 forward and TN4 reverse primers. Chromatograph profiles were inspected using Chromas 2 software
  <span class="monospace">.</span> The sequence from the forward TN3 primer and the reverse complement of the TN4 primer PCR product were aligned in both directions for each sample using MEGA 4.1 software and ClustalW. Sequences were compared with available gene sequences within NCBI Genbank using the BLAST search function.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reliable discrimination between necrotic ingluvitis due to salmonellosis or trichomonosis in finches is not possible based on gross examination alone. In order to evaluate whether our nested PCR cross-reacted non-specifically with 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> Typhimurium Definitive Type (DT)40 and DT56 variant (v), lesions from 56 greenfinches and six chaffinches confirmed to have died due to salmonellosis by microbiological examination in 2005 and 2006 (Lawson, 
  <span class="italic">unpublished data</span>) were screened. The majority of cases were negative on nested PCR (54/62 cases) and all cases examined during the study period 1 April 2006 to 30 September 2006 were negative. This indicates that 8 cases examined outside the study period might have had concurrent infection with 
  <span class="italic">Trichomonas</span> sp. and 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> sp.. Carcass condition precluded parasite culture in all but one of these cases, but this case yielded trichomonad parasites confirming the existence of dual infection. These findings suggest that the nested PCR does not cross react non-specifically with 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> Typhimurium DT40 and DT56(v) and can be used within our case definition for the diagnosis of trichomonosis in finches.
