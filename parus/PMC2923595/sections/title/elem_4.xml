 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Necrotic ingluvitis, typically extending through the full thickness of the oesophageal wall and often involving adjacent connective tissue, was diagnosed through post-mortem examination (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g002" href="#pone-0012215-g002">Fig. 2a</a>) and confirmed as trichomonosis, according to our case definition (see below), in 70 of 125 greenfinches, and in 18 of 76 chaffinches examined between 1 April 2006 and 30 September 2006. These diagnoses were reached on the basis of 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> culture alone in 17 birds, nested PCR amplification alone in 58 birds, and a combination of parasite culture and nested PCR in 13 birds. All confirmed trichomonosis cases were negative for 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> sp. on culture. In addition, 20 of the 125 greenfinches and 29 of the 76 chaffinches were suspected to have died of trichomonosis as these birds had necrotic ingluvitis which was negative for 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> sp. Trichomonosis in these cases, however, was not confirmed using nested PCR or culture.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of 241 finch carcasses examined during the period 1 April 2006 to 30 September 2006, 179 were diagnosed as having died of infectious disease. Of these 179 birds, trichomonosis accounted for 144 (80%) of the deaths (90 greenfinches, 47 chaffinches and 7 birds from four other finch species), 
  <span class="italic">E.coli</span> serotype O86 (the second most common infectious cause of death and which is associated with enteritis with no necrotic ingluvitis) was diagnosed in 24 (13%), while salmonellosis was confirmed in only 4 (2%).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fringillidae species accounted for 84% (292/347) of trichomonosis cases diagnosed in 2005 and 2006, including greenfinch (173 cases), chaffinch (106 cases) and four other finch species (5 bullfinch 
  <span class="italic">Pyrrhula pyrrhula</span>, 4 goldfinch 
  <span class="italic">Carduelis carduelis</span>, 2 brambling 
  <span class="italic">Fringilla montifringilla</span> and 2 siskin 
  <span class="italic">Carduelis spinus</span>). Columbidae species accounted for 11% (37/347) of cases (20 collared dove 
  <span class="italic">Streptopelia decaocto</span> and 17 wood pigeon 
  <span class="italic">Columba palumbus</span>). The only other species in which the disease was diagnosed were house sparrow 
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span> (9 cases), yellowhammer 
  <span class="italic">Emberiza citrinella</span> (4 cases), dunnock (3 cases) and great tit 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (2 cases). Concurrent soiling of the beak and facial plumage with food and saliva was frequently present in affected finches and such birds were typically thin or emaciated. Histopathological examination of the crop confirmed focally extensive moderate to severe mucosal ulceration and submucosal necrosis with infiltration by moderate numbers of degenerate and viable heterophils, lymphocytes and macrophages. Superficially, there was often a layer of necrotic crop epithelial tissue within which groups of 10–20 µm diameter round cells (consistent with protozoal organisms) and numerous clusters of mixed bacterial colonies were seen. Autolysis of the alimentary tract precluded meaningful histological examination in many cases; consequently histopathology was not used as a routine diagnostic test for confirmation of trichomonosis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Giemsa-stained parasite culture preparations revealed a variable morphology (body dimensions range 8–11×4–5 µm) typical of a trichomonad parasite with a single nucleus and axostyle, anterior flagella and an undulating membrane. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g002" href="#pone-0012215-g002">Fig. 2b</a>) confirmed the presence of a parasite with plastic pyriform morphology and four anterior flagella that typically exited the body together in pairs. A prominent undulating membrane, with no free posterior trailing flagellum, was present.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Amplification of the ITS1/5.8S/ITS2 ribosomal region was performed on DNA extracted from oesophageal lesions from nine greenfinches and nine chaffinches (submitted from 18 disparate sites across 13 counties covering England, Wales and Scotland) that died of trichomonosis in 2005 or 2006. An identical consensus sequence of 214 nucleotides was identified for all PCR products (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g003" href="#pone-0012215-g003">Fig. 3a</a>, Genbank accession numbers GQ150752 and GQ150753) from the finch samples examined. National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST search identified that the consensus finch sequence matched four Genbank entries with100% sequence identity with 100% query coverage, all of which were for 
  <span class="italic">Trichomonas gallinae</span> (EU215369 (multiple columbid and hawk species from the USA), EU290649 (house finch 
  <span class="italic">Carpodacus mexicanus</span>/corvid species from the USA), EF208019 (Mauritian columbid species), AY349182 (
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> strain g7)). Thus the organism infecting the British finches was identified as 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sequencing of second stage products of a nested PCR for the detection of trichomonads from oesophageal lesion extracts from seven greenfinches and one chaffinch examined in 2005 or 2006 with trichomonosis identified a consensus sequence of 149 nucleotides in all eight cases (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g003" href="#pone-0012215-g003">Fig. 3b</a>, Genbank accession no GQ214405). NCBI BLAST identified the consensus finch sequence as a match for four

  <span class="italic">Tetratrichomonas gallinarum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Tetratrichomonas</span> sp. reports had 98% or less sequence identity with 100% query coverage. The specificity of the nested PCR for a range of species within the Trichomonadidae was not assessed in this study, therefore this technique cannot currently be used in isolation as a diagnostic test for 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span>. However, use of the nested PCR appears robust within the case definition for finch trichomonosis that we have employed.
