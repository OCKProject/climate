  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g005" href="#pone-0012215-g005">Fig. 5a</a>). There was a significant difference in seasonal pattern of occurrence between 2005 (which was very similar to previous years, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g005" href="#pone-0012215-g005">Fig. 5b</a>) and 2006, with markedly fewer gardens reporting greenfinches from early August (week 32) onwards (

  <sub>9,23</sub> = 24.23, p&lt;0.0001). Analysis of a subset of these sites which recorded counts of individual birds (rather than presence) showed a similar reduction in mean abundance in gardens reporting greenfinches in the latter half of 2006.

  <a rid="pone.0012215-Newson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Newson1">[23]</a>. The decline in relative abundance of greenfinches on BBS squares was significantly greater (35%) in the region of High trichomonosis-associated mortality than in either of the other two regions (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0012215-t001" href="#pone-0012215-t001">Table 1</a>). This annual change was much more marked than any seen in the previous ten years (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g007" href="#pone-0012215-g007">Fig. 7</a>). In accordance with our predictions, the number of breeding chaffinches declined significantly (21%) in the High incidence region but not in the other two areas; abundance of breeding dunnocks did not decline in any region.
