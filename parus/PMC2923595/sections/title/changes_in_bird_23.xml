 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each week, GBW participants recorded the presence of each bird species in their garden and, optionally, the peak number of birds counted each week 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Cannon1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Cannon1">[22]</a>. For this analysis we used the 828 gardens for which data were submitted in every week from January 2005 to June 2007 in England south of 53.5°N (see below). We modelled bird abundance as the proportion of gardens in which the species was present (‘reporting rate’). We modelled reporting rates using generalised additive or linear mixed models, fitted using the gamm function in package 
  <span class="italic">mgcv</span> for R 2.6.0

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To exclude the possibility that changes in other environmental factors, such as climate, between years might have caused changes in greenfinch numbers, we also modelled reporting rates of chaffinch, which has a similar body size and ecology to the greenfinch, and was the second most frequently affected species in which trichomonosis was recorded, and of dunnock, which also feeds around garden feeders 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Snow1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Snow1">[51]</a> but in which trichomonosis was rarely recorded (only three cases diagnosed in 2005 and 2006 combined). Both species show similar patterns of spatial and temporal abundance in gardens to the greenfinch 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Cannon1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Cannon1">[22]</a>. We predicted that, if trichomonosis was responsible for changes in numbers, chaffinch should show an identifiable, but less marked, response and dunnock should show little response; if other factors, such as climatic factors or a change in resource availability, were involved then the response among the three species should be similar.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Abundance of birds in gardens varies seasonally in a non-linear fashion, with peak numbers occurring in late winter or spring and lowest counts in late summer/autumn, when many birds are moulting 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Cannon1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Cannon1">[22]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Chamberlain1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Chamberlain1">[35]</a>. To model this variation we fitted a generalised additive model to the reporting rate as a function of week number (1–7 Jan = 1 to 25–31 Dec = 52) in the form of a thin-plate regression spline using gamm with a binomial error structure and logit link function 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Wood1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Wood1">[50]</a>. We used the default level of smoothing, as increasing the potential for smoothing (by changing the basis, k) did not alter the results materially. To account for variation among gardens in the probability of birds being present and observer ability we included garden identifier as a random-effect term. Preliminary models including garden identifier as a fixed effect showed the distribution of these effects, as for other large-scale schemes run by BTO, were indeed approximately normally distributed. The weekly records of bird presence are likely to exhibit serial auto-correlation, both temporally and spatially. We initially fitted models with no temporal or spatial auto-correlation and while temporal correlation among the residuals was strong, spatial correlations (analysed using the correlog function in library ncf 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Bjornstad1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Bjornstad1">[52]</a>), though statistically significant, were typically weak (r≤0.05). This may reflect the fact that distance between gardens was generally much greater than the ambit of individual foraging flocks and it is unlikely the provisioning behaviour in any one sample garden influenced the behaviour in neighbouring sample gardens. We therefore included an AR1 auto-regressive correlation structure (with weeks numbered consecutively through the entire period) to account for the correlation between records in consecutive weeks; the degree of auto-correlation was assumed to be the same for each garden.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify impacts on the breeding season following the epidemic of trichomonosis in autumn 2006, we constructed a model to compare reporting rate at the start of the 2007 breeding season (weeks 13–21, 26 March–28 May) with the average reporting rate for the same period in the previous two years (which, as far as could be determined, were typical). We restricted the analysis to the previous two years to avoid potential confounding effects of long-term trends in bird numbers and reporting rates. As we were considering a relatively short time-span within a year, it was not necessary to fit a smoothed term of week; rather we modelled reporting rate as a function of garden size, week (and its square to account for any non-linearity) and a two-level dummy variable, year, with weeks in 2005/06 having year = 0 and those in 2007 year = 1. The estimate of this latter term then gives the change in reporting rate in 2007 relative to that in the previous two years. As before, we included garden identifier as a random effect and fitted an auto-correlated binomial error structure.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mortality due to trichomonosis varied spatially throughout the country, so we defined three regions representing areas of High, Intermediate and Low incidence of trichomonosis, based on the results of opportunistic sampling. We restricted these analyses to England south of a line from the Mersey to the Humber (approx. 53° 30′N) as it is in this region that gardens participating in GBW are most representative of the landscape as a whole (for example upland areas, where there tend to be few GBW sites, are relatively limited in extent). Greenfinch, chaffinch and dunnock populations occur widely across this region, being observed in 70–80% of gardens in the GBW scheme. For convenience, we defined these three regions in terms of administrative county boundaries with areas of High (Cheshire, Derbyshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Leicestershire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and the West Midlands), Intermediate (Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, South Yorkshire and Wiltshire) and Low (Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Greater London, Kent, Norfolk, Suffolk, Surrey and Sussex) incidence of trichomonosis. To test for differences in the change in reporting rate in spring 2007 among areas, we included an interaction term between area and the dummy year variable described above.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numbers of birds present across Britain during the breeding season are monitored using line-transect counts in a sample of c. 3,000 randomly selected 1×1 km squares by the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Newson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Newson1">[23]</a>. BBS transects are undertaken in all habitats, rather than being restricted to gardens as with the GBW scheme. An index of relative abundance based on a generalized linear Poisson model with categorical site and year fixed-effects is produced annually; we obtained indices for the three county groupings to measure the relative change in breeding population between 2006 and 2007 in each region.
