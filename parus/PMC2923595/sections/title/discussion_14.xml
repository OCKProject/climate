 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We diagnosed trichomonosis as an emerging and widespread cause of death in British finches in 2005 and 2006. The gross and histopathological findings are consistent with upper alimentary tract lesions caused by 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> infection in columbiform species 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-PerezMesa1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-PerezMesa1">[24]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Narcisi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Narcisi1">[25]</a>, although lesions in finches typically occur in the proximal oesophagus, compared to the pharyngeal region in affected pigeons and doves. Ultrastructural examination identified morphology consistent with 
  <span class="italic">Trichomonas</span> sp. protists, including 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span>
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Benchimol1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Benchimol1">[26]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Bondurant1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Bondurant1">[28]</a>. Amplification and sequencing of the ITS1/5.8S/ITS2 region using TFR1 and TFR2 primers yielded consensus sequence with 100% identity to published accounts for 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span>, confirming the parasite species identification

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental assessment of the survival of 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> in white-winged dove 
  <span class="italic">Zenaida asiatica</span> carcasses found that most reliable diagnostic results were obtained on sampling within 8 hours of death and that parasite culture from 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span>-positive birds was successful in only 44% of carcasses sampled at 48 hours following death 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Erwin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Erwin1">[32]</a>. In the current study, parasite culture was found to be a useful technique for confirmation of the diagnosis in carcasses even in a mild state of autolysis. Due to delays in submission, however, negative culture results could not be used to exclude the diagnosis. Therefore, nested PCR provided a useful ancillary diagnostic tool in combination with post mortem and microbiological examinations within our case definition for the diagnosis of trichomonosis for carcasses in which the protozoan parasites were no longer viable.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consideration of two independent data sets of bird mortality in Britain (i.e. (1) surveillance based opportunistically on unsolicited reports from members of the public and (2) systematic monitoring according to a defined protocol by our volunteer network) in combination enables us to maximise their relative benefits. The large-scale, but ad hoc, sampling from the opportunistic survey provided indication of the commencement of the epidemic and samples to determine its epidemiology. The systematic sampling using a pre-existing network provided a quantitative measure of incidence which will be relatively robust to, for example, increases in reporting frequency in response to media coverage. Such data could not realistically be collected in any other way and should, over time, provide much needed detail on the background complement of disease agents in wild bird populations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The winter of 2006 was relatively mild (mean temperature anomaly in England for Nov-Mar +1.7°C 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Met1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Met1">[33]</a>) so mortality levels would be expected to be low 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Robinson1">[34]</a>. Also, the number of birds, especially seed-eaters, recorded in gardens would be expected to be lower than usual due to a reduced reliance on provisioning 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Chamberlain1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Chamberlain1">[35]</a> and a small reduction in the reporting rate of dunnock was observed in the area of high disease incidence perhaps for this reason. However, the much larger reduction in the occurrence of greenfinches in gardens was not simply because birds were not coming into gardens for food, since reporting continued to be low into the following spring (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g005" href="#pone-0012215-g005">Fig. 5</a>) and regional declines in greenfinch breeding populations were observed in an independent dataset (BBS) with broader habitat coverage. The onset of the decline in greenfinch reporting rate is contemporaneous with the onset of the trichomonosis outbreak (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g005" href="#pone-0012215-g005">Fig. 5</a>) and the spatial pattern in regional population decline (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0012215-t001" href="#pone-0012215-t001">Table 1</a>) matches that of the disease occurrence (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g004" href="#pone-0012215-g004">Fig. 4</a>). We have been unable to identify any other factor that could have caused such large-scale mortality. Furthermore, there were no similarly large declines noted in any other garden bird species (Toms, 
  <span class="italic">unpublished data</span>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Great Britain as a whole, the greenfinch breeding population increased steadily (by c. 60%) from the mid 1980s to 2006, but decreased (significantly) by 15% in 2007 compared to the previous year 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Risely1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Risely1">[36]</a>. It seems likely that this decline was driven, in large part, by the emergence of trichomonosis. Given that the population of greenfinches in Great Britain is in the order of 4 million 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Newson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Newson1">[23]</a>, this represents mortality of a very large number of individuals, possibly in the order of half a million birds. This level of mortality due to an EID is unprecedented in British wild bird populations and is of international interest as, although other studies have demonstrated trichomonosis in non-columbiform species 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Anderson1">[10]</a>, this is the first trichomonosis epidemic to show substantial negative impact on free-ranging populations of these species. The current study also reinforces the value of large-scale, long-term, citizen science programmes for wildlife population monitoring and disease surveillance and of a multi-disciplinary approach to investigating the conservation significance of wildlife disease. As the opportunistic reports from the public were unsolicited, rather than in response to a direct appeal, such as the one undertaken to monitor the spread of house finch mycoplasmosis in the USA 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Dhondt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Dhondt1">[20]</a>, we predict large-scale under-reporting of the 2006 trichomonosis epidemic. Our use of volunteers to actively search for sick and dead birds in a systematic fashion, however, should provide a reliable estimate of relative disease incidence (with up to 10% of monitored gardens recording at least one incident of morbidity or mortality) and this was temporo-spatially consistent with the observed population declines in greenfinch and chaffinch populations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The origin of 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> infection in finches is currently unknown but columbiform species are considered the most likely source. Future research priorities include molecular studies to identify the origin of 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> in finches, for example through comparing parasite isolates derived from finch, columbiform and other wild bird species, and to assess 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> strain diversity in Great Britain on the basis of geography, species and virulence. Retrospective surveys using the nested PCR methodology on archived garden bird tissues, collected prior to 2005, could identify presence of the parasite in non-columbiform populations prior to the onset of epidemic finch mortality, although the chance of detecting a low prevalence from the relatively small number of archived carcasses would be low.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although greenfinches appear to be the species most frequently affected by 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> infection in garden habitats (and chaffinches somewhat less so), the reasons for this are not clear. The greenfinch is one of the species most frequently affected by other infectious diseases that are commonly diagnosed in garden birds, such as salmonellosis and colibacillosis (Lawson and Cunningham, 
  <span class="italic">unpublished data</span>). The gregarious and granivorous habits of finch species sharing food and water at feeding stations with high contact rates are likely to facilitate pathogen spread. Trichomonosis, however, was confirmed only rarely in members of the Paridae, which also commonly flock to garden bird feeders, so feeding behaviour is unlikely to be the sole driver of greenfinch susceptibility. Investigations of wildlife species mortality which rely on the reporting of sick and dead birds by members of the public have an inherent risk of bias due to variation in observer effort. Also, some species, such as large or brightly coloured ones, are more likely to be detected. Systematic sampling by volunteers in our network provides a relatively consistent level of observer effort and will have reduced variability in detection bias between gardens so should provide a robust measure of relative disease incidence. Although we have quantified the occurrence of trichomonosis in dead birds, the overall prevalence of 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> infection in wild bird populations remains unknown. Prospective studies to screen multiple species of live birds for trichomonad parasites 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Bunbury2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Bunbury2">[37]</a> would help address this knowledge gap. Experimental challenge studies in multiple species are required to definitively confirm the extent of interspecific variation in susceptibility to infection with, and to disease caused by, 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Land-use change and habitat degradation have led to an increased national focus on garden habitats as a useful refuge for British wildlife 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Toms1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Toms1">[38]</a>. It has been estimated that 48% of gardens in Britain provide some form of artificial food for wildlife 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Davies1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Davies1">[39]</a>. Anthropogenic provisioning of wild birds in garden habitats influences contact rates among conspecifics and alters species complements at feeding sites; both factors influence pathogen transmission and exposure rates 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Robb1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Robb1">[40]</a>. Garden bird feeding practice in Great Britain has altered over recent years with increased adoption of summer feeding and increased provision of sunflower and niger seed which might have led to increased concentration of birds at feeders. 
  <span class="italic">Trichomonas gallinae</span> can be transmitted through direct contact between birds, for example courtship and feeding of young, and through indirect routes including shared food and water sources 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Forrester1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Forrester1">[9]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Bunbury3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Bunbury3">[41]</a>, however further studies are required to assess the relative importance of these transmission routes for finches. Establishing the nature and frequency of disease transmission at garden feeders is thus clearly important to identify if mitigation measures are required and, if so, how they should be employed. The greenfinch and chaffinch are both common garden bird visitors in England and Wales across the year, ranking number 9 and 10 in the most frequent garden visitors in the GBW scheme 
  <a rid="pone.0012215-Cannon1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Cannon1">[22]</a>. Both species are gregarious, visiting gardens in flocks, but other granivorous passerine species are reported in a comparable number of gardens around feeding stations, for example house sparrows, great tits and blue tits, and they also feed in groups. More generally, 
  <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> is a pathogen of potential significance to the racing pigeon, aviculture, game bird and poultry industries and the implications for finch trichomonosis to these industries remain poorly understood. Continued monitoring of diseases in wild bird populations is required to better quantify and understand their impact on population dynamics

  <a rid="pone.0012215-Hudson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Hudson1">[42]</a> and to identify future changes in host-parasite relationships.
