  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Opportunistic monitoring of garden bird mortality by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) between 2001 and 2004 showed an annual seasonal peak in mid-winter (Dec/Jan), with 37–76% of reports per annum occurring in these two months (

   <span class="italic">Unpublished data</span>); post mortem examinations indicated that this seasonal peak was largely due to salmonellosis in Fringillidae and Passeridae species (

   <span class="italic">Unpublished data</span>). Between January 1
   <span class="sup">st</span> 2000 and December 31
   <span class="sup">st</span> 2004, we examined 750 garden birds post mortem, of which 67% of greenfinch deaths (168/252 birds) were due to salmonellosis and no cases of finch trichomonosis were confirmed.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the index case of trichomonosis in a British finch in April 2005, small numbers of finch mortality incidents were reported throughout 2005, unusually peaking during September to November 
   <a rid="pone.0012215-Pennycott2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0012215-Pennycott2">[17]</a>. In summer 2006, the number of finch, particularly greenfinch, mortality reports increased dramatically with a total of 1054 trichomonosis incidents recorded (according to our incident definition – see below), involving c. 6300 dead greenfinches and chaffinches combined, between 1 April 2006 and 30 September 2006. This comprised 50% of all reported incidents of garden bird morbidity and mortality during this period and compares with 84 incidents of trichomonosis for the same time period in 2005 and sporadic cases (none of which involved finches) in previous years. These reports from the public were unsolicited, not in response to a direct appeal and occurred prior to media coverage of the EID. Sick and dead birds at affected sites were typically observed in close vicinity to garden bird feeding stations and exhibited non-specific signs of malaise, for example lethargy and fluffed-up plumage, frequently in combination with dysphagia.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Necrotic ingluvitis, typically extending through the full thickness of the oesophageal wall and often involving adjacent connective tissue, was diagnosed through post-mortem examination (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g002" href="#pone-0012215-g002">Fig. 2a</a>) and confirmed as trichomonosis, according to our case definition (see below), in 70 of 125 greenfinches, and in 18 of 76 chaffinches examined between 1 April 2006 and 30 September 2006. These diagnoses were reached on the basis of 
   <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span> culture alone in 17 birds, nested PCR amplification alone in 58 birds, and a combination of parasite culture and nested PCR in 13 birds. All confirmed trichomonosis cases were negative for 
   <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> sp. on culture. In addition, 20 of the 125 greenfinches and 29 of the 76 chaffinches were suspected to have died of trichomonosis as these birds had necrotic ingluvitis which was negative for 
   <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> sp. Trichomonosis in these cases, however, was not confirmed using nested PCR or culture.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of 241 finch carcasses examined during the period 1 April 2006 to 30 September 2006, 179 were diagnosed as having died of infectious disease. Of these 179 birds, trichomonosis accounted for 144 (80%) of the deaths (90 greenfinches, 47 chaffinches and 7 birds from four other finch species), 
   <span class="italic">E.coli</span> serotype O86 (the second most common infectious cause of death and which is associated with enteritis with no necrotic ingluvitis) was diagnosed in 24 (13%), while salmonellosis was confirmed in only 4 (2%).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fringillidae species accounted for 84% (292/347) of trichomonosis cases diagnosed in 2005 and 2006, including greenfinch (173 cases), chaffinch (106 cases) and four other finch species (5 bullfinch 
   <span class="italic">Pyrrhula pyrrhula</span>, 4 goldfinch 
   <span class="italic">Carduelis carduelis</span>, 2 brambling 
   <span class="italic">Fringilla montifringilla</span> and 2 siskin 
   <span class="italic">Carduelis spinus</span>). Columbidae species accounted for 11% (37/347) of cases (20 collared dove 
   <span class="italic">Streptopelia decaocto</span> and 17 wood pigeon 
   <span class="italic">Columba palumbus</span>). The only other species in which the disease was diagnosed were house sparrow 
   <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span> (9 cases), yellowhammer 
   <span class="italic">Emberiza citrinella</span> (4 cases), dunnock (3 cases) and great tit 
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (2 cases). Concurrent soiling of the beak and facial plumage with food and saliva was frequently present in affected finches and such birds were typically thin or emaciated. Histopathological examination of the crop confirmed focally extensive moderate to severe mucosal ulceration and submucosal necrosis with infiltration by moderate numbers of degenerate and viable heterophils, lymphocytes and macrophages. Superficially, there was often a layer of necrotic crop epithelial tissue within which groups of 10–20 µm diameter round cells (consistent with protozoal organisms) and numerous clusters of mixed bacterial colonies were seen. Autolysis of the alimentary tract precluded meaningful histological examination in many cases; consequently histopathology was not used as a routine diagnostic test for confirmation of trichomonosis.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Giemsa-stained parasite culture preparations revealed a variable morphology (body dimensions range 8–11×4–5 µm) typical of a trichomonad parasite with a single nucleus and axostyle, anterior flagella and an undulating membrane. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g002" href="#pone-0012215-g002">Fig. 2b</a>) confirmed the presence of a parasite with plastic pyriform morphology and four anterior flagella that typically exited the body together in pairs. A prominent undulating membrane, with no free posterior trailing flagellum, was present.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Amplification of the ITS1/5.8S/ITS2 ribosomal region was performed on DNA extracted from oesophageal lesions from nine greenfinches and nine chaffinches (submitted from 18 disparate sites across 13 counties covering England, Wales and Scotland) that died of trichomonosis in 2005 or 2006. An identical consensus sequence of 214 nucleotides was identified for all PCR products (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g003" href="#pone-0012215-g003">Fig. 3a</a>, Genbank accession numbers GQ150752 and GQ150753) from the finch samples examined. National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST search identified that the consensus finch sequence matched four Genbank entries with100% sequence identity with 100% query coverage, all of which were for 
   <span class="italic">Trichomonas gallinae</span> (EU215369 (multiple columbid and hawk species from the USA), EU290649 (house finch

   <span class="italic">T. gallinae</span>. However, use of the nested PCR appears robust within the case definition for finch trichomonosis that we have employed.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rates of opportunistic reports of trichomonosis (identified according to our incident definition) varied greatly among counties, with rates in excess of 0.20 incidents per thousand households (ipth) found in Gloucestershire, Powys and Warwickshire. We used the opportunistic reports to define regions of High, Intermediate and Low disease incidence (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012215-g004" href="#pone-0012215-g004">Fig. 4</a>). Overall, the average reporting rate was 0.037 ipth but this varied markedly among the regions (aggregate average for the High region: 0.109 ipth; Intermediate region: 0.056 ipth; Low region: 0.003 ipth, χ

   <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;0.001). As these rates may have been influenced by local publicity, we quantified incidence in a network of garden sites where diseased birds were searched for systematically according to a defined protocol throughout the study period. Trichomonosis (according to our incident definition) was identified at 39 sites (5.2%) but the incidence varied spatially in a manner similar to the opportunistic reports, with 10.4% (n = 115) of participants in the High region reporting an incident, 7.8% (n = 154) in the Intermediate region and 0.0% (n = 164) in the Low region (χ
