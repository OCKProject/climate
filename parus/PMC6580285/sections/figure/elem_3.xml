  <p>Upper: observed geographic distribution of eastern North American (blue) mtDNA haplotypes at the ND2 locus and those found predominantly in the Florida peninsula (yellow; e.g., Figure 
   <a rid="ece35190-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0001">1</a>) along a transect from Key Largo (FL) to Houston (TX) in
