  <span ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="MK523769" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">MK523769</span>‐

After trimming the sequences to eliminate potential recombining fragments, we analyzed a sequence of 104 bp. Seven substitutions (three transitions and four transversions) resulted in five observed alleles; three of these were common, the other two occurred in only one or two individuals (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0002">2</a>a). We were unable to place an unambiguous root on this network because two of the most divergent alleles observed in 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span> were also found in 
  <span class="italic">B. jamaicensis,</span> probably as a result of incomplete lineage sortin

  <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0001">1</a>; one of the estimates of Tajima's 
  <span class="italic">D</span> was significant, that for central Florida (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). Geographic variation at this locus was very modest; one of the three common alleles was present at most eastern localities, but absent in California; the other two common alleles were found everywhere. Our estimate of 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>st</sub> among populations with sample sizes greater than four was slightly negative and not statistically significant (Table

We obtained 228 sequences from 114 specimens from the 14 populations. We analyzed 377 recombination free bases and found eight transitions (no transversions) that resulted in eight alleles; five of these occurred at frequencies greater than 10% (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0002">2</a>b). The 
  <span class="italic">B. jamaicensis</span> outgroup rooted the network at a common, widespread allele. All populations sampled were quite variable (Table 
  <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0001">1</a>) with the exception of Ohio (sample size of two). None of the estimates of Tajima's 
  <span class="italic">D</span> was significant. Statistically significant interpopulation variation was found; the most common allele in the eastern portion of the range was not present in the California populations and neither was another common eastern allele. An allele present in both California samples at a frequency of 0.5 did not exceed a frequency of 0.25 in the east. Our overall estimate of 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>st</sub> for this locus was 0.05 (Table 
  <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0002">2</a>); between California and the East Coast, it was 0.22.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ND2 divergence exceeded that found in the two nuclear introns both between the California and eastern United States populations and among the eastern populations (Table 
  <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0002">2</a>). This is the expected pattern given the differences in effective population size between maternally inherited and autosomal loci (Irwin,
