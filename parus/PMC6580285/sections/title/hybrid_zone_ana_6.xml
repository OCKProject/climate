 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We modeled the ND2 differentiation of 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span> populations in the southeastern portion of its range using a binary hybrid zone analysis. For a geographic axis, we designated a theoretical transect as a straight line from Key Largo, Florida north‐northwest to Lakeland, Georgia and then west along the 31° line of latitude through Texas. Each specimen of 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span> from Florida, Louisiana, and Texas was identified as possessing either a “Florida peninsula” or a “common” ND2 haplotype. We then projected each of the assigned haplotypes perpendicularly from its approximate original geographical position onto that transect. In this way, we obtained an ND2 haplotype frequency by distance survey through the southeastern portion of the hawk's range (e.g., Barrowclough et al.,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crank (
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0017">1975</a>) showed that transient neutral diffusion is expected to result in a modified cumulative normal distribution that scales with the square root of the product of the diffusion coefficient (gene flow) and time since primary contact (e.g., Barrowclough et al., 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0007">2018</a>). In practice, hybrid zones and other clines are generally characterized by their maximum slope (May, Endler, &amp; McMurtrie, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0037">1975</a>) or their 20%‐80% width (Endler, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0023">1977</a>). We fit the distribution of ND2 haplotypes along our designated transect to a cumulative normal distribution using the logistic regression procedure in SAS (
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0057">1990</a>). The form of the fit was 
  <span class="italic">F</span>(
  <span class="italic">X</span>)
  <span class="italic"> = </span>Φ(
  <span class="italic">mX + b</span>) where Φ is the cumulative normal distribution, 
  <span class="italic">X</span> is the distance along the transect, and 
  <span class="italic">m</span> and 
  <span class="italic">b</span> are the maximum likelihood estimated parameters (slope and intercept). The center of the hybrid zone was estimated as 
  <span class="italic">b/m</span>, the maximum slope as 
  <span class="italic">m</span>/√(2π), and the 20%‐80% width as 
  <span class="italic">1.68/m</span>; those estimates come directly from the definition of a normal distribution.
