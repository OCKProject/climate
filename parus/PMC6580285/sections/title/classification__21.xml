 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The California population of this hawk was originally described as a distinct species, 
  <span class="italic">B. elegans</span> (Cassin, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0014">1855</a>). Our results indicate it is genetically divergent from the eastern ones on the basis of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Table 
  <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0002">2</a>). A previous survey of 21 microsatellite loci had demonstrated 100% discrimination between California and eastern populations (Hull et al., 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0031">2008</a>). The overall evidence suggests that not only is there no current gene flow between these regions but that there has not been any for a sufficient period of time to allow the California population to become monophyletic (e.g., Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0003">3</a>). It is expected to take approximately 2
  <span class="italic">N
   <sub>e</sub>
  </span> generations for neutral coalescence of mitochondrial genes to occur; the results of our coalescent analysis using the BPP program were consistent with that interpretation. The niche modeling indicates the period of isolation must have been well in excess of 20,000 years, that is, it must pre‐date the last glacial cycle, that is, 100,000 years. The ND2 sequences render the eastern and western populations 100% diagnosable. Morphologically, the Pacific Coast birds are also distinguishable on the basis of a much richer rufous coloration, particularly on the undersides; they also may be nearly 100% diagnosable on the basis of the number and size of tail bands (Crocoll, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0018">1994</a>; Johnson &amp; Peeters, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0035">1963</a>; Palmer, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0045">1988</a>; Pyle, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0052">2008</a>). 
  <span class="italic">B. eleg</span>ans clearly represents a phylogenetic species and is an appropriate taxon for phylogenetic and biogeographic investigation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Red‐shouldered hawks found in the central and southern portion of the Florida peninsula, described as 
  <span class="italic">B. l. extimus</span> by Bangs (
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0005">1920</a>), are substantially smaller than those to the north (e.g., James, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0033">1970</a>) and much paler in color (Wheeler, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0064">2018a</a>). Eighteen percent of the mtDNA variation was distributed between the peninsula and the rest of the eastern range of the bird. At present, there appears to be extensive introgression in the peninsula region, with a broad hybrid zone, but the ecological niche modeling suggests this is a postglacial phenomenon in a species with substantial dispersal ability. Advocates of the biological species concept will regard this taxon as a well‐differentiated subspecies (e.g., Dickinson &amp; Remsen, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0019">2013</a>). However, our opinion is that the Florida peninsula population has had a separate evolutionary history from that of the other eastern birds and consequently represents an appropriate unit for studies of diversification and historical biogeography; therefore, it represents a phylogenetic species. This would not be apparent were the taxon to be simply regarded as a subspecies in the 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span> complex. For example, Dickinson and Remsen (
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0019">2013</a>) recognize additional subspecies in that complex that cannot be historical units given that their current, largely latitudinal, ranges (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0001">1</a>) are at odds with the glacial history of eastern North America. Ranking 
  <span class="italic">B. extimus</span> as a subspecies of 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span> would result in treating historical entities and ahistorical classes as equivalents, thus resulting in a nonhierarchical classification, useless for historical investigation.
