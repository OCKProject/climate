 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We attempted to ascertain whether gene trees derived from our mitochondrial and nuclear loci might be consistent with more than a single species of red‐shouldered hawk under a coalescent process accounting for gene tree uncertainty, incomplete lineage sorting due to ancestral polymorphism, but no gene flow among populations (Yang &amp; Rannala, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0069">2010</a>). We used the Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography Program (BPP version 3.3: Yang, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0068">2015</a>) to obtain joint Bayesian estimates of species delimitation and species trees by treating the ND2 and two nuclear genes as freely recombining among, but with no recombination within, loci. We assigned ND2 one‐quarter the effective population size of the nuclear loci. We treated sequences from California and those from the eastern United States as a priori candidate species, with 
  <span class="italic">B. jamaicensis</span> sequences as a possible basal taxon.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the A01 MCMC algorithm (species delimitation with user‐defined guide tree) with adaptive adjustment during burn‐in of both priors and step length search parameters. Because the ages of the possible divergences (τ) and the ancestral effective population sizes (θ = 4μ
  <span class="italic">N
   <sub>e</sub>
  </span>) of these birds are poorly known, we used three sets of initial conditions for the runs. These were the following: large 
  <span class="italic">N
   <sub>e</sub>
  </span> and old divergence (θ and τ gamma‐distributed priors of 
  <span class="italic">G</span>(1,10) and 
  <span class="italic">G</span>(1,10), respectively), small 
  <span class="italic">N
   <sub>e</sub>
  </span> and recent divergence (priors of 
  <span class="italic">G</span>(2, 2000) and 
  <span class="italic">G</span>(2, 2000), respectively), and large 
  <span class="italic">N
   <sub>e</sub>
  </span> and recent divergence (priors of 
  <span class="italic">G</span>(1, 10) and 
  <span class="italic">G</span>(2, 2000), respectively). Runs with each set of priors were repeated twice, with different initial seeds; the MCMC chains included 200,000 steps of burn‐in with adaptive parameter estimation and adjustment, followed by estimation chains 200,000 steps in length sampled every 20 steps (10,000 estimation points).
