 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We attempted to obtain tissue samples of 
  <span class="italic">Buteo lineatus</span> from throughout its known breeding range (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0001">1</a>); all samples came from specimens cataloged in natural history museums, but many originally came from raptor rehabilitation centers (see Acknowledgments). We tried to obtain approximately ten unrelated individuals from within a relatively confined geographical region (up to several adjacent counties) to represent local populations. Along the Gulf Coast of the United States and in peninsula Florida, we used geographically denser sampling to investigate finer‚Äêscale spatial variation.
