 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found 2,764 museum specimen records or breeding bird atlas records for 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span> that possessed valid latitude/longitude data, given its known breeding season and range (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0003">3</a>a). We trained our ENM and evaluated predictive abilities based on those data and projected the model onto a larger area that included the Yucatan peninsula and the Caribbean islands. Projection to this larger area facilitated comparison of climate suitability between the current climate and the LGM. The ENM projection for current climatic conditions (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0003">3</a>a) thus shows 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span> suitability in areas where the species is not known to be present, perhaps because of competitive exclusion by some other large sit‐and‐wait predator (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">Rupornis magnirostris</span>). The ENM projected to the LGM (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0003">3</a>b) shows a considerable constriction in potential suitable habitat in the eastern United States compared with the current ENM projection. There was less change between predicted present and past suitable habitat in western North America, and there was no indication of potential LGM contact between the eastern and western portions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our ENM showed strong ability to predict the current observed localities, with AUC values &gt;0.92 and significant binomial tests (range of AUC values 0.29–0.938, omission error 0.03–0.1 at 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). Variables with the largest percentage contribution to the ENM were mean temperature of the warmest quarter (43%) and precipitation in the coldest quarter (38%).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The projection of the ENM for 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span> suggests there was a gap in suitable habitat along the Gulf Coast during the last glacial maximum (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0003">3</a>b), provided the niche of the hawk was conserved over evolutionary time (e.g., Peterson, Soberón, &amp; Sánchez‐Cordero, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0046">1999</a>). If ancestors of 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span> occupied the Florida peninsula and Texas Gulf Coast portions of the suitable habitat at that time, then those allopatric populations would have been free to differentiate in size, plumage, and various DNA markers during the period of isolation. Subsequent contact and hybridization of the formerly allopatric population segments would have occurred as climate ameliorated and the intervening habitat became suitable for occupation (Soltis et al., 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0059">2006</a>). Ecological niche modeling of other species of birds has also identified the Gulf Coast as a likely region of range disjunction at the LGM (e.g., Shipley et al., 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0058">2013</a>).
