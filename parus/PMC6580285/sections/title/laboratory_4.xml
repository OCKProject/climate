 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We amplified and sequenced both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences from the tissue samples. The laboratory work generally employed methods previously described (e.g., Barrowclough, Groth, Odom, &amp; Lai, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0008">2011</a>; Barrowclough et al., 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0007">2018</a>). We extracted total DNA from tissue samples using standard protocols; we used taq‐DNA polymerase and PCR methods to amplify the complete mitochondrial ND2 gene plus small fragments of the two flanking tRNAs using standard ND2 primers; the resulting products were isolated on agarose gels and reamplified as two overlapping fragments using internal primers. The fragments were sequenced in both directions using Sanger techniques, end‐labeled with fluorescent dye, and separated on an ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using similar techniques, we also sequenced two introns suggested to be useful for studies of avian phylogeography (Primmer, Borge, Lindell, &amp; Saetre, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0051">2002</a>). These were intron 11 of the G3PDH gene (chromosome 1 in 
  <span class="italic">Gallus</span>) and intron 5 of the TGFB2 gene (chromosome 3 in 
  <span class="italic">Gallus</span>). Both of these loci were amplified and sequenced as single fragments using primers located in the two flanking exons. We designed novel primers for the G3PDH intron: G3P11Fb (5'‐TTCCAGGTTGTCTCTYGTGACTTCA‐3') and G3P12Ra: (5'‐CTTGGATGCCATGTGGACC‐3'). The primers used to amplify TGFB2 were previously described (Primmer et al., 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0051">2002</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The G3PDH and TGFB2 introns are autosomal and therefore diploid in birds; consequently, we encountered many individuals having ambiguous sites due to heterozygous alleles. We phased these alternate alleles in individuals having two or more ambiguities by sequencing the product of allele‐specific PCR amplification. Primers were designed to amplify one of the two alternate alleles in an individual by matching only one of these at the 3' end of the primer for one of the two (i.e., 5'‐most or 3'‐most) most distal ambiguities; in addition, the penultimate 3' base of the phasing primer was purposely mismatched to both alleles so that the sequence of the allele‐specific primer mismatched one allele at two 3' bases, including the final one, whereas the other allele was mismatched only at a single, penultimate base. After one allele was determined by sequencing, the alternate allele was reconstructed by subtracting the sequenced allele from the original, heterozygous sequence.</p>
