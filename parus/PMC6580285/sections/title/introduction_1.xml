 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although generally congruent patterns are evident in the postglacial biogeography of Western Europe (Hewitt, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0028">2000</a>), this is less true of North America, particularly in birds (Zink, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0070">1997</a>). Patterns expected on the basis of palynological studies (Pielou, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0050">1991</a>) and other aspects of inferred Pleistocene history, such as the location of glacial refugia (Hubbard, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0030">1973</a>; Mengel, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0040">1964</a>; Remington, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0054">1968</a>) have not always been realized in subsequent phylogeographic investigations in this region (e.g., Bermingham, Rohwer, Freeman, &amp; Wood, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0011">1992</a>). One general result in eastern North America, though, has been the repeated discovery of genetic differentiation across Gulf Coast river systems and the Appalachian Mountain chain in many disparate taxa, including plants, invertebrates, and both aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates (Avise, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0003">2000</a>; Soltis, Morris, McLachlan, Manos, &amp; Soltis, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0059">2006</a>). These genetic divisions are proximal to Remington's (
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0054">1968</a>) Northern Florida Suture Zone, a proposed region of postglacial population convergence and interaction following dramatic landscape alteration during the Pleistocene (Emslie, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0022">1998</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the time of the Soltis' review, the sole avian exemplar of that Gulf Coast pattern was the Carolina chickadee (
  <span class="italic">Poecile carolinensis</span>: Gill, Slikas, &amp; Agro, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0025">1999</a>). An additional species was known with marked genetic divergence in that region, the seaside sparrow (
  <span class="italic">Ammospiza maritima</span>). It possesses an east–west, not north–south, pattern, but this species is associated with salt marshes, rather than with forested habitat (Avise &amp; Nelson, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0004">1989</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As Barrowclough, Groth, Bramlett, Lai, and Mauck (
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0007">2018</a>) pointed out, the Gulf Coast pattern of genetic differentiation subsequently has been found in additional nonmigratory birds resident in eastern deciduous forests. However, the pattern was not observed in either of two grassland‐associated species, the northern bobwhite (
  <span class="italic">Colinus virginianus</span>: Williford, DeYoung, Honeycutt, Brennan, &amp; Fernandez, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0066">2016</a>) and Bachman's sparrow (
  <span class="italic">Peucaea aestivalis</span>: Cerame, Cox, Brumfield, Tucker, &amp; Taylor, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0015">2014</a>), nor in an open‐country species, the wild turkey (
  <span class="italic">Meleagris gallopavo</span>: Mock, Theimer, Rhodes, Greenberg, &amp; Keim, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0041">2002</a>), or in a migratory species, the yellow‐throated warbler (
  <span class="italic">Setophaga dominica</span>: McKay, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0039">2009</a>), all of which were well‐sampled and are distributed throughout the Southeastern United States. Therefore, to further assess the importance of southeastern geographic features in avian differentiation during the Quaternary, it is apparent that nonmigratory, forest‐dwelling species are particularly appropriate for future investigation. One such species is the red‐shouldered hawk (
  <span class="italic">Buteo lineatus</span>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The red‐shouldered hawk is a generally common, sit‐and‐wait predator, especially associated with swamp and riparian habitats (Crocoll, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0018">1994</a>), with disjunct populations in eastern and western North America (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0001">1</a>). In the east, it ranges from Maine and the Canadian Maritimes south to the Florida Keys and west to Minnesota and southern Texas; in the western United States. It is found west of the Sierra Nevada and Cascades in California and southwestern Oregon. It is a woodland hunter and a year‐round resident where climate allows. In eastern North America, only the most northern populations are migratory; the West Coast populations are year‐round residents.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Five subspecies (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0001">1</a>) are presently recognized in two subspecies groups, four eastern taxa versus the populations on the West Coast (Dickinson &amp; Remsen, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0019">2013</a>). The latter taxon, 
  <span class="italic">B. l. elegans</span>, was originally described as a separate species (Cassin, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0014">1855</a>). Of the eastern subspecies, the Florida peninsula taxon, 
  <span class="italic">B. l. extimus</span>, is the most distinctive. A prior phylogeographic survey using a small piece of mtDNA and 21 microsatellites found substantial divergence between the eastern and western population segments (Hull et al., 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0031">2008</a>); however, most of the analysis was performed at the level of subspecies, rather than populations, potentially obscuring structure inconsistent with present taxonomy (Zink, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0071">2004</a>). In addition, the well‐marked Florida peninsula populations were not sampled.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated phylogeography and species limits in the red‐shouldered hawk using population sequences of the entire mitochondrial ND2 gene and two nuclear introns taken from throughout its range. In addition, we used a variety of methods, including niche modeling and coalescent species delimitation, to investigate the evolutionary history of the hawk. Finally, we initiated quantitative comparisons of avian hybridization patterns in the Northern Florida Suture Zone as a step toward a general assessment of its importance in avian diversification during the Last Glacial Maximum.</p>
