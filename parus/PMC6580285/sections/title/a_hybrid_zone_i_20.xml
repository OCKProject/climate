 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The discovery of genetic evidence for a zone of secondary contact in central Florida was surprising given prior taxonomic treatments of this hawk. For example, Mayr and Short (
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0038">1970</a>), in their systematic analysis of the North American avifauna, treated the southern Florida population as an uncomplicated, weakly to moderately differentiated subspecies, not posing any taxonomic concern at the species level. In part, the failure to recognize an important biogeographic signal resulted from a lack of quantification of the pattern of variation in plumage and size with geography. James (
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0033">1970</a>) suggested that wing length in this species (the Florida subspecies was originally based on size) was broadly clinal, but an examination of her Table 5 (i.e., p. 371) suggests it is actually quite steep, and possibly a step. Of course, with a few notable exceptions (e.g., Johnson, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0034">1980</a>; Rising, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0055">2001</a>), most species of birds have never been subjected to modern statistical analyses of geographical variation in size, shape, or plumage color (Zink &amp; Remsen, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0073">1986</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternative hypothesis to our suggestion of secondary contact in these hawks might be that this hybrid zone represents a case of primary divergence. However, several qualitative arguments suggest that is not the most parsimonious scenario. First, if the divergence did begin post‐LGM, then there has been less than 20,000 years to achieve a near fixation of a newly arisen haplotype in a large population. More saliently, plumage differences in the hawk populations are coincident with unlinked mitochondrial differences, as well as with the position of LGM refugia and the geographical patterns of multiple additional species (see below).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our estimate of the width of the hybrid zone is only approximate. We did obtain statistical convergence of estimates of the width and shape of the hybrid zone (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0004">4</a>). However, there were few samples to the immediate north of the estimated center of the zone; consequently, the width may be somewhat narrower than our estimate. Additional samples of these hawks from northern Florida and the Southeastern United States would improve our confidence in its width.
