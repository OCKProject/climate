 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assembled and edited sequences using SEQUENCHER software (Gene Codes). Mitochondrial sequences were trimmed of primer and flanking genes to provide complete ND2 sequences; the sequences were aligned by eye. We checked the sequences for quality by searching for indels, unexpected stop codons, heterogeneous base composition, and ambiguous sites.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the purposes of estimating several population genetic parameters, individuals were assigned to one of 14 population samples (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0001">1</a>). Standard genetic statistics were estimated for these populations using procedures previously described (e.g., Barrowclough et al.,

  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0007">2018</a>); these included Nei's (

  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0067">1969</a>). We used two ND2 sequences deposited in GenBank (

  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0060">2001</a>) to infer gene trees and a minimum length network for the unique haplotypes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The diploid G3PDH and TGFB2 sequences were also trimmed of primer and flanking exon sequence and aligned by eye. Individuals possessing two different alleles were phased, if necessary, as described above. The two alleles for each individual were assigned to the same 14 population samples used for the ND2 sequences and the same statistics computed. Possible recombination events were identified using a four‐gamete test, and sequences were trimmed to the largest sequence fragment consistent with no recombination. PAUP* was used to infer gene trees and minimum length networks for the unique alleles at each locus; in these analyses, we used the
