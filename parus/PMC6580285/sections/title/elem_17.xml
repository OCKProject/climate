  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found major genetic divergence between the California samples of red‐shouldered hawks and those from the eastern portion of the range, consistent with species‐level taxa in a Bayesian coalescent analysis. At the ND2 locus, there was no sharing of haplotypes (Figure 
   <a rid="ece35190-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0001">1</a>) and our estimate of 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>st</sub>, 0.65, indicates that two‐thirds of the genetic variance was distributed between the regions. For the two introns, the divergence was less, but there were salient differences in allelic frequencies between the regions and this was statistically significant for one of them (Table 
   <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0002">2</a>; Figure 
   <a rid="ece35190-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0002">2</a>), consistent with differences expected between mitochondrial and nuclear divergence based on differences in their respective coalescent times (e.g., Zink &amp; Barrowclough, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0072">2008</a>). For ND2, there was approximately an order of magnitude less nucleotide diversity in the California populations than in the eastern ones; there was also more variation in the east for both G3PDH and TGFB2. Those results are consistent with the major difference in range sizes of the two populations, presumably reflective of substantial differences in 
   <span class="italic">N
    <sub>e</sub>
   </span> and, as a consequence, genetic variation. The patterns are also consistent with no recent gene flow between the two portions of the range. At present, they are completely allopatric and the ENM results suggest they may have been so during recent glacial cycles (Figure 
   <a rid="ece35190-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0003">3</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genetic divergence between these eastern and western North America populations is not surprising; a previous microsatellite investigation had uncovered similar results (Hull et al., 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0031">2008</a>) and the birds show phenotypic differences in plumage (Wheeler, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0065">2018b</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic variation in eastern populations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The salient feature found among the eastern population samples was the presence of a clade of ND2 haplotypes at high frequency in the Florida peninsula, decreasing in frequency with distance to the north and west. Little genetic variation could be attributed to populations within regions (Table 
   <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0002">2</a>). Given the differences in plumage between the peninsula birds and those to the north, as well as our historical niche modeling and the well‐known pattern of biotic differentiation in this area, we interpret these ND2 results as the signature of a zone of secondary contact between populations isolated from one another until after the LGM.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A hybrid zone in peninsula Florida</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The discovery of genetic evidence for a zone of secondary contact in central Florida was surprising given prior taxonomic treatments of this hawk. For example, Mayr and Short (
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0038">1970</a>), in their systematic analysis of the North American avifauna, treated the southern Florida population as an uncomplicated, weakly to moderately differentiated subspecies, not posing any taxonomic concern at the species level. In part, the failure to recognize an important biogeographic signal resulted from a lack of quantification of the pattern of variation in plumage and size with geography. James (
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0033">1970</a>) suggested that wing length in this species (the Florida subspecies was originally based on size) was broadly clinal, but an examination of her Table 5 (i.e., p. 371) suggests it is actually quite steep, and possibly a step. Of course, with a few notable exceptions (e.g., Johnson, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0034">1980</a>; Rising, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0055">2001</a>), most species of birds have never been subjected to modern statistical analyses of geographical variation in size, shape, or plumage color (Zink &amp; Remsen, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0073">1986</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternative hypothesis to our suggestion of secondary contact in these hawks might be that this hybrid zone represents a case of primary divergence. However, several qualitative arguments suggest that is not the most parsimonious scenario. First, if the divergence did begin post‐LGM, then there has been less than 20,000 years to achieve a near fixation of a newly arisen haplotype in a large population. More saliently, plumage differences in the hawk populations are coincident with unlinked mitochondrial differences, as well as with the position of LGM refugia and the geographical patterns of multiple additional species (see below).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our estimate of the width of the hybrid zone is only approximate. We did obtain statistical convergence of estimates of the width and shape of the hybrid zone (Figure 
   <a rid="ece35190-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0004">4</a>). However, there were few samples to the immediate north of the estimated center of the zone; consequently, the width may be somewhat narrower than our estimate. Additional samples of these hawks from northern Florida and the Southeastern United States would improve our confidence in its width.

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The California population of this hawk was originally described as a distinct species, 
   <span class="italic">B. elegans</span> (Cassin, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0014">1855</a>). Our results indicate it is genetically divergent from the eastern ones on the basis of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Table 
   <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0002">2</a>). A previous survey of 21 microsatellite loci had demonstrated 100% discrimination between California and eastern populations (Hull et al., 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0031">2008</a>). The overall evidence suggests that not only is there no current gene flow between these regions but that there has not been any for a sufficient period of time to allow the California population to become monophyletic (e.g., Figure 
   <a rid="ece35190-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0003">3</a>). It is expected to take approximately 2
   <span class="italic">N
    <sub>e</sub>
   </span> generations for neutral coalescence of mitochondrial genes to occur; the results of our coalescent analysis using the BPP program were consistent with that interpretation. The niche modeling indicates the period of isolation must have been well in excess of 20,000 years, that is, it must pre‐date the last glacial cycle, that is, 100,000 years. The ND2 sequences render the eastern and western populations 100% diagnosable. Morphologically, the Pacific Coast birds are also distinguishable on the basis of a much richer rufous coloration, particularly on the undersides; they also may be nearly 100% diagnosable on the basis of the number and size of tail bands (Crocoll, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0018">1994</a>; Johnson &amp; Peeters, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0035">1963</a>; Palmer, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0045">1988</a>; Pyle, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0052">2008</a>). 
   <span class="italic">B. eleg</span>ans clearly represents a phylogenetic species and is an appropriate taxon for phylogenetic and biogeographic investigation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Red‐shouldered hawks found in the central and southern portion of the Florida peninsula, described as 
   <span class="italic">B. l. extimus</span> by Bangs (
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0005">1920</a>), are substantially smaller than those to the north (e.g., James, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0033">1970</a>) and much paler in color (Wheeler, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0064">2018a</a>). Eighteen percent of the mtDNA variation was distributed between the peninsula and the rest of the eastern range of the bird. At present, there appears to be extensive introgression in the peninsula region, with a broad hybrid zone, but the ecological niche modeling suggests this is a postglacial phenomenon in a species with substantial dispersal ability. Advocates of the biological species concept will regard this taxon as a well‐differentiated subspecies (e.g., Dickinson &amp; Remsen, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0019">2013</a>). However, our opinion is that the Florida peninsula population has had a separate evolutionary history from that of the other eastern birds and consequently represents an appropriate unit for studies of diversification and historical biogeography; therefore, it represents a phylogenetic species. This would not be apparent were the taxon to be simply regarded as a subspecies in the 
   <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span> complex. For example, Dickinson and Remsen (
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0019">2013</a>) recognize additional subspecies in that complex that cannot be historical units given that their current, largely latitudinal, ranges (Figure 
   <a rid="ece35190-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0001">1</a>) are at odds with the glacial history of eastern North America. Ranking 
   <span class="italic">B. extimus</span> as a subspecies of 
   <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span> would result in treating historical entities and ahistorical classes as equivalents, thus resulting in a nonhierarchical classification, useless for historical investigation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparative avian phylogeography in the Southeastern United States</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four avian taxa have now been identified showing mtDNA divergence with hybridization on the Florida peninsula or along the Gulf Coast of the southern United States. This is a region identified as a suture zone, on the basis of external morphology of many organisms (Remington, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0054">1968</a>). Three of those four hybrid zones, all except that of the Carolina chickadee, are centered within the geographical limits of Remington's original description of the zone. A survey of molecular studies (Soltis et al., 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0059">2006</a>) showed that a wide variety of organisms are genetically divergent in the same region. The four avian zones differ in degree of morphological and mtDNA divergence, position of the center, and width of the zone (Table 
   <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0003">3</a>, Figure 
   <a rid="ece35190-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0005">5</a>). However, these may not necessarily represent responses to differing ultimate causes; for example, three Pleistocene refugia in southern Europe have led to multiple patterns of range expansion and subsequent hybridization (Hewitt, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0027">1999</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of interest is whether these four avian zones represent patterns resulting from a single temporal biogeographic event. This would appear to be unlikely; the extent of mtDNA divergence, often thought to be a surrogate for time, differed by more than an order of magnitude among the species pairs. That suggests that some of the taxa, particularly 
   <span class="italic">P. carolinensis</span>, may have differentiated through repeated isolation events over multiple glacial cycles; Soltis et al. (
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0059">2006</a>) indicated that scenario might be a general phenomenon.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Secondly, the centers of the zones differ substantially in geographical position. The 
   <span class="italic">Poecile</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Strix</span> cases would appear to correspond to the Tombigbee and Apalachicola discontinuities of Soltis et al. (
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0059">2006</a>). Barton (
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0009">1979</a>) and Barton and Hewitt (
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0010">1985</a>) pointed out that hybrid zones are attracted to physical barriers and density troughs such as those presented by wide rivers. The 
   <span class="italic">Melanerpes</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Buteo</span> zones centered on the Florida peninsula seem to be exemplars of the southern edge of the canonical Northern Florida Suture Zone. Remington (
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0054">1968</a>) suggested the zone represented the position of initial contact for many previously allopatric species pairs. In an important synthesis of phylogeographic patterns found in turtles of this same region, Walker and Avise (
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0063">1998</a>) discovered exemplars of each of the geographic patterns we observed in the four birds.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the widths of the four hybrid zones vary by a factor in excess of six. The widths of neutral hybrid zones are expected to scale with dispersal (gene flow) distance and the square root of time since secondary contact (Endler, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0023">1977</a>). The latter is likely similar for these species. However, dispersal distances vary greatly among the species pairs, and the hybrid zone widths scatter reasonably well with those estimates (Figure 
   <a rid="ece35190-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0006">6</a>). For hybrid zones maintained by a balance between dispersal and selection, the widths should scale with the inverse square root of selection intensity (Barton &amp; Hewitt, 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0010">1985</a>). In these four cases, widths scale poorly with phenotypic differences (e.g., sexual selection) and only weakly with genetic divergence (Figure 
   <a rid="ece35190-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0006">6</a>, Table 
   <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0003">3</a>), possible correlates of general selective divergence. Thus, it appears that these avian zones have been in isolation for varying numbers of glacial cycles and that their current positions and widths reflect their idiosyncratic dispersal propensities. Further insight will require denser geographical sampling, extensive nuclear sequencing, and examination of additional species pairs.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, these four avian cases, along with numerous examples from plants and other animals (Soltis et al., 
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0059">2006</a>), suggest there may be additional, cryptic divergence waiting to be discovered in the avifauna of the Southeastern United States. Interestingly, Remington (
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0054">1968</a>) and later Newton (
   <a rid="ece35190-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0044">2003</a>), suggested six species of birds as candidates for differentiation in the Northern Florida Suture Zone. Three of those (northern bobwhite, wild turkey, and Bachman's sparrow) have now been surveyed using phylogeographic methods, and none were found to possess significant mitochondrial differentiation. Thus, it appears that predicting which avian taxa might be involved is not transparent. Nevertheless, species that are permanent residents or only partially migratory would seem to be particularly appropriate candidates for further investigation.
