 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Barred owls (
  <span class="italic">Strix varia</span>), red‐bellied woodpeckers (
  <span class="italic">Melanerpes carolinus</span>), and Carolina chickadees (
  <span class="italic">Poecile carolinensis</span>) have geographic distributions in the Southeastern United States similar to that of 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span>. In addition, they all show patterns of southeast‐northwest genetic divergence that might be signatures of historical events common to all four species. Ecological niche modeling was not reported in those studies; however, all three are common residents of eastern deciduous forest where they are sympatric with the hawk. It seems probable that they possessed similar LGM geographical distributions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unfortunately, varying mitochondrial loci had been used in the original studies of these species. In order to have a common scale of differentiation, we sequenced exemplars of eastern and western individuals of 
  <span class="italic">S. varia</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. carolinensis</span> for the ND2 gene to compare with our new results for 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span>, and with the previously published results for 
  <span class="italic">M. carolinus</span>. In both cases, the tissues we sequenced were drawn from individuals used in the original studies. The new sequences have been deposited in GenBank (
  <span ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="MK495851" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">MK495851</span>‐
  <span ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="MK495854" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">MK495854</span>); the percent sequence divergence for 1,041 bp of ND2 for all four pairs of taxa is shown in Table 
  <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0003">3</a>. The divergence in 
  <span class="italic">P. carolinensis</span> was an order of magnitude greater than that in the other three species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to compare the geographical patterns of differentiation among the four species, we analyzed the zones of divergence in 
  <span class="italic">S. varia</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. carolinensis</span> using the same approach we described above for 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span>, and which had previously been employed in a study of 
  <span class="italic">M. carolinus</span>. In the case of 
  <span class="italic">S. varia</span>, we used the mitochondrial control region haplotype frequencies reported for Florida, Louisiana, and Texas (Barrowclough et al., 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0008">2011</a>) and projected them onto the same transect used for 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span>. The probit fit to a cumulative normal indicated a narrower, steeper hybrid zone than that for 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span>, with an approximate center near the Apalachicola River in the Florida panhandle (Table 
  <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0003">3</a>). For 
  <span class="italic">P. carolinensis</span>, we used reported frequencies of mitochondrial restriction sites from Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas (Gill et al., 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0025">1999</a>, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0026">2005</a>), projected onto the 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span> transect, with a similar probit analysis. The results indicated a very narrow, steep transition with a center just west of the Tombigbee River in Mobile Co., Alabama (Table 
  <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0003">3</a>). For 
  <span class="italic">M. carolinus</span>, the hybrid zone was narrower than that of 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span>, but with a center just 54 km north of that of the latter. A comparison of the geography of the zones for the four species is shown in Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0005">5</a>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The estimated widths of the four hybrid zones differed by a factor of approximately 6.6. For neutral introgression, zone width is expected to scale with the magnitude of gene flow and the square root of time since initial contact (Crank, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0017">1975</a>; Endler, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0023">1977</a>). If the four species were all responding to habitat change associated only with the end of the last glacial cycle, then time would be approximately the same for the species. However, the species differ dramatically in their size, life history, and ecology; consequently, they might be expected to differ in the extent of their natal dispersal (gene flow). We found two studies of natal dispersal in 
  <span class="italic">B. lineatus</span> that reported the standard error of mean dispersal distance and sample size for a total of three populations (Bloom, Scott, Papp, Thomas, &amp; Kidd, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0012">2011</a>; Dykstra et al., 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0020">2004</a>); these yielded estimates of root‐mean‐square natal dispersal distances of 22.9, 112.4, and 185.6 km; we used the median in further analyses. For 
  <span class="italic">S. varia</span>, Livezey (
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0036">2009</a>) analyzed some band recovery data consistent with a root‐mean‐square total dispersal distance of 69 km. Cox and Kessler (
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0016">2012</a>) reported radio‐tracking natal dispersal data for 
  <span class="italic">M. carolinus</span> equivalent to a gene flow distance of approximately 2 km. We were unable to locate any detailed dispersal studies providing the requisite dispersal data for 
  <span class="italic">P. carolinensis</span>; the birds of North America account provides anecdotal distances of 1, 4, and 8 km (Mostrum, Curry, &amp; Lohr, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0042">2002</a>); these are roughly consistent with estimates from populations of the closely related 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (e.g., Barrowclough, 
  <a rid="ece35190-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35190-bib-0006">1980</a>); we used the median in a correlation analysis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We scattered our four estimates of hybrid zone width against both the estimates of dispersal distances and the estimates of ND2 divergence (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35190-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35190-fig-0006">6</a>). Hybrid zone width scaled positively with the estimates of dispersal distance; the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient was 0.97. The hybrid zone width scaled weakly negative with ND2 divergence; the correlation coefficient was −0.70.
