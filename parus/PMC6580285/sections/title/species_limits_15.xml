 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used sequences of the mitochondrial ND2 gene, along with those of the two nuclear introns, to investigate consistency of gene trees inferred from the three loci with species status of eastern and western red‚Äêshouldered hawks, based on a Bayesian coalescent analysis. The BPP analyses, using three differing sets of initial estimates of divergence time and effective population size, each replicated twice with differing initial seeds, and with adaptive adjustment of the MCMC step length, all resulted in posterior probabilities of 1.0 for separate species status of western and eastern populations. No attempt was made to assay the status of the Florida populations because the BPP program does not accommodate hybridization or continuing gene flow (Yang,
