 <p>We thank Chris Raithel (Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management), Dana Simón (Texas Wildlife Rehabilitator), the Florida Audubon Center for Birds of Prey (Diana Flynt), the New Jersey Raptor Trust (Len Soucy), and the Shasta Wildlife Rescue (James Miller) for providing salvaged hawks for this and other research. The Burke Museum at the University of Washington (Sharon Birks), the Cleveland Museum of Natural History (Andy Jones), the Field Museum of Natural History (Dave Willard and John Bates), the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Sciences (Robb Brumfield and Donna Dittman), the North Carolina State Museum (John Gerwin), and San Diego State University (Kevin Burns) provided tissues samples from red‐shouldered hawks in their collections; we are grateful to them all. Peter Capainolo (American Museum of Natural History) cheerfully prepared many specimens of these hawks donated by raptor rehab centers. The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (Nate Rice) provided tissue samples of Carolina chickadees for comparative purposes. The editors and two anonymous reviewers offered helpful comments on an earlier version of this manuscript. We thank Dolores Albertuzzi for providing the photograph of an adult red‐shouldered hawk. This research received support from the L. J. Sanford Trust, the Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics, the Ambrose‐Monell Molecular Laboratory, and the Cullman Program for Molecular Systematics.</p>
