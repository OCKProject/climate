 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic variation in eastern populations</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The salient feature found among the eastern population samples was the presence of a clade of ND2 haplotypes at high frequency in the Florida peninsula, decreasing in frequency with distance to the north and west. Little genetic variation could be attributed to populations within regions (Table 
  <a rid="ece35190-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece35190-tbl-0002">2</a>). Given the differences in plumage between the peninsula birds and those to the north, as well as our historical niche modeling and the well‚Äêknown pattern of biotic differentiation in this area, we interpret these ND2 results as the signature of a zone of secondary contact between populations isolated from one another until after the LGM.
