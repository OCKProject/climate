  <p>Association between nest type and climatic variables. Species with open nests are distributed in areas with similar (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) minimum temperatures and (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) maximum radiation levels across their range as species with closed nests. Species with open nests have (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) significantly larger ranges (log
   <sub>10</sub> 11,000 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> cells) and (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) significantly broader niches than species of Australian passerines with domed nests. Black points represent raw data and coloured points represent the average for each group (*P &lt; 0.05, Table
