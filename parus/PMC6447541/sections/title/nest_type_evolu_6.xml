 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore whether general nest type (domed or cup) is related to environmental variables, information on nest type for continental Australian passerines was extracted from Price and Griffith
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span> (38 families, cup = 181 species, domed = 96 species). Cavity nesters (n = 15) were excluded from the analyses because they were too few to include as a separate category and at the same time different enough from domed nesters to prevent inclusion in the same category. The remaining 277 species were selected on the basis that they all breed in continental Australia, that are not introduced, that they have available information on distribution and that the majority of their breeding range is in the continent (list of excluded species in supplementary data file). For each of these species I downloaded 1000 random records from the Atlas of Living Australia repository (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ala.org.au" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ala.org.au</span>) and then for each location I extracted six environmental variables. Some species didn’t have 1000 records available, so for these the maximum number of records available was extracted (mean number of records ± s.d., 973 ± 134, Supplementary Material Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). Records were manually filtered to keep only those from continental Australia and Tasmania. The climatic variables extracted were chosen to describe two different aspects of the environment of each species during the warmest and most productive months of the year (December-February), when they are likely to be breeding in Australia
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>: radiation levels (radiation in warmest quarter, wettest quarter and annual mean radiation) and temperature (temperature in warmest quarter, wettest quarter and annual mean temperature). The roof in domed nests is suggested to have evolved to 1. protect eggs from high radiation levels and temperatures in hot and arid environments or 2. to protect eggs and nestlings from the cold. Thus, what could potentially lead to the evolution of domed nests is the maximum radiation a species can tolerate or the minimum temperature (i.e. domed nests evolving in species that experience high radiation levels or colder environments). The highest probability distribution (HPD) was calculated for each variable across the 1000 records per species, and using the HPDinterval function in the ‘coda’ package I extracted 95% HPD intervals
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. These intervals don’t assume normal or unimodal distributions and consider the posterior distribution of the variable, which is probably a more accurate representation of the environment of the species. For temperature I extracted the lower interval (i.e. the lowest temperature across the records in the 95% interval) and the upper interval for radiation (i.e. the highest radiation in the 95% interval).
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each of the six environmental variables extracted the standard deviation across records was calculated (as a measure of climatic niche breadth or environmental variation across the range of each species). All variables describing either radiation or temperature were used in two PCAs (Principal Component Analysis) to extract an axis that summarises variation in either radiation levels or temperatures across the range. I also used all the variables that measure standard deviation across records and extracted a principal component (PC) that described the ‘climatic niche breadth’ of each species. I only used the first PC from each analysis because PC1 explained more than 70% of the variation in each case (Supplementary Material Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). Therefore, after this process, each species had a value for three PCs that described maximum radiation levels across the species range, lowest temperature across the range, and a value of environmental variation (climatic niche breadth). In addition to the variables described above, I also collated information on range size (in thousands of km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) from published datasets
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>, which as expected, was highly correlated to the niche breadth measure (r
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001).
