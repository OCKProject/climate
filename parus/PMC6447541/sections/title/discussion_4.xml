 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nests are part of the extended phenotype of birds that have a great impact on the fitness of the individuals and are considered an innovation that has allowed the spread of passerines in the world
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. Contrary to what has been previously proposed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, temperature across the range could not predict the type of nests (domed or open) in Australian passerines. I also found no evidence that species with domed nests were more likely to live in environments with higher radiation. This result contrasts with Englert Duursma 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> finding of species with closed nests being more common in arid regions (discussed below). Recently, Price and Griffith (2017) found that the most likely ancestral nest type in passerines is a domed nest
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>, and that there were multiple transitions from enclosed to open nests in the evolution of perching birds. This previous finding, combined with the results presented here, suggests that temperature or radiation regimes may not be responsible for the repeated transition from closed to open nests in passerines. While my results suggest there is no particular environment associated with any given nest shape in Australia, environmental variability could be key in nest evolution. Species that have open nests are distributed in significantly broader environmental niches (e.g. there is higher environmental variation across their distribution) and also have larger ranges. This result could be counterintuitive, because if enclosed nests serve to protect birds against adverse environmental conditions, then these species would be expected to have wider ranges than species with open nests. However, the present findings fit well with the idea that domed nests could be more specialized than open nests.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Different hypotheses have been suggested to explain why domed or open nests have evolved in passerines. One of these is predation, and Hall 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> showed evidence that domed nests in Timaliidae have evolved in ground nesting species, where predation risk is likely to be higher. However, more recently, Martin 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> showed in a broader analysis that there is no association between nest type and nest predation. Martin 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> and previous authors
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span> have proposed that the thermal properties of a nest are important drivers of nest architecture. Species in colder environments may need better insulation for eggs and nestlings, and hence domed nests should be favoured in these climates. In fact, within species, studies have shown morphological variation in nest type in response to temperature (although these changes do not involve variation between cup and domed nests)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. Another hypothesis is that domed nests offer protection from high radiation in arid environments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, but the present results show that species with open and closed nests have overall similar radiation levels across their ranges. Australia has had the same general climatic pattern since the early Miocene (~23 mya) with warmer and more arid central zones and rainforests in northern and eastern coasts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>, so it is unlikely that this could explain the absence of pattern in the analyses reported. A recent study found that a higher proportion of species with domed nests are found in areas with high aridity in Australia
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. This may seem contrary to what found here, but the analyses performed and questions approached were different. For instance, in Englert Duursma’s study the unit of analysis was spatial (not the species) and the response variable was the proportion of species with domed nests in each species assemblage. They used a method (SAR, spatial autoregressive model) that took into account the spatial autocorrelation between sampled points in gridcells of 100 × 100 km. Hence, their study indicates that the proportion of domed nests in arid areas is higher, but not necessarily that species with domed nests have independently and repeatedly appeared in areas with higher radiation. The temporal and spatial scale of the current study and Englert-Duursma’s study is different. Both studies in combination suggest that there are no phylogenetically independent associations between having a closed nest and living in arid environments, but closed nests are more prevalent in these environments. This could be explained by historical factors (i.e. closely related species living in similarly arid environments) and by the fact that species with closed nests could have overlapping climatic distributions with open nest species but be more specialized (discussion below in detail).
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Worldwide, open nests are more common than closed nests and 71% of the passerine families in the world have open nests
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. Moreover, many of the passerine lineages with open nests have relatively more species than sister lineages with domed nests, implying an evolutionary advantage in open nests
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. My results show that species in Australia with open nests have larger ranges with a broader range of climatic conditions. Australia has a very high proportion of species with domed nests compared to other regions, and also contains a large proportion of the Passerine families in the world and hosted the early radiation of these
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Because of the high proportion of domed nests in Australia, it is likely that the patterns found here are a good representation of what occurs across all passerines.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several scenarios could link the widespread phylogenetic distribution of open nests with wider ranges. First, open nests might increase a species’ capacity to live in a broader range of environmental conditions, which may have led to an adaptive advantage and hence more species with open nests. In fact, it has been shown in birds that the expansion of a species’ niche promotes diversification
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. Alternatively, it is also possible that the association between having an open nest type and living in broader niches and larger ranges may not be causal (and open nests may not allow establishment in broader niches 
  <span class="italic">per se</span>), but the association found here could rather be a correlation driven by a currently unknown variable. For example, building nests can be an energetically demanding activity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span> and building a platform of twigs may require less material and less weaving than building a domed nest. Building an open nest may free time and resources for other activities, indirectly affecting the possibility of dispersal and divergence. Many species of birds re-use nests and the number of nests a male can build is a sexually selected trait in several species, suggesting that nest building is energetically costly and time consuming
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another idea that can explain the results reported here is that open nests might not offer any benefit but rather that domed nests constrain dispersal in passerines. Domed nests could be well adapted for arid regions as suggested by Englert Duursma, 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, but may not perform well in other environments. In fact, in the present dataset 12.6% of the species with domed nests were under a threat category according to the IUCN (data extracted from Delhey 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>), while this percentage was only 2.8% for species with open nests. Closed nests may represent a specialization to arid environments that hinders the dispersal and divergence of the species. On the other hand, the higher percentage of threatened species with closed nests could just reflect that species in arid environments are more likely to be threatened. In any case, the mechanisms behind the link between nest structure, environmental flexibility, and diversification, need to be further explored.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis within honeyeaters and allies (Meliphagoidea) further confirmed what previous broader studies have found
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>, and shows that various aspects of nest structure are relatively conserved within families, as seen in the four clusters in the ordination, which roughly represent the families studied (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). This analysis also supports broadly what was recently found by Fang 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>, where it was suggested that different nest traits evolve independently and asynchronously. Fang 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span> found no association between structure and attachment method, and similarly, I found that both open and closed nests can be either suspended or supported from below. However, the ordination analysis also revealed strong associations between some traits. Nests that are suspended tend to be more elongated vertically (e.g. pouch like) than nests that are supported on branches or on a surface. Also, nests that are closed are more likely to have more materials (e.g. include feathers and not only vegetable material) than open nests.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most likely ancestral type of nest in the Meliphagoidea was a domed nest, supported by a substrate, globular, and built relatively low (around 1 m over the ground, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). In general, this structure was probably similar to the type of nest in fairy-wrens (Maluridae), but less elongated. Size proved to be an important variable predicting nest structure, with large species having supported instead of suspended nests and building nests higher up. This is probably expected, given that the amount and strength of material required to support larger nestlings would be higher and probably unfeasible in suspended nests
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. It is likely that this could also be influenced not only by the nestling body size, but also by the size of the brood
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. These findings also mean that we can roughly predict the nest morphology of a species based on their size: in Meliphagoidea (and possibly other passerines), larger species are more likely to have shallower nests supported by a surface. Previous studies have found a link between body size and having open nests
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> and this trend was visible in the present dataset (see results) suggesting this association could exist across passerines but we need further research to confirm this. Similarly to the broad analysis on Australian passerines, the analyses on Meliphagoidea showed no evidence of association between nest and environment, and different nest structures were not linked with particular environments.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nests are part of the extended phenotype of a species, and although to date there is a huge amount of information, there are still many questions surrounding the evolution of the variation in nest types we currently observe. The findings reported in this study help understand better the evolution of nest structure in passerines. Overall, the results presented here, in combination with previous findings, suggest that closed nests may constitute a type of specialization in passerines. I propose that open nests may offer more environmental flexibility, potentially affecting dispersal and colonization abilities and ultimately diversification rates in birds. One future way of testing this idea would be to study the nest type of those species that are more likely to colonize and establish in new environments such as islands or explore the nest type of species that have extended further their distributions in the recent years due to climate change. The two different datasets used in this study show that there are no phylogenetically independent associations between environmental variables and nest structure traits, but perhaps more detailed studies that take into account both phylogenetic relationships and spatial correlations could explore this link in a larger range of species. Also, by scoring different traits that describe the structure of a nest we might be able to understand in more detail how this complex structure has evolved in different lineages. Body size proved to be an important trait affecting nest elongation and attachment type. This ‘multi-dimensional trait’ framework could be adopted in future studies of nest evolution to understand in depth how selection drives different components of this complex phenotypic trait.</p>
