 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether environmental variables could explain the type of nest shape (domed vs. open) that Australian passerines construct, I built a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) using the R package MCMCglmm
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>, which controls for phylogenetic non-independence by incorporating phylogenetic relationships as a random factor. The response variable in this model was a binary variable (nest type: domed or cup), and a categorical family model was used. The predictors were the PC1 of maximum radiation, the PC1 of minimum temperature and log
  <sub>10</sub> body weight. The variance inflation factor (VIF) for this model was below 2, suggesting there are no collinearity issues in the model. To test whether nest type can predict the range size or the niche breadth of a species, I run a mixed model as described above but from a gaussian family, using either log
  <sub>10</sub> range size or niche breadth PC1 as response variables and log
  <sub>10</sub> body weight and nest type as predictor variables, given that body size can potentially explain variation in the range size and distribution of a species

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phylogenetic uncertainty was taken into account by running the models described above in 1000 different phylogenies obtained from birdtree.org using the Hackett backbone
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>, which belong to a posterior sample of possible phylogenetic hypotheses. I followed the procedure described by Ross 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span> and sampled, without replacement, one tree from the 1300 trees and cycled through each of these, running the MCMC mixed model for 3000 iterations and saving the results of the last MCMC sample before continuing on another tree. The runs from the first 300 trees were discarded as burn-in, ending with a posterior sample of 1,000 saved iterations. For each model I report the 95% credible interval for the estimate across 1000 trees for each predictor, and the P-value. I evaluated model convergence visually by using the command plot(model) in the package and made sure that all effective sample sizes were at least 900. All models were run using both default priors and a χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> prior distribution for the binary model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span> and, following Nakagawa, 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>, a non-informative prior for the gaussian models. Results using different priors were qualitatively identical, and the Gelman-Rubin criteria showed that analyses with different priors – and the same analyses run repeated times – converged in the same posterior distributions (details given in the supplementary material, Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>).

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand in detail the evolution of nest shape within the clade of honeyeaters and allies, the same procedure described above was used, but sampling trees from the posterior distribution of the most recent phylogenetic analysis on Meliphagoidea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. A model was built to test whether morphological or environmental variables can explain nest architecture. Therefore, the predictor variables were the logarithm of the size of the bird species, the logarithm of the height of the nest and the environmental PC1. The response variable was each of the two ordination axes that describe nest shape. The first axis (x) was log-transformed (log
  <sub>10</sub> x + 0.5) to increase normality of the residuals. Results remain qualitatively identical with or without using the log-transformed variable. Results of all models described above were confirmed using different methods (e.g. PGLS, Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>).
