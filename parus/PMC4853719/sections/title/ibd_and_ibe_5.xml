 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The structural equation modelling (SEM) and multiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR) analyses both revealed significant effects of IBD and IBE on neutral (non-outlier) AFLP divergence (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>) in this species. In both analyses, IBD explained more of the variation in genetic differentiation than IBE (SEM: ≈2 times as much; MMRR: ≈1.25 times as much; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t3" href="#t3">Table 3</a>). SEM identified significant pairwise relationships among environmental distance, geographic distance, and genetic distance (
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt; 0.01) and estimated that IBD (β
  <sub>D</sub> = 0.360 ± 0.037) contributed about twice as much as IBE (β
  <sub>E</sub> = 0.181 ± 0.151) to genetic distance. Similarly, MMRR also estimated the contribution of IBD (β
  <sub>D</sub> = 0.307, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt; 0.001) to be larger than that of IBE (β
  <sub>E</sub> = 0.247, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.002). Each analysis detected low levels of covariation between geographical and environmental distance (0.133 ± 0.028 in SEM and 0.488 in MMRR), although the covariation based on the MMRR analysis was approaching the reliability limit of 0.5 (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t3" href="#t3">Table 3</a>). The difference between these estimates from each analysis is due to the different environmental distance matrices used, estimated as Euclidian distances among all observed environmental variables in MMRR and as a latent variable constructed from the observed environmental variables in SEM.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the SEM analysis, we also quantified the contributions of the individual environmental variables to the composition of the environmental dissimilarity latent variable (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S7</a>). The results revealed that 
  <span class="sc">bio</span>4 (temperature seasonality) and 
  <span class="sc">bio</span>7 (temperature annual range) were the primary contributors, followed by 
  <span class="sc">bio</span>1 (annual mean temperature), 
  <span class="sc">bio</span>5 (max temperature of warmest month), 
  <span class="sc">bio</span>9 (mean temperature of driest quarter), and 
  <span class="sc">bio</span>15 (precipitation seasonality). By contrast, slope, soil, and 
  <span class="sc">bio</span>12 (annual precipitation) had very minor contributions.
