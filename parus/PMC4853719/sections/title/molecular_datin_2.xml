The onset of lineage diversification was estimated as 3.42 Ma (Northern lineage, 95% HPD: 0.99–6.40 Ma; node 4) and 3.64 Ma (Southern lineage, 95% HPD: 1.18–6.42 Ma; node 3). For this cpDNA-IGS chronogram, we recovered an average substitution rate of 6.225 × 10
  <span class="sup">−10</span> s/s/y by the 
  <span class="sc">beast</span> analysis, which is much lower than the average values generally reported for noncoding regions of the chloroplast genome (e.g. 1.2–1.7 × 10
