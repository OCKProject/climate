 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using 
  <span class="sc">fdist</span>, 67 of 457 loci (14.66%) showed high probability (99.5%) for divergent selection among the nine 
  <span class="sc">baps</span> groups, including 21 loci under directional selection and 46 loci under balancing selection (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5A</a>). Additionally, we identified 16 outlier loci in 
  <span class="sc">bayescan</span> (3.50% of all 457 loci; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5B</a>). However, only six loci were identified by both 
  <span class="sc">fdist</span> and 
  <span class="sc">bayescan</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5</a>). Eventually, four potential loci under selection (L128, L144, L294, and L305) were confirmed by the MLR analysis with

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S8</a>). When we ran linear regressions using each environmental variable individually, all six loci were significantly (
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt; 0.05) associated with at least two of the eight selected environmental variables (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S7</a>). Among the environmental variables, 
  <span class="sc">bio</span>2 (mean diurnal temperature range), 
  <span class="sc">bio</span>4 (temperature seasonality), 
  <span class="sc">bio</span>5 (maximum temperature of the warmest month), 
  <span class="sc">bio</span>12 (annual precipitation) and 
  <span class="sc">bio15</span> (precipitation seasonality) were most highly associated with the potential loci under selection.
