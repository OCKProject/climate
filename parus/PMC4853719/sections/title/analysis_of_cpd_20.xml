  <span class="bold">(A)</span> Geographical distribution of haplotypes across 38 sampled populations. Pie charts represent haplotype proportions. Colored haplotypes are shared by two or more populations, and blank ones are private haplotypes. Population groups identified by SAMOVA for 
  <span class="italic">K</span> = 4 are delimited by red dotted lines. 
  <span class="bold">(B)</span> Fifty percent majority-rule consensus tree of the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Numbers on branches are Bayesian posterior probabilities. 
  <span class="bold">(C)</span> Statistical parsimony network of cpDNA haplotypes. Lines represent single nucleotide substitutions, and the small black dots indicate missing haplotypes (extinct or not found). The sizes of circles are approximately proportional to sample size (
  <span class="italic">n</span>), with the smallest circles representing
