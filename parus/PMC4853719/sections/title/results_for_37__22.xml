  <span class="bold">(A)</span> Histogram of the 
  <span class="sc">baps</span> assignment test for 37 populations (394 individuals) (
  <span class="italic">K</span> = 9). Each vertical bar represents an individual. Southern and northern cpDNA lineages contain 9 and 1 AFLP clusters, respectively. Population codes are shown above the bar. 
  <span class="bold">(B)</span> Spatial clustering of 37 populations in 
  <span class="sc">baps</span> (
  <span class="italic">K</span> = 9). Each polygon represents one population corresponding to the histogram above, and colours of polygons indicate clusters. 
  <span class="bold">(C)</span> PCoA for 37 populations (394 individuals). Percentages of total variance explained by the first three coordinates are shown on the respective axes.
