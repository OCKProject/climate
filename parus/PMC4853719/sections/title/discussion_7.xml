 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of our phylogeographic and landscape genetic analyses reveal how historical and contemporary environmental and geographic factors have all contributed to presently observed patterns of genetic divergence in 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span>. At broad scales, the results of our cpDNA and ITS phylogeography show that genetic variation is, largely, geographically structured. In the cpDNA phylogeography, we found two major lineages corresponding to the Northern and Southern populations (with minor exceptions). The boundary between these lineages is located in the region of the Yangtze River and next to the Three Gorges Mountain Region (TGMR; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Figs 1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">3</a>). We found evidence of admixture of Northern lineage cpDNA haplotypes into the Southern lineage (S16, S17, S18), which is most likely explained by both introgression following secondary contact during glacial periods and incomplete lineage sorting due to recent, postglacial divergence. Nuclear ITS ribotype data did not show such a distinct division between the Northern and Southern populations but did, nevertheless, indicate geographically structured ribotype frequency differences between these sets of populations and the presence of ribotypes found only in the Northern and Southern lineages. In fact, of the nine ribotypes we detected, only one was shared between lineages (R1), which was found in many populations, including those around the Yungui Plateau (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). Several ribotypes and chlorotypes are also unique to Southeastern populations, where the climate is warmest and wettest, or to the Northernmost populations, where the climate is coolest and driest. Whether these haplotypes and populations sharing similar haplotype frequencies are clustered in these areas because they are environmentally divergent from the intermediate climate of central China, where the most haplotype diversity is found, or because of geographical restrictions to the mountain chains in these regions is still unclear. Nevertheless, it appears that major geographic regions harbor phylogeographic structure, but that geographic distances and major geographic barriers (like the Yangtze River) are not always major barriers to genetic introgression. For example, there is cpDNA evidence to suggest that two populations from the Northern lineage (N6 and N15 in the Qinling Mts.) were shaped by dispersal events from a southern population (S12 in central China), as a chlorotype (H1) unique to this latter population differs from its derived haplotype (H26) in the Qinling Mts. by only one step (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1A,C</a>; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S1</a>). These populations are separated by several hundred kilometers, suggesting that very long distance dispersal may be possible in this species, that these populations have some shared ancestry, or that they may have been more widespread and come in contact in the past, possibly during the LGM when there was much more suitable habitat available to 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4</a>). Hence, the observed phylogeographic patterns may also reflect historical factors, particularly relating to the expansion of suitable habitat during the LGM from heavily fragmented habitat during the LIG, followed by the restriction, again, of suitable habitat leading to the present disjunct montane distribution of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> populations (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our ENM analysis through time suggested that 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> populations likely experienced cycles of expansion and retraction into and out of local refugia, and Quaternary climatic fluctuations may have played a role in generating phylogeographic structure as well
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">42</a>. In fact, the earliest diversification events in 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> are associated with major geological and climatic events. The estimated divergence time between the two major lineages (Northern and Southern) of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span>, at approximately the Mio-/Pliocene boundary [
  <span class="italic">c</span>. 5.06 Ma (1.68–8.91) Ma; see node 2 in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1B</a>], coincides with global climate cooling during the Late Miocene/Early Pliocene
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">43</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">44</a>. This cooling is hypothesized to have been a key trigger of aridification in East Asia along with stronger winter and/or weaker summer monsoon circulations
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">45</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">46</a>. Concurrently, the mid-Pliocene abrupt uplift of the eastern Tibetan Plateau (
  <span class="italic">c</span>. 3.4 Ma)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">46</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">47</a> induced dramatic geomorphological changes in Southwest China. These climatic and geological changes may have triggered early lineage diversification in 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> through habitat fragmentation and the formation of physical barriers to gene flow
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">46</a>, which we see reflected in early branching events within each of the major Northern and Southern lineages beginning around 3.64 to 3.42 Ma (see nodes 3 and 4 in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1B</a>). Such tectonic/climate-induced vicariance has also been invoked to explain similar patterns of north-south differentiation in other forest tree species from subtropical China (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Taxus wallichiana</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">48</a>, 
  <span class="italic">Cercidiphyllum japonicum</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>, 
  <span class="italic">Kalopanax septemlobus</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">49</a>). Expansion of potential suitable habitat of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> during the last glaciations, indeed, is supported by our ENM analysis, which indicates larger distribution ranges of this lineage at the LGM compared to both the LIG and present (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4A–C</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the interplay between geographic and climatic factors, population demography and colonization history also likely contributed to the observed pattern of phylogeographic structure. For instance, our phylogeographic and ENM analyses are consistent with the relatively recent expansion of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> into the northernmost regions (Northwest and Northeast groups) of its range. These groups (particular the Northeast group; N1–6) harbor lower genetic diversity (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Fig. S3</a>) and the most derived haplotypes found in our 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> phylogeny (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1B</a>) and 
  <span class="sc">tcs</span> networks (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1C</a>), which both suggest populations founded following range expansion. Additionally, the MDA indicated a spatial (and demographic) expansion within the Northwest and Northeast groups at 
  <span class="italic">c</span>. 0.19 Ma (95% CI: 0.111–0.314 Ma) and 
  <span class="italic">c</span>. 0.26 Ma (95% CI: 0.133–0.376 Ma; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t2" href="#t2">Table 2</a>), respectively, possibly coinciding with the penultimate (Riss) glacial (
  <span class="italic">c</span>. 0.12–0.35 Ma), although, due to the broad confidence intervals, this interpretation requires some caution. In fact, the species is not predicted to have occurred in the northern Sichuan Basin and the Daba/Qinling Mts. during the LIG (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4B</a>), i.e. when temperatures were at least 5 °C higher than at present
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">47</a>. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the climate might have warmed enough during the LIG to extirpate 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> from the above regions, followed by recolonization via northward expansion during the LGM (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4C</a>). Notably, such a significant impact of the LIG has also been detected for other plants and animals in subtropical China (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Pinus kwangtungensis</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">50</a>, 
  <span class="italic">Aegithalos concinnus</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">51</a>, 
  <span class="italic">Parus monticolus</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">52</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Southeast group may also carry signatures of expansion – these populations also have reduced haplotype diversity (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Fig. S3A</a>) and significantly negative Tajima’s 
  <span class="italic">D</span> and Fu’s 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>S</sub> statistics (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t2" href="#t2">Table 2</a>). This provides strong evidence for a relatively recent spatial (and demographic) expansion in the Tianmu and Wuyi Mts. located southwest of the Yangtze Delta Region (YDR). Although the range of our time estimates for this expansion, again, is broad (approx. 0–0.81 Ma; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t2" href="#t2">Table 2</a>), the respective point estimate (
  <span class="italic">c</span>. 0.23 Ma) once more coincides with the penultimate (Riss) glacial (see above). In addition to the ENM and MDA analyses (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Figs 4B,C</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S3A</a>), this expansion scenario is further supported by vegetation reconstructions based on fossil pollen data, which indicate that the YDR still sustained patches of northern peripheral WTD forest in the lowland areas of East China during the LGM
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">53</a>. Thus, we again find evidence that Quaternary climatic oscillations across geographic regions of China likely contributed to phylogeographic patterns in this species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clearly, at broad phylogeographic scales, our results demonstrate distinct geographic genetic structure across the range of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span>. At finer spatial and evolutionary scales, our landscape genetic analysis of AFLP genotype data also revealed that geographical isolation played the predominant role in driving genetic divergence of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> populations. However, we also found that environmental/climatic variation also contributed significantly to explaining population genetic structure (SEM: IBD ≈ 36.0 vs. IBE ≈ 18.1%; MMRR: IBD ≈ 30.72 vs. IBE ≈ 24.67%). Thus, we found evidence of both isolation by distance (IBD)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a> and isolation by environment (IBE)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a> in our population genetic dataset. IBD could be explained by geographical distance, extensive restriction and fragmentation of WTD forests
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">54</a>, physical barriers to gene flow (like the Yangtze River), or increasing fragmentation from other land uses in subtropical China (such as forest, agriculture and residential), all of which are commonly barriers to gene flow in plants
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">3</a>. Patterns of IBE often result from divergent selection between different environments; however, environmental factors can also shape gene flow through other processes (e.g. environmental differences affecting phenological differences among populations)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">55</a>. Thus, IBE may not be due solely to selection but could also be explained by other diverse mechanisms associated with environmental factors
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a>. Hence, multiple processes, associated with both geographic and environmental variables, all could have effectively disrupted gene flow between 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> populations, and broad-scale geographic and climatic factors appear to have shaped the spatial distribution of genetic variation in this species at both deeper evolutionary and more recent ecological time scales.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine the potential mechanism driving the pattern of IBE, we tested for loci under selection, in our AFLP dataset, and their associations with environmental/climatic variables. In identifying outlier AFLP loci, we sought to determine how selection might play a role in shaping genetic differentiation of the nine 
  <span class="sc">baps</span> clusters of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> along environmental clines. All four loci identified by both 
  <span class="sc">fdist</span> and 
  <span class="sc">bayescan</span> as undergoing putative diversifying selection (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5</a>) were associated with environmental predictors across environmental gradients (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S7</a>), suggesting these regions of the genome are diverging and that climate may play a role. As expected, temperature and precipitation were estimated as the major driving factors influencing allele frequencies at outlier loci, consistent with other studies examining drivers of adaptive genetic divergence in plants
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">56</a>. These variables were also identified as important drivers of neutral genetic divergence by our SEM analysis (specifically 
  <span class="sc">bio</span>5, maximum temperature of the warmest month, and 
  <span class="sc">bio15</span>, precipitation seasonality). Altogether, these results are consistent with population genetic divergence under natural selection in divergent environments, suggesting this may have been the process generating IBE in this system.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, by using phylogeographic, landscape genetic, and ecological niche modeling analysis together, we were able to identify the many factors, both historical and contemporary, that have shaped spatial genetic structure in this Tertiary relict species. At various spatial and evolutionary scales, we found that both geographical and environmental/climatic factors contribute to patterns of genetic structure. Geography played a predominant role at all levels – phylogeographic clades are broadly geographically structured, the deepest levels of divergence are associated with major geological or pre-Quaternary climatic events, and IBD primarily explained population genetic structure. However, environmental factors are clearly also important – climatic fluctuations since the LIG have likely contributed to phylogeographic structure, and the population genetic structure (in our AFLP dataset) was partly explained by IBE, which may have resulted from natural selection in environments with divergent climates. Thus, historical and contemporary geography and historical and contemporary environments have all shaped patterns of genetic structure in 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span>, and, in fact, changes in the landscape through time have also been critical factors.
