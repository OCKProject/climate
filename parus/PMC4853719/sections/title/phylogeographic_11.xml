 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both cpDNA and ITS, haplotype (
  <span class="italic">h</span>) and nucleotide (
  <span class="italic">π</span>) diversities were calculated for each population and the species overall using 
  <span class="sc">dnasp</span> v.5.10
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">62</a>. Genealogical relationships of the haplotypes identified were inferred from a 95% statistical parsimony network constructed in 
  <span class="sc">tcs</span> v.1.21
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">63</a>, with gaps (indels) coded as substitutions (A or T). For cpDNA, the permutation test implemented in 
  <span class="sc">permut</span> was employed to compare parameters of population differentiation with unordered and ordered alleles (
  <span class="italic">G</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>, respectively) based on 1000 random permutations
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" href="#b64">64</a>. Spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA), as implemented in 
  <span class="sc">samova</span> v.1.0
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" href="#b65">65</a>, was used to identify regional groups of populations that are geographically homogeneous and maximally differentiated from each other. For cpDNA data, isolation by distance (IBD) effects
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a> were assessed by regressions of 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>/(1 − 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>) against the logarithm (log
  <sub>10</sub>) of geographic distance for all pairs of populations, or subsets thereof, following Rousset
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" href="#b66">66</a>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the AFLP dataset, we calculated the total number of AFLP fragments per population (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>T</sub>), the percentage of fragments that are polymorphic within each population (
  <span class="italic">PPF</span>), Nei’s (1973) gene diversity (
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>E</sub>), and Shannon’s information index 
  <span class="italic">I</span> following the method of Lynch &amp; Milligan
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" href="#b67">67</a> using 
  <span class="sc">aflpsurv</span> v.1.0
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" href="#b68">68</a>. In addition, ‘frequency-down-weighted-marker values’ (
  <span class="italic">DW</span>; according to Schönswetter &amp; Tribsch
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b69" href="#b69">69</a>), were calculated for each population. To infer the most likely number of population genetic clusters (
  <span class="italic">K</span>) in the AFLP dataset, we used three approaches. First, we used 
  <span class="sc">baps</span> v.6.0
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">70</a> to detect clusters of genetically similar populations and to estimate individual coefficients of ancestry (
  <span class="italic">q</span>) with regard to the detected clusters. Second, we utilized 
  <span class="sc">genalex</span> v.6.4
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">71</a> to run a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), which non-hierarchically grouped the samples without prior knowledge of their source location. Third, we constructed an unrooted neighbour-joining (NJ) tree using the 
  <span class="sc">phylip</span> package 3.6 with 1000 bootstraps (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Method S3</a> for more details). To quantify variation in cpDNA sequences and AFLPs among populations and genetic clusters (as identified by SAMOVA), we performed analyses of molecular variance (AMOVAs) in 
  <span class="sc">arlequin</span> v.3.5
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b72" href="#b72">72</a> using 
  <span class="italic">Φ</span>- statistics, respectively. The significance of fixation indices was tested using 10,000 permutations
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b73" href="#b73">73</a>.
