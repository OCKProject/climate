 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nine primer combinations employed with samples from 37 populations (394 individuals) of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> generated a total of 457 fragments, of which 431 (94.31%) were polymorphic. Different primer pairs amplified variable numbers of fragments, from 38 to 69, with an average of 50.8 ± 10.1 fragments per primer combination (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S3</a>). The percentage of polymorphic fragments varied among primer pairs from 88.89 to 98.55% (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S3</a>). Because of the high degree of polymorphism, these primer combinations distinguished all 394 individuals as separate phenotypes. AFLP variation within populations (in terms of 
  <span class="italic">PPF</span>, 
  <span class="italic">I</span>, 
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>E</sub>, 
  <span class="italic">DW</span>) varied widely (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S1</a>). The highest genetic diversity was observed in a northern population (N12), with 
  <span class="italic">PPF</span> = 74.18%, 
  <span class="italic">I</span> = 0.243, and 
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>E</sub> = 0.162. By contrast, genetic diversity was lowest in a southern population (S22), with 
  <span class="italic">PPF</span> = 57.77%, 
  <span class="italic">I</span> = 0.035, and 
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>E</sub> = 0.023. Regression analyses showed that 
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>E</sub> was weakly related to latitude (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The partition with the highest log marginal likelihood (spatial: -51313.01, non-spatial: -51225.49) produced by 
  <span class="sc">baps</span> identified nine different clusters (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Fig. S2A</a>). All populations from the Northern and two (S17, S18) from the Southern (cpDNA) lineage formed one cluster, while the remaining populations from the Southern lineage were further divided into eight clusters (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3A,B</a>). In the PCoA-plot, the first axis (42.20% of the variation) and the third axis (12.84%) indicated that the main split in the dataset was between the central-southeastern and the northern samples, while the second axis (16.10%) separated the southwestern samples from the northern group (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3C</a>). The NJ analysis based on genetic distances among populations also identified three regional groups, again comprising populations from the central-southeastern region (67% bootstrap support), southwestern region (92%), and northern region (&lt;50%; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Fig. S2B</a>). With few exceptions, S16 and S17 clustered with the northern group. Populations from central-southeastern and southwestern China showed higher among-population divergence when compared with those from within the northern group (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Figs 3C</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S2B</a>). Non-hierarchical AMOVA indicated high overall levels of population differentiation for AFLPs in

  <span class="italic">Φ</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.344; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). When accounting for the species’ significant hierarchical (regional) substructure (
  <span class="italic">Φ</span>
  <sub>CT</sub> = 0.061), levels of population subdivision still remained high (
  <span class="italic">Φ</span>
  <sub>SC</sub> = 0.364), but were markedly higher in the Southern lineage (
  <span class="italic">Φ</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.416) than in the Northern one (
