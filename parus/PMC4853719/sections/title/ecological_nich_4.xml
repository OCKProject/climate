  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4A</a>) were accurate representations of the species’ extant distribution, except for some predicted areas where the species does not occur at present (e.g. southeastern Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau and Taiwan). Palaeodistribution modeling suggested more restricted ranges of the species during the Last Interglacial (LIG) compared with its current distribution, particularly in north-central China (e.g. northern Sichuan Basin and Daba/Qinling Mts.; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4B</a>), with subsequent expansion at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to cover a slightly greater area than that predicted under current climatic conditions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4A,C</a>). However, ENMs for the future (2080) predict that climate change will result in a reduction of the species’ potential range in China. Most evident is a loss of suitable habitat in areas south of the Yangtze Delta, where only small and disjunct mountain areas are predicted as suitable (
