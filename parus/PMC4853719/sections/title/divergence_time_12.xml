 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To relate differentiation among cpDNA haplotypes of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> to pre-Quaternary and Quaternary events, we estimated divergence time under a Bayesian approach as implemented in 
  <span class="sc">beast</span> v.1.8.0
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b74" href="#b74">74</a>. We estimated the divergence time using an unlinked substitution model (

  <span class="italic">trn</span>L–

  <span class="sc">2.0</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b75" href="#b75">75</a>. Given the intraspecific nature of our data, an uncorrelated lognormal distributed relaxed clock (
  <span class="sc">ucld</span>) model, and a coalescent model assuming constant population size were used to model the tree prior. Since no reliable fossils of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> are currently known (see Introduction), we used the divergence time between 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. bracteata</span>, inferred from a fossil-calibrated cpDNA phylogeny of Rubiaceae, as a secondary calibration point to calibrate the stem node of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span>

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1B</a>: mean = 21.77 Ma; SD = 5.0 Ma; 95% CI = 7.92–33.64 Ma). For divergence time estimations, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was run for three independent 50 million generation chains, sampling from the chain every 5000 generations. The output was visualized using 
  <span class="sc">tracer</span> v.1.5 (

Based on these results, the first 5000 trees were discarded as burn-in, and the remaining samples were summarized as a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree with mean divergence times and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals of age estimates in 
  <span class="sc">treeannotator</span> v.1.8.0
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" href="#b76">76</a>. Finally, these results were summarized in a single tree visualized in

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b78" href="#b78">78</a> neutrality tests were used to assess population demographic history. We also used
