 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two different basic approaches allow screening for AFLP loci that are putatively under selection: (i) a genome scan test procedure based on 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> comparisons to identify the loci that are significantly different than expected under neutrality and a given demographic model; and (ii) correlative methods that look for associations between genetic variation and environmental variables. The key to using these approaches together is that they identify links between putative loci under selection and individual environmental variables. Hence, our primary purpose for using these tests was to identify the specific environmental variables that are potential drivers of genetic differentiation via divergent natural selection (e.g. IBE resulting from selection in divergent environments).

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b92" href="#b92">92</a> approaches were implemented on 457 polymorphic AFLP loci using the nine genetic clusters defined in the 
  <span class="sc">baps</span> analysis (
  <span class="italic">K</span> = 9). Then, to detect associations between allele frequencies and environmental variables, we used Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b93" href="#b93">93</a> in R v.3.1.1 (R Development Core Team 2011) to identify potential adaptive loci that are under selection from current environmental factors. For outlier loci confirmed by both 
  <span class="sc">fdist</span> and 
  <span class="sc">bayescan</span>, we computed their population pairwise frequencies of AFLP alleles at the 37 sampling sites. We extracted values for the geographical coordinates of each population from 19 bioclimatic GIS data layers with 30 arc-second resolution (1950–2000;

We then regressed the allele frequencies of the retained outlier loci (dependent variables) on the selected environmental variables (explanatory variables; standardized) using the MLR model (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S4</a> for the retained allele frequencies and the selected environmental variables). Potential adaptive loci were identified as
