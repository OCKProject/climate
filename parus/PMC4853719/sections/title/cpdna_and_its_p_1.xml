 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three cpDNA-IGS regions surveyed across the 443 individuals of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> were aligned along a total length of 2163 bp with 26 single-site mutations (including two 1-bp indels), 18 length polymorphisms (2–78 bp) and one inversion (27 bp) observed (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S5</a>). A total of 40 haplotypes (‘chlorotypes’; H1–40) were detected in the 38 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> populations across subtropical China (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S1</a>; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1A</a>). Of the 40 haplotypes, 20 were shared by at least two populations while the other 20 haplotypes were only found in a single population (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S1</a>; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1A</a>). The most common haplotypes were H12 (found in 10 populations with a frequency of 0.25), H2 (17.5% of all populations), H28 (15%), H14 (12.5%), and H6 (10%). Total haplotype diversity (
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <sub>T</sub>) was estimated to be 0.928 and within-population diversity (
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <sub>S</sub>) was 0.332 (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S1</a>). Regression analyses showed that 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <sub>S</sub> was not dependent on longitude or latitude (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.23, 0.66, respectively), but 
  <span class="italic">π</span>
  <sub>s</sub> was weakly related to latitude (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0.116, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.036).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Bayesian haplotype tree from 
  <span class="sc">beast</span> supported the monophyly of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> [posterior probability (
  <span class="italic">PP</span>) = 1], and two main (‘Northern’ vs. ‘Southern’) lineages were recognized with weak support (
  <span class="italic">PP</span> = 0.57, 0.70, respectively; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1B</a>). The haplotypes of the Northern lineage were located in the northern part of the species’ range, except for H12 from populations S17 and S18, while those of the Southern lineage were present only in southern populations (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1A</a>). In the haplotype network, the two major lineages are also recognized (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1B,C</a>). Most haplotypes close to each other in the phylogeny and haplotype network tended to occur in nearby populations (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). In the 
  <span class="sc">samova</span> analysis, 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>CT</sub> values increased progressively as the value of 
  <span class="italic">K</span> increased from 2 to 26. However, with 
  <span class="italic">K</span> ranging between 5 and 26, 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>CT</sub> values did not increase significantly, and in most cases the newly defined groups comprised single populations (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Fig. S1</a>). Thus, we retained the configuration of 
  <span class="italic">K</span> = 4 (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>CT</sub> = 0.523). The four cpDNA groups identified are populations S1–S6 in the east (Southeast group), S7–S23 in the middle (Central-Southwest group), N1–N6 in the northeast (Northeast group), and N7–N15 in the northwest (Northwest group). This grouping is mostly consistent with the phylogenetic analyses (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1B,C</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Non-hierarchical AMOVA (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>) revealed a strong population genetic structure for cpDNA sequence variation at the species level (
  <span class="italic">Φ</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.779; 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt; 0.001). Hierarchical AMOVA, however, revealed that of the total genetic variation, 36.48% was distributed between the Northern lineage and the Southern lineage (
  <span class="italic">Φ</span>
  <sub>CT</sub> = 0.365), 45.43% was explained by variation among populations within regions (
  <span class="italic">Φ</span>
  <sub>SC</sub> = 0.715), and only 18.10% was found within populations (
  <span class="italic">Φ</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.819; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Nevertheless, there was greater population subdivision in the Southern lineage (
  <span class="italic">Φ</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.823) when compared to the Northern lineage (
  <span class="italic">Φ</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.551; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Moreover, significant phylogeographic structure for cpDNA was observed at the range-wide scale (
  <span class="italic">G</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>/
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.704/0.802, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt; 0.01) and in the Southern lineage (
  <span class="italic">G</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>/
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.757/0.868, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt; 0.05), but no such structure was found in the Northern lineage (
  <span class="italic">G</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>/
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.521/0.379, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Finally, Mantel tests uncovered a strong pattern of IBD for cpDNA both at the range-wide scale (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.237, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.001) and the region scale (Northern lineage: 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.506, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.001; Southern lineage: 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.293, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.001).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ITS sequences of 212 individuals (38 populations) of 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> were aligned with a total of length of 767 bp, exhibiting 10 nucleotide substitutions (ITS-1: 4; ITS-2: 6; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S6</a>). Together, these 10 polymorphic sites identified nine ITS haplotypes (‘ribotypes’, R1–9; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S6</a>). Of those, five ribotypes were specific to the Southern cpDNA lineage (R2–6) and three to the Northern cpDNA lineage (R7–9; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2A</a>). These lineage-specific ribotypes formed separate 
  <span class="sc">tcs</span> clades, except for the shared ribotype R1 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2B</a>).
