 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained silica-dried leaf material from 38 populations of 
  <span class="italic">Emmenopterys henryi</span> throughout its range (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Method S1</a> for more details of the study species). In each population, representative samples of 10–20 plants were taken, resulting in a total of 433 individuals. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the dried leaf tissue using a DNeasy plant tissue kit (Qiagen). All samples were sequenced at three intergenic spacer (IGS) regions of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), while a subset of individuals (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 212) was also sequenced at the entire internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA). Of these 433 individuals, 394 (representing 37 populations; population S23 with 1 individual was excluded) were surveyed for AFLPs (
