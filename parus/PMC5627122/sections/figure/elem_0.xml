  <p>Survival-type curves showing time to laying of first clutches in relation to (
   <span class="italic">a</span>) mean minimum spring temperature and (
   <span class="italic">b</span>) recent rainfall measured over 7 days prior to each day within the observation period. Predicted curves were estimated from the model in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="RSOS170835TB1" href="#RSOS170835TB1">table 1</a> (setting the predictor variables not plotted to their mean values) and correspond to temperatures and rainfall within the ranges recorded across the study years (light grey, dark grey and black lines for minimum, mean and maximum values, respectively). Day 0 corresponds to 28 August (earliest laying date in our dataset was 29 August).
