 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simplest model of the probability of breeding included rainfall in the previous season (electronic supplementary material, table S3a, model 9: 
  <span class="italic">Δ</span>
  <sub>AIC</sub> = 1.86, 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>(c)</sub>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.14). Fewer pairs bred following seasons during which rainfall was high (

  <a ref-type="table" rid="RSOS170835TB2" href="#RSOS170835TB2">table 2</a>). Alternative models that included an interaction between mean maximum breeding season temperature and colony size (model 6), or length of the breeding season and an interaction between total rainfall in the current breeding season and colony size (model 3), also had AIC
  <sub>c</sub> values within 2 of the model with the lowest 
  <span class="italic">Δ</span>
  <sub>AIC</sub>. However, these models had more parameters than the simpler model with only rainfall in the previous season.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A post hoc test, in which we tested for additional short-term effects of recent temperature and rainfall by incorporating them into the simplest model obtained above (electronic supplementary material, table S3a, model 9), indicated that rainfall in the 20 days before the peak of breeding activity was correlated with the probability of breeding (electronic supplementary material, table S3c: effect estimate (95% CI) = 0.53 (0.10, 0.96)). The models considered in the post hoc test also included the month during which the peak was recorded as a random intercept term, to account for the seasonal variation in temperature and rainfall (see details in electronic supplementary material, table S3b).</p>
