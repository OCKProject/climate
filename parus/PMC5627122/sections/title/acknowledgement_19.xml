 <p>This study was only possible with the help of numerous ringers and field assistants that helped capture and monitor the colonies used in the study. We thank Rowan Martin for stimulating discussion on the effects of temperature on reproduction in our population, and Res Altwegg, Susan Cunningham and Sinead English for further discussion and comments on the analyses and the manuscript. We also thank the two anonymous reviewers whose comments improved the original manuscript. De Beers Consolidated Mines gave us permission to work at Benfontein Reserve.</p>
