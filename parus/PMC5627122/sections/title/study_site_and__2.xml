 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was conducted using data from a wild population of sociable weavers at the Benfontein Nature Reserve (28°52′ S, 24°50′ E) in South Africa. The study area covers approximately 15 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of open, semiarid savannah and contains around 30 sociable weaver colonies, many of which have been regularly captured and ringed since 1993 [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C34">34</a>]. The climate is characterized by low annual rainfall (432 ± 134 mm per year (mean ± s.d.), range 187–789 mm, as recorded from 1990 to 2013; South African Weather Service), the majority of which falls between October and April (over 35 mm per month, on average), and by widely ranging temperatures: 2–19°C (mean daily minimum and maximum, respectively; minimum recorded, −8.4°C) during the coldest months (June and July), and 17–32°C (maximum recorded, 40.9°C) during the hottest months (December to February). Breeding at the study site can start as early as August and extend to as late as June, but the majority of clutches (over 96% in this study) are laid between September and March.
