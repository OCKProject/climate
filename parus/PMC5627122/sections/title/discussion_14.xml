 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results reveal an important role of temperature in the breeding phenology of arid-region birds: in sociable weavers, warmer springs were followed by earlier laying dates, and cooler summers were correlated with longer breeding seasons. Our results also confirm the importance of rainfall for breeding onset and success, but suggest that the timing of rainfall is as important as its quantity: for example, high rainfall early in the breeding season was associated with increased fledgling production, whereas rainfall across the entire breeding season was associated with more clutches being laid. Finally, our results suggest that rainfall may also have long-term effects: breeding probability and output were lower following years of high rainfall, independent of current rainfall. Overall, these results confirm the importance of rainfall for reproduction in arid-zone species. In addition, our findings on the effects of temperature on the breeding phenology of sociable weavers parallel those found in long-term studies on temperate-region passerines and highlight the importance of this often overlooked climatic variable on species living in arid environments.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In temperate regions, breeding patterns largely follow changes in day length, yet temperature plays a key role in determining the onset of breeding [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C5">5</a>]. Long-term studies on blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span> [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C57" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C57">57</a>]), great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C58">58</a>]), long-tailed tits (
  <span class="italic">Aegithalos caudatus</span> [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C59" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C59">59</a>]) and pied flycatchers (
  <span class="italic">Ficedula hypoleuca</span> [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C60">60</a>]) suggest that birds use temperature as a predictive cue of food availability, with warmer springs typically leading to earlier breeding activity. In some cases, temperature appears to influence breeding decisions independently of other cues (e.g. leafing [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C61" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C61">61</a>]), to the extent that mismatches between breeding activity and food abundance can occur in warmer-than-average years [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C1">1</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C7">7</a>]. Our results align with those from previous studies, suggesting that temperature is also an important cue for birds breeding in arid regions [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C20">20</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C23">23</a>], which may likewise be due to its effect on food availability. For example, the timing of swarming events in termites, one of the main prey species for arid-region passerines before the summer rains [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C62" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C62">62</a>], may be influenced by spring temperatures [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C63" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C63">63</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C64">64</a>]. Results from food supplementation experiments in sociable weavers [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C33">33</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C39">39</a>] suggest that such an increase in food availability may ultimately determine the onset of breeding in arid-region passerines. While rainfall is also expected to precede an increase in food availability, seasonal changes in temperature are more predictable than the onset of rains, and may thus be a more reliable environmental cue that arid-region species can use to time their breeding activity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature can also affect the length of the breeding season. In temperate-region species, earlier start dates associated with warmer springs can result in longer breeding seasons [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C54">54</a>]. In species that are able to produce multiple broods, these longer seasons may involve more clutches or longer intervals between clutches [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C54">54</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C65" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C65">65</a>]. Our results for sociable weavers indicate that in addition to the correlation between earlier start dates and length of the breeding season, a reduction in mean summer temperature by 1°C was correlated with an extension of the reproductive window by up to 75%. Longer breeding seasons typically involved an increase in the mean number of clutches laid per colony, from eight clutches during the shortest breeding season to 35 during the longest. Note that this shift appears to be independent of colony size, as colonies were not necessarily larger at the start of longer breeding seasons. We found no such relationship, however, between length of the breeding season and interclutch interval at the individual level (range across pairs with two or more clutches, 17–39 days). The increase in clutches per colony could suggest that in sociable weavers, relatively cool summer temperatures increase reproductive output, as previously found in song sparrows (
  <span class="italic">Melospiza melodia</span> [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C66">66</a>]), zebra finches (
  <span class="italic">Taeniopygia guttata</span> [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C67" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C67">67</a>]) and lark buntings (
  <span class="italic">Calamospiza melanocorys</span> [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C68" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C68">68</a>]). Indeed, in subtropical arid regions, high summer temperatures have been shown to reduce foraging efficiency and condition in southern pied babblers (
  <span class="italic">Turdoides bicolor</span> [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C29">29</a>]) and southern fiscals (
  <span class="italic">Lanius collaris</span> [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C30">30</a>]) and can ultimately suppress activities such as foraging, territorial behaviours and reproduction [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C69" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C69">69</a>]. However, we found no clear correlations between temperature and number of clutches laid, fledglings produced or number of breeding pairs per colony. Thus, a simple, linear relationship between mean maximum temperature and a colony's reproductive output cannot be assumed based on the correlation between temperature and breeding season length. Given the likely negative impact of extreme temperature events on reproduction, and given that more broadly, the effects of temperature may be nonlinear [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C69" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C69">69</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C70" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C70">70</a>] and inconsistent across species [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C68" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C68">68</a>], further research into the role of temperature in determining reproductive output in this species is warranted.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As with temperature, the effects of rainfall on reproductive timing and output are likely largely due to its impact on food availability [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C71" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C71">71</a>]. In arid environments, where water is a limiting factor for primary productivity and rainfall can be unpredictable, several studies have found a strong relationship between rainfall and reproduction [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C10">10</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C11">11</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C20">20</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C71" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C71">71</a>]. Nevertheless, while the link between the amount of rainfall and breeding is well established, few studies have looked at the impact of the timing of rains across the breeding season. Using a proportional-hazards model which allows the incorporation of rainfall as a time-dependent variable (rather than fixed at an arbitrary point in time), we show that the probability of laying a first clutch in sociable weavers was correlated with rainfall during a moving, 7-day window. Similarly, we found that the probability of breeding at the peak of breeding activity was correlated with rainfall in the previous 20 days. Our results also suggest that the timing of rains affects total reproductive output, as rainfall early on in the breeding season was correlated with the number of fledglings produced over the entire season, but total rainfall was not. These results indicate that interannual variation in rainfall over long periods (e.g. during the entire breeding season) cannot alone explain the observed variation in breeding patterns. The importance of considering the effects of the timing of rainfall, in addition to its amount, on key life-history events is highlighted in recent studies on migration [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C72" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C72">72</a>], breeding [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C12">12</a>], growth [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C73" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C73">73</a>] and survival [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C13">13</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C28">28</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C74" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C74">74</a>] across multiple taxa.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, our results showing that both breeding probability and reproductive output in sociable weaver colonies were lower after years of high rainfall, independent of current rainfall, suggest that rainfall may also have long-term effects. Given that reproductive output increases with current rainfall in sociable weavers, the decrease observed after favourable years could be due to a trade-off between current and future investment in breeding [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C75" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C75">75</a>]. This is unlikely to be the case for all potential breeders in our study, however, as we included 2-year-old females which would probably not have bred as yearlings in the previous season [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C34">34</a>] (but see [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C76" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C76">76</a>]). Alternatively, lower reproductive output and breeding probability after years of high rainfall could be due to an increase in resource competition within or between colonies following favourable years [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C77" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C77">77</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C78" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C78">78</a>]. Indeed, rainfall is correlated with adult survival in sociable weavers [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C40" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C40">40</a>], and there is some evidence to suggest that the number of potential breeders (i.e. adults aged 2 years or older) drops below colony means after years of low rainfall (R. Mares 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2016, unpublished data). A longitudinal study of adult females in sociable weavers could shed further light on the potential long-term effects of rainfall on breeding decisions and output in this system.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several recent studies have highlighted the effects that local changes in rainfall and temperature patterns due to global climate change are having on the timing of migration and breeding [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C3">3</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C79" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C79">79</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS170835C82" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C82">82</a>]. In arid regions, where rainfall and temperature range widely within and between years, the impact of climate change on survival and reproduction is expected to be exacerbated [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C29">29</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C83" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C83">83</a>], yet there are few long-term studies on wild populations informing these predictions [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C13">13</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C14">14</a>]. As a result, predictions on the fitness consequences that changes in rainfall and temperature patterns will have on arid-region species may not be robust [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C70" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C70">70</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C84" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C84">84</a>]. Although the time span of our study is relatively short and our results should thus be treated with caution, our findings are largely consistent with those from a previous 17-year study that found that adult survival in the same sociable weaver population is negatively correlated with low rainfall and high temperatures [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C40" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C40">40</a>]. Here, we show the importance of considering both rainfall and temperature for obtaining a broader view on how breeding patterns may be influenced by climatic variation. Our results suggest that the increase in temperature and reduction in rainfall for the central area of southern Africa, consistently predicted by different climate change models [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C85" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C85">85</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C86" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C86">86</a>], are likely to lead to earlier laying dates, shorter breeding seasons and lower fledging success in sociable weavers. Shorter breeding seasons and lower fledgling success will clearly have a negative impact on reproductive output, but the effects of earlier laying dates may ultimately depend on the extent to which sociable weavers are able to maintain synchrony between the timing of breeding and increases in food availability in a rapidly changing environment.
