 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed the effects of rainfall and temperature (as detailed in §2.3.2) on the total number of clutches laid and the total number of fledglings produced (i.e. chicks reaching 17 days old) per colony per season (data from 24 colonies across six breeding seasons). We considered sets of candidate GLMMs with Poisson errors (electronic supplementary material, tables S4 and S5) fitted with the predictor variables listed in §2.3.3 and with colony-specific predation rates to control for the effects of predation on reproductive success. Predation rates were estimated for each colony using data from nest failures attributable to snakes [

  <a rid="RSOS170835C56" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C56">56</a>] for calculating nest mortality. Briefly, for each colony, the total number of nest predation events (i.e. predation of all eggs or chicks of a clutch or brood) was divided by the sum of nest days within a season (days elapsed between laying and nest failure or fledging for each clutch) to obtain a daily predation rate (mean (range) = 0.02 nests (0–0.08)).
