 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used laying dates from a total of 27 colonies (7–14 per season), monitored over nine breeding seasons, to investigate the effects of rainfall and temperature on time to laying of first clutches. We used mixed-effects Cox proportional-hazards models, which allowed us to assess the effects of fixed (e.g. winter temperature) and time-dependent covariates (e.g. daily temperature) on the probability that a clutch would be laid at a given time interval (i.e. day), while accounting for differences in the baseline hazard of each level of the random intercept terms incorporated in our models (see [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C6">6</a>] for a similar analytical approach). Our analysis was restricted to the two-month period (28 August to 31 October) in which the earliest-recorded clutch and approximately 60% of first clutches were laid in each of our six complete breeding seasons (remaining first clutches were laid within the following seven months). As Cox models allow the inclusion of censored data, our analysis included all potential breeding pairs, regardless of whether they bred during the observation period. The number of potential breeding pairs within each colony was taken to be half the number of adults aged 2 years or older, assuming an equal sex ratio [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first built two candidate sets of models for the onset of breeding to determine the best predictors among various measures of recent (a) rainfall (electronic supplementary material, table S1a) and (b) temperature (electronic supplementary material, table S1b). We then built a third candidate set of models (electronic supplementary material, table S1c) to test for additive effects of recent rainfall and temperature, using the best predictors obtained for each of the two climatic variables. In the rainfall candidate set (a), we included rainfall during 7, 15 and 30 days, with a lag of 6 days [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C51" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C51">51</a>], before the focal day (mean (range) = 3 mm (0–60), 6 mm (0–69), 12 mm (0–77), respectively). In the temperature candidate set (b), we included: mean minimum winter (June to July) and early spring (August) temperatures (1°C (−1 to 4) and 3.3°C (1.1 to 5.3), respectively), minimum temperature on the focal day (8.8°C (−5.6 to 22.4)) and an adjusted minimum temperature on the focal day (average over the previous 30 days, estimated using linear weighting which gives smoothed daily measures of temperature more heavily influenced by recent temperatures; 7.6°C (0.9–13.9)). As rainfall and temperature are highly seasonal, our daily measures were strongly correlated with the time component in the models (day of the year). We therefore adjusted these time-dependent variables for day of the year before incorporating them into the models, by subtracting the day-specific mean values of rainfall or minimum temperature (estimated using data collected between 1990 and 2013). To account for the increasing variance in rainfall from August to October, we then divided the above adjusted daily measures of rainfall by day-specific standard deviations (see [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C52" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C52">52</a>] for a similar method). We also controlled for colony size (31 adults (4–150)) in all our models, and input variables were allowed to interact with the time component when assumptions of proportional hazards were not met (e.g. for a categorical variable, the laying curves for each level should have similar shapes and proportional values over time [
