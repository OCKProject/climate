 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed the effects of rainfall and temperature (as detailed in ยง2.3.2) on the number of pairs that bred per colony per season (data from 24 colonies across six breeding seasons). We considered a set of candidate GLMMs with binomial errors (electronic supplementary material, table S3) and fitted the number of pairs per colony that initiated a clutch (i.e. successes) and those that did not (i.e. failures) as the two-vector response variable, to account for differences in the number of potential breeders per colony (i.e. weighted regression [

Candidate models were also fitted with rainfall in the previous breeding season, the estimated length of a colony's breeding season and colony size (as detailed in ยง2.3.2), and the interaction of colony size with the climatic variable fitted in the model.
