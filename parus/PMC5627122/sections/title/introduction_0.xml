 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reproduction involves high energetic and nutritional demands associated with the production of eggs and the development of embryos and, in many species, with subsequent care of offspring. The ability to time reproduction to match the peak of resource availability using predictive environmental cues is thus expected to be under strong selective pressure [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C1">1</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS170835C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C4">4</a>]. For example, in northern, temperate regions, where seasons are well defined by cold winters and warm summers, studies on birds have shown that the onset of reproduction is mostly determined by temperature and day length [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C5">5</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS170835C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C7">7</a>]. Indeed, temperature is an important determinant of reproductive success for these species due to its effects on food availability, energetic demands and physiological state [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C5">5</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C8">8</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C9">9</a>]. By contrast, in arid regions, rainfall can range widely within and between years and is expected to play a more important role in determining the incidence and timing of reproduction [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C10">10</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS170835C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C12">12</a>]. Few long-term studies, however, have investigated concurrently the influence of rainfall and temperature on breeding decisions and output in arid-region species [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C13">13</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C14">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In arid, seasonal environments, the onset of rains is typically correlated with a subsequent increase in food availability [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C15">15</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C16">16</a>]. Many primary producers appear to fine-tune their investment in growth and flowering to the first rains [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C17">17</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C18">18</a>], the timing of which varies greatly between years despite their seasonality [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C19">19</a>]. Studies have thus shown strong correlations between the onset of rains and breeding, to the point where breeding is drastically reduced or even absent in years of extremely low rainfall [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C11">11</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C12">12</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C20">20</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C21">21</a>]. Furthermore, rainfall over a given period may determine the length of the breeding season. For example, in birds, it appears to affect whether breeders are able to lay replacement clutches after failed nesting attempts and, in species that can lay multiple clutches within a single season, the number of successful breeding attempts [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C10">10</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C21">21</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C22">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although patterns of temperature are more predictable than those of rainfall [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C19">19</a>], the dramatic seasonal variation in temperature experienced by most tropical and subtropical arid regions may also have implications for reproduction. Minimum and maximum temperatures can also vary greatly from year to year, but whether and how this variation affects breeding decisions and output is poorly understood [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C20">20</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C21">21</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C23">23</a>]. In temperate regions, where temperature is an important determinant of food availability and acts as a cue that triggers reproduction, warmer springs can lead to earlier laying dates [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C5">5</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C7">7</a>]. By contrast, lower-than-average winter temperatures may affect female condition [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C24">24</a>] and lead to fewer individuals breeding and to reduced output in the following breeding season [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C25">25</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C26">26</a>]. In arid regions, temperature may also be used as a cue for breeding [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C23">23</a>] and can exert a strong influence on food availability: lower-than-average temperatures can reduce primary productivity, independent of rainfall [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C27">27</a>], and may directly affect insect activity patterns and phenology, for example by increasing developmental times [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C28">28</a>]. Furthermore, recent studies in birds have shown that high temperatures can have negative impacts on foraging efficiency and condition, which appear to be independent of food availability [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C29">29</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS170835C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C31">31</a>]. Taken together, these studies suggest that temperature in arid regions is likely to play a greater role in the timing of breeding and in reproductive success than currently reported.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we use 9 years of breeding data from a wild population of sociable weavers (
  <span class="italic">Philetairus socius</span>) to investigate the effects of a suite of measures of rainfall and temperature on breeding decisions and output. Sociable weavers are facultative cooperative breeders that are endemic to the semiarid savannah regions of southern Africa [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C32">32</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C33">33</a>], which are characterized by unpredictable rainfall and extreme temperatures [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C34">34</a>]. Sociable weavers form large colonies of up to 500 individuals who share a massive communal nest with multiple separate chambers, occupied year-round by pairs or groups of up to seven individuals [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C32">32</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C33">33</a>]. Chambers provide thermoregulatory benefits [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C35">35</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS170835C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C37">37</a>] and function as individual nests during breeding periods. Breeding occurs both year-round and seasonally, but its timing is likely to be determined by food availability, with experimental food supplementation leading to earlier laying dates and more individuals breeding [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C33">33</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C38">38</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170835C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C39">39</a>]. As in other arid systems, reproductive output has been linked to seasonal rainfall [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C22">22</a>], with some pairs laying up to nine clutches in a single breeding period [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C38">38</a>]. However, it remains poorly understood whether the onset of breeding is, in fact, determined by rainfall, and whether and how both the amount and timing of rainfall influence other reproductive parameters. Furthermore, although low and very high temperatures are negatively correlated with adult survival in sociable weavers [
  <a rid="RSOS170835C40" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170835C40">40</a>], the impact of temperature fluctuations on reproduction has yet to be determined in this system. Here, we examine the correlations of both rainfall and temperature, measured during winter, spring and throughout the breeding season, with the timing of onset and length of the breeding season, probability of breeding and reproductive output in sociable weavers.
