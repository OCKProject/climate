 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Building the networks</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the seed-female tree assignment, we built two seed dispersal networks in which female trees and seed-plot are represented as nodes linked by dispersal events—i.e. when a seed from a female tree is found in a seed-plot. The first network includes the locally dispersed seeds—i.e. from source trees located inside the fenced area—and will be, hereafter, referred to as the local network. The second network was constructed considering all the seed dispersal events, thus incorporating the seeds from mother trees located outside the fence and the immigrant seeds (i.e. from unidentified mother trees). This network will be, hereafter, referred to as the regional network.</p>
