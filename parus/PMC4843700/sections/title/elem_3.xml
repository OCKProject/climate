  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The evergreen, non-resinous gymnosperm 
   <span class="italic">T. baccata</span> L., the common yew, is a dioecious wind-pollinated tree growing across Europe [
   <a rid="RSTB20150280C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C33">33</a>]. Embryos are protected by pseudobayes composed of a seed partially covered by a red and fleshy aril (‘fruit’ hereafter, for simplicity). Fruits ripen asynchronously from late summer (August) to late autumn (November), but can remain on trees until late winter when not consumed by seed dispersers [
   <a rid="RSTB20150280C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C19">19</a>]. Yew relies essentially on avian frugivores for seed dispersal, especially on thrushes, 
   <span class="italic">Turdus</span> spp., that feed on fruits directly from branches [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study population is located in Nava de las Correhuelas (37°55′ N, 2°51′ W, Parque Natural de las Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y las Villas) in the autonomous community of Andalusia, south-east Spain, at 1615 m a.s.l. elevation (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20150280F1" href="#RSTB20150280F1">figure 1</a>; electronic supplementary material, figures S1 and S3). The site vegetation is dominated by grassland with scattered woody deciduous patches, with gravelly soil or rock outcrops covered by shrubs (e.g. 
   <span class="italic">Juniperus</span> spp., 
   <span class="italic">Rosa</span> spp.) or small isolated trees. Some pine stands (
   <span class="italic">Pinus nigra</span> subsp. 
   <span class="italic">salzmannii</span> (Dunal) Franco) also occur on rocky slopes. The site is protected by a fence to exclude large mammals, and thus the grazing pressure is low. At this site, the yew grows as a secondary species and is found almost exclusively on rocks, aggregated in clusters. The highly fragmented landscape offers a rich mosaic of habitats at the local scale therefore providing an adequate system to study seed dispersal in heterogeneous conditions.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During 5 years, 2001–2002 and 2005–2007, we conducted direct observations of birds feeding on fruits. Eight focal trees were observed from hides under nearby trees, 40–50 m away, and with the help of 8 × 40 binoculars (Nikon, Monarch). Two-hour observation sessions were performed during the activity range of frugivores (09.00 to 18.00 h), such that each tree was observed at different times throughout the day. During observation, we focused on individual birds post-feeding behaviour and recorded the following data whenever possible: (i) bird species; (ii) flight distance to first perch; and (iii) identity of first perch after leaving the focal tree (for distance validation purposes; see electronic supplementary material, SI-2). We only considered here observations from legitimate seed dispersers (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2006, we censused 102 trees within the fenced study plot and identified 20 female trees, 6 male trees and 76 trees that were either juveniles or seedlings, and were classified as non-reproductive (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20150280F1" href="#RSTB20150280F1">figure 1</a>
   <span class="italic">b</span>). Furthermore, we explored the surrounding landscape outside the fence, and censused 14 additional trees (electronic supplementary material, figure S1 and table S1). From those 14, five were male, six were female and three were non-reproductive. Leaf tissue was collected from each tree and remained in silica gel for a few days until the samples could be stored at −80°C. We preferentially collected newly formed leaves to increase the quality of the DNA when processing the samples for genetic analysis.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To represent the fine-scale environmental variability of the microsites where yew seeds are deposited, we defined eight categories of microhabitats based on soil type and vegetation cover: (1) TF, 
   <span class="italic">T. baccata</span> female; (2) TM, 
   <span class="italic">T. baccata</span> male; (3) S, shrub; (4) F, fleshy-fruited tree; (5) N, non-fleshy-fruited trees; (6) P, pine; (7) G, open ground; and (8) R, rock. We categorized types 1–6 as ‘covered’ microhabitats and types 7–8 as ‘open’ microhabitats (see electronic supplementary material, SI-1 for a detailed description of the microhabitats).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We studied the bird-generated seed rain with a microhabitat-based sampling of seed deposition. We collected the seeds deposited in seed traps that were 32 × 26 × 8 cm aluminium trays, top-covered with a wire mesh to prevent seed consumption by post-dispersal seed predators (mostly rodents, see [
   <a rid="RSTB20150280C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C15">15</a>] for a similar methodology). For the ‘rock’ microhabitat, due to the difficulty of installing seed traps and their conspicuousness to animals, we collected the seeds directly from open quadrats, permanently marked on the rock substrate, with the same surface as the seed traps. Open quadrats are prone to seed predation, however, it is usually low in open microhabitats and mostly occurs in late winter [
   <a rid="RSTB20150280C36" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C36">36</a>,
   <a rid="RSTB20150280C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C37">37</a>]. Nonetheless, we have accounted for this bias by counting some of the predated seeds found 
   <span class="italic">in situ</span> as part of the seed rain. Although seed losses might have happened in the rock microhabitat, they were considered negligible (see also [
   <a rid="RSTB20150280C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C34">34</a>,
   <a rid="RSTB20150280C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C38">38</a>,
   <a rid="RSTB20150280C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C39">39</a>], for a validation of the methodology).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sampling scheme consisted of an even number of sampling stations per microhabitat (when not constrained by microhabitat availability), with a total number of 277 (electronic supplementary material, figure S2). Each station consisted of two sampling surfaces—either seed traps or open quadrats—located at a maximum distance of 0.5 m of each other. Hereafter, for simplicity, we will refer to each sampling station as a seed-plot. We checked seed-plots monthly, collecting and counting all yew seeds during the whole fruiting season. Yew bird-dispersed seeds—smooth and without aril—are easily distinguishable from non-dispersed seeds in fallen fruits—seeds with aril remains. We estimated the bird-generated seed rain from the total number of seeds collected in seed-plots over all surveys. The collected seeds were then stored in silica gel.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To study the seed dispersal pattern, we processed all the seeds collected per microhabitat, with the exception of 
   <span class="italic">T. baccata</span> female. Indeed, that was the only microhabitat in which we collected more than 100 seeds, and we randomly sub-sampled 143 seeds (electronic supplementary material, table S3). By doing so, we ensured that at least one seed per seed-plot was analysed to account for the spatial variability of the seed rain. For the 273 seeds selected, we carefully separated the endocarp tissue, of maternal inheritance, from the embryo and stored both at −80°C until processed for genetic analysis.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each seed-plot, hence each seed, and 
   <span class="italic">T. baccata</span> tree was georeferenced using a Leica GS20 differential GPS. Post processing using Leica GisDataPro software allowed for an average precision of 0.5 m. Original data in geographical coordinates were projected in UTM coordinates using A
