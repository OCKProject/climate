 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify the source tree of each dispersed seed, we obtained the genotype at eight microsatellite loci (Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) developed by Dubreuil 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C45" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C45">45</a>]) for all adult trees sampled, along with the multilocus genotype of the endocarp of the dispersed seeds. As some amplifications failed for several markers, we discarded the individuals that had more than one unamplified loci. Finally, our dataset included 254 endocarps (electronic supplementary material, table S3) and 26 female trees with at least seven amplified loci.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the endocarp is maternally inherited, its genotype matches that of its mother tree [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C41" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C41">41</a>]. Therefore, we searched the matching genotypes between each endocarp and the 26 candidate female trees for a complete set of at least seven microsatellite markers out of eight. Additionally, as the multilocus genotypes of the candidate female trees differed for at least one locus, we assumed that two seeds come from the same mother tree when the seeds' endocarp multilocus genotype are identical. We used GIMLET software [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C46" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C46">46</a>] to identify each different multilocus genotype among the endocarps and to find the female tree multilocus genotype with which each of them match. When the endocarp did not match with any female tree, the seed was considered as immigrant.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each dispersed seed, we calculated its dispersal distance. When the source tree was identified, we calculated the dispersal distance as the euclidean distance between the seed-plot containing that seed and its source tree. Similarly for the immigrant seeds, we calculated the minimum distance to the edge of the complementary area explored (electronic supplementary material, figure S1) using A
