 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During 5 years, 2001–2002 and 2005–2007, we conducted direct observations of birds feeding on fruits. Eight focal trees were observed from hides under nearby trees, 40–50 m away, and with the help of 8 × 40 binoculars (Nikon, Monarch). Two-hour observation sessions were performed during the activity range of frugivores (09.00 to 18.00 h), such that each tree was observed at different times throughout the day. During observation, we focused on individual birds post-feeding behaviour and recorded the following data whenever possible: (i) bird species; (ii) flight distance to first perch; and (iii) identity of first perch after leaving the focal tree (for distance validation purposes; see electronic supplementary material, SI-2). We only considered here observations from legitimate seed dispersers (
