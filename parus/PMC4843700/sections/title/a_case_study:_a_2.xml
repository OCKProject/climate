 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we combine field sampling and observations, molecular analyses and analytical tools from network theory to advance our understanding of the spatial dynamics of seed dispersal. We focus on 
  <span class="italic">Taxus baccata</span>, a temperate forest tree, and its avian seed dispersers' guild in a highly fragmented landscape in southern Spain. Specifically, we analyse a set of bird-dispersed seeds using highly polymorphic DNA markers (microsatellites) to identify their source tree. This information is then used to build two spatial networks of seed dispersal events (links) between source trees and seed-plots (nodes). The first network is constructed using local seed dispersal events, while the second also includes regional seed dispersal events. Once the seed dispersal networks are built, we characterize their structure applying network modularity analysis. Such an analysis finds, for each network, the best partition in modules, where a module is a subset of nodes from the network (here, mother trees and seed-plots) that interact much more frequently among themselves than they do with nodes from other modules [

  <a rid="RSTB20150280C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C28">28</a>]. The partition of each network in modules is based exclusively on the distribution of links between mother trees and seed-plots. Therefore, the activity of birds dispersing the seeds determines the modular structure of seed dispersal in the landscape. This approach allows a meaningful description of the spatial pattern of seed dispersal that can be related to the body of work bridging the structure of networks and their dynamics [

  <a rid="RSTB20150280C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C32">32</a>]. We proceed by using a series of ecological correlates to explore what variables better explain the observed modular structure. Finally, by comparing how the module assignment of nodes varies from the local to the regional dispersal network, we explore to what extent the incorporation of long-distance dispersal events (
