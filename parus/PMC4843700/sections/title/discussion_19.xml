 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By combining field work, molecular data and analytical tools from network theory, we have been able to get a glimpse of the differential contribution of short- and long-distance dispersers to the overall seed rain. Indeed, the results highlighted the coexistence of two complementary seed dispersal dynamics that might be driven locally by short-distance dispersers and regionally by long-distance dispersers.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gene flow in plant population, through pollen or seed dispersal, is largely determined by landscape heterogeneity [

  <a rid="RSTB20150280C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C34">34</a>], therefore constraining the spatial structure of the seed rain. Our results are in agreement with the extensive literature on the subject (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C18">18</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C23">23</a>,

  <a rid="RSTB20150280C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C39">39</a>]), that is, high seed densities in microhabitats

  <span class="italic">a</span>), and almost none in open microhabitats. However, here we were able to disentangle the origin of each seed and quantify the actual fraction of seeds resulting from long-distance dispersal (31.1%, 
  <span class="italic">sensu</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C22">22</a>]), as well as the number of contributing mother trees (52; 
  <a rid="RSTB20150280TB1" ref-type="table" href="#RSTB20150280TB1">table 1</a>). The results indicate an extensive seed flow between our studied population and other population patches within the landscape (electronic supplementary material, figure S3).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More importantly, our results enable the portrayal of the fine details of the spatial structuring of the seed rain beyond the average dispersal distance. Indeed, a network approximation to the spatial structure of seed dispersal has several advantages [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C56" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C56">56</a>]. First, it facilitates the assessment of the simultaneous influence of all nodes beyond the information obtained from a series of pairwise comparisons between each tree—seed-plot pair. This is particularly relevant in other examples such as that of genetic variability, as one can prune the network by removing all links connecting nodes whose genetic similarity is mediated by their genetic similarity with other nodes [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C57" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C57">57</a>–
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C59" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C59">59</a>]. Second, an advantage of looking at seed dispersal from a network perspective lies in the novel information that can be derived from the topology of such a network [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C56" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C56">56</a>]. In particular, we can use quantitative tools such as modularity analysis. In our system, both the local and regional networks of seed dispersal events linking mother trees to seed-plots were organized in well-defined modules composed by a subset of seed-plots that received more seeds from the mother trees in the same module than from those outside this module. Indeed, the resulting modules can be seen as bottom-up classifications of meaningful evolutionary or conservation units [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C56" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C56">56</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C58">58</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C59" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C59">59</a>]. This modular structure describes how variability is mapped in space, in contrast with dominant approaches looking at whether there is a significant variability [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C56" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C56">56</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed modular organization was caused neither by distance nor by the microhabitat type of the seed-plots. In fact, these two variables were partly accounted for when constructing the networks. As seed-plots receiving no seeds were not included in the networks (because they could not be linked to a mother tree), we excluded 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> those seed-plots avoided by frugivores. Indeed, these were mostly either located in microhabitats known to be avoided by birds (e.g. open ground, G), or at some distance from the fruiting trees [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C15">15</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C60">60</a>]. The remaining subset of seed-plots included in the networks were thus inherently a combination of favoured microhabitat and distance [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C60">60</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the module composition itself, only the module assignment of the seed-plots slightly changed between the local and the regional networks (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20150280F4" href="#RSTB20150280F4">figure 4</a>), most probably as a consequence of incorporating those seed-plots that received immigrant seeds exclusively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20150280F3" href="#RSTB20150280F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">b</span>). In the local and regional networks, the same two mother trees contributed the higher number of seeds to the seed-plots, and were the most connected (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20150280F4" href="#RSTB20150280F4">figure 4</a>; electronic supplementary material, table S4). The origin of the seeds collected in the seed-plots around those two mother trees (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20150280F3" href="#RSTB20150280F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">b</span>) and their high visitation rates (electronic supplementary material, table S4) suggest that they act as ‘frugivory hubs’ [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C61" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C61">61</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C62" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C62">62</a>], and might therefore preferentially attract long-distance dispersers. Indeed, the higher relative modularity of the regional network supports the hypotheses that long-distance dispersers, here mostly mistle thrushes (
  <span class="italic">Turdus viscivorus</span>), are channeled through only a subset of the nodes (either trees or seed-plots). In autumn, during the fruiting season of yew at our study site, mistle thrushes' behaviour is principally driven by resource tracking and protection against predators [

  <a rid="RSTB20150280C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C38">38</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C63" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C63">63</a>]. This foraging behaviour would imply that the most productive trees and those with the biggest canopies would be preferentially visited, therefore, shaping the seed dispersal patterns at the landscape scale [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C62" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C62">62</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thrushes are partial migrants [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C64">64</a>], which makes them susceptible to the drastic environmental changes taking place on the Earth. Among the profound structural and functional modifications predicted [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C65" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C65">65</a>], shifts in species distribution ranges due to climate change are expected to be a major driver of functional disruption [
