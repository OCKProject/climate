 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We evaluate the role of microhabitat in shaping the modular organization of the networks using the 
  <span class="italic">V</span> index (see above) for the set of seed-plots common to the two networks (i.e. 49). In this case, we assign the seed-plots to modules as a function of the microhabitat. That is, seed-plots belonging to the same microhabitat are assigned to the same module (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20150280F3" href="#RSTB20150280F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">a</span>). Then we compute separately the variation index between the modular structure of the seed-plots based on microhabitat and seed-plots assignment to modules previously detected in the local network, 
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>hl</sub>, and in the regional network, 
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>hr</sub>. As before, the values are normalized and thus vary from zero to one. By comparing the variation in information between the microhabitat-based modularity and the modular organization of each network previously obtained by genetic analyses, we evaluate to what extent two seed-plots receiving seeds from the same mother tree, i.e. assigned to the same module, are also located in the same microhabitat.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we test the effect of geographical distance on the modular organization of the networks. For both networks independently, we compare the distribution of the between–seed-plot distances within modules with the distribution of all between seed-plot distances in the population by means of a Mann–Whitney 
  <span class="italic">U</span> test. The analyses were performed using either the R package [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C54">54</a>] or Matlab [
  <a rid="RSTB20150280C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20150280C55">55</a>].
