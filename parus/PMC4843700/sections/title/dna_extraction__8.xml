 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Briefly, frozen tissues—either leaf or endocarp—were ground using a zirconia-ball mill (Retsch Mixer Mill 200). The DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., USA) and 5 µl extract was used as a template for the polymerase chain reaction. Amplified fragments were then separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3730 sequencer, using the GS500LIZ size standard (Applied Biosystems). Results were recovered electronically, and all scorings were carried out using Genemapper v. 3.7 (Applied Biosystems) (from [
