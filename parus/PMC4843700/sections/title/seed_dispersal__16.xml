 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the seed rain was highly heterogeneous, with 215 (77%) seed-plots receiving no 
  <span class="italic">T. baccata</span> seeds; 47 (17%) receiving less than 10 seeds; and only 15 (5%) receiving 10 or more seeds (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 254 seed endocarps analysed were distributed in 59 seed-plots, thus encompassing the spatial variability of the seed rain. From those endocarps, 172 (67.7%) matched a mother tree inside the fenced area, 3 (1.2%) matched a mother tree outside the fence and 79 (31.1%) originated from unknown sources (electronic supplementary material, tables S2 and S4). For clarity, we will refer to the seeds that originate from a mother tree inside the fence as the local seed pool, and from a mother tree outside the fence as the immigrant seed pool (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20150280F3" href="#RSTB20150280F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">b</span>). Ten (42%) female trees contributed to the local seed pool, out of the 20 censused inside the fenced area. As for the immigrant seed pool, 1 of the 6 additional female trees sampled contributed 3 (4%) seeds, and 51 unidentified source trees—thus located outside our extended sampling area (electronic supplementary material, figures S1 and S3)—contributed the remaining 79 (96%) seeds.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seed dispersal distances of seeds from a mother tree within the fenced area and from outside of it have different frequency distributions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20150280F2" href="#RSTB20150280F2">figure 2</a>
  <span class="italic">c,d</span>). Dispersal events inside the fence largely occur at very short distances (less than 50 m), in the vicinity of the source trees. Contrastingly, the seeds originating from outside the fence, and from unknown origin, displayed much longer dispersal distances (most of them greater than 300 m), especially because these distances are most probably underestimated (closest population located at 1.5 km; electronic supplementary material, figure S3).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was an equal number of seed-plots, 25 (42%), receiving either strictly locally dispersed seeds or both locally dispersed and immigrant seeds (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20150280F3" href="#RSTB20150280F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">b</span>). Only 9 (15%) seed-plots received immigrant seeds exclusively. No clear spatial pattern of the seed-plots depending on the origin of the seeds emerged, but we observed a tendency for the seed-plots with mixed seed origin to receive a greater number of seeds.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The immigrant seed pool displayed a higher mean allelic richness than the local seed pool (
  <a rid="RSTB20150280TB1" ref-type="table" href="#RSTB20150280TB1">table 1</a>), which probably reflects the larger number of mother trees (52 versus 10). Nonetheless, the lower observed heterozygosity, 
  <span class="italic">H</span>
