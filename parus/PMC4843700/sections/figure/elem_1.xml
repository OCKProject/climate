  <p>Empirical observations from our study system. (
   <span class="italic">a</span>) Seed rain of 
   <span class="italic">T. baccata</span>. Squares represent seed-plots and are proportional to the number of yew seeds collected; dots represent seed-plots that did not receive 
   <span class="italic">T. baccata</span> seeds. (
   <span class="italic">b</span>) Distribution of observed flight distances to first perch of frugivorous birds feeding on 
   <span class="italic">T. baccata</span>. Grey bars represent short-distance seed dispersers, which include 
   <span class="italic">Coccothraustes coccothraustes</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Erithacus rubecula</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Phoenicurus ochruros</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Sylvia atricapilla</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>. White bars represent long-distance seed dispersers, which include 
   <span class="italic">Turdus viscivorus</span>, 
   <span class="italic">T. philomelos</span> and 
   <span class="italic">T. torquatus</span>. (
   <span class="italic">c</span>) Frequency distribution of the dispersal distances of seeds from known origin. All the seeds but three (indicated by an arrow) came from a source tree inside the fence. (
   <span class="italic">d</span>) Frequency distribution of the minimum dispersal distance of the seeds from unknown sources, i.e. the minimum distance between the seed-plot containing the immigrant seed and the limit of the complementary area explored (dotted line in the electronic supplementary material, figure S1).
