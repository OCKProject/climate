 <div class="caption">
  <p>Modular organization of the seed dispersal network of 
   <span class="italic">Taxus baccata</span>. Nodes represent mother trees (squares) and seed-plots (circles). The size of the node is proportional to the number of seeds either received, for seed-plots, or contributed, for mother trees. Arrows indicate seed dispersal events mediated by birds and are directed from the source, mother trees, to the destination, seed-plots. The same set of nodes is represented in both panels and include 10 mother trees and 49 seed-plots. Each colour represents a module, i.e. a group of non-overlapping highly connected mother trees and seed-plots detected by the QuanBiMo algorithm; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> indicates the corresponding number of modules. (
   <span class="italic">a</span>) Modular organization of the local network (locally dispersed seeds). (
   <span class="italic">b</span>) Modular organization of the regional network (all seeds); black arrows indicate the nodes that have changed module assignment when incorporating regional dispersal events.
