  <p>Observed (points) and fitted (lines) relationships between: (
   <span class="italic">a</span>) log genome size (megabases, Mb) and log linkage map length (centimorgans, cM), (
   <span class="italic">b</span>) log haploid chromosome number (HCN) and log linkage map length (cM) and (
   <span class="italic">c</span>) log HCN and log recombination rate measured as linkage map (cM) divided by genome size (Mb). Fitted linear and quadratic relationships were obtained by fitting a phylogenetic generalized linear model separately for plants, animals and fungi.
