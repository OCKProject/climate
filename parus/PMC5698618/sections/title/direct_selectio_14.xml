 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Direct selection on variation in genome-wide recombination rate</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering direct selection on recombination, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and efficient DNA repair imposes stabilizing selection on recombination, thus creating an ‘optimal range’ for a given organism. Extremely high or low rates of recombination outside this optimal range can have negative effects on fitness; for example, in humans and mice very low recombination rates can cause chromosomal abnormalities in gametes and reduce fertility, and very high rates can cause genomic instability and disease [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C170" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C170">170</a>]. As discussed, obligate CO requirements and genomic architecture can explain some, but not all, of the variation observed between species in the optimal range of the GwRR (
  <a ref-type="boxed-text" rid="RSTB20160455BX2" href="#RSTB20160455BX2">box 2</a>). Changes in the environment can push recombination beyond the optimal range with negative fitness consequences, and tolerance to these perturbations may explain some of the variation between species [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering less extreme modifications of recombination (within the optimal range), there are a few studies linking GwRR to fitness, but there is no clear directional pattern. In populations at equilibrium, recombination is expected to reduce fitness because it breaks apart allelic combinations that selection has favoured (termed recombination load) [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C2">2</a>], and several studies in 
  <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> support this prediction (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C2">2</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C171" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C171">171</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C172" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C172">172</a>]). In humans, a positive relationship between GwRR (cM/Mb) and female fecundity was found, which was argued to be due to a higher number of COs reducing the frequency of age-related non-disjunction, and increasing the likelihood that the gamete became a live birth (realized recombination) [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C148" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C148">148</a>]. In flour beetles (
  <span class="italic">Tribolium castaneum</span>), lines that evolved longer linkage map lengths (i.e. higher GwRR) during coevolution with their parasite were found to have higher fitness in the absence of the parasite compared to lines with shorter linkage maps [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C117" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C117">117</a>]. The authors did not identify any possible explanations, but posited that it may be due to coevolution with the parasite selecting for fitter beetles. Although studies at the genome-wide level provide evidence of correlations, they may not be very informative with respect to the mechanisms underlying any fitness–recombination relationships. Studies that can quantify where in the genome recombination is modified, not just the change in the overall rate, are likely to provide more insight into the traits that are involved and how changes in recombination influence these.
