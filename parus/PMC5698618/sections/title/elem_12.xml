With a growing understanding of the genes and molecular mechanisms determining variation in recombination frequency and landscape, and data accumulating in a greater range of organisms, we are in a good position to begin to address long-standing questions about how recombination evolves and how variation in recombination frequency or landscape influences evolutionary processes such as adaptation and speciation. In this section, we begin by exploring the evidence for indirect and direct selection on genome-wide recombination; we then discuss how selection acts to modify recombination in specific regions of the genome and how this influences local adaptation and speciation, and finish with discussion of the evolutionary explanations of the evolution of sex differences in recombination rate.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indirect selection on recombination rate has received much empirical and theoretical consideration in order to understand the evolution of sex, but there has been less focus on understanding the processes that govern recombination variation in obligate sexuals (see [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C60">60</a>]). Models of the evolution of sex suggest that one of the main advantages of recombination is that it can increase the efficacy of selection and facilitate adaptation (see [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C3">3</a>,
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C66">66</a>,

   <a rid="RSTB20160455C152" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C152">152</a>]). It does this by reducing the amount that genetic variants or alleles interfere with each other's response to selection. Alleles can interfere in at least two ways: first, when the presence of one allele alters the fitness effects of another allele (epistasis); and second, when the probability of two alleles at two different loci occurring together in a population is non-random (referred to as linkage disequilibrium (LD)), which can be due to their physical proximity on a chromosome (genetically linked) or because of selection, migration or drift (see [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C153" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C153">153</a>]). For simplicity, we will use the more general term 
   <span class="italic">allelic non-independence</span> to refer to LD, epistasis and other processes that make alleles behave non-independently. Allelic 
   <span class="italic">non-independence</span> can interfere with how an allele responds to selection. For example, selection at one locus interferes with selection at other selected loci, reducing its probability of fixation (termed Hill–Robertson interference (HRI) [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C152" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C152">152</a>], and the degree of interference increases with genetic linkage between the loci under selection. Another example is when alleles in LD experience conflicting selection pressures—if a beneficial allele is associated with a strongly deleterious allele, it can be lost from the population, whereas a deleterious allele can rise to high frequency if it is associated with a strongly beneficial allele. Finally, selection at one locus can reduce the level of polymorphism at linked loci (an effect called background selection when purifying selection acts on a deleterious allele and selective sweep when positive selection acts on a beneficial allele), and this selection at linked sites was found to be a key factor determining genetic diversity within a species and diversity within the genome across animals and plants [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C154" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C154">154</a>]. The most recognized benefits of recombination in sexual species is that (i) it can increase the efficacy of selection by modifying the degree of independence among alleles: it can break down negative LD generated by selection and drift, thus reducing HRI; and (ii) it can create beneficial combinations of alleles and create greater genetic variation that selection can act on. What makes recombination paradoxical is that it can break apart combinations of beneficial alleles that selection has brought together, resulting in negative fitness effects, both direct [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C2">2</a>] and indirect [

   <a rid="RSTB20160455C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C26">26</a>]. Therefore, the benefits of recombination are dependent on how alleles are associated and how breaking up these associations influences fitness.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several demographic and ecological factors can increase the number and strength of allelic non-independence within a population. For example, small effective population size (
   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>e</sub>) and high rates of inbreeding or selfing will increase associations between alleles and thus HRI; in these cases, indirect selection should favour an increase in the rate of recombination [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C66">66</a>,
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C155" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C155">155</a>]. In line with this expectation, studies have found a negative association between recombination rate and indirect measures of

   <a rid="RSTB20160455C78" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C78">78</a>]. In plants, recombination (cM/Mb) was higher in large, long-lived tree species compared to shrubs and herbs [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C25">25</a>]; Cf/B was higher in selfing plants [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C157" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C157">157</a>] and higher in annual plants that are probably experiencing higher rates of inbreeding and drift [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C74" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C74">74</a>]. Higher rates of asexual reproduction, for example in parthenogenetic animals or fungi, would also increase HRI and should also select for higher rates of recombination. In line with this prediction, we observed elevated recombination in parthenogenic animals compared to animals with gonochorus sexual systems—where all individuals are either male or female and reproduce sexually every generation (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). Taken together, these data suggest that optimal rates of recombination between species have evolved to reduce HRI and increase genetic variation and the efficacy of selection; however, these relationships do not provide definitive proof of causality. For example, in mammals longer-lived species have a longer meiotic arrest in females, which may favour higher recombination to prevent aneuploidy [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C158" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C158">158</a>].

   <a rid="RSTB20160455C161" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C161">161</a>]. However, there is mixed evidence for changes in overall recombination rates between artificially selected populations and their wild progenitors [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C152" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C152">152</a>]: a study comparing chiasma counts in wild and domesticated mammal species pairs saw no differences [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C162" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C162">162</a>], suggesting that an increase in recombination is not a universal feature of domestication.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Populations experiencing heterogeneity in selection are also expected to benefit from higher rates of recombination. In particular, higher rates are predicted when organisms experience rapid oscillations in the fitness of certain allelic combinations, for example in organisms involved in a coevolutionary arms race [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C1">1</a>], or that experience fluctuating environments [

This has been confirmed in several experimental evolution studies (see §2e) and supported by indirect evidence: high recombination in genomic regions harbouring genes related to immunity (e.g. major histocompatibility complex (MHC) [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C165" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C165">165</a>],

   <a rid="RSTB20160455C167" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C167">167</a>]. Studies testing this model normally consider parasite-induced changes in the host; however, it is possible that host-induced selection on the parasite can also drive a high recombination rate in parasites [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C168" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C168">168</a>]. We tested this hypothesis with our data by comparing the GwRR of parasitic or pathogenic species with free-living species. Using phylogenetic generalized linear models, we found that parasitic or pathogenic species had a higher recombination rate compared to their free-living counterparts in SAR and in animals, but there was no difference between parasitic or pathogenic and free-living species of fungi (electronic supplementary material, figure S5; plants were excluded as data were not available for any parasitic or pathogenic plant species). Interestingly, parasites often have smaller genomes compared to their free-living counterparts, which is consistent with high recombination driving genome contraction (discussed earlier in 
   <a ref-type="boxed-text" rid="RSTB20160455BX2" href="#RSTB20160455BX2">box 2</a>), although genome contraction may also be due to selection on small cell size and fast replication rates [

Temporal variation is often considered less likely to drive increases in recombination because the fluctuations in the abiotic environment are not fast or predictable enough (see [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C164" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C164">164</a>]). Data collected in the field investigating the effects of spatial variation in an abiotic environment on recombination often cannot rule out other confounding effects such as demography or biotic factors. For example, marginal populations of 
   <span class="italic">Drosophila robusta</span>, which can experience greater environmental fluctuations, have fewer inversion heterozygotes and thus higher recombination rates (see [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C5">5</a>]). In plants, higher Cf/B was found in annuals that are well suited to colonizing new variable habitats [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C74" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C74">74</a>]. However, in both cases higher recombination rate may be favoured because of the small 
   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>e</sub> of marginal or colonizing populations. More empirical work is needed to test this hypothesis, ideally comparing across natural populations while controlling for potential confounding effects.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Theoretically, differential selection pressure on males and females can induce fluctuating selection on an allele as it cycles through the male and female genomes [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C164" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C164">164</a>]. Differential selection on male and female traits, such as mating rate or parental investment, creates intra-locus sexual conflict that could favour increased recombination [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C164" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C164">164</a>]. One prediction that can be drawn from this model is that hermaphrodites, which do not have separate sexes and thus have low levels of intra-locus sexual conflict, should have lower recombination rates compared to species with separate sexes. We tested this in our data looking at how sexual system (gonochorous, hermaphrodite, male-haploid and parthenogenic) was related to recombination rate (GwRR/HCN) across animals. We found that parthenogenic and male-haploid species had a higher recombination rate compared to species with separate sexes, but found no difference between separate sexes and hermaphrodites (see the electronic supplementary material). The dataset used here has a limited number of hermaphrodites (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering direct selection on recombination, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and efficient DNA repair imposes stabilizing selection on recombination, thus creating an ‘optimal range’ for a given organism. Extremely high or low rates of recombination outside this optimal range can have negative effects on fitness; for example, in humans and mice very low recombination rates can cause chromosomal abnormalities in gametes and reduce fertility, and very high rates can cause genomic instability and disease [

The authors did not identify any possible explanations, but posited that it may be due to coevolution with the parasite selecting for fitter beetles. Although studies at the genome-wide level provide evidence of correlations, they may not be very informative with respect to the mechanisms underlying any fitness–recombination relationships. Studies that can quantify where in the genome recombination is modified, not just the change in the overall rate, are likely to provide more insight into the traits that are involved and how changes in recombination influence these.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The prevailing hypothesis for the complete absence of recombination in the heterogametic sex is that achiasmy is a pleiotropic effect of selection for tight linkage on the Y or W chromosomes and/or suppression of recombination between the heterogametic sex chromosomes [

   <a rid="RSTB20160455C96" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C96">96</a>]. However, reduced recombination is not always observed in the heterogametic sex (i.e. birds and moths) and it cannot explain variation between the sexes in hermaphrodites [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C210" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C210">210</a>]. Understanding the conditions under which heterochiasmy evolves has been the subject of extensive theoretical attention and debate (e.g. [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C96" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C96">96</a>]), but as yet, there is no consensus on its evolutionary drivers. Arguments related to the relative strengths of sexual selection, sperm competition and dispersal remain weakly supported by empirical data [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C211" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C211">211</a>], with some arguing that sex differences are primarily driven by drift [

   <a rid="RSTB20160455C96" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C96">96</a>]. Nevertheless, there are two arguments gaining broader theoretical and empirical support. The first is haploid selection; the sex experiencing the strongest haploid selection should recombine less (see [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C89" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C89">89</a>]). In plants, both female and male gametes have a haploid phase, but Lenormand &amp; Dutheil [
   <a rid="RSTB20160455C89" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C89">89</a>] proposed that selfing could be used as a proxy for the strength of selection on the female haploid phase, and showed that the degree of heterochiasmy (male–female ratio) was higher in species with moderate to high selfing. The second is the role of meiotic drive, for example where asymmetry in female meiosis can be exploited by selfish genetic elements associated with centromere strength [
