 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examination of recombination at the individual level, using cytogenetic and pedigree-based approaches, has shown that GwRRs can vary substantially between individuals within a population. Studies in humans, cattle, sheep, mice and 
  <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> have shown that variation in regional or GwRRs (cM/Mb) often have an underlying heritable component, explaining 8–40% of the phenotypic variance in rate [
