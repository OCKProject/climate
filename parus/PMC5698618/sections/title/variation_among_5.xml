 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linking variation in recombination rates between closely related species and between populations with variation in selection and demography may elucidate long-term mechanisms driving recombination rate evolution. Differences in chiasma count between sister species, populations, accessions and inbred lines of cultivated and model species have been studied since the 1930s (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C73" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C73">73</a>–
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C76" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C76">76</a>]). Within a more ecological context (i.e. natural populations, non-model species), early empirical work identified relationships between chiasma frequency and ecological and environmental variables. For example, chiasma frequency per bivalent (Cf/B) in orthopterans is associated with latitude (see [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C15">15</a>]) and was higher in low-density populations of grasshoppers [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C77" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C77">77</a>] and snails [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C78" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C78">78</a>], and in plants Cf/B was higher in selfers compared to outcrosses [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C79" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C79">79</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C80" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C80">80</a>]. In many cases where clinal variation in recombination has been detected, karyotypic differences, which are known to modify recombination, are also present (e.g. accessory or B chromosomes (see [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C15">15</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C78" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C78">78</a>]), chromosomal inversions [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C78" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C78">78</a>]). These karyotypic differences can suppress the GwRR and may explain the variation observed. At a finer genomic scale, comparisons between closely related taxa find, in general, greater variation in the recombination landscape compared to the GwRR. For example, similar linkage map lengths are evident across species (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Eucalyptus</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C81" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C81">81</a>], flycatchers (
  <span class="italic">Ficedula)</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C34">34</a>]), strains (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C82" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C82">82</a>]), cultivars (e.g. maize (
  <span class="italic">Zea mays</span>) [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C83" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C83">83</a>]) and populations (e.g. great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C84" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C84">84</a>], honeybee (
  <span class="italic">Apis mellifera</span>) [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C85" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C85">85</a>]). In most mammals, the position of hotspots appears to be dynamic, differing between subspecies of mice [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C86" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C86">86</a>] and between humans and chimps [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C32">32</a>], while hotspot location is more conserved in other groups, for example birds [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C34">34</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C45" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C45">45</a>], dogs [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C35">35</a>] and in 
  <span class="italic">Saccharomyces</span> yeast [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C87" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C87">87</a>]. Recent work in determining the molecular mechanisms governing hotspot activity has shed light on this pattern: most notably, in species with rapidly evolving hotspots, hotspot position is determined by a common gene (
  <span class="italic">PRDM9</span>), whereas this gene is missing or non-functional in species with more conserved hotspots ([
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C88" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C88">88</a>] and discussed in §3b).
