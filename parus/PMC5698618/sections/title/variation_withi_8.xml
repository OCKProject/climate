 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in recombination rate has been observed within individuals, i.e. between subsequent measurements or between clones experiencing different environments, demonstrating plasticity in recombination rate. Intrinsic factors, such as age and stress, as well as a diverse range of extrinsic factors, such as parasites, have been found to influence CO frequency [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C99" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C99">99</a>–
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C101" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C101">101</a>]. Of all studies to date, there are three commonly reported factors affecting recombination rate within individuals.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first, age, has been considered in several model species, but there is little consensus in broad trends. In humans, the recombination rate (cM/Mb) tends to increase with maternal age, while there appears to be little effect of paternal age (see [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C102" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C102">102</a>] and references therein; for an exception see [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C103" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C103">103</a>]); in mice, patterns in females and males are varied [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C104" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C104">104</a>–
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C107" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C107">107</a>]. In 
  <span class="italic">Arabadopsis thaliana</span>, paternal recombination rate (cM/Mb) measured at nine genomic intervals was stable in five of these regions, but increased with age in the other four [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C99" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C99">99</a>]. In cattle and humans, CO interference, which can set a minimum distance between neighbouring COs, decreases with maternal age, which may explain observed increases in recombination frequency [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C106" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C106">106</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C108" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C108">108</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, temperature is one of the most commonly reported extrinsic correlates of recombination rate variation. In exothermic organisms, successful completion of meiosis is sensitive to changes in temperature, which are frequently associated with failures in synapsis and subsequent declines in fertility (see [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C109" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C109">109</a>]). The relationship between increasing temperature and CO number and positioning varies across species; for example, in plants it is associated with increased paternal recombination in 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span> and barley (
  <span class="italic">Hordeum vulgare</span> L.), but decreases in other species (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Allium ursinum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Locusta migratoria</span>) (see [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C99" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C99">99</a>]). Relationships can also vary nonlinearly with temperature, such as in 
  <span class="italic">Drosophila</span>, where the highest recombination rates occur at both high and low temperature extremes (see [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C109" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C109">109</a>]). Interestingly, temperature can also influence the degree of heterochiasmy; in barley, at 10°C, sex-specific rates of recombination (cM/Mb) estimated from linkage maps were similar with a male/female map length ratio of 1.02, but at 30°C this ratio increased to 1.58 [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The third factor frequently associated with variation in recombination rate is pathogen infection. In line with predictions of the Red Queen hypothesis—enhanced recombination rates will increase the genetic diversity of offspring, so that more rapidly evolving parasites cannot exploit a static host genotype [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C111" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C111">111</a>]—studies have observed longer linkage maps, and increased recombination frequency and rate (cM/Mb) with parasite infection; e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Tribolium castenatum</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C112" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C112">112</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C113" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C113">113</a>], 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C114" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C114">114</a>] and tomato and barley [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C115" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C115">115</a>], but see other studies in e.g. mice [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C116" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C116">116</a>] and 
  <span class="italic">T. castenatum</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C117" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C117">117</a>]). A study in 
  <span class="italic">D. melanogaster</span> showed increased production of recombinant offspring in response to two bacteria and to a parasitic wasp, and this increase was driven by transmission distortion of recombinant chromatids—either during meiosis or due to asymmetric viability of gametes [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C97" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C97">97</a>].
