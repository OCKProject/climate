 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recombination is the exchange of DNA between maternal and paternal chromosomes during meiosis, and is a fundamental feature of sexual reproduction in nearly all multicellular organisms, producing new combinations of genetic variants or alleles that are passed on to offspring. It is also a fundamental, yet paradoxical evolutionary process: it can facilitate adaptation through the creation of novel genetic combinations, but it can also break apart favourable combinations of alleles, potentially reducing fitness [

  <a rid="RSTB20160455C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C3">3</a>]. This antagonism is central to the adaptive responses of organisms to their environment [

  <a rid="RSTB20160455C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C5">5</a>], but also to the evolution of sex [

  <a rid="RSTB20160455C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C6">6</a>] and to the formation of new species when there is gene flow [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C7">7</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C8">8</a>]. Recombination also performs an essential role during meiosis to ensure accurate segregation of chromosomes [

  <a rid="RSTB20160455C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C10">10</a>]. As a consequence, tight regulation of the rate of recombination is expected, but studies have revealed that recombination can vary within and between chromosomes, individuals, sexes, populations and species [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C11">11</a>–
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C15">15</a>]. Recombination rates can be influenced by environmental and demographic factors, but are also heritable and underpinned by specific genetic loci [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C16">16</a>–
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C20">20</a>] and can respond to selection [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C21">21</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C22">22</a>]. Therefore, they have the potential to vary in a manner dependent on the evolutionary or selective contexts [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C6">6</a>]. While the role of recombination in the evolution of sex and in facilitating responses to selection has been the focus of much empirical and theoretical work, investigation on how recombination rate 
  <span class="italic">itself</span> evolves and how this impacts evolutionary processes within sexually reproducing organisms has received less attention. Until recently, empirical studies were restricted to cytogenetic studies of chiasma counts, or to low-density linkage map data in a handful of model organisms; however, in recent years, advances in genomic technologies have allowed more detailed characterization of recombination rates at a finer genomic scale and in a greater number of species.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this review, we aim to explore the patterns of, and processes governing recombination in predominantly sexually reproducing eukaryotes from an evolutionary perspective, in a manner that is accessible to a general audience. We begin by summarizing the patterns of variation in the number of recombination events in the genome per megabase per generation (herein referred to as recombination rate) at different taxonomic and genomic scales across eukaryotes—updating and integrating current knowledge with an analysis of linkage map data in 353 organisms. Then, we discuss processes governing recombination rate variation, beginning with what is known of the proximate causes and genetic correlates of recombination rate variation, before summarizing the key evolutionary (ultimate) causes and consequences of this variation. We do not attempt to systematically review the enormous body of literature, but want to provide the reader with an introduction to the topic that is taxonomically broad, reflecting the development of the field, and provide directions for future research. Throughout, we use the term recombination to refer to the meiotic process whereby a double-strand DNA break (DSB) is repaired via reciprocal exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, resulting in a crossover (CO).</p>
