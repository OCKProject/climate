 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in recombination between the sexes</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most widely reported within-species variation in recombination rate is that seen between the sexes. Differences between sexes can be as extreme as one sex lacking recombination completely (achiasmy), or where recombination is present but different in both sexes, in terms of the rate and landscape (heterochiasmy), [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C89" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C89">89</a>]. Achiasmy has evolved independently at least 26 times [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C15">15</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C90" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C90">90</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C91" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C91">91</a>] and nearly always occurs in the heterogametic sex (e.g. in XY 
  <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> males and ZW 
  <span class="italic">Bombyx</span> females) [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C92" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C92">92</a>â€“
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C94" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C94">94</a>]. By contrast, heterochiasmy is phylogenetically dispersed across plants and animals, and reduced recombination is not always observed in the heterogametic sex [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C89" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C89">89</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C90" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C90">90</a>]. In animals and plants, females tend to have higher overall rates of recombination, although exceptions exist, such as in corals, marsupials, macaques and sheep [
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C89" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C89">89</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C95" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C95">95</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20160455C96" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20160455C96">96</a>]. There appears to be no link between sex chromosomes or sex-determining mechanism (genetic, environmental) and the direction of heterochiasmy. However, only one species that has environmental sex determination (ESD) has been studied to date, and more studies are needed in clades that have evolved ESD multiple times (e.g. lizards and turtles) to test this more explicitly.
