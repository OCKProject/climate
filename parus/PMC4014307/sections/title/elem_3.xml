  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Behavioral experiments were performed at 41 sites within a 50-km radius of the center of London, UK, using the London Natural History Society method of using St. Paul’s Cathedral as an approximate for the center of London (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). Sites comprised the gardens of members of the public who responded to advertisements made through the media, project website (
   <span xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.projectparakeet.co.uk" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.projectparakeet.co.uk</span> no longer online), local bird watching groups, and word of mouth and therefore the location of sites used were constrained by those offered, but still provided an adequate number of sites (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 41) spread across a broad area of London and the surrounds (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). Procedures for contacting members of the public were assessed and passed by Imperial College’s research ethics committee in April 2010. Sites were at least 200 m apart (closest distance between 2 sites 226 m, see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>) to minimize the risk of repeating the experiment on same individual native birds and were gardens that used bird feeders regularly to minimize the time needed for habituation of the birds to the feeding station. To test for potential habituation, gardens were classified as being either within or outside the current range of the invasive parakeet population. This was classified based on residents’ information and verification by observations made during the experiment. Parakeet absence was also verified by British Breeding Bird Survey parakeet presence–absence data for London and the Home Counties for 2009 (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). The range of the great spotted woodpecker covers the entire area of the study (
   <a rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0004">Balmer et al. 2013</a>) and garden owners verified that the species visited each garden used in the experiment regularly, therefore it was considered that garden birds’ exposure to great spotted woodpeckers would be similar across all sites.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental procedure</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A standardized feeding station was set up at each of the sites, with the behavior of free-living native birds being observed under a range of experimental and control conditions. Feeding stations comprised 2 squirrel proof feeders (The Nuttery NT28 and NT22 ASIN: B0007LQ3WQ, dimensions 20.3×20.3×34.3cm) hung on a steel shepherd hook pole Gardman (ASIN: B001F36RA8, height 218cm). Feeders were placed approximately 200cm above the ground as parakeets generally feed in plants and trees above ground (
   <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">Clergeau and Vergnes 2011</a>) and therefore any species affected by their presence are more likely to be species which also feed at this level rather than ground feeding species. Sunflower and peanuts were selected for use as the food sources as they are known to attract both parakeets and a variety of other birds species and therefore provided a high value food source likely to attract a variety of bird species (
   <a rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0048">Lack 1986</a>; 
   <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">Cowie and Simons 1991</a>;

   <a rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0008">Bonter et al. 2013</a>). Sites were located in positions that could be viewed from a hidden location in order to be able to view the experiment without disturbing visiting birds. The feeding station was also placed in an area that had enough space for the experimental equipment (i.e., room for both the feeding station and the camera and tripod) and that was not obscured by vegetation or other structures. Where possible the feeding station was placed where the garden’s previous feeding station had been so as to limit the need for habituation to the new feeding station. To allow habituation of the local birds to the feeders before the experiment was conducted, each feeder was supplied with peanuts and sunflower seeds respectively for 2 weeks. This period was similar to acclimatization periods used for other bird studies (e.g., 
   <a rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0081">Sol et al. 2011</a>; 
   <a rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0060">Orros and Fellowes 2012</a>). These feeders represented a localized, high value resource that could be standardized across sites independent of season and prevented interference from gray squirrels, which are the only other nonnative vertebrate species present in the site locations that use garden bird feeders.
  </p>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The behavioral experiments were conducted from May 2010 to February 2011 by H.L.P. or H.E.P., using 7 treatments that were designed to vary in the extent to which native birds were exposed to the presence of parakeets and control treatments. These consisted of 4 control treatments, which were an empty cage, a cage with a great spotted woodpecker in it, a cage with a great spotted woodpecker in it with a recording of a great spotted woodpecker call playing and an empty cage with just the call playing. In addition, there were 3 experimental treatments, these were a cage with a rose-ringed parakeet, a cage with a rose-ringed parakeet with a parakeet call playing, and an empty cage with just the parakeet call playing (see

   </div>
  </div>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both a caged live parakeet and a recording of its call were used as treatments, as birds are known to be sensitive to both sight and sound (
   <a rid="CIT0088" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0088">Sturkie 2000</a>). In addition to the control of an empty cage with no recording it was necessary to also use native controls, making it possible to test for the strength of any effect of neophobia or habituation to the parakeet.
  </p>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The great spotted woodpecker was chosen as a control species because it is the closest species in size that regularly feeds from hanging garden feeders, (rose-ringed parakeet: 400mm length, mass 120g; great spotted woodpecker: 220mm in length, mass 85g [
   <a rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0079">Snow et al. 1998</a>]) and its distribution overlaps with the study area (
   <a rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0004">Balmer et al. 2013</a>). Although smaller than the parakeet, this species has been observed to be aggressive at feeding stations in comparison to other birds and has been recorded successfully supplanting parakeets from feeding stations (
   <a rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0065">Pithon 1998</a>).
  </p>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 7 treatments were presented in a randomized order for 20min each (i.e., a total treatment time of 140min per site) generated through nonreplacement sampling in R (
   <a rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0068">R Core Development Team 2009</a>) for each individual site. For all treatments the cages (Montana KT3001, GTIN 04038374320048 46×63×53cm) were equipped with 2 metal bowls containing peanuts and water. For each treatment, the cage was placed on a stand at 0.3 m from the feeder station at the same height as the feeder for 20min. In the treatments involving sound, calls were played from a Ministry of Sound MOSMP020 MP3 player connected to 2 Skytronic 100.165 monitor speakers (frequency response 80–15000 Hz) played at full volume of an approximate amplitude of 80 dB(A), positioned on the ground directly below the cage. The great spotted woodpecker call was obtained from prerecorded material (
   <a rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0073">Sample 1996</a>), whereas the parakeet call was recorded from a series of vocalizations of an adult male rose-ringed parakeet in a garden in Richmond, Surrey, specifically for the study using a Sony Dictaphone. Both calls were general contact calls. Both calls were edited using Audacity 1.2.6 to minimize any background noise and repeated with intervals of random length (0–5 s) between calls to be of similar length (under 3min). These were played on repeat for the duration of the treatment.
  </p>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rose-ringed parakeet and great spotted woodpecker pairs (a male and female of each) used in the experimental trials were caught from the wild using a standard mist net under license from the British Trust for Ornithology and kept under Natural England (NE) licence (number 20101145) in an outside aviary between experiments. Aviaries were provisioned with nest boxes, ad libitum food and water, and provided sufficient room for flight. Each bird in a pair was used in alternate experiments in order to minimize stress and to control for any differences in behavior of visiting birds in response to differences in appearance due to sexual dimorphism. After all experiments were completed, the woodpeckers were given a 2-week soft-release at the catching site with open access to the aviary for food, water, and shelter. The parakeets were re-homed in captivity as required by the NE licence.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data collection</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The activity of native birds at the feeder was recorded using a small camcorder (Panasonic SDR-S156) mounted on a tripod 3 m from the feeders. Video recordings of each trial were watched subsequently to record each visiting bird’s species, duration of visit (in seconds), whether or not feeding occurred, and which food was eaten (sunflower seed or peanut). For sites within the current range of the parakeet population, visits made by wild parakeets to the feeding station during the trials were removed from the data before analysis (this included 136 visits altogether and occurred in 12 out of the 30 sites within the parakeet range). Data were recorded by trained volunteer research assistants, using standardized methods. Error checking was carried out by double checking a random 5-min sample of each video.</p>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental conditions of the feeder location for each trial were recorded to take into account any variables that might affect foraging behavior and visiting activity of birds within each location. These included; feeder position in the sun or shade as direct sunlight can affect perception of risk and therefore foraging (
   <a rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0036">Fernández-Juricic and Tran 2007</a>), cloud cover and rain (cloudy, rain, or clear sky) as rainfall can also affect foraging (
   <a rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0043">Hilton et al. 1999</a>), wind strength (0–3: no wind to strong wind) which has been found to affect visiting rates (
   <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">Cowie and Simons 1991</a>), time of year measured as months from May (1–10) to account for seasonal effects on feeding requirements (
   <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">Chamberlain et al. 2005</a>), time of day (AM or PM) to account for changes in foraging activity during the day (
   <a rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0008">Bonter et al. 2013</a>), and distance of the feeding station to vegetation cover (&lt;1 m, 1–2 m, &gt;3 m) as distance to cover is known to affect foraging in birds (
   <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">Cowie and Simons 1991</a>). Distance of the site from the center of London (measured in km from St. Paul’s Cathedral) was also measured and used to account for any between site differences due to differences in the level of urbanization in the surrounding area (
   <a rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0020">Crawley 2011</a>), which might be confounded with parakeet distribution.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data on the behavior of native birds at the feeding stations were analyzed to test for differences between experimental treatments in a number of dependent variables: model 1 tested the number of visits by native birds to the feeders; model 2 tested the proportion of visits that included a bout of feeding; model 3 tested the absolute time spent feeding within a visit; model 4 tested the proportion of time spent vigilant during a feeding visit. These were chosen to test for whether parakeets inhibited birds from visiting (model 1) and then whether and how they affected foraging success (models 2 and 3) and the trade-off between foraging and vigilance (model 4). Vigilance is defined here as the proportion of time spent not feeding during feeding visits to peanuts and is an indication of risk perception. The absolute time feeding is likely to be correlated with the amount of food taken and therefore an indication of foraging success. Behaviors other than feeding and vigilance, such as aggression or preening were extremely rare and so the assumption was made that when birds are on the feeding station and not feeding then they were being vigilant. Birds visiting the feeders were not individually marked and so multiple visits by the same individual could not be accounted for but all sites were treated equally. In addition to the experimental treatments described in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>, we also tested for an effect of whether or not the site was within the range of the invasive parakeet population.
  </p>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were analyzed using generalized linear models in R (
   <a rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0068">R Core Development Team 2009</a>), using the lme4 package (
   <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">Bates et al. 2012</a>). Models 1 and 3 were over dispersed so these included an observation-level random effect and were fitted using a Poisson log-normal error structure and a log link function (
   <a rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0032">Elston et al. 2001</a>). Models 2 and 4 were fitted using a binomial error structure and logit link function. Model 1 was analyzed using a data subset of the summed total visits for each treatment per site. Model 2 was analyzed using the full data set of each individual visit. Sunflower seeds were visited for such a short time per visit (median = 1 s, interquartile range [IQR] = 1, 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 2117) regardless of treatment, that it was not possible to analyze differences in time spent feeding. Therefore, only feeding visits to peanuts were analyzed for differences in time feeding, so models 3 and 4 were analyzed using a subset of only feeding visits where the bird fed on peanuts.
  </p>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In models the experimental feeding site identification was added as a random effect. Variables measured in each site were added into each model as fixed effects: inside or outside the parakeet range, cloud cover and rain, wind strength, sun or shade, time of day (AM or PM), time of year (number of months from May), distance of the feeding station to vegetation, and distance (km) from central London. Inside or outside the parakeet range was categorized as binomial (absent or present), as preliminary analysis using a continuous measure of parakeet numbers in the site ranging from 0 to 5 found no difference in visits between the sites ranging from 1 to 5. The order in which each treatment took place were also added as a fixed effect to account for any interference that may result in a time lag between exposure to a treatment and resumption of foraging (
   <a rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0077">Sih 1992</a>; 
   <a rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0034">Evans 2003</a>). For models 2, 3, and 4 the species visiting the feeding station were also added as a fixed effect to account for differences in behavior between species in response to the treatments. This variable could not be tested on model 1 due to it being a measure of total visits and therefore excluding details of individual visits. No explanatory variables included in the full models were highly correlated (
