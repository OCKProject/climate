 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In total, at the 30 sites inside the current range of the parakeet population, the feeding station was visited 6872 times (median = 96, IQR = 42–252 visits per site) and in the 11 sites outside the parakeet range the feeding station was visited 4021 times (149, 72–311). Across these visits 18 native bird species were observed on the feeding stations, which were predominantly blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>, 42% of visits) and great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>, 41%) (a summary of visits made by each species,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses demonstrated that at sites inside the current range of the parakeet population, experimental exposure to caged parakeets resulted in a significant reduction in the number of visits by native birds to the feeders (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2a</a>), a significant reduction in the number of visits that included a feeding bout (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2b</a>), a significant reduction in the absolute time spent feeding (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2c</a>), and a significant increase in the proportion of time spent vigilant (

For all these behaviors, changes in the same direction were also observed in the presence of a woodpecker (

The number of total visits to feeding stations was higher for 3 out of 4 of the control treatments (C1, C3, and C4) at sites outside the parakeet range compared with sites within (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3a</a>). However, notably, parakeet treatments (T1 and T2) resulted in a lower proportion of feeding events outside of the parakeet range than inside (

However, the parakeet call alone treatment (T3), which did have enough visits to compare (visits
