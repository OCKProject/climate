 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It should be noted that wild rose-ringed parakeets often forage gregariously and therefore monopolize a feeding site (
  <a rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0065">Pithon 1998</a>). During our experiment, 95 out of 136 visits by wild parakeets to the experimental feeding station were when one of our captive parakeets was present in the cage, further demonstrating parakeetsâ€™ gregarious nature. Given this we would expect that the impacts demonstrated here are a conservative estimate of those that would be seen with free-living parakeets.

 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been hypothesized that optimal foraging in urban settings can alter the community structure and result in biodiversity loss (
  <a rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0075">Shochat et al. 2004</a>). It is also common for invading species to establish where competition among the resident species is low (
  <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">Crawley et al. 1986</a>) and so the dominance of nonnative species can also be increased by the provision of artificial feeding stations in gardens (
  <a rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0011">Chace and Walsh 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0054">McKinney 2006</a>;

  <a rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0010">Cannon 2010</a>). The link between garden feeding and the success of invasive species is seen directly in Chicago, where the persistence and growth of the monk parakeet (
  <span class="italic">Myiopsitta monachus</span>) population is attributed to the generalist diet of the nonnative species and its sole use of bird feeders in winter (
  <a rid="CIT0603" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0603">South and Pruett-Jones 2000</a>). Clearly garden food provisioning plays a major role in the persistence of invasive populations, which in tandem with the temporally stable climate and homogenization of the environment makes the urban landscape favorable to nonnative species (
  <a rid="CIT0600" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0600">Garden et al. 2006</a>). Given our evidence for foraging disruption at artificial food sources and the potential reliance of the parakeets on garden bird feeders (
  <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">Clergeau and Vergnes 2011</a>), the exclusion of parakeets from access to garden bird feeders might benefit native species through reducing the interference competition. In addition, exclusion of parakeets would simultaneously reduce the foraging benefits of urban areas for the parakeets, which may in turn limit the persistence of the parakeet populations. Therefore, an interesting implication of this research is that exclusion of parakeets from garden bird feeders may provide an option for mitigating impacts of parakeets on garden birds.

 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we provide evidence demonstrating interference foraging competition between a nonnative bird and 2 native birds common to urban areas. While this study does not provide proof of any population level change as a result of the disrupted foraging, it does demonstrate a mechanism by which nonnative birds could potentially impact native species at the population level and shows a need for further investigation. The increased establishment of rose-ringed parakeets in the United Kingdom (

  <a rid="CIT0085" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0085">Strubbe and Matthysen 2008</a>) as well as other nonnative bird species in urban areas across the world (

  <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">Bonter et al. 2010</a>), highlights the potential for widespread occurrence of similar effects of foraging behavior on urban birds.
