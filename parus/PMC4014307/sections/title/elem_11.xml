 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings show that experimental exposure to parakeets influences the behavior of native birds, resulting in reduced feeding and increased vigilance. These changes in behavior are much more pronounced in the presence of a parakeet than in the presence of a dominant native species, the great spotted woodpecker. While visit rates drop significantly in the presence of a parakeet both inside and outside the current parakeet range, visits that do occur are more likely to result in feeding inside the range. Taken together, these results suggest that interference competition between a nonnative species and the native fauna does appear likely in this study system, and that some habituation may occur in the native populations.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interspecific interference competition between native and nonnative fauna is a concern as it may lead to reduced energy intake, and thus potentially lower the fitness of native birds (

   <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">Cresswell 2008</a>). Similarly, increased vigilance induced by the presence of nonnative species can diminish the relative value of a food resource through increasing access costs (
   <a rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0015">Cooper and Frederick 2007</a>).
  </p>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The majority of visits to the feeding stations were by blue tits and great tits. These species are common, ubiquitous birds in urban areas in the United Kingdom (
   <a rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0017">Cowie et al. 1988</a>; 
   <a rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0004">Balmer et al. 2013</a>). Interspecific competition between tit species has been shown to cause displacement of individuals of less dominant species to lower quality food sources in coniferous forest (
   <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">Alatalo et al. 1987</a>), and spatial displacement and niche compression of blue tits in oak woodland (
   <a rid="CIT0601" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0601">Herrera 1978</a>). The presence of parakeets may simply result in temporary displacement of native species from a food source, with minimal costs. Temporal niche shift behavior has been shown in the timing of great tit dawn singing in response to supplemental feeding (
   <a rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0072">Saggese et al. 2011</a>) and also in invasive mink (
   <span class="italic">Neovison vison</span>) avoiding 2 native mustelid species (
   <span class="italic">Lutra lutra</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Mustela putorius</span>) during foraging (
   <a rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0042">Harrington et al. 2009</a>). Our analyses did, however, control for time of day and found it was not a significant predictor of the number of visits to the feeding station. This suggests that parakeets may induce a spatial, rather than, temporal shift in native bird foraging behavior. Similar spatial shifts in response to environmental changes, such as loss of access to food resources, have been shown to lead to reduced population sizes (
   <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">Durell et al. 2005</a>, 
   <a rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0027">2006</a>; 
   <a rid="CIT0083" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0083">Stillman and Goss-Custard 2010</a>). Consistent displacement of native birds from high-quality resources may, therefore, be expected to have long-term implications for native species’ populations.
  </p>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are very few examples in the literature of dominance over food sources by nonnative species resulting in displacement of native species. Examples of this occurring with nonnative vertebrates include an invasive gecko (
   <span class="italic">Lepidodactylus lugubris</span>) in Hawaii (
   <a rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0064">Petren and Case 1996</a>) and the invasive gray squirrel (
   <span class="italic">Sciurus carolinensis</span>) in the United Kingdom (
   <a rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0045">Kenward and Holm 1993</a>) but see (
   <a rid="CIT0094" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0094">Wauters and Gurnell 1999</a>). The subtle changes in feeding behavior seen in response to parakeet presence may represent a mechanism for displacement, which to our knowledge would be the first case of such by a nonnative avian species and therefore merits further investigation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habituation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our finding of a higher likelihood of feeding in the presence of a parakeet within the parakeet range compared with sites outside, suggests habituation to parakeets following prior exposure. This is particularly evident considering the overall lower mean total number of visits in the sites within the parakeet range compared with those outside. Without data on individual behavior, it is not possible to distinguish whether this effect is due to an increased number of visits by bold individuals who have become accustomed to the parakeets, comparable to behavior seen in several other bird species exposed to a predator (
   <a rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0067">Quinn and Cresswell 2005</a>; 
   <a rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0059">van Oers 2005</a>; 
   <a rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0055">Minderman et al. 2010</a>; 
   <a rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0070">Rockwell et al. 2012</a>), but see 
   <a rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0016">Couchoux and Cresswell (2011)</a>; or, if the perception of risk lowers for all individuals with continued exposure (
   <a rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0030">Ellenberg et al. 2009</a>; 
   <a rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0071">Rodríguez-Prieto et al. 2011</a>). The former would suggest that some individuals may be disproportionately impacted by nonnative species’ presence, whereas the latter would indicate population-wide adjustment to the presence of a nonnative species, and potentially lower overall impact.
  </p>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to habituation to the presence of the parakeets, we also found some evidence of reinforcement behavior, such that native birds within the parakeet range were more vigilant when exposed to a parakeet call, which suggests that prior exposure to parakeet calls has an influence on behavior. This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating this initial lack of response of prey to the calls of a novel avian predator (
   <a rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0069">Reudink et al. 2007</a>; 
   <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">Elmasri et al. 2012</a>) and studies demonstrating learned association of predator cues (reviewed by 
   <a rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0039">Griffin et al. 2000</a>).
  </p>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is possible differences in native bird behavior between sites within and outside the parakeet range are due to differences associated with urbanization (
   <a rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0050">Lowry et al. 2013</a>). For example, bird species in urban areas, including blue tits and great tits, have been demonstrated to have differing behavioral adaptation to predators compared with rural areas (
   <a rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0056">Møller and Ibáñez-Álamo 2012</a>) and urban populations of song sparrow (
   <span class="italic">Melospiza melodia</span>) have been found to be bolder and show greater territorial aggression compared with rural populations (
   <a rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0033">Evans et al. 2010</a>). We did control for an urbanization effect in our analysis, by testing for an effect of distance from the city center, which was not found to be of importance. Regardless of the causes for the differences in response of birds inside and outside the parakeet range, the higher proportion of feeding visits at sites inside the range in the presence of a parakeet was still lower than the control treatments and therefore foraging visits were still less successful across all sites in the presence of a parakeet at a food source, despite the prior exposure. This indicates that the inhibition of foraging in the presence of a parakeet is a permanent effect and not just a case of neophobia.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecological implications</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It should be noted that wild rose-ringed parakeets often forage gregariously and therefore monopolize a feeding site (
   <a rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0065">Pithon 1998</a>). During our experiment, 95 out of 136 visits by wild parakeets to the experimental feeding station were when one of our captive parakeets was present in the cage, further demonstrating parakeets’ gregarious nature. Given this we would expect that the impacts demonstrated here are a conservative estimate of those that would be seen with free-living parakeets.
  </p>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been hypothesized that optimal foraging in urban settings can alter the community structure and result in biodiversity loss (
   <a rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0075">Shochat et al. 2004</a>). It is also common for invading species to establish where competition among the resident species is low (
   <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">Crawley et al. 1986</a>) and so the dominance of nonnative species can also be increased by the provision of artificial feeding stations in gardens (
   <a rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0011">Chace and Walsh 2006</a>; 
   <a rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0054">McKinney 2006</a>; 
   <a rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0044">Jones and Reynolds 2008</a>; 
   <a rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0010">Cannon 2010</a>). The link between garden feeding and the success of invasive species is seen directly in Chicago, where the persistence and growth of the monk parakeet (
   <span class="italic">Myiopsitta monachus</span>) population is attributed to the generalist diet of the nonnative species and its sole use of bird feeders in winter (
   <a rid="CIT0603" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0603">South and Pruett-Jones 2000</a>). Clearly garden food provisioning plays a major role in the persistence of invasive populations, which in tandem with the temporally stable climate and homogenization of the environment makes the urban landscape favorable to nonnative species (
   <a rid="CIT0600" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0600">Garden et al. 2006</a>). Given our evidence for foraging disruption at artificial food sources and the potential reliance of the parakeets on garden bird feeders (
   <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">Clergeau and Vergnes 2011</a>), the exclusion of parakeets from access to garden bird feeders might benefit native species through reducing the interference competition. In addition, exclusion of parakeets would simultaneously reduce the foraging benefits of urban areas for the parakeets, which may in turn limit the persistence of the parakeet populations. Therefore, an interesting implication of this research is that exclusion of parakeets from garden bird feeders may provide an option for mitigating impacts of parakeets on garden birds.
  </p>
  <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we provide evidence demonstrating interference foraging competition between a nonnative bird and 2 native birds common to urban areas. While this study does not provide proof of any population level change as a result of the disrupted foraging, it does demonstrate a mechanism by which nonnative birds could potentially impact native species at the population level and shows a need for further investigation. The increased establishment of rose-ringed parakeets in the United Kingdom (
   <a rid="CIT0089" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0089">Tayleur 2010</a>) and across Europe (
   <a rid="CIT0085" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0085">Strubbe and Matthysen 2008</a>) as well as other nonnative bird species in urban areas across the world (

   <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">Bonter et al. 2010</a>), highlights the potential for widespread occurrence of similar effects of foraging behavior on urban birds.
