 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our finding of a higher likelihood of feeding in the presence of a parakeet within the parakeet range compared with sites outside, suggests habituation to parakeets following prior exposure. This is particularly evident considering the overall lower mean total number of visits in the sites within the parakeet range compared with those outside. Without data on individual behavior, it is not possible to distinguish whether this effect is due to an increased number of visits by bold individuals who have become accustomed to the parakeets, comparable to behavior seen in several other bird species exposed to a predator (

  <a rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0016">Couchoux and Cresswell (2011)</a>; or, if the perception of risk lowers for all individuals with continued exposure (

  <a rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0071">Rodríguez-Prieto et al. 2011</a>). The former would suggest that some individuals may be disproportionately impacted by nonnative species’ presence, whereas the latter would indicate population-wide adjustment to the presence of a nonnative species, and potentially lower overall impact.

 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to habituation to the presence of the parakeets, we also found some evidence of reinforcement behavior, such that native birds within the parakeet range were more vigilant when exposed to a parakeet call, which suggests that prior exposure to parakeet calls has an influence on behavior. This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating this initial lack of response of prey to the calls of a novel avian predator (

  <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">Elmasri et al. 2012</a>) and studies demonstrating learned association of predator cues (reviewed by

 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is possible differences in native bird behavior between sites within and outside the parakeet range are due to differences associated with urbanization (
  <a rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0050">Lowry et al. 2013</a>). For example, bird species in urban areas, including blue tits and great tits, have been demonstrated to have differing behavioral adaptation to predators compared with rural areas (
  <a rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0056">Møller and Ibáñez-Álamo 2012</a>) and urban populations of song sparrow (
  <span class="italic">Melospiza melodia</span>) have been found to be bolder and show greater territorial aggression compared with rural populations (
  <a rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0033">Evans et al. 2010</a>). We did control for an urbanization effect in our analysis, by testing for an effect of distance from the city center, which was not found to be of importance. Regardless of the causes for the differences in response of birds inside and outside the parakeet range, the higher proportion of feeding visits at sites inside the range in the presence of a parakeet was still lower than the control treatments and therefore foraging visits were still less successful across all sites in the presence of a parakeet at a food source, despite the prior exposure. This indicates that the inhibition of foraging in the presence of a parakeet is a permanent effect and not just a case of neophobia.
