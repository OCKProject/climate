 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interspecific interference competition between native and nonnative fauna is a concern as it may lead to reduced energy intake, and thus potentially lower the fitness of native birds (

  <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">Cresswell 2008</a>). Similarly, increased vigilance induced by the presence of nonnative species can diminish the relative value of a food resource through increasing access costs (

 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The majority of visits to the feeding stations were by blue tits and great tits. These species are common, ubiquitous birds in urban areas in the United Kingdom (
  <a rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0017">Cowie et al. 1988</a>; 
  <a rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0004">Balmer et al. 2013</a>). Interspecific competition between tit species has been shown to cause displacement of individuals of less dominant species to lower quality food sources in coniferous forest (
  <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">Alatalo et al. 1987</a>), and spatial displacement and niche compression of blue tits in oak woodland (
  <a rid="CIT0601" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0601">Herrera 1978</a>). The presence of parakeets may simply result in temporary displacement of native species from a food source, with minimal costs. Temporal niche shift behavior has been shown in the timing of great tit dawn singing in response to supplemental feeding (
  <a rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0072">Saggese et al. 2011</a>) and also in invasive mink (
  <span class="italic">Neovison vison</span>) avoiding 2 native mustelid species (
  <span class="italic">Lutra lutra</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Mustela putorius</span>) during foraging (
  <a rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0042">Harrington et al. 2009</a>). Our analyses did, however, control for time of day and found it was not a significant predictor of the number of visits to the feeding station. This suggests that parakeets may induce a spatial, rather than, temporal shift in native bird foraging behavior. Similar spatial shifts in response to environmental changes, such as loss of access to food resources, have been shown to lead to reduced population sizes (
  <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">Durell et al. 2005</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0027">2006</a>; 
  <a rid="CIT0083" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0083">Stillman and Goss-Custard 2010</a>). Consistent displacement of native birds from high-quality resources may, therefore, be expected to have long-term implications for native speciesâ€™ populations.
 </p>
 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are very few examples in the literature of dominance over food sources by nonnative species resulting in displacement of native species. Examples of this occurring with nonnative vertebrates include an invasive gecko (
  <span class="italic">Lepidodactylus lugubris</span>) in Hawaii (
  <a rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0064">Petren and Case 1996</a>) and the invasive gray squirrel (
  <span class="italic">Sciurus carolinensis</span>) in the United Kingdom (
  <a rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0045">Kenward and Holm 1993</a>) but see (
  <a rid="CIT0094" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0094">Wauters and Gurnell 1999</a>). The subtle changes in feeding behavior seen in response to parakeet presence may represent a mechanism for displacement, which to our knowledge would be the first case of such by a nonnative avian species and therefore merits further investigation.
