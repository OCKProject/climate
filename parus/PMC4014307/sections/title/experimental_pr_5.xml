 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A standardized feeding station was set up at each of the sites, with the behavior of free-living native birds being observed under a range of experimental and control conditions. Feeding stations comprised 2 squirrel proof feeders (The Nuttery NT28 and NT22 ASIN: B0007LQ3WQ, dimensions 20.3×20.3×34.3cm) hung on a steel shepherd hook pole Gardman (ASIN: B001F36RA8, height 218cm). Feeders were placed approximately 200cm above the ground as parakeets generally feed in plants and trees above ground (
  <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">Clergeau and Vergnes 2011</a>) and therefore any species affected by their presence are more likely to be species which also feed at this level rather than ground feeding species. Sunflower and peanuts were selected for use as the food sources as they are known to attract both parakeets and a variety of other birds species and therefore provided a high value food source likely to attract a variety of bird species (

Sites were located in positions that could be viewed from a hidden location in order to be able to view the experiment without disturbing visiting birds. The feeding station was also placed in an area that had enough space for the experimental equipment (i.e., room for both the feeding station and the camera and tripod) and that was not obscured by vegetation or other structures. Where possible the feeding station was placed where the garden’s previous feeding station had been so as to limit the need for habituation to the new feeding station. To allow habituation of the local birds to the feeders before the experiment was conducted, each feeder was supplied with peanuts and sunflower seeds respectively for 2 weeks. This period was similar to acclimatization periods used for other bird studies (e.g.,

  <a rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0060">Orros and Fellowes 2012</a>). These feeders represented a localized, high value resource that could be standardized across sites independent of season and prevented interference from gray squirrels, which are the only other nonnative vertebrate species present in the site locations that use garden bird feeders.

 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The behavioral experiments were conducted from May 2010 to February 2011 by H.L.P. or H.E.P., using 7 treatments that were designed to vary in the extent to which native birds were exposed to the presence of parakeets and control treatments. These consisted of 4 control treatments, which were an empty cage, a cage with a great spotted woodpecker in it, a cage with a great spotted woodpecker in it with a recording of a great spotted woodpecker call playing and an empty cage with just the call playing. In addition, there were 3 experimental treatments, these were a cage with a rose-ringed parakeet, a cage with a rose-ringed parakeet with a parakeet call playing, and an empty cage with just the parakeet call playing (see

   </fn>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both a caged live parakeet and a recording of its call were used as treatments, as birds are known to be sensitive to both sight and sound (
  <a rid="CIT0088" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0088">Sturkie 2000</a>). In addition to the control of an empty cage with no recording it was necessary to also use native controls, making it possible to test for the strength of any effect of neophobia or habituation to the parakeet.
 </p>
 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The great spotted woodpecker was chosen as a control species because it is the closest species in size that regularly feeds from hanging garden feeders, (rose-ringed parakeet: 400mm length, mass 120g; great spotted woodpecker: 220mm in length, mass 85g [
  <a rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0079">Snow et al. 1998</a>]) and its distribution overlaps with the study area (
  <a rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0004">Balmer et al. 2013</a>). Although smaller than the parakeet, this species has been observed to be aggressive at feeding stations in comparison to other birds and has been recorded successfully supplanting parakeets from feeding stations (
  <a rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0065">Pithon 1998</a>).
 </p>
 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 7 treatments were presented in a randomized order for 20min each (i.e., a total treatment time of 140min per site) generated through nonreplacement sampling in R (
  <a rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0068">R Core Development Team 2009</a>) for each individual site. For all treatments the cages (Montana KT3001, GTIN 04038374320048 46×63×53cm) were equipped with 2 metal bowls containing peanuts and water. For each treatment, the cage was placed on a stand at 0.3 m from the feeder station at the same height as the feeder for 20min. In the treatments involving sound, calls were played from a Ministry of Sound MOSMP020 MP3 player connected to 2 Skytronic 100.165 monitor speakers (frequency response 80–15000 Hz) played at full volume of an approximate amplitude of 80 dB(A), positioned on the ground directly below the cage. The great spotted woodpecker call was obtained from prerecorded material (
  <a rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0073">Sample 1996</a>), whereas the parakeet call was recorded from a series of vocalizations of an adult male rose-ringed parakeet in a garden in Richmond, Surrey, specifically for the study using a Sony Dictaphone. Both calls were general contact calls. Both calls were edited using Audacity 1.2.6 to minimize any background noise and repeated with intervals of random length (0–5 s) between calls to be of similar length (under 3min). These were played on repeat for the duration of the treatment.
 </p>
 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rose-ringed parakeet and great spotted woodpecker pairs (a male and female of each) used in the experimental trials were caught from the wild using a standard mist net under license from the British Trust for Ornithology and kept under Natural England (NE) licence (number 20101145) in an outside aviary between experiments. Aviaries were provisioned with nest boxes, ad libitum food and water, and provided sufficient room for flight. Each bird in a pair was used in alternate experiments in order to minimize stress and to control for any differences in behavior of visiting birds in response to differences in appearance due to sexual dimorphism. After all experiments were completed, the woodpeckers were given a 2-week soft-release at the catching site with open access to the aviary for food, water, and shelter. The parakeets were re-homed in captivity as required by the NE licence.</p>
