 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall the patterns in response to treatments were consistent with those inside the current parakeet range (

The number of total visits to feeding stations was higher for 3 out of 4 of the control treatments (C1, C3, and C4) at sites outside the parakeet range compared with sites within (

During the 2 caged parakeet treatments there were so few feeding visits to peanuts, (T1,

  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3) that changes found for total feeding time and vigilance, in response to these 2 treatments could not be confidently compared (

However, the parakeet call alone treatment (T3), which did have enough visits to compare (visits 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 95 outside, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 63 inside), was shown to elicit a stronger vigilance response inside the parakeet range compared with outside (T3 outside range vs T3 inside range;
