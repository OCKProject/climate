 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Behavioral experiments were performed at 41 sites within a 50-km radius of the center of London, UK, using the London Natural History Society method of using St. Paul’s Cathedral as an approximate for the center of London (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). Sites comprised the gardens of members of the public who responded to advertisements made through the media, project website (
  <span xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.projectparakeet.co.uk" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.projectparakeet.co.uk</span> no longer online), local bird watching groups, and word of mouth and therefore the location of sites used were constrained by those offered, but still provided an adequate number of sites (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 41) spread across a broad area of London and the surrounds (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). Procedures for contacting members of the public were assessed and passed by Imperial College’s research ethics committee in April 2010. Sites were at least 200 m apart (closest distance between 2 sites 226 m, see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>) to minimize the risk of repeating the experiment on same individual native birds and were gardens that used bird feeders regularly to minimize the time needed for habituation of the birds to the feeding station. To test for potential habituation, gardens were classified as being either within or outside the current range of the invasive parakeet population. This was classified based on residents’ information and verification by observations made during the experiment. Parakeet absence was also verified by British Breeding Bird Survey parakeet presence–absence data for London and the Home Counties for 2009 (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). The range of the great spotted woodpecker covers the entire area of the study (
  <a rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0004">Balmer et al. 2013</a>) and garden owners verified that the species visited each garden used in the experiment regularly, therefore it was considered that garden birds’ exposure to great spotted woodpeckers would be similar across all sites.

Black circles represent parakeet free sites, white circles represent sites where parakeets were present, the solid gray area represents the area of Greater London, the lined polygon represents the area of the 2009 parakeet range (this is the extent of the Breeding Bird Survey 1 km
