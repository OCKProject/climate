 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data on the behavior of native birds at the feeding stations were analyzed to test for differences between experimental treatments in a number of dependent variables: model 1 tested the number of visits by native birds to the feeders; model 2 tested the proportion of visits that included a bout of feeding; model 3 tested the absolute time spent feeding within a visit; model 4 tested the proportion of time spent vigilant during a feeding visit. These were chosen to test for whether parakeets inhibited birds from visiting (model 1) and then whether and how they affected foraging success (models 2 and 3) and the trade-off between foraging and vigilance (model 4). Vigilance is defined here as the proportion of time spent not feeding during feeding visits to peanuts and is an indication of risk perception. The absolute time feeding is likely to be correlated with the amount of food taken and therefore an indication of foraging success. Behaviors other than feeding and vigilance, such as aggression or preening were extremely rare and so the assumption was made that when birds are on the feeding station and not feeding then they were being vigilant. Birds visiting the feeders were not individually marked and so multiple visits by the same individual could not be accounted for but all sites were treated equally. In addition to the experimental treatments described in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a>, we also tested for an effect of whether or not the site was within the range of the invasive parakeet population.

 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were analyzed using generalized linear models in R (
  <a rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0068">R Core Development Team 2009</a>), using the lme4 package (
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">Bates et al. 2012</a>). Models 1 and 3 were over dispersed so these included an observation-level random effect and were fitted using a Poisson log-normal error structure and a log link function (
  <a rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0032">Elston et al. 2001</a>). Models 2 and 4 were fitted using a binomial error structure and logit link function. Model 1 was analyzed using a data subset of the summed total visits for each treatment per site. Model 2 was analyzed using the full data set of each individual visit. Sunflower seeds were visited for such a short time per visit (median = 1 s, interquartile range [IQR] = 1, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 2117) regardless of treatment, that it was not possible to analyze differences in time spent feeding. Therefore, only feeding visits to peanuts were analyzed for differences in time feeding, so models 3 and 4 were analyzed using a subset of only feeding visits where the bird fed on peanuts.

 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In models the experimental feeding site identification was added as a random effect. Variables measured in each site were added into each model as fixed effects: inside or outside the parakeet range, cloud cover and rain, wind strength, sun or shade, time of day (AM or PM), time of year (number of months from May), distance of the feeding station to vegetation, and distance (km) from central London. Inside or outside the parakeet range was categorized as binomial (absent or present), as preliminary analysis using a continuous measure of parakeet numbers in the site ranging from 0 to 5 found no difference in visits between the sites ranging from 1 to 5. The order in which each treatment took place were also added as a fixed effect to account for any interference that may result in a time lag between exposure to a treatment and resumption of foraging (

  <a rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0034">Evans 2003</a>). For models 2, 3, and 4 the species visiting the feeding station were also added as a fixed effect to account for differences in behavior between species in response to the treatments. This variable could not be tested on model 1 due to it being a measure of total visits and therefore excluding details of individual visits. No explanatory variables included in the full models were highly correlated (

At each stage the reduced model was tested against the previous model to check that a significant amount of variation had not been lost using a chi-squared statistic in an Anova.
