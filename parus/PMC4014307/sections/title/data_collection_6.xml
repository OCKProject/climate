 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The activity of native birds at the feeder was recorded using a small camcorder (Panasonic SDR-S156) mounted on a tripod 3 m from the feeders. Video recordings of each trial were watched subsequently to record each visiting bird’s species, duration of visit (in seconds), whether or not feeding occurred, and which food was eaten (sunflower seed or peanut). For sites within the current range of the parakeet population, visits made by wild parakeets to the feeding station during the trials were removed from the data before analysis (this included 136 visits altogether and occurred in 12 out of the 30 sites within the parakeet range). Data were recorded by trained volunteer research assistants, using standardized methods. Error checking was carried out by double checking a random 5-min sample of each video.</p>
 <p content-type="indent" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental conditions of the feeder location for each trial were recorded to take into account any variables that might affect foraging behavior and visiting activity of birds within each location. These included; feeder position in the sun or shade as direct sunlight can affect perception of risk and therefore foraging (
  <a rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0036">Fernández-Juricic and Tran 2007</a>), cloud cover and rain (cloudy, rain, or clear sky) as rainfall can also affect foraging (
  <a rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0043">Hilton et al. 1999</a>), wind strength (0–3: no wind to strong wind) which has been found to affect visiting rates (
  <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">Cowie and Simons 1991</a>), time of year measured as months from May (1–10) to account for seasonal effects on feeding requirements (
  <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">Chamberlain et al. 2005</a>), time of day (AM or PM) to account for changes in foraging activity during the day (
  <a rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0008">Bonter et al. 2013</a>), and distance of the feeding station to vegetation cover (&lt;1 m, 1–2 m, &gt;3 m) as distance to cover is known to affect foraging in birds (
  <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">Cowie and Simons 1991</a>). Distance of the site from the center of London (measured in km from St. Paul’s Cathedral) was also measured and used to account for any between site differences due to differences in the level of urbanization in the surrounding area (
