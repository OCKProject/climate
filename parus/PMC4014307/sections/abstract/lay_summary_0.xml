 <p>Invasive rose-ringed parakeets caused behavioral changes in native garden birds that reduced their feeding rates. Understanding how invasive species impact native species can be complex, especially in urban environments where many other factors are also at play. We therefore used an experiment to disentangle these factors and demonstrate that parakeets are more disruptive than a dominant native competitor.</p>
