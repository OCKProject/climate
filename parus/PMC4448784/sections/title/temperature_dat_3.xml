  <span xlink:href="http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca</span>). Pitt Meadows is less than 20 km from our Davistead Farm study site. Mean monthly temperature at Pitt Meadows was highly correlated (
  <span class="italic">p</span> ≥ 0.95) with mean monthly and daily temperature at the Cloverdale weather station (20 km south of our study site), and at Vancouver Airport (40 km west), and thus provides a good index of variation in regional temperature.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a sliding window approach to determine the time period that provided the best correlation between the average daily temperature and the annual mean laying date [
  <a rid="RSOS140301C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS140301C10">10</a>]. We calculated Pearson's correlations between the mean annual laying dates and the mean, minimum or maximum daily temperature determined using a sliding window, where the window size varied from a minimum 10 days to 80 days for all possible windows between 1 January–31 March (prior to the earliest first-egg date of 1 April; using temperature data for different time periods, e.g. 1 January–30 April, or 1 January–31 December did not change the results). The time period during which the mean temperature provided the highest correlation with the mean laying date was taken to represent the best description of local environmental conditions important for timing of breeding [
  <a rid="RSOS140301C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS140301C10">10</a>]. For example, a window of 1–10 would represent temperatures for 10 days between 1 and 10 January (furthest from onset of egg laying), whereas a window of 81–90 would represent temperatures for 10 days from 22 to 31 March (just before onset of egg laying). We also confirmed the results of the sliding window analysis using a proportional hazard model which describes the probability per time unit that an event (in this case laying date) occurs, as a function of a basic probability (the baseline hazard) and one or more explanatory variables (in this case temperature) and outputs the best fit model [
  <a rid="RSOS140301C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS140301C21">21</a>]. Finally, we conducted univariate analysis of laying date and temperature for particular time periods to test specific hypotheses about how temperature might act as a cue: (i) using mean temperature for August of the preceding year to test for a delayed effect of temperature on larval tipulid survival based on Pearce-Higgins 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSOS140301C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS140301C22">22</a>] (see ‘Discussion’); and (ii) using mean temperature for the period 0–7 days, and 8–15 days prior to the first-egg date in each year, to test for short-term, direct effects of temperature on female reproductive development (see ‘Discussion’). Analyses were carried out using R v. 3.0.1 [
  <a rid="RSOS140301C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS140301C23">23</a>] or SAS v. 9.2 [
