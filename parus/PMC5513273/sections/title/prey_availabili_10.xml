 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caterpillars were abundant at both sites, and there was no variation in weekly caterpillar biomass between sites (Deep Bottom mean = 0.72 ± 1.6 mg, Presquile = 0.22 ±0.38 mg, Wilcoxon

   <p>Distribution of prothonotary warbler hatching dates by clutch (box whiskers; open for early clutch, hashed for late clutch) in relation to caterpillar biomass (A) and mayfly biomass (B) from both trap types (solid line emergence traps, dashed line light traps) at Deep Bottom Park and Presquile National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) throughout the 2014 breeding season. Medians, 25th and 75th percentiles (boxes), 10th and 90th percentiles (whiskers), and outliers (dots) are shown. Caterpillar data are pooled values from both sites while mayfly data are only from Deep Bottom because no mayflies were captured at Presquile NWR.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mayfly biomass differed significantly between the two sites. Despite weekly light‐trapping efforts, only one mayfly was caught in the vicinity of our nest boxes at Presquile NWR. At Deep Bottom, mayflies were abundant and captured throughout the nestling period (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece32400-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32400-fig-0002">2</a>). The day of maximum egg production and hatch date of the earliest nest (9 May) occurred 3 days before mayfly emergence (12 May). The date of maximum nestling demand occurred during a time of high mayfly biomass, and mayfly biomass remained high, although variable, for the duration of the season (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece32400-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32400-fig-0002">2</a>).
