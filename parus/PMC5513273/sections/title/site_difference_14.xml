 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to differences in growth rate between sites, we further examined site differences using a variety of fitness measures. The proportion of females that double brooded (Deep Bottom mean = 0.35, Presquile = 0.26, 
  <span class="italic">x</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.635, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.426) and average number of young fledged per female (Deep Bottom mean = 4.12 ± 3.0, Presquile = 3.97 ± 2.3, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = −0.26, df = 95, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.795) did not differ significantly between sites. The first clutch was initiated earlier at Deep Bottom (mean clutch initiation date = 3 May ± 2 days) compared with Presquile (13 May ± 3 days, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 2.86, df = 58.47, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.006). In addition, nestlings at Presquile remained in the nest longer (11.9 ± 1.1 days) than nestlings at Deep Bottom (11.4 ± 1.3 days, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 1.95, df = 106, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.053), which could be related to the slower growth rate observed at this site.
