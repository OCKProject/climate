 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sampling of mayfly availability</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a combination of Pennsylvania style light traps (Frost 
  <a rid="ece32400-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0016">1957</a>) and emergence traps (Davies 
  <a rid="ece32400-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0013">1984</a>) to sample mayfly abundance. At each site, eight emergence traps (0.86 m × 0.86 m) were placed approximately 10 m from the shore, four along the main stem of the river and four along the tributary, following the layout of the nest boxes. Emergence traps were deployed on 28 April and were checked weekly until soon after the first emergence (15 May), after which light traps were used as our primary weekly sampling method. Adult mayflies were collected from the emergence trap using a Heavy Duty Hand Held Aspirator from BioQuip (item number 2820GA). Light traps were set up 30 min prior to sunset and samples collected 2 h after sunset on evenings when there was no rain or strong wind. All collected insects were frozen until processing. All mayflies (Ephemeroptera, 
  <span class="italic">Hexagenia</span> spp) were picked from each sample, dried in the oven at 80°C for at least 24 h, and weighed (dry mass ± 0.0001 mg). Mayfly emergence from emergence traps was quantified as total g dry mass·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> of trap area·week
  <span class="sup">−1</span> to determine weekly rate of emergence. Weekly light trap samples were quantified as total mg of dry mass per hour after sunset.
