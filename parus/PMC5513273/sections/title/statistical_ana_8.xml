 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compared weekly caterpillar biomass between sites using a Wilcoxon rank‐sum test because the assumption of normality was not met (zero‐inflated distribution). The amount of food brought to nestlings (food score chick
  <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) was compared among nestling age classes using a one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and we assessed whether video start time influenced the amount of food brought to nestlings or the number of parental visits (chick
  <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) using simple linear regression. Assumptions of normality were met for these analyses based on Shapiro–Wilk tests (total food score 
  <span class="italic">w</span> = 0.981, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.166, total visits 
  <span class="italic">w</span> = 0.992, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.814).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the influence of site, date, and weekly availability on the prey types brought to nestlings, we conducted a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) that accounted for the interdependence of different prey types being fed (García‐Navas and Sanz 
  <a rid="ece32400-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0017">2011</a>). Specifically, the caterpillar and mayfly food scores at a nest are not independent, and the MANOVA tested for changes in prey type simultaneously as well as for univariate effects on prey types individually. The dependent variables in the MANOVA were mayfly food score chick
  <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and caterpillar food score chick
  <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. The independent variables were site, date, and the relative site availability of these prey items the week that the provisioning video was taken; caterpillar and mayfly availability were calculated from branch clippings and light trap samples, respectively. No mayflies were captured in the vicinity of nest boxes at Presquile despite weekly sampling efforts, yet some nestlings were fed mayflies at this site (see 
  <a rid="ece32400-sec-0009" ref-type="sec" href="#ece32400-sec-0009">Results</a>). We therefore assume that mayflies also peaked in the same week near Presquile such that nests were assigned the weekly mayfly availability values from Deep Bottom in the MANOVA. We also tested for an interaction between site and date on the type of prey delivered to nests.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to analyses, weekly mayfly biomass, weekly caterpillar biomass, and nest‐level provisioning food scores were log
  <sub>10</sub> (
  <span class="italic">x</span> + 1) transformed to improve normality. The transformation led to normal distributions for Deep Bottom food score values (Shapiro–Wilk test 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05) but not nest‐level mayfly food scores at Presquile (see 
  <a rid="ece32400-sec-0009" ref-type="sec" href="#ece32400-sec-0009">Results</a>) nor caterpillar and mayfly biomass collected each week to assess prey availability. However, because MANOVA is robust to violations of the normality assumptions when the sample sizes are large (nest‐level mayfly food scores 
  <span class="italic">n </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>40), we present the results but do not plot the regression line for the non‐normal data (Presquile mayfly food scores, see 
  <a rid="ece32400-sec-0009" ref-type="sec" href="#ece32400-sec-0009">Results</a>) in the figure showing these results. Further, because prey availability and use between sites were so different (see 
  <a rid="ece32400-sec-0009" ref-type="sec" href="#ece32400-sec-0009">Results</a>), we conducted subsequent analyses assessing growth rate and condition separately for each site.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine how diet influences mean nestling growth rate and body condition, we developed linear regression models for each site and used Akaike's information criterion (AIC
  <sub>c</sub>) adjusted for small sample size to compare the models (Burnham and Anderson 
  <a rid="ece32400-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0011">2002</a>). All provisioning data were collected at the brood level (not for each individual nestling), and we used brood mean growth rate and body condition as the response variables in these models. Before specifically testing the effects of mayfly and aquatic (mayfly plus other emerging aquatic insect) prey, we first assessed the following factors shown in previous studies to influence nestling growth rate and/or condition: date, mean brood age, brood size, male visits chick
  <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, and female visits chick
  <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (Neill and Holmes 
  <a rid="ece32400-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0033">1996</a>; Podlesak and Blem 
  <a rid="ece32400-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0037">2001</a>; Stodola et al. 
  <a rid="ece32400-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0044">2010</a>). Brood age was excluded in the body condition model as it was calculated separately for each age. We used backward stepwise regression with growth rate or body condition as the dependent variable and AIC
  <sub>c</sub> as the criterion for variable exclusion. The result of this stepwise procedure was then considered the base model upon which to test the hypothesis that aquatic prey influenced nestling growth rate and condition. We compared the best performing base model with models including either aquatic food score (chick
  <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) or mayfly food score (chick
  <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) using AIC
  <sub>c</sub> and adjusted 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> values to see whether these predictors improved model fit. Because mayfly and aquatic food score values from Presquile were zero‐inflated, we converted it to a categorical value at this site (aquatic or mayfly FS
  <sub>cat</sub>: 0 = nests fed no aquatic or mayfly prey, 1 = nests fed aquatic or mayfly prey); however, this was not necessary for mayfly and aquatic food scores at Deep Bottom (Shapiro–Wilk test 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05). Mayfly and aquatic food score values are highly correlated with each other and are never included in models at the same time.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lastly, we compared site‐level nestling growth rate and body condition using 
  <span class="italic">t</span>‐tests. Due to the large differences in prey availability and use at the two sites, we also compared site‐level nestling growth rate (separating Presquile nests that were and were not fed aquatic prey) using a Kruskal–Wallis test. We compared double brooding rate using a chi‐square analysis and number of young fledged, clutch initiation date, and length of the nestling period using 
  <span class="italic">t</span>‐tests. Eleven nests were excluded from analyses: two that were parasitized by brown‐headed cowbirds (
  <span class="italic">Molothrus ater</span>) at Presquile NWR, two with a brood age of ten at Presquile NWR, and seven with a brood size of one, three at Presquile NWR, and four at Deep Bottom. All analyses were carried out in JMP 11.2.0 (SAS Institute Inc. 
  <a rid="ece32400-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0040">2013</a>). Unless otherwise stated, results are given throughout as mean ± 1 standard deviation.
