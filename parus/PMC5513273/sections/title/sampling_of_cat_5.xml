 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate caterpillar abundance, we used a branch‐clipping apparatus and methods described by Johnson (
  <a rid="ece32400-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0023">2000</a>). Branch clipping was conducted weekly in 15‐m‐radius plots along near‐shore transects. Each week we collected three branch clippings, standardized by leaf mass, from four randomly selected plots (12 per site) for a total of 24 branch clippings per week between the two sites. Prothonotary warblers are generalist foliage‐gleaning insectivores (Petit et al. 
  <a rid="ece32400-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0036">1990b</a>), and during the breeding season, both males and females forage most often below 6 m, concentrating their foraging maneuvers on the middle and outer parts of trees and shrubs (Petit et al. 
  <a rid="ece32400-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0036">1990b</a>). We sampled the outer branches of the most common tree species in each plot at heights ranging from 0.5 to 6 m. Within a plot, three branch clippings were taken from three different trees.

All invertebrates were identified to order. The primary species of caterpillars collected were Geometridae. Both insects and leaves were dried at 80°C for at least 24 h and weighed (dry mass ± 0.0001 mg). Caterpillar biomass was calculated for each branch sample as mg caterpillar dry mass·mg
