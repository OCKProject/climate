 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MANOVA assessing prey type brought to individual nests demonstrated a significant multivariate effect whereby the amount of mayflies and caterpillars brought to the nests were different (Wilk's 
  <span class="italic">λ</span> statistic = 0.183, 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>10,206</sub> = 27.49, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt;
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.001). Specifically, prey items brought to nestlings varied with weekly mayfly biomass (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>2,103</sub> = 4.48, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt;
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.014), by site (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>2,103</sub> = 166.93, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt;
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.001) and by date (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>2,103</sub> = 14.04, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt;
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.001), and there was an interaction between site and date (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>2,103</sub> = 9.55, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt;
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.001). The types of prey brought to nestlings did not differ as a function of weekly caterpillar biomass (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>2,103</sub> = 2.47, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.090), although the relationship between weekly caterpillar biomass and caterpillar food score was positive. Multiple regression analysis indicated that 77% of the variation in the amount of mayflies brought to nestlings can be explained by weekly mayfly biomass (
  <span class="italic">β </span>= 0.120, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.035), site (Deep Bottom 
  <span class="italic">β </span>= 0.342, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt;
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.0001), date (
  <span class="italic">β </span>= −0.004, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.0002), and the interaction between site and date (Deep Bottom 
  <span class="italic">β </span>= −0.003, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.008). Significantly more mayflies were fed to nestlings at Deep Bottom than Presquile, and this amount declined throughout the season at Deep Bottom but stayed consistently low at Presquile (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece32400-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32400-fig-0004">4</a>A). About 33% of the variation in caterpillar prey brought to nestlings was explained by site (Deep Bottom 
  <span class="italic">β </span>= −0.088, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>&lt;
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.0001), date (
  <span class="italic">β </span>= 0.003, 
  <span class="italic">P = </span>0.002), and the interaction between site and date (Deep Bottom 
  <span class="italic">β </span>= 0.002, 
  <span class="italic">P </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0.047). Significantly more caterpillars were fed to prothonotary warbler nestlings at Presquile than Deep Bottom early in the season, but this difference decreased later in the season (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece32400-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32400-fig-0004">4</a>B).

   <p>Total mayfly (A) and total caterpillar (B) food score brought to nestling prothonotary warblers by date at the two study sites; Deep Bottom (closed circle, solid line) and Presquile (open circle, dotted line). The Presquile mayfly line was not plotted because it did not meet the assumptions of normality due to the high number of zero values (see text). Nests that were fed no mayflies or caterpillars were given values of 0.01 because zero values do not appear on a log scale.</p>
