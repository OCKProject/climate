 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prothonotary warblers are Neotropical migratory birds that nest in bottomland hardwood forests throughout the southeastern United States. Their nests are usually in cavities near or over water, and as such, they use aquatic and terrestrial prey resources. The most common prey items include caterpillars and spiders (terrestrial), and mayflies and midges (aquatic) (Petit et al. 
  <a rid="ece32400-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0035">1990a</a>). Prothonotary warblers are cavity nesters and will readily nest in artificial nest boxes, making them an ideal species to study their reproductive ecology and diet.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A long‐term study of prothonotary warblers breeding in nest boxes along the lower James River and its tributaries began in 1987 (Blem et al. 
  <a rid="ece32400-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0005">1999</a>). This study focused on two sites: Presquile National Wildlife Refuge (Presquile NWR) and Deep Bottom Park in Henrico County, Virginia. Deep Bottom Park is approximately 8 km upstream from Presquile NWR. The nest boxes are situated near the shoreline along the main stem of the river and in a smaller tributary (mean width = 20 m). River width from the mouth of the tributary at Deep Bottom Park is 185, and 325 m at Presquile NWR. Both sites are a combination of tidal freshwater swamp and bottomland hardwood forest, with green ash (

  <span class="italic">Acer rubrum</span>), sycamore (
  <span class="italic">Platanus occidentalis</span>), oak (
  <span class="italic">Quercus</span> spp.), black gum (
  <span class="italic">Nyssa sylvatica</span>), and hornbeam (
  <span class="italic">Carpinus caroliniana</span>) as the dominant tree species. Both sites are situated on river meanders; however, the site at Presquile has notably more sedimentation around the oxbow and deposition throughout the creek compared with Deep Bottom. This is likely the result of a channel cut made in 1934 at the base of the oxbow that turned Presquile NWR into an island.
