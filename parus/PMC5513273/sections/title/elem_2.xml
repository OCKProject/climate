  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prothonotary warblers are Neotropical migratory birds that nest in bottomland hardwood forests throughout the southeastern United States. Their nests are usually in cavities near or over water, and as such, they use aquatic and terrestrial prey resources. The most common prey items include caterpillars and spiders (terrestrial), and mayflies and midges (aquatic) (Petit et al. 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0035">1990a</a>). Prothonotary warblers are cavity nesters and will readily nest in artificial nest boxes, making them an ideal species to study their reproductive ecology and diet.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A long‐term study of prothonotary warblers breeding in nest boxes along the lower James River and its tributaries began in 1987 (Blem et al. 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0005">1999</a>). This study focused on two sites: Presquile National Wildlife Refuge (Presquile NWR) and Deep Bottom Park in Henrico County, Virginia. Deep Bottom Park is approximately 8 km upstream from Presquile NWR. The nest boxes are situated near the shoreline along the main stem of the river and in a smaller tributary (mean width = 20 m). River width from the mouth of the tributary at Deep Bottom Park is 185, and 325 m at Presquile NWR. Both sites are a combination of tidal freshwater swamp and bottomland hardwood forest, with green ash (
   <span class="italic">Fraxinus pennsylvanica</span>), red maple (
   <span class="italic">Acer rubrum</span>), sycamore (
   <span class="italic">Platanus occidentalis</span>), oak (
   <span class="italic">Quercus</span> spp.), black gum (
   <span class="italic">Nyssa sylvatica</span>), and hornbeam (
   <span class="italic">Carpinus caroliniana</span>) as the dominant tree species. Both sites are situated on river meanders; however, the site at Presquile has notably more sedimentation around the oxbow and deposition throughout the creek compared with Deep Bottom. This is likely the result of a channel cut made in 1934 at the base of the oxbow that turned Presquile NWR into an island.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nestling field surveys</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 110 nest boxes were monitored in 2014: 63 boxes at Deep Bottom Park and 47 boxes at Presquile NWR. Mean yearly temperature and total precipitation were consistent with climate data for this area (mean 15°C and 90.7 cm total rainfall). All boxes were positioned on metal conduit poles approximately 30 m apart over water at high tide and were checked 2–3 times each week during the breeding season (late April–mid‐July). Nest contents were recorded to determine dates for nest initiation (first egg), hatching, and completion for each clutch. As a species and population that often double broods (Bulluck et al. 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0009">2013</a>), there is a natural lull in hatching dates during the season between the early and later clutches. This lull occurred on May 28 such that nests with eggs that hatched prior to this date were classified as early clutches, and those nests whose eggs hatched after 28 May were classified as late clutches.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nestlings were carefully removed from the nest box (Fig. 
   <a rid="ece32400-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32400-fig-0001">1</a>) and fitted with a unique numbered aluminum band (USGS). We measured the mass and tarsus length of each nestling on two occasions between hatching and fledging (mean age of first weighing was 3–4 days, range 2–8 days, mean age of second weighing was 7–8 days, range 5–10 days, with hatch day = 0). We were not able to standardize the ages for these measurements due to the logistics of accessing the sites and boxes. Tarsus length was measured to 0.1 mm using dial calipers, and mass was measured to 0.1 g using a digital scale. Mean growth rates per brood were calculated as the change in mean mass between the first and second weighing dates, standardized by the number of days between measurements. Nestling body condition was calculated as the residuals from a regression of tarsus and mass at the second measurement, and was calculated for each age class separately (Schulte‐Hostedde et al. 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0041">2005</a>). All applicable institutional and/or national guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed. All research was approved by the Virginia Commonwealth University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol #AM10230) as well as the VA Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (permit #053965) and the US Department of Interior (USGS Bird Banding Laboratory permit #23486).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sampling of caterpillar availability</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate caterpillar abundance, we used a branch‐clipping apparatus and methods described by Johnson (
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0023">2000</a>). Branch clipping was conducted weekly in 15‐m‐radius plots along near‐shore transects. Each week we collected three branch clippings, standardized by leaf mass, from four randomly selected plots (12 per site) for a total of 24 branch clippings per week between the two sites. Prothonotary warblers are generalist foliage‐gleaning insectivores (Petit et al. 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0036">1990b</a>), and during the breeding season, both males and females forage most often below 6 m, concentrating their foraging maneuvers on the middle and outer parts of trees and shrubs (Petit et al. 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0036">1990b</a>). We sampled the outer branches of the most common tree species in each plot at heights ranging from 0.5 to 6 m. Within a plot, three branch clippings were taken from three different trees.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a branch was collected, it was carefully inspected for invertebrates and all leaves were removed at the base of the petiole and collected. All invertebrates were identified to order. The primary species of caterpillars collected were Geometridae. Both insects and leaves were dried at 80°C for at least 24 h and weighed (dry mass ± 0.0001 mg). Caterpillar biomass was calculated for each branch sample as mg caterpillar dry mass·mg
   <span class="sup">−1</span> leaf dry mass, and weekly averages were calculated for each site.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sampling of mayfly availability</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a combination of Pennsylvania style light traps (Frost 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0016">1957</a>) and emergence traps (Davies 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0013">1984</a>) to sample mayfly abundance. At each site, eight emergence traps (0.86 m × 0.86 m) were placed approximately 10 m from the shore, four along the main stem of the river and four along the tributary, following the layout of the nest boxes. Emergence traps were deployed on 28 April and were checked weekly until soon after the first emergence (15 May), after which light traps were used as our primary weekly sampling method. Adult mayflies were collected from the emergence trap using a Heavy Duty Hand Held Aspirator from BioQuip (item number 2820GA). Light traps were set up 30 min prior to sunset and samples collected 2 h after sunset on evenings when there was no rain or strong wind. All collected insects were frozen until processing. All mayflies (Ephemeroptera, 
   <span class="italic">Hexagenia</span> spp) were picked from each sample, dried in the oven at 80°C for at least 24 h, and weighed (dry mass ± 0.0001 mg). Mayfly emergence from emergence traps was quantified as total g dry mass·m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> of trap area·week
   <span class="sup">−1</span> to determine weekly rate of emergence. Weekly light trap samples were quantified as total mg of dry mass per hour after sunset.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantifying nestling diet</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nestling diet was quantified using video observations. A Canon FS400 handheld standard‐definition camera (min/max focal length = 2.6/96.2 mm) was placed 2–4 m from the nest box with a clear view of the nest box opening for at least 1.09 h (mean video length was 2.55 h, range 1.09–3.75 h). All video observations were conducted in the mornings (6:00–12:30) when the nestlings were 6–9 days old. We observed no difference in feeding behavior in the presence of the video cameras (e.g., prolonged nest vigilance or excessive chipping around nest or camera), and cameras have been successfully used to quantify nestling provisioning in other warbler species (Stodola et al. 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0044">2010</a>). Videos were reviewed by four observers for the identification of food items brought to the nest. All observers were initially trained by watching and scoring the same video and then discussing any interobserver differences, and regular meetings were held to discuss identification of any questionable prey items. For each visit, we recorded the number and size of food item(s) as well as parent sex using plumage characteristics and color band combinations. When possible, food items were identified to one of the following orders: Lepidoptera (caterpillar – terrestrial), Ephemeroptera (mayfly – aquatic), Araneae (spider – terrestrial), Orthoptera (grasshopper – terrestrial), Odonata (dragonfly – aquatic), other terrestrial (i.e., Coleoptera larvae or pupae), or unknown.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The length (size) of food was estimated relative to the parents' bill (1 = smaller than bill, 2 = same size as bill, 3 = larger than bill) following Beck (
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0003">2010</a>) and Stodola et al. (
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0044">2010</a>). These size estimations were used to calculate a food score. A food score was calculated for each visit as the food size multiplied by the number of items. These food scores were totaled for each prey type and for each nest. If the item size could not be estimated because the item was too small (e.g., inside the beak), it received a size of one. If an item could not be identified due to visual obstruction, it was classified as a nonvisualized unknown prey item and did not receive a size score. In these cases, we assumed that nonvisualized prey items were consistent with the sizes of identified items, and calculated an adjusted food score estimate. To calculate the adjusted food score estimate, the number of visits with nonvisualized prey items was multiplied by the average food score per visualized item for that parent. These values provided an estimated food score of the nonvisualized unknown item(s). This was performed for males and females separately and added to the total food score, creating a total adjusted food score for that nest. When an item was not visualized but a parent displayed normal feeding behaviors such as perching on the box entrance and lowering its head and neck into the box, it was assumed one item was being fed. All diet variables were standardized by number of nestlings and video length (chick
   <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
   <span class="sup">−1</span>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compared weekly caterpillar biomass between sites using a Wilcoxon rank‐sum test because the assumption of normality was not met (zero‐inflated distribution). The amount of food brought to nestlings (food score chick
   <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) was compared among nestling age classes using a one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and we assessed whether video start time influenced the amount of food brought to nestlings or the number of parental visits (chick
   <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) using simple linear regression. Assumptions of normality were met for these analyses based on Shapiro–Wilk tests (total food score 
   <span class="italic">w</span> = 0.981, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.166, total visits 
   <span class="italic">w</span> = 0.992, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.814).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the influence of site, date, and weekly availability on the prey types brought to nestlings, we conducted a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) that accounted for the interdependence of different prey types being fed (García‐Navas and Sanz 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0017">2011</a>). Specifically, the caterpillar and mayfly food scores at a nest are not independent, and the MANOVA tested for changes in prey type simultaneously as well as for univariate effects on prey types individually. The dependent variables in the MANOVA were mayfly food score chick
   <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
   <span class="sup">−1</span> and caterpillar food score chick
   <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
   <span class="sup">−1</span>. The independent variables were site, date, and the relative site availability of these prey items the week that the provisioning video was taken; caterpillar and mayfly availability were calculated from branch clippings and light trap samples, respectively. No mayflies were captured in the vicinity of nest boxes at Presquile despite weekly sampling efforts, yet some nestlings were fed mayflies at this site (see 
   <a rid="ece32400-sec-0009" ref-type="sec" href="#ece32400-sec-0009">Results</a>). We therefore assume that mayflies also peaked in the same week near Presquile such that nests were assigned the weekly mayfly availability values from Deep Bottom in the MANOVA. We also tested for an interaction between site and date on the type of prey delivered to nests.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to analyses, weekly mayfly biomass, weekly caterpillar biomass, and nest‐level provisioning food scores were log
   <sub>10</sub> (
   <span class="italic">x</span> + 1) transformed to improve normality. The transformation led to normal distributions for Deep Bottom food score values (Shapiro–Wilk test 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05) but not nest‐level mayfly food scores at Presquile (see 
   <a rid="ece32400-sec-0009" ref-type="sec" href="#ece32400-sec-0009">Results</a>) nor caterpillar and mayfly biomass collected each week to assess prey availability. However, because MANOVA is robust to violations of the normality assumptions when the sample sizes are large (nest‐level mayfly food scores 
   <span class="italic">n </span>=
   <span class="italic"> </span>40), we present the results but do not plot the regression line for the non‐normal data (Presquile mayfly food scores, see 
   <a rid="ece32400-sec-0009" ref-type="sec" href="#ece32400-sec-0009">Results</a>) in the figure showing these results. Further, because prey availability and use between sites were so different (see 
   <a rid="ece32400-sec-0009" ref-type="sec" href="#ece32400-sec-0009">Results</a>), we conducted subsequent analyses assessing growth rate and condition separately for each site.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine how diet influences mean nestling growth rate and body condition, we developed linear regression models for each site and used Akaike's information criterion (AIC
   <sub>c</sub>) adjusted for small sample size to compare the models (Burnham and Anderson 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0011">2002</a>). All provisioning data were collected at the brood level (not for each individual nestling), and we used brood mean growth rate and body condition as the response variables in these models. Before specifically testing the effects of mayfly and aquatic (mayfly plus other emerging aquatic insect) prey, we first assessed the following factors shown in previous studies to influence nestling growth rate and/or condition: date, mean brood age, brood size, male visits chick
   <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, and female visits chick
   <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (Neill and Holmes 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0033">1996</a>; Podlesak and Blem 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0037">2001</a>; Stodola et al. 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0044">2010</a>). Brood age was excluded in the body condition model as it was calculated separately for each age. We used backward stepwise regression with growth rate or body condition as the dependent variable and AIC
   <sub>c</sub> as the criterion for variable exclusion. The result of this stepwise procedure was then considered the base model upon which to test the hypothesis that aquatic prey influenced nestling growth rate and condition. We compared the best performing base model with models including either aquatic food score (chick
   <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) or mayfly food score (chick
   <span class="sup">−1</span>·h
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) using AIC
   <sub>c</sub> and adjusted 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> values to see whether these predictors improved model fit. Because mayfly and aquatic food score values from Presquile were zero‐inflated, we converted it to a categorical value at this site (aquatic or mayfly FS
   <sub>cat</sub>: 0 = nests fed no aquatic or mayfly prey, 1 = nests fed aquatic or mayfly prey); however, this was not necessary for mayfly and aquatic food scores at Deep Bottom (Shapiro–Wilk test 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05). Mayfly and aquatic food score values are highly correlated with each other and are never included in models at the same time.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lastly, we compared site‐level nestling growth rate and body condition using 
   <span class="italic">t</span>‐tests. Due to the large differences in prey availability and use at the two sites, we also compared site‐level nestling growth rate (separating Presquile nests that were and were not fed aquatic prey) using a Kruskal–Wallis test. We compared double brooding rate using a chi‐square analysis and number of young fledged, clutch initiation date, and length of the nestling period using 
   <span class="italic">t</span>‐tests. Eleven nests were excluded from analyses: two that were parasitized by brown‐headed cowbirds (
   <span class="italic">Molothrus ater</span>) at Presquile NWR, two with a brood age of ten at Presquile NWR, and seven with a brood size of one, three at Presquile NWR, and four at Deep Bottom. All analyses were carried out in JMP 11.2.0 (SAS Institute Inc. 
   <a rid="ece32400-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32400-bib-0040">2013</a>). Unless otherwise stated, results are given throughout as mean ± 1 standard deviation.
