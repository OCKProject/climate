 <div class="caption">
  <p>Distribution of prothonotary warbler hatching dates by clutch (box whiskers; open for early clutch, hashed for late clutch) in relation to caterpillar biomass (A) and mayfly biomass (B) from both trap types (solid line emergence traps, dashed line light traps) at Deep Bottom Park and Presquile National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) throughout the 2014 breeding season. Medians, 25th and 75th percentiles (boxes), 10th and 90th percentiles (whiskers), and outliers (dots) are shown. Caterpillar data are pooled values from both sites while mayfly data are only from Deep Bottom because no mayflies were captured at Presquile NWR.</p>
