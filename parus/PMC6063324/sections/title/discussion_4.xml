 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently, many avian species in Europe migrate and breed earlier as a result of higher temperatures caused by global climate changes (DeLeon et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2011</a>; Fletcher et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2013</a>; Charmantier and Gienapp 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2014</a>). The great tit and the blue tit are among such earlier breeding species (Bauer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2010</a>). Our previous studies show that extreme phenomena may act in opposition to general trends (Glądalski et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2014</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2016a</a>)—the generally warmer and earlier springs do not exclude spells of exceptionally unfavorable weather occasionally. In the present study, hatching delays of great tits and blue tits were highly correlated with temperatures during the mid-laying-early-incubating period. This study shows that the large temperature drop during the laying period in 2017 caused extreme hatching delays in both tit species at both our study areas. In all cases, the relationship was non-linear; therefore, it suggests that the hatching delays for low temperatures are disproportionately larger than for average conditions. It is difficult to tell whether hatching delay immense flexibility is a unique feature of great tits and blue tits. Several studies analyzed the potential of tits for adjusting the interval between laying and hatching date and excluding Cresswell and McCleery (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2003</a>), all those studies analyze only 1–3 breeding seasons (Monrós et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">1998</a>; Naef-Daenzer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2004</a>; García-Navas and Sanz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2011</a>; Kluen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2011</a>). Cresswell and McCleery (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2003</a>) suggested that birds increase their fitness by synchronizing their production of offspring with a peak of food abundance (in the case of tits, caterpillars are the optimal food for nestlings). This synchronization may be accomplished by varying the moment of clutch initiation (and this is very flexible in tits), but temperature characteristics during the egg production phase may delay or accelerate the caterpillar peak. Another way of synchronization may be downsizing of the clutch, laying gaps or delaying/accelerating the onset of incubation (Tomás 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2015</a>). Tomás (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2015</a>) even suggests that the hatching date should be analyzed as a more proper phenological trait than the laying date because of those mechanisms that allow a female to synchronize her production of offspring with a peak of food abundance. Laying gaps may be caused also by food shortage (a low temperature inhibits activity of insects (Mellanby 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">1939</a>; Bale 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2002</a>) and may reduce prey accessibility for birds) or increased costs of thermoregulation during egg laying period (Nilsson and Svensson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1993a</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">b</a>). But the “strategy” and the “constraint” hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and probably both energetic limitations and behavioral decisions contributed to the observed hatching delays (Naef-Daenzer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2004</a>). Monrós et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">1998</a>) conclude that some delays in the hatching date could be beneficial for parents and offspring, since they seemed to allow for a better adjustment to changes in environmental conditions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference in hatching delay between the study areas and years (thus also interaction) in both tit species may be caused by a difference in phenology of great tits and blue tits in combination with a difference in phenology of the study habitats (blue tits tend to initiate clutch mean 1.5 days earlier than great tits in the parkland area and mean 2.5 earlier in the forest area, unpublished data). Urban environments are usually associated with earlier clutches in tits (Bańbura and Bańbura 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2012</a>; Seress and Liker 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2015</a>; Marini et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2017</a>). Taxonomic composition of tree flora in the parkland results in earlier leafing—buds and thus larvae on poplars and birches (the parkland) appear earlier than on oaks (the forest) (Glądalski et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2015</a>; Wawrzyniak et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2015</a>). The leafing phenology directly influences the occurrence of caterpillars (the most important component of the diet of chicks, sometimes supplemented by spiders and other insects (Blondel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">1993</a>)). Those shifts in timing may affect the hatching delay because when the drop of a temperature happens birds in one study area may be a few days later in clutch completion or vice versa.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper is based on the occurrence of a cold spell as a natural experiment in which we could not control environmental conditions and properly ascribe initiated clutches to treatments. This results from the fact that it is obviously not possible to experimentally manipulate the ambient temperature in the field. We see two ways in which experiments capable of identifying more precisely at least some proximate mechanisms underlying hatching delays could be performed. One way would be to use indoor aviaries to manipulate thermal conditions during the egg laying stage of breeding. The other way, available in the field in the case of hole-nesting birds, would be experimental cooling of nestboxes at the time of egg laying. As far as we know, such experimental cooling has only been used to study different effects of thermal conditions for incubation so far (e.g., Alvarez and Barba 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2014</a>).
