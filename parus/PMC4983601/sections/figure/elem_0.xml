 <div class="caption">
  <p>Box plots of laying date in relation to intensity of urbanization in four passerine bird species in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Box plots show medians, quartiles, 5‐ and 95‐percentiles, and extreme values. Width of box plots reflects sample size (study populations/total number of years: 100/1125, 138/1439, 66/592, and 23/259 for blue tit, great tit, collared flycatcher, and pied flycatcher, respectively). Intensity of urbanization was estimated as the local density of buildings per km² and log‐transformed.</p>
