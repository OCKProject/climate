  <p>Interdependence among phenotypic dimensions, plasticity, flexibility and environmental influences jointly affect body size in snakes. Schematic representation of the many ways by which different phenotypic dimensions interact and are influenced by internal and external environmental factors and how they may jointly contribute to within- and among-individual variation in growth rate and body size of snakes. This example illustrates that individuals are complex integrated units that cannot be decomposed into a suite of independent â€˜traits', and that variation in a given phenotypic dimension can be influenced by combinations of both genes, irreversible developmental plasticity and by reversible phenotypic flexibility in response to changes along different environmental factors.
