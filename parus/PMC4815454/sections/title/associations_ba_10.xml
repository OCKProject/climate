 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indications of costs or benefits of plasticity might be gained from comparisons of performance of different genotypes or between populations subjected to different environmental conditions (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106" href="#bib106">Wund, 2012</a>). Similarly, associations of variation in single- or multivariate trait plasticity with changes along environmental gradients can inform about which factors and conditions might promote the evolution of induced phenotypic variation. It is also possible to test for associations of plasticity with fitness in the wild, but this requires tedious analyses, and interpretation of results is not straight forward (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3" href="#bib3">Araya-Ajoy and Dingemanse (2014)</a> proposed an analytical approach that allows for studying (co)variation in labile behavioural character complexes both within and among individuals using multivariate mixed-effects models. Their approach resembles to some extent the one put forward by 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57" href="#bib57">Nussey 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2007)
  </a> for quantifying, comparing and partitioning variation among individuals and populations in reaction norms of labile life-history traits based on longitudinal data from natural populations. Comparisons among populations that inhabit different environments may help identify potential drivers of plasticity evolution and suggest how plasticity can contribute to evolutionary differentiation within species (see, for example,

  </a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56" href="#bib56">Nunes 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2013
  </a>). On a larger scale, phylogeny-based comparative analyses can be used to infer about the role of plasticity for evolutionary diversification among species and for speciation (see, for example, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15" href="#bib15">Colbourne 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 1997

  </a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81" href="#bib81">Schwander and Leimar, 2011</a>). However, with a whole organism perspective on plasticity (that is, acknowledging that homeostasis in one particular phenotypic dimension is mediated by plasticity or flexibility in other dimension(s)), it is difficult to envisage how to perform such comparisons and demonstrate such associationsâ€”let alone to establish causation.
