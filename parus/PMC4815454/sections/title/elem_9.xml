 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To put the predictions about plasticity to empirical tests, we must be able to quantify, compare and ultimately manipulate the level of and capacity to express plasticity. This is true not only for the proposed population-level consequences (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102" href="#bib102">Wennersten and Forsman, 2012</a>); the need to quantify, compare and manipulate plasticity also applies if we want to investigate, for example, whether plasticity influences fitness, whether it is adaptive and whether it is costly (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indications of costs or benefits of plasticity might be gained from comparisons of performance of different genotypes or between populations subjected to different environmental conditions (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106" href="#bib106">Wund, 2012</a>). Similarly, associations of variation in single- or multivariate trait plasticity with changes along environmental gradients can inform about which factors and conditions might promote the evolution of induced phenotypic variation. It is also possible to test for associations of plasticity with fitness in the wild, but this requires tedious analyses, and interpretation of results is not straight forward (

    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2007

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9" href="#bib9">Brommer, 2013</a>). For instance, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3" href="#bib3">Araya-Ajoy and Dingemanse (2014)</a> proposed an analytical approach that allows for studying (co)variation in labile behavioural character complexes both within and among individuals using multivariate mixed-effects models. Their approach resembles to some extent the one put forward by 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57" href="#bib57">Nussey 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2007)
   </a> for quantifying, comparing and partitioning variation among individuals and populations in reaction norms of labile life-history traits based on longitudinal data from natural populations. Comparisons among populations that inhabit different environments may help identify potential drivers of plasticity evolution and suggest how plasticity can contribute to evolutionary differentiation within species (see, for example, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11" href="#bib11">Carroll and Corneli, 1995</a>; 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70" href="#bib70">Pollard

   </a>; 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56" href="#bib56">Nunes 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2013
   </a>). On a larger scale, phylogeny-based comparative analyses can be used to infer about the role of plasticity for evolutionary diversification among species and for speciation (see, for example, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15" href="#bib15">Colbourne

However, with a whole organism perspective on plasticity (that is, acknowledging that homeostasis in one particular phenotypic dimension is mediated by plasticity or flexibility in other dimension(s)), it is difficult to envisage how to perform such comparisons and demonstrate such associationsâ€”let alone to establish causation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How to manipulate plasticity in order to establish causation?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies based on observational approaches can offer important insights, generate hypothesis and testable predictions and uncover patterns and associations in accordance or disagreement with predictions. However, demonstrating causal relationships and mechanisms linking either variation in the capacity for plasticity itself or plasticity-induced phenotypic variation to aspects of individual or population fitness is complicated because it requires experimental manipulation, replication and controlled comparisons (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24" href="#bib24">Forsman, 2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To experimentally manipulate the level of or capacity for plasticity seems very challenging, at least if one aims to test for effects of the capacity to express plasticity or flexibility (independent of genetic variation), and if one is concerned with whole organism rather than single trait plasticity. Artificial selection or genetic engineering might be used to increase or reduce levels of plasticity-induced phenotypic variation (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42" href="#bib42">Krebs and Feder, 1998</a>; 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20" href="#bib20">Feder, 1999</a>). However, interpretation of such manipulation studies is not straight forward, because of the potential for pleiotropy and epistasis (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50" href="#bib50">Lynch and Walsh, 1998</a>), and because changes in plasticity of the focal trait may be accompanied by increased or decreased plasticity in buffering traits. Phenotypic engineering based on hormonal treatments offers another possibility to experimentally manipulate the phenotypic expression of plastic and flexible traits (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85" href="#bib85">Sinervo and Huey, 1990</a>; 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41" href="#bib41">Ketterson 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 1996
   </a>), but again interpretation of results is complicated because hormones can have a multitude of cascading and interacting effects on organismal functioning. To test for effects and consequences of plasticity based on comparisons between experimental treatments that consist of unmanipulated individuals with naturally high versus low plasticity is equally problematic, because differences in plasticity between treatments would not be independent of genetic variation.
