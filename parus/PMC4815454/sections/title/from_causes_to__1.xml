 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the questions of how interindividual variation and plasticity influence the performance and ecological success of individuals, populations and species (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102" href="#bib102">Wennersten and Forsman, 2012</a>). Overall, theoretical models agree that phenotypically and genetically more variable populations are predicted to be associated with broader niches, reduced intraspecific competition, increased productivity and population growth rate, decreased vulnerability to environmental changes, dampened fluctuations in population size, increased establishment success, increased invasiveness, larger distribution ranges, decreased extinction risk and increased rate of speciation as compared with less variable populations (reviewed by 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25" href="#bib25">Forsman 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2008
  </a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102" href="#bib102">Wennersten and Forsman, 2012</a> and references therein). 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102" href="#bib102">Wennersten and Forsman (2012)</a> systematically evaluate whether the consequences of interindividual variation are likely to be similar or different depending on the nature of the source of variation. Despite some exceptions with regard to temporal and spatial scales, the population-level consequences listed above are, at first glance, largely similar regardless of whether the variation stems from genetic polymorphism (allelic variation at coding loci), plasticity or randomized phenotype switching (see 
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> in 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102" href="#bib102">Wennersten and Forsman, 2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The overall agreement with regard to consequences is in part illusory, because the mechanisms that mediate the consequences of plasticity versus polymorphism are sometimes different (for a discussion and examples see 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102" href="#bib102">Wennersten and Forsman, 2012</a>). Furthermore, predictions are sometimes similar because models on the consequences of plasticity build in part on the assumption that there are heritable differences among genotypes in norms of reaction (how the phenotypic expression of genotypes change along an environmental gradient), in which case the distinction between genetic polymorphism and plasticity is debatable (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103" href="#bib103">West-Eberhard, 2003</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44" href="#bib44">Leimar, 2009</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84" href="#bib84">Shuster, 2010</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102" href="#bib102">Wennersten and Forsman, 2012</a>). The consequences of plasticity for the ecological success of populations and individuals may also differ depending on whether one is concerned with variation among individuals in the capacity to express plasticity, or with interindividual phenotypic variation resulting from induced responses (which could also arise in the absence of genetic variation for plasticity if individuals utilize different microhabitats).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Developing, summarizing and comparing theoretical models and their predictions (see, for instance, 
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> in 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102" href="#bib102">Wennersten and Forsman, 2012</a>) are necessary and important tasks. Given the development during the past decades, the time is now ripe for empirical evidence to catch up with theoretical predictions concerning the consequences of plasticity. This is challenging, because, as argued below, to empirically evaluate the predicted consequences (and other issues) of plasticity requires methods allowing for quantifying and comparing ‘single trait' as well as ‘whole organism' plasticity. In addition, I claim that rigorous testing of predictions requires that we can experimentally
