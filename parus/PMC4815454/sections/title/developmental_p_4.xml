 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The term ‘developmental plasticity' is used by many researchers who focus on irreversible phenotypic variation in traits of individuals (or genotypes) that result from environmentally induced modifications of development and growth. Some traits remain largely fixed after maturity, such as structural body size in some unitary organisms, the number of vertebrae in limbed vertebrates and various morphological defence structures induced by the presence of predators. Reaction norms (or norms of reaction) that describe the association linking the phenotypic expression of genotypes to an environmental gradient, and genotype by environment interactions that refer to the differential phenotypic responses of alternative genotypes, are key components in this field (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103" href="#bib103">West-Eberhard, 2003</a>). Developmental plasticity is not restricted to traits that display quantitative variation, and it can result in discrete phenotypic classes that represent developmental threshold responses regulated by complex mechanisms including polygenic effects and shifts induced by continuously distributed underlying cues (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88" href="#bib88">Stearns, 1989</a>). A candidate example is wing polymorphism, the co-occurrence of flight-capable individuals that possess fully developed functional wings and flightless individuals with only partially developed or no wings that in some insect species seems to be regulated by juvenile hormone titres (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81" href="#bib81">Schwander and Leimar, 2011</a>). Plasticity can also involve mechanisms that operate between or across generations. In quantitative genetics and evolutionary biology, when the environment responsible for the induced phenotypic response consist of the (female) parent, the developmental plasticity is usually referred to as maternal effects (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The term ‘phenotypic flexibility' seems to be used primarily by researchers who focus on intraindividual plasticity, that is, reversible changes within individuals of labile, context-dependent physiological, morphological and life-history traits (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61" href="#bib61">Piersma and Drent, 2003</a>). Examples include metabolic and endocrine switches, shifts in the sizes of body parts and organ systems in relation to reproductive condition and metabolic demand, changes in colour patterns in relation to seasonality, changes within individuals among years in the timing of reproductive activities in response to weather conditions and changes in number of eggs or offspring between sequential reproductive events. Phenotypic flexibility is also applied to changes in behavioural traits (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98" href="#bib98">Tuomainen and Candolin, 2011</a>), for instance, as a result of learning and experience or adjustments depending on the presence or absence of predators, and encompasses both developmental behavioural plasticity and activational plasticity (for a thorough discussion see 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86" href="#bib86">Snell-Rood, 2013</a>). Despite the flexible nature of many behavioural traits, there is also a tendency of individuals to display consistency through time. In the behavioural plasticity literature, there is a growing interest in the causes and consequences of such consistency within individuals and repeatable variation among individuals, often referred to as animal personalities or ‘behavioural syndromes', for instance in the form of shyness versus boldness in different types of behaviour and across environmental contexts (
