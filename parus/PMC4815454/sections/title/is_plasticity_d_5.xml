 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Is plasticity distinct from genetic polymorphism?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are still articles published (including some of my own) that contain phrasings and arguments along the lines of genetics versus plasticity that might suggest that the authors do not consider plasticity a property of the genotype. There are probably examples of intraindividual reversible phenotypic flexibility and behavioural plasticity that are only loosely connected to genetics. Plasticity is not equivalent to genetic polymorphism, and their evolutionary dynamics can differ considerably (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75" href="#bib75">Saito 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2013
  </a>). However, irreversible developmental plasticity is not 
  <span class="italic">fundamentally</span> different from genetic determinism, except for the environment dependence of the expression of the phenotypic state, and they are best interpreted and analysed within a common, quantitative genetics, framework (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102" href="#bib102">Wennersten and Forsman, 2012</a>). Most phenotypic traits display a certain amount of plasticity, and plasticity includes genetic components (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63" href="#bib63">Pigliucci, 1996</a>,

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69" href="#bib69">Pigliucci and Preston, 2004</a>). Indeed, the existence of crossing norms of reaction, such that different genotypes display different phenotypic responses to environmental change, reflects an underlying genetic polymorphism (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88" href="#bib88">Stearns, 1989</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64" href="#bib64">Pigliucci, 2001</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103" href="#bib103">West-Eberhard, 2003</a>). This means that population-level consequences of plasticity predicted by theory are largely mediated by the same mechanisms as are those of genetic polymorphisms (for exceptions see 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102" href="#bib102">Wennersten and Forsman, 2012</a>).
