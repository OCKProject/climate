 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The focus of this review is ‘whole organism' (rather than ‘single trait') plasticity, how it may affect the ecological success of individuals, populations and species, and how to rigorously test predictions from theory regarding its consequences. Knowledge of the causes, mechanistic underpinnings and consequences of phenotypic plasticity and the capacity of a genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to environmental variation is crucial for a better understanding of the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86" href="#bib86">Snell-Rood, 2013</a>). From having been considered primarily as nuisance in evolutionary biology, plasticity research has grown tremendously (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78" href="#bib78">Scheiner and DeWitt, 2004</a>), from &lt;10 papers published per year before 1983 to nearly 1300 papers in 2013 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). To what extent has this growing attention, appreciation of the potential importance of plasticity and increased scientific output been accompanied by a similar increase in our understanding and knowledge of the causes and consequences of plasticity?

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Much research has been devoted to unravel how plasticity may influence and contribute to diversity among individuals, populations and species. Key questions in this area include, but are not limited to: Does plasticity promote or hinder evolution and speciation? Why does plasticity vary among populations and species? Is plasticity adaptive? What are the costs of plasticity? Do genes typically act as ‘leaders' or ‘followers' in evolution? What is the relative contribution of plasticity versus evolution (via modifications of allele frequencies) to population differentiation? What are the ecological conditions that promote the evolution and maintenance of plasticity? Some issues, such as the genetic underpinnings of plasticity and gene-by-environment interactions, have been settled or superseded by new questions and approaches (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65" href="#bib65">Pigliucci, 2005</a>). Plasticity can be considered at the level of genes, individuals, and populations (see, for example,

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3" href="#bib3">Araya-Ajoy and Dingemanse, 2014</a>), but there are also studies based on comparisons of plasticity among species (see, for example,

  </a>). Here, I focus primarily on the consequences for individuals and populations of whole organism developmental plasticity and phenotypic flexibility. An enhanced knowledge of the population-level consequences of interindividual genetic and phenotypic variation may increase our ability to understand the ecological dynamics of natural populations, and ultimately to develop more informed management plans for protection and restoration of threatened species and biodiversity (
