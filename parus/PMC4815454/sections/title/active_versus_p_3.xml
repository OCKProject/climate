 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One distinction worth mentioning in this context is that between active and passive plasticity (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105" href="#bib105">Whitman and Agrawal, 2009</a>), because there might be differences in the way that these two aspects of plasticity affect the ecological success of individuals and populations. Active plasticity is used for predominantly anticipatory, and often highly integrated, phenotypic changes in response to some environmental cue or signal, and reflect modifications of developmental pathways and regulatory genes. In active plasticity, such as in the case of wing-length polymorphism in some species of insects (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74" href="#bib74">Roff and Fairbairn, 2007</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81" href="#bib81">Schwander and Leimar, 2011</a>), the magnitude of the induced phenotypic response(s) is not necessarily correlated with the strength of the environmental signal (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77" href="#bib77">Scheiner, 2006</a>). However, graded responses are also relatively common for active plasticity. For example, the magnitude of inducible defences in prey may increase as the number of predators, or the amount of cue produced by predators, increases. Passive plasticity, on the other hand, may stem from direct environmental influences on chemical, physiological and developmental processes, and is generally not considered anticipatory, but a mere consequence of the environment, such as stunted growth owing to low resource levels. In the case of passive plasticity, when the environment acts directly on the expression of the trait, phenotypic changes are often proportional to environmental differences (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77" href="#bib77">Scheiner, 2006</a>). Active phenotypic plasticities are often (unlike â€˜truly' passive plasticities) considered adaptive, but the distinction between the two is not always clearcut (
