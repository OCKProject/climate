 <p>This study compares two nearby populations of arctic ground squirrels that experience significant differences in the timing of snowmelt and snow cover relative to their phenologies of hibernation and breeding. We found differences in the body condition, stress physiology and reproductive success of adult females, and in the subsequent juvenile recruitment between the populations.</p>
