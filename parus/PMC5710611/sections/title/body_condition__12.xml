 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body condition index</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found an effect of site (F
  <sub>1,78</sub> = 4.32, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.04) and of date (F
  <sub>1,78</sub> = 20.54, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.0001), but not of year (F
  <sub>1,78</sub> = 0.22, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.64) and an interaction effect between year*date (F
  <sub>1,78</sub> = 4.69, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.03) but no other interaction effect (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05). Average body condition of Atigun females was 2.5 times lower at gestation and 1.5 times lower at weaning than of Toolik females (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="cox065F2" href="#cox065F2">2</a>B). At both sites, body condition increased from gestation to weaning (Atigun: âˆ’33.7 to 58.8, Toolik: 9.8 to 84.5, respectively; Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="cox065F2" href="#cox065F2">2</a>B). The interaction effect of year*date occurred because females had better gestation body condition but poorer weaning body condition in 2011 than in 2012 (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="cox065F2" href="#cox065F2">2</a>B).
