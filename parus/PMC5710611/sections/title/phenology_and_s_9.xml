 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the two springs combined, Atigun females emerged on April 22nd ± 2 days, 4 days before 50% snowmelt and 18–23 days before complete snowmelt, whereas Toolik females emerged on April 30th ± 2 days, 20–25 days before 50% snowmelt and 30–35 days before complete snowmelt (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="cox065F1" href="#cox065F1">1</a>). At Toolik first onset of snow cover occurred between September 5th and 15th and covered between 25% and 50% of the ground, snow cover occurred again September 20–25th and by September 30th 65–90% of the ground was covered. At Atigun, first onset of snow cover occurred September 28th and by September 30th 90% of the ground was covered (data in 2011 were not collected past September 15th due to camera malfunction, however, no snow cover had occurred by this point).
