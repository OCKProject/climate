 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that individual Toolik and Atigun female ground squirrels weaned a similar number of offspring of similar size and condition. Although much of the energy to support reproduction comes from foraging (
  <a rid="cox065C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C27">Kiell and Millar, 1980</a>), we suggest that AGS at the two sites may have different breeding strategies. At both sites, body condition and FCM levels increased from gestation to weaning, yet the body condition of Toolik females only increased to 75% that of Atigun females, and their FCM levels increased to 135% that of Atigun females in 2011. Thus, females at Toolik may tend towards a capital breeding strategy and rely more on internal reserves to support their developing offspring. In contrast, females at Atigun may tend toward an income breeding strategy, where most of their energetic needs for breeding are derived from foraging. Although it may be questioned why Atigun females do not forage more, get bigger and have more offspring, we suggest there is likely a trade-off between the amount of time spent foraging and the risk of predation. It may be a better strategy to minimize risk and live to breed again next year. Survival differences of AGS between the sites remain unknown.

  </a>), yet we found that female glucocorticoid levels (as indicated by FCM levels) did not seem to affect reproduction at either of our sites. Glucocorticoid levels may modulate female’s ability to mobilize energy differently and cope with the environment. We did find, however, that in 2012 Toolik females had extremely high FCM levels during gestation and their reproductive success was reduced. The number of weaned offspring decreased by &gt;1.5 individuals per female and those that weaned had a lower body condition (relative score of 35 in 2011 vs. −114 in 2012). In comparison, at Atigun in 2012 the number of weaned offspring per female decreased by only 0.6 individuals, and the body condition of offspring increased (relative score of −49 in 2011 vs. −19 in 2012). Thus, we suggest that glucocorticoid hormones may play vital roles in allowing AGS to cope with differences in their phenology-environment relationship, yet if AGS encounter stressors that greatly increase hormone levels it may compromise their reproduction.
