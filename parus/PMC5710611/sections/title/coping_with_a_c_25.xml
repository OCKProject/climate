 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the potential physiological mechanisms and their fitness consequences that allow animals to cope with rapid environmental changes has been cited as one of the biggest challenges of current biology (

   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2013
  </a>). Our study is one of the first to integrate marked differences in the relationship between animal phenology and snow cover regimes, with associated differences in foraging opportunities, body condition and stress physiology, reproductive success and recruitment. Our study provides insights into the consequences of changing relationships between animals and their environment. We make the following recommendations for future research:

    <p>There is accumulating recent evidence that in addition to directional trends and regime shifts, climate-induced environmental changes will include a large increase in extreme weather events (

      <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2017
     </a>). We suggest that in the face of climate-induced changes in the relationship between animals and their environment, we must understand that animals that may seemingly be able to adapt strategies to cope with environmental regime shifts may be pushed near the limits of their ability to cope, reducing their perturbation resistance potential (
     <a rid="cox065C71" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C71">Wingfield 
      <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011
     </a>).
    </p>

   <div class="list-item">
    <p>We suggest there is a critical need to also investigate climate-induced changes to autumn conditions. Most studies on environmental change focus on spring conditions, however, we have shown that autumn conditions and the timing of new snow cover influences the spring phenology of both adult male and female AGS (
     <a rid="cox065C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C60">Sheriff 
      <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2013
     </a>, 
     <a rid="cox065C61" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C61">2015</a>). Here we show that offspring stress physiology and recruitment may also be influenced by autumn conditions and the onset of snow cover. If climate warming, for example, prolongs autumn conditions and delays the onset of snow cover, it could allow offspring more time to prepare for winter, increase recruitment and relax the urgency of early breeding.

   <div class="list-item">
    <p>We provide evidence to support the growing notion that to properly assess the impact of seasonal differences in environmental conditions it is critical to link the animal’s response to multiple fitness metrics (

     <a rid="cox065C69" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C69">Wingfield, 2013</a>). Further, because many estimates of vulnerability are often related to survival, we suggest that we may be underestimating potential climate-induced impacts on populations; i.e. estimates of impacts on survival provide evidence of conditions that are immediately lethal, however, more subtle impacts on reproduction and recruitment may be just as critical and over time contribute greatly to local extirpation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, to better understand how animals may cope with and respond to abiotic stressors in their changing environment, ecologists will need to examine changes at both the individual and population levels; appreciating that predictions based on findings from one level may not translate to another. As we show here, females living in the poorer environment were bigger and in better body condition, had higher stress hormone levels, yet had similar reproductive output as females living in a better environment; at the population level, the poorer environment may have the potential to limit recruitment.</p>
