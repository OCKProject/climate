 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How organisms interact with their biotic and abiotic environments critically influences their survival and reproductive success. Understanding these interactions, their mechanisms and their influence on fitness has taken on new urgency as climate change is rapidly altering environmental conditions and seasonality (

  <a rid="cox065C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C26">IPCC, 2014</a>). Animal and plant phenologies (recurring seasonal events) are among the best-studied response traits to changing environments and seasonality, and it is now evident that climate change can result in mismatches, or loss of alignment, between the timing of animal breeding and food presence and abundance. This mismatch may translate into negative effects on fitness and population dynamics (

  </a>). For example, in Western Greenland, the timing of caribou (
  <span class="italic">Rangifer tarandus</span>) calving has not kept pace with the advancement of the plant growing season and may have contributed to the observed decline in caribou reproductive success (
  <a rid="cox065C40000" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C40000">Post and Forschhammer, 2008</a>). In the Rocky Mountains, yellow-bellied marmots (
  <span class="italic">Marmota flaviventris</span>) have advanced their timing of emergence from hibernation and weaning of young in response to warming temperatures, although snowmelt date and thus the beginning of the plant growing season has not changed (

   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2010
  </a>). This has resulted in greater body mass of marmots prior to hibernation, decreased adult mortality and an increase in population size presumably because marmots are active for longer (
  <a rid="cox065C43" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C43">Ozgul 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2010
  </a>). Although we are beginning to understand some of the behavioral responses to changing seasonality, the physiological mechanisms which drive these responses remain largely unknown (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One physiological integrative system that will play a key role in affecting the ability of animals to cope with changing environments is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and subsequent secretion of glucocorticoids (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our objective was to compare the body condition, stress physiology, reproductive success and recruitment of arctic ground squirrels (AGS; 
  <span class="italic">Urocitellus parryii</span>) living in two populations that experience significant differences in the relationship between snow cover and adult female phenology. Using long-term data comparing two nearby populations of free-living AGS in northern Alaska, we have previously shown that at our Atigun site, where snowmelt occurs on average 26 days earlier than at our Toolik site, female AGS emerge from hibernation and give birth significantly earlier than females living at Toolik, &lt;20 km away (
  <a rid="cox065C57" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C57">Sheriff 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011a
  </a>). However, relative to the timing of when snowmelt occurs, Atigun females have shifted their phenology of annual events significantly later; they emerge from hibernation 2 weeks before snowmelt and give birth 2 weeks after complete melt, whereas Toolik females emerge from hibernation 4 weeks before snowmelt and give birth coincident with complete melt (
  <a rid="cox065C61" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C61">Sheriff 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2015
  </a>). Thus, the timing of key AGS life history events is not synchronous with the environmental differences between the sites. Although AGS are generalist herbivores and will eat roots, seeds, old berries and dried leaves in spring, ground squirrels will not dig beneath snow to access food (
  <a rid="cox065C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C12">Bronson, 1980</a>; 
  <a rid="cox065C40" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C40">Murie and Harris, 1982</a>; 
  <a rid="cox065C57" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C57">Sheriff

  <a rid="cox065C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C66">Williams 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2014
  </a>). Thus, Toolik females face harsher spring conditions than Atigun females; they must deal with prolonged spring snow cover and the associated reduction in food availability, having to sustain their entire pregnancy during this time. Given this significant difference in their phenological-environmental relationship, we predicted that, compared with Atigun females: (i) Toolik females would be in worse body condition and have higher glucocorticoid levels; (ii) Toolik females would have lower fitness, as measured by number of offspring per female and by offspring condition; and (iii) recruitment (juvenile density at hibernation) would be lower at Toolik.
