 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of offspring/female at weaning was similar between the sites (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="cox065F4" href="#cox065F4">4</a> inset). Atigun females averaged 0.2 offspring/female fewer in 2011, and 0.1 offspring/female more in 2012 than Toolik females. Because of a higher adult female density (&gt;1 ind/ha), juvenile density was higher at Atigun than at Toolik in both years of the study (2011: &gt; 1.25 offspring/ha more, 2012: &gt; 2 offspring/ha more at Atigun than Toolik; Fig.
