 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used an enzyme immunoassay to measure fecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) concentrations (reflecting glucocorticoid levels) from 41 adult females (18 from Toolik and 23 from Atigun) and 61 juveniles (24 from Toolik and 37 from Atigun), validated specifically for use with AGS (see

   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2012
  </a> for details). FCM values represent one of the least invasive measures of physiological stress and have been widely used in wild animals (

   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2014
  </a>). FCM values reflect free (unbound to corticosteroid binding globulin) glucocorticoid levels found in the blood (

   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2012
  </a>). Thus, FCM values provide an integrated measure of circulation glucocorticoid levels, better reflecting the average physiological state of the individual as compared with blood samples, that provide a point-in-time sample (
  <a rid="cox065C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C58">Sheriff 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011b
  </a>). FCM values have been used to investigate the influence of both predictable (changes in season, reproductive status, etc.) and unpredictable stressors (predation risk, food limitations, competition) in a wide variety of free-living animals (reviewed in

   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2014
  </a>). Although it is often assumed that individuals with higher FCM levels have reduced fitness, it is important to appreciate that, as with any measure of physiological stress, the FCM—fitness relationship likely forms a bell shaped curve with greater levels potential increasing an individual’s ability to cope with a particular stressor to a certain threshold at which point greater levels reduce fitness (
  <a rid="cox065C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C53">Selye, 1936</a>). Thus, FCM levels are best suited to provide insights into how individuals cope with a particular stressor and should be paired with actual fitness measures (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study fecal samples were obtained within 2 h of capture, thus the stress of capture would not have affected measured FCM levels (
  <a rid="cox065C59" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C59">Sheriff 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2012
  </a>). Further, although human disturbance may increase FCM values, trapping and sampling procedures were similar between sites and this potential disturbance likely did not affect potential site differences in FCM levels. Further, AGS are highly re-trappable (even within the same session), indicating humans and traps are not perceived as much of a threat. Upon collection in the field, feces were immediately placed on wet ice, transported back to the Toolik Field Station, and frozen at −20°C within 7 h of collection. Samples were transported on dry ice to the University of Toronto where they were lyophilized (LabConco, Missouri, USA) and homogenized. Following extraction with 80% methanol (50 ± 3 mg feces with 1 ml), FCMs were measured as outlined by
