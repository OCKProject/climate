 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All data are presented as mean ± SE, unless otherwise stated. All statistics were performed using the software package STATISTICA 10. Because individual ground squirrels could not be tracked throughout the entire study, individual ID was tested as a covariate. The latter was found to be non-significant and was dropped from the models. The assumption of normality was tested with Shapiro–Wilks test, and the assumption of homogeneity of variances was tested with Levene’s test. For data that met the assumptions we used a 3-way ANOVA (site × date × year). For data that did not meet the assumptions a Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric test was used; no interaction effects could be tested. Comparisons of the means were considered significant if
