 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated how marked differences in the relationship between seasonality (timing of snowmelt in spring and snow cover in autumn) and phenology affected the body condition, stress physiology and reproductive success of adult females, and the subsequent recruitment of juveniles just prior to hibernation in two nearby AGS populations in northern Alaska. Because female squirrels living at Toolik experienced prolonged spring snow cover and hence lower food availability during pregnancy relative to those at Atigun (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="cox065F1" href="#cox065F1">1</a>), we predicted that: (i) Toolik females would be in poorer body condition and have higher FCM levels (indicative of glucocorticoid levels); (ii) that they would have lower reproductive fitness; and (iii) that juvenile recruitment would be lower. However, we found that: (i) adult females at Toolik were larger and in better body condition but had significantly higher FCM levels during pregnancy and at weaning compared to Atigun females (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="cox065F2" href="#cox065F2">2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="cox065F3" href="#cox065F3">3</a>); (iia) the number of offspring produced per adult female and offspring body size and condition was similar between the two the sites (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="cox065F4" href="#cox065F4">4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="cox065F5" href="#cox065F5">5</a>); (iib) offspring FCM levels were higher at Toolik than at Atigun at weaning (by 1.5 times) and pre-hibernation (by 4.5 times), and levels nearly tripled in Toolik offspring from weaning to pre-hibernation whereas in Atigun offspring levels remained constant (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="cox065F6" href="#cox065F6">6</a>); and (iii) juvenile density at hibernation was lower at Toolik than Atigun, and from weaning to hibernation density decreased 54% at Toolik but only 44% at Atigun (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="cox065F4" href="#cox065F4">4</a>), indicating that recruitment is lower at Toolik. While this study demonstrates correlative results among phenotypic and life history traits between two populations of AGS that have a significantly different phenological-environmental relationship, we believe our findings may point to possible mechanistic relationships of how organisms can cope with and respond to environmental change. Below we discuss why our predictions did not match our results and discuss the significance of our findings within the broader context of climate change.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adult female condition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At Toolik, females emerged from hibernation to a snow-covered environment approximately 1 month prior to complete spring snowmelt, whereas at Atigun, females emerged to a partially snow-covered environment, 2 weeks prior to complete melt. Thus, the entire gestation period (~26 days) of Toolik females occurred prior to complete snowmelt, whereas Atigun females gave birth 2 weeks after complete melt. Given that access to food is limited for AGS by snow cover and females do not cache food, we expected Toolik females to be in worse condition in spring. Previously, we have shown that Toolik females lose mass for the first 1–2 weeks following emergence (we do not have data on Atigun females; 
   <a rid="cox065C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C13">Buck and Barnes, 1999a</a>). We found, however, that Toolik females were larger and in better body condition than those at Atigun during pregnancy (10–14 days after emergence at mid-gestation) and at weaning. 
   <a rid="cox065C43" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C43">Ozgul 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2010)
   </a> also found in another hibernator, the yellow-bellied marmot, that earlier emergence relative to snowmelt date resulted in larger individuals. The authors suggest this is due to a greater amount of time animals had to grow during their active season. In our system adult females are active on the surface for a similar amount of time between the sites, 119 ± 2 d/yr at Toolik and 123 ± 3 d/yr at Atigun (
   <a rid="cox065C57" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C57">Sheriff 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011a
   </a>) and thus we cannot attribute the larger size and better body condition of Toolik females to a longer growing or active season. If anything Toolik females have a more limited ability to invest in growth given that they emerge and go through gestation with relatively reduced food availability. Previously, we have found that, independent of sex, over time AGS increase mass, such that a 3-year-old weighs more than a 2-year-old; although we do not have morphometric data on size (
   <a rid="cox065C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C13">Buck and Barnes, 1999a</a>). Thus, one possible explanation is that females we sampled at Toolik are older than those we sampled at Atigun.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Toolik females also had significantly higher glucocorticoid levels (as indicated by FCM levels) during pregnancy and at weaning compared to those at Atigun. There are two non-exclusive explanations for these elevated levels. First, glucocorticoids play a principle role in mobilizing energy reserves, such as glucose (
   <a rid="cox065C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C7">Boonstra 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 1998
   </a>; 
   <a rid="cox065C52" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C52">Sapolsky 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2000
   </a>). Hence, it is possible that Toolik females had elevated glucocorticoid levels to facilitate gluconeogenesis, tissue catabolism and mobilization of internal reserves to meet the demands of the growing offspring in a poor environment, whereas Atigun females can meet their demands by foraging. Increased glucocorticoid levels may also stimulate foraging and increase feeding efficiency (
   <a rid="cox065C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C38">Montanholi 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2013
   </a>), and thus aid Toolik females in food intake during foraging. Second, a number of external factors can also influence individual glucocorticoid levels including inclement weather (
   <a rid="cox065C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C49">Romero 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2000
   </a>), reduced food availability (
   <a rid="cox065C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C28">Kitaysky 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2010
   </a>) and increased predation risk (
   <a rid="cox065C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C18">Clinchy 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2013
   </a>). For example, 
   <a rid="cox065C59" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C59">Sheriff 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2012)
   </a> found no clear, single explanation for different glucocorticoid hormone patterns among AGS populations living in the southwestern Yukon. They hypothesized that glucocorticoid levels were influenced by a combination of differences in seasonal climate, adverse weather, density and visibility (a proxy for predation risk). It is likely that Toolik females also face a combination of factors in spring. The prolonged snow cover and reduced food availability throughout pregnancy could: (i) cause females to have elevated glucocorticoid levels to increase gluconeogenesis and internal energy mobilization, (ii) increase their glucocorticoid levels in response to a food restricted spring environment and (iii) force them to engage in riskier foraging behavior, as they roam further from the safety of their burrows in search of foraging areas. Although we do not have quantifiable data, red foxes and birds of prey are very often seen at both sites and there are active fox dens nearby both sites, thus we predict that the number of predators is very similar between the sites and, as such, greater foraging activity likely increases the potential for predation. An individual’s physiological state may have a great impact on their ability to cope with and respond to changes in the environment (
   <a rid="cox065C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C7">Boonstra

   <a rid="cox065C70" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C70">Wingfield 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 1998
   </a>). It may also provide a good indication of an individual’s overall health (
   <a rid="cox065C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C48">Romero, 2004</a>; 
   <a rid="cox065C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C20">Dantzer 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2014
   </a>). Generally, those individuals with higher glucocorticoid levels are considered to be experiencing poor and unpredictable environmental conditions, and to be in worse condition and have reduced reproduction and survival (

   </a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results appear paradoxical given that Toolik females are in better condition based on their weight and size, but in worse condition based on their FCM levels. Although we cannot rule out age as a possible factor influencing female weight and size, we suggest that the environments AGS experience may be driving factors in the differences we found. The later snowmelt and poorer environment Toolik females face in spring may have selected for larger more robust phenotypes, i.e. smaller females in poor body condition may simply not survive in such an environment. Earlier snowmelt at Atigun may allow small, poor condition females to survive and reproduce because of the better spring environment and greater access to food. This is supported by the fact that our smallest females at Toolik had zygomatic arch sizes of 34 (2 females) and 35 mm (2 females), whereas the smallest females at Atigun had arch sizes of 30 (1 female), 31 (1 female), 32 (2 female), 33 (4 females), 34 (2 females), 35 (6 females). However, emerging to a poor spring environment coupled with the energetic and food requirements of breeding, females support litters that reach up to 166% of their body mass (
   <a rid="cox065C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C47">Reed, 1993</a>) and much of the energy to support these litters comes from the immediate ingestion of food (
   <a rid="cox065C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C27">Kiell and Millar, 1980</a>), all possibly result in Toolik females having elevated FCM levels.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reproductive fitness</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that individual Toolik and Atigun female ground squirrels weaned a similar number of offspring of similar size and condition. Although much of the energy to support reproduction comes from foraging (
   <a rid="cox065C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C27">Kiell and Millar, 1980</a>), we suggest that AGS at the two sites may have different breeding strategies. At both sites, body condition and FCM levels increased from gestation to weaning, yet the body condition of Toolik females only increased to 75% that of Atigun females, and their FCM levels increased to 135% that of Atigun females in 2011. Thus, females at Toolik may tend towards a capital breeding strategy and rely more on internal reserves to support their developing offspring. In contrast, females at Atigun may tend toward an income breeding strategy, where most of their energetic needs for breeding are derived from foraging. Although it may be questioned why Atigun females do not forage more, get bigger and have more offspring, we suggest there is likely a trade-off between the amount of time spent foraging and the risk of predation. It may be a better strategy to minimize risk and live to breed again next year. Survival differences of AGS between the sites remain unknown.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reproduction can be compromised by glucocorticoid hormone levels (
   <a rid="cox065C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C55">Sheriff 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2009
   </a>), yet we found that female glucocorticoid levels (as indicated by FCM levels) did not seem to affect reproduction at either of our sites. Glucocorticoid levels may modulate female’s ability to mobilize energy differently and cope with the environment. We did find, however, that in 2012 Toolik females had extremely high FCM levels during gestation and their reproductive success was reduced. The number of weaned offspring decreased by &gt;1.5 individuals per female and those that weaned had a lower body condition (relative score of 35 in 2011 vs. −114 in 2012). In comparison, at Atigun in 2012 the number of weaned offspring per female decreased by only 0.6 individuals, and the body condition of offspring increased (relative score of −49 in 2011 vs. −19 in 2012). Thus, we suggest that glucocorticoid hormones may play vital roles in allowing AGS to cope with differences in their phenology-environment relationship, yet if AGS encounter stressors that greatly increase hormone levels it may compromise their reproduction.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Offspring stress physiology</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that the patterns of FCM levels in offspring differed between the sites. At weaning, Toolik offspring had similar FCM levels in 2011, but significantly higher levels in 2012 compared to Atigun offspring. At pre-hibernation, Toolik offspring had FCM levels 3 times higher than they had at weaning; whereas Atigun offspring had FCM levels that remained constant and relatively low across these time periods. Given that prior to weaning offspring remain sequestered in their natal burrow and have little experience with the above ground environment, the significantly higher FCM levels in Toolik offspring compared to Atigun offspring at weaning in 2012 may have resulted from the elevated maternal stress during gestation and lactation of adult females at Toolik. Maternal glucocorticoids can influence offspring glucocorticoid levels through a number of mechanisms including pre-natal changes to the offspring’s epigenome and post-natal changes to maternal behavior and offspring care (
   <a rid="cox065C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C34">Meaney 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2007

   </a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The elevated levels of FCMs during pre-hibernation in Toolik offspring may reflect their need to fatten and prepare for hibernation in a quickly deteriorating environment. On average female offspring enter hibernation mid-September and males in early October (
   <a rid="cox065C57" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C57">Sheriff 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011a
   </a>); however, in early September (when sampling occurred) Toolik was already 25–50% snow covered, reducing offspring’s access to food. In addition to restricted food access in a poor environment, Toolik offspring may then have also needed to expose themselves to riskier situations and engage in dangerous foraging behavior—all of which could increase their FCM levels. Conversely, Atigun offspring would not have needed to engage in such risky foraging behavior since, in early September, Atigun was only 0–5% snow covered. Thus, offspring stress physiology likely result from the indirect and direct influence of their environment; indirectly in spring via their mother’s experience with her environment, and directly in autumn in response to their own experience with the environment.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recruitment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that pre-hibernation juvenile density was lower and that there was a 10% greater reduction in density from weaning to hibernation at Toolik compared with Atigun. This was particularly evident in 2012, when pre-hibernation density at Toolik was 0.19 juvniles/ha, only 25% of that at weaning, whereas at Atigun the pre-hibernation density was 1.89 juveniles/ha, almost 70% of that at weaning. At weaning in 2012, Toolik offspring were in significantly worse condition and had significantly higher FCM levels, which may have affected their propensity to disperse and their survival (although we do not know the exact fates of juveniles who disappeared off of our trapping grids). Juvenile dispersal in AGS occurs in the first few weeks of July and is sex-specific; studies in the Yukon have shown that females are highly philopatric and disperse approximately 120 m, and males disperse approximately 500 m from the natal area (
   <a rid="cox065C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C17">Byrom and Krebs, 1999</a>). During this time juveniles, regardless of sex, lose significant mass (
   <a rid="cox065C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C13">Buck and Barnes, 1999a</a>); however, little is known about how an individual’s stress physiology may influence dispersal. In other vertebrates, glucocorticoid levels have been shown to alter juvenile dispersal. For example, in willow tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus montanus</span>) experimental increases in glucocorticoids increased dispersal propensity (
   <a rid="cox065C30000" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C30000">Silverin, 1997</a>), and in the common lizard (
   <span class="italic">Lacerta vivipara</span>) experimental increases in both maternal and juvenile glucocorticoids alter juvenile dispersal (
   <a rid="cox065C36" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C36">Meylan 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2004
   </a>). This has been suggested as an adaptive mechanism increasing offspring movement out of poor habitats (
   <a rid="cox065C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C35">Meylan and Clobert, 2005</a>). Adult density is likely unrelated to the potential greater dispersal of Toolik offspring, given Atigun density is higher than Toolik (see 
   <span class="italic">Reproductive output</span> in Results).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The low recruitment and large reduction in Toolik offspring density in 2012 may also be driven by decreased offspring survival. In 2012, Toolik offspring were in poor body condition and may have needed to spend more time foraging, increasing their susceptibility to predation (AGS are primary prey for nearly all arctic mammal and avian predators). Additionally, their poor start may have been exacerbated by the poor environment at Toolik, where winter snow begins to accumulate and reduce food availability earlier in the active season. Clearly, the interaction AGS have with their environment likely plays an important role in recruitment of offspring, and as environments change in the spring (altering maternal condition) or in the autumn (altering the ability of offspring to prepare for hibernation) recruitment is likely to be greatly affected.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the potential physiological mechanisms and their fitness consequences that allow animals to cope with rapid environmental changes has been cited as one of the biggest challenges of current biology (

Our study is one of the first to integrate marked differences in the relationship between animal phenology and snow cover regimes, with associated differences in foraging opportunities, body condition and stress physiology, reproductive success and recruitment. Our study provides insights into the consequences of changing relationships between animals and their environment. We make the following recommendations for future research:

We suggest that in the face of climate-induced changes in the relationship between animals and their environment, we must understand that animals that may seemingly be able to adapt strategies to cope with environmental regime shifts may be pushed near the limits of their ability to cope, reducing their perturbation resistance potential (

    <div class="list-item">
     <p>We suggest there is a critical need to also investigate climate-induced changes to autumn conditions. Most studies on environmental change focus on spring conditions, however, we have shown that autumn conditions and the timing of new snow cover influences the spring phenology of both adult male and female AGS (

      <a rid="cox065C61" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C61">2015</a>). Here we show that offspring stress physiology and recruitment may also be influenced by autumn conditions and the onset of snow cover. If climate warming, for example, prolongs autumn conditions and delays the onset of snow cover, it could allow offspring more time to prepare for winter, increase recruitment and relax the urgency of early breeding.
     </p>

    <div class="list-item">
     <p>We provide evidence to support the growing notion that to properly assess the impact of seasonal differences in environmental conditions it is critical to link the animal’s response to multiple fitness metrics (

      <a rid="cox065C69" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C69">Wingfield, 2013</a>). Further, because many estimates of vulnerability are often related to survival, we suggest that we may be underestimating potential climate-induced impacts on populations; i.e. estimates of impacts on survival provide evidence of conditions that are immediately lethal, however, more subtle impacts on reproduction and recruitment may be just as critical and over time contribute greatly to local extirpation.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, to better understand how animals may cope with and respond to abiotic stressors in their changing environment, ecologists will need to examine changes at both the individual and population levels; appreciating that predictions based on findings from one level may not translate to another. As we show here, females living in the poorer environment were bigger and in better body condition, had higher stress hormone levels, yet had similar reproductive output as females living in a better environment; at the population level, the poorer environment may have the potential to limit recruitment.</p>
