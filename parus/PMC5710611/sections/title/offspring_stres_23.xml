 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that the patterns of FCM levels in offspring differed between the sites. At weaning, Toolik offspring had similar FCM levels in 2011, but significantly higher levels in 2012 compared to Atigun offspring. At pre-hibernation, Toolik offspring had FCM levels 3 times higher than they had at weaning; whereas Atigun offspring had FCM levels that remained constant and relatively low across these time periods. Given that prior to weaning offspring remain sequestered in their natal burrow and have little experience with the above ground environment, the significantly higher FCM levels in Toolik offspring compared to Atigun offspring at weaning in 2012 may have resulted from the elevated maternal stress during gestation and lactation of adult females at Toolik. Maternal glucocorticoids can influence offspring glucocorticoid levels through a number of mechanisms including pre-natal changes to the offspring’s epigenome and post-natal changes to maternal behavior and offspring care (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The elevated levels of FCMs during pre-hibernation in Toolik offspring may reflect their need to fatten and prepare for hibernation in a quickly deteriorating environment. On average female offspring enter hibernation mid-September and males in early October (

  </a>); however, in early September (when sampling occurred) Toolik was already 25–50% snow covered, reducing offspring’s access to food. In addition to restricted food access in a poor environment, Toolik offspring may then have also needed to expose themselves to riskier situations and engage in dangerous foraging behavior—all of which could increase their FCM levels. Conversely, Atigun offspring would not have needed to engage in such risky foraging behavior since, in early September, Atigun was only 0–5% snow covered. Thus, offspring stress physiology likely result from the indirect and direct influence of their environment; indirectly in spring via their mother’s experience with her environment, and directly in autumn in response to their own experience with the environment.
