 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At Toolik, females emerged from hibernation to a snow-covered environment approximately 1 month prior to complete spring snowmelt, whereas at Atigun, females emerged to a partially snow-covered environment, 2 weeks prior to complete melt. Thus, the entire gestation period (~26 days) of Toolik females occurred prior to complete snowmelt, whereas Atigun females gave birth 2 weeks after complete melt. Given that access to food is limited for AGS by snow cover and females do not cache food, we expected Toolik females to be in worse condition in spring. Previously, we have shown that Toolik females lose mass for the first 1–2 weeks following emergence (we do not have data on Atigun females; 
  <a rid="cox065C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C13">Buck and Barnes, 1999a</a>). We found, however, that Toolik females were larger and in better body condition than those at Atigun during pregnancy (10–14 days after emergence at mid-gestation) and at weaning. 
  <a rid="cox065C43" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C43">Ozgul 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2010)
  </a> also found in another hibernator, the yellow-bellied marmot, that earlier emergence relative to snowmelt date resulted in larger individuals. The authors suggest this is due to a greater amount of time animals had to grow during their active season. In our system adult females are active on the surface for a similar amount of time between the sites, 119 ± 2 d/yr at Toolik and 123 ± 3 d/yr at Atigun (
  <a rid="cox065C57" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C57">Sheriff 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011a
  </a>) and thus we cannot attribute the larger size and better body condition of Toolik females to a longer growing or active season. If anything Toolik females have a more limited ability to invest in growth given that they emerge and go through gestation with relatively reduced food availability. Previously, we have found that, independent of sex, over time AGS increase mass, such that a 3-year-old weighs more than a 2-year-old; although we do not have morphometric data on size (
  <a rid="cox065C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C13">Buck and Barnes, 1999a</a>). Thus, one possible explanation is that females we sampled at Toolik are older than those we sampled at Atigun.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Toolik females also had significantly higher glucocorticoid levels (as indicated by FCM levels) during pregnancy and at weaning compared to those at Atigun. There are two non-exclusive explanations for these elevated levels. First, glucocorticoids play a principle role in mobilizing energy reserves, such as glucose (
  <a rid="cox065C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C7">Boonstra 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 1998
  </a>; 
  <a rid="cox065C52" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C52">Sapolsky 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2000
  </a>). Hence, it is possible that Toolik females had elevated glucocorticoid levels to facilitate gluconeogenesis, tissue catabolism and mobilization of internal reserves to meet the demands of the growing offspring in a poor environment, whereas Atigun females can meet their demands by foraging. Increased glucocorticoid levels may also stimulate foraging and increase feeding efficiency (
  <a rid="cox065C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C38">Montanholi 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2013
  </a>), and thus aid Toolik females in food intake during foraging. Second, a number of external factors can also influence individual glucocorticoid levels including inclement weather (
  <a rid="cox065C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C49">Romero 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2000
  </a>), reduced food availability (
  <a rid="cox065C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C28">Kitaysky 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2010
  </a>) and increased predation risk (
  <a rid="cox065C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C18">Clinchy 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2013
  </a>). For example, 
  <a rid="cox065C59" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C59">Sheriff 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2012)
  </a> found no clear, single explanation for different glucocorticoid hormone patterns among AGS populations living in the southwestern Yukon. They hypothesized that glucocorticoid levels were influenced by a combination of differences in seasonal climate, adverse weather, density and visibility (a proxy for predation risk). It is likely that Toolik females also face a combination of factors in spring. The prolonged snow cover and reduced food availability throughout pregnancy could: (i) cause females to have elevated glucocorticoid levels to increase gluconeogenesis and internal energy mobilization, (ii) increase their glucocorticoid levels in response to a food restricted spring environment and (iii) force them to engage in riskier foraging behavior, as they roam further from the safety of their burrows in search of foraging areas. Although we do not have quantifiable data, red foxes and birds of prey are very often seen at both sites and there are active fox dens nearby both sites, thus we predict that the number of predators is very similar between the sites and, as such, greater foraging activity likely increases the potential for predation. An individual’s physiological state may have a great impact on their ability to cope with and respond to changes in the environment (

  <a rid="cox065C70" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C70">Wingfield 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 1998
  </a>). It may also provide a good indication of an individual’s overall health (

  <a rid="cox065C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C20">Dantzer 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2014
  </a>). Generally, those individuals with higher glucocorticoid levels are considered to be experiencing poor and unpredictable environmental conditions, and to be in worse condition and have reduced reproduction and survival (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results appear paradoxical given that Toolik females are in better condition based on their weight and size, but in worse condition based on their FCM levels. Although we cannot rule out age as a possible factor influencing female weight and size, we suggest that the environments AGS experience may be driving factors in the differences we found. The later snowmelt and poorer environment Toolik females face in spring may have selected for larger more robust phenotypes, i.e. smaller females in poor body condition may simply not survive in such an environment. Earlier snowmelt at Atigun may allow small, poor condition females to survive and reproduce because of the better spring environment and greater access to food. This is supported by the fact that our smallest females at Toolik had zygomatic arch sizes of 34 (2 females) and 35 mm (2 females), whereas the smallest females at Atigun had arch sizes of 30 (1 female), 31 (1 female), 32 (2 female), 33 (4 females), 34 (2 females), 35 (6 females). However, emerging to a poor spring environment coupled with the energetic and food requirements of breeding, females support litters that reach up to 166% of their body mass (
  <a rid="cox065C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C47">Reed, 1993</a>) and much of the energy to support these litters comes from the immediate ingestion of food (
  <a rid="cox065C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#cox065C27">Kiell and Millar, 1980</a>), all possibly result in Toolik females having elevated FCM levels.
