 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds, as other animals, have molecular mechanisms for detoxifying harmful compounds, including contaminants 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Costantini1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Costantini1">[1]</a>. Birds are able to modulate their enzyme activities and detoxification systems as a response to pollution levels and in that way improve their survival under pollution exposure in polluted areas 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Fossi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Fossi1">[2]</a>. However, inter-specific differences in bird defence mechanisms against toxic substances are poorly understood. Species specific differences in detoxification capacity are suggested to be diet-bound 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Fossi2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Fossi2">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Fossi3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Fossi3">[4]</a>. For example, species having normally high levels of harmful secondary compounds in their diet or species using toxic food items might also tolerate higher levels of contaminants and have better ability to detoxify harmful compounds than species whose diet naturally contains low amounts of toxic chemicals 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Koivula1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Koivula1">[5]</a>. Furthermore, different feeding habits ranging from omnivorous species to specialists (e.g. insectivores and granivores) can be related to inter-specific differences in detoxification capacity. Omnivores, which use a mixture of plant and animal matter as their food, show high detoxification capacity whereas species with narrow diet may show lower detoxification capacity 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Fossi2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Fossi2">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Fossi3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Fossi3">[4]</a>. Earlier reviews by Ronis &amp; Walker 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Ronis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Ronis1">[6]</a> and Sinclair &amp; Sinclair 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Sinclair1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Sinclair1">[7]</a> have reported a strong relationship between hepatic microsomal mono-oxygenase (MO) activities and diet, based on studies on 30 species of birds in 10 different orders. There was also an inverse relationship between body weight and relative MO activity in fish-eating birds and mammals 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Ronis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Ronis1">[6]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Sinclair1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Sinclair1">[7]</a>, suggesting that there may be a relationship between MO activity and metabolic rates that are size-dependent. It is therefore possible that e.g. insectivorous and granivorous birds differ from each other in their detoxification capacity due to their different diet composition.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Migratory behaviour may also be linked to detoxification capacity of a species. Migratory birds, especially those moving between boreal and tropical environments, can be exposed to a wide range of toxic substances (e.g. secondary compounds or contaminants) throughout their annual cycle. Resident birds, on the other hand, may face a narrower range of toxic compounds in their relatively small home ranges. Thus, it is possible that birds having a large home range face more diverse toxic compounds in their environment, and are also better adapted to handle variety of harmful compounds, including those of anthropogenic origin. Migratory behaviour and diet are coupled to a large extent. Although migratory insectivores use invertebrate food all year round, they use different insects as food items along their migratory routes and overwintering and breeding areas, which may have led to increased detoxification ability as well as tolerance against the variety of defence chemicals and toxic compounds compared to resident birds.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species specific differences in detoxification capacity have been found in birds, mammals and fish 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Fossi2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Fossi2">[3]</a>. The interspecific variation in detoxification capacity is usually related to differences in the mixed function oxidase (MFO) system of animals. The function of MFO enzymes is based on their ability to detoxify compounds into less toxic forms 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Newman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Newman1">[8]</a>. The members of MFO group are cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are heme-containing proteins that are found in all organisms examined so far 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Bernhard1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Bernhard1">[9]</a>. They can metabolize exogenous xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, such as steroids and fatty acids, to a more polar form, which can be more easily excreted from organs 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Bernhard1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Bernhard1">[9]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Tanhuanp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Tanhuanp1">[10]</a>. The MFO system that evolved 800 million years ago 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Nebert1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Nebert1">[11]</a> was probably able to metabolize lipophilic compounds and detoxify natural plant and animal toxins 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Fossi3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Fossi3">[4]</a>. However, after man-made contaminants appeared in the environment, this enzyme family recognized also the foreign toxic compounds 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Fossi3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Fossi3">[4]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Whyte1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Whyte1">[12]</a>. To a large part the cytochrome P450 group is thought to have evolved in response to natural substances of toxic plants, an idea known as the “plant-animal warfare” hypothesis 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Whyte1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Whyte1">[12]</a>. In addition, the system metabolizes, e.g. steroid hormones. The many functions of cytochrome P450 enzymes are shown by the large number of genes encoding them. P450 enzymes are mainly concentrated in the liver, where the toxic compounds are modified to more excretable forms by phase I (where MFO enzymes are involved) and phase II biotransformation reactions involving oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis and conjugation 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Andersson1">[13]</a>. Induction of the P450 enzymes takes place fairly rapidly and elevated activities of P450 can persist for weeks after exposure to contaminants 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-KloepperSams1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-KloepperSams1">[14]</a>. One of the most important enzymes of cytochrome P450 group, participating in the detoxification process of xenobiotic compounds, is called CYP1A 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Guengerich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Guengerich1">[15]</a>. CYP1A subfamily, which contains the members CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, has been found in all mammals and birds studied so far 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Nelson1">[16]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Zhang1">[17]</a>. CYP1A production increases in cells after chemical exposure and therefore it is a useful marker especially in biomonitoring studies 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Whyte1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Whyte1">[12]</a>. The basic mechanism in CYP1A induction is the binding of xenobiotics to a cytosolic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which initiate the synthesis of proteins such as CYP1A 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Nebert2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Nebert2">[18]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Whyte1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Whyte1">[12]</a>. The enzymatic activity of CYP1A can be assessed by measuring ethoxyresorufin-
  <span class="italic">O</span>-deethylase (EROD) activity, which is a sensitive biomarker especially for organic contaminants 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Whyte1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Whyte1">[12]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EROD activity is a useful biomarker for detecting early signs of contamination 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Fossi2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Fossi2">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Davis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Davis1">[19]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Sanderson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Sanderson1">[20]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Tanhuanp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Tanhuanp1">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Eeva1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Eeva1">[21]</a>. Understanding the innate differences in species-specific detoxification abilities is important for recognizing the species that are at greatest risk in polluted environments 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Fossi3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Fossi3">[4]</a>. However, when conducting biomarker studies, it is important to keep in mind that species differ in their basal levels, showing species-specific differences even under similar exposure 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Gorbi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Gorbi1">[22]</a>. Therefore the knowledge of basal levels of used biomarkers (e.g. EROD activity) in target species is essential in ecotoxicological studies. Besides enzymatic activity the size of the detoxifying organs, especially the liver, is also an important factor because it may affect the total detoxification capacity and also be related to EROD activity by unit amount of protein. So far, the relation of liver size and specific EROD activity is poorly known in birds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the minimum resting metabolic rate in a thermoneutral ambient temperature 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Brody1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Brody1">[23]</a>, can be related to EROD activity as well, because metabolic rate affects the production of harmful metabolites. Interspecific variation in BMR has shown to be dependent on many ecological traits such as food, habitat, climate, flight activity, torpor, migration, and latitude and altitude, although phylogenetic analyses have not always supported the adaptivity of such variation 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-McNab1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-McNab1">[24]</a>. Avian BMR is known to vary especially with body mass, but also other factors including behaviour and environmental conditions can affect the BMR 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-McNab2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-McNab2">[25]</a>. Daan et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Daan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Daan1">[26]</a> reported that avian body mass explains 95–97% of interspecific variation in BMR. Birds in general have ca. 30–40% higher BMR than mammals due to their expensive and energy-demanding flight ability 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-McNab1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-McNab1">[24]</a>. Organ size is often related to BMR as well. Daan et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Daan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Daan1">[26]</a>, for example, showed that birds having relatively high BMR for their body mass had also relatively large kidneys and hearts. Therefore it would be important to include BMR and the size of the organs in the analyses of EROD activity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our goal was to find out whether there are differences among passerine species in their ability to detoxify and tolerate harmful compounds in their body. We measured basal hepatic EROD activities in ten passerine species by collecting samples approximately at the same age and time of the year. This was important because EROD activity can have seasonal variation 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Gorbi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Gorbi1">[22]</a>. The standardization of age at sampling is important also to minimize the possible variation caused by different contaminant exposure of wild birds. EROD activities were measured in the absence of known contaminant loads, meaning that contamination loads of the birds are not measured and thus the early contamination in the eggs or later in their nestling phase cannot be completely ruled out, which is often the case with the wild animals caught from their natural habitats. However, because there were no major pollution sources nearby and since all the sampled birds were young with a relatively short period of exposure, we can expect those birds to be relatively uncontaminated and therefore consider their EROD activity as basal activity. The pollution levels in SW of Finland have also shown to be in general the lowest in Europe

  <a rid="pone.0033926-VandenSteen2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-VandenSteen2">[28]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So far, the basal EROD activity has been very little studied in small passerine species and our results bring novel information on the levels of EROD activities related to diet and migratory status. To our knowledge this is also the first time that EROD activity is combined with analyses of BMR and relative organ size in small passerine birds. We also took into account the phylogenetic relationships when analysing species-specific variation in EROD activity in relation to relative BMR and relative liver mass. Closely related species are more likely to share the same kind of evolutionary traits such as the MFO system, which has diversified over the course of evolutionary history. We hypothesize that 1) Basal EROD activity varies between different bird species in relation to their diet and/or migratory status; 2) Species ingesting larger amounts of harmful compounds from their natural food are better adapted to them compared to birds ingesting lesser amounts of harmful compounds; 3) Migratory birds have higher detoxification ability than resident birds, due to their more variable diet and living habitats; 4) Insectivores have higher detoxification ability than granivores due to more variable food items containing a variety of different defence chemicals; 5) Birds with higher BMR also show higher EROD activity; 6) High relative liver mass is associated with high EROD activity, both speeding up the detoxification process.</p>
