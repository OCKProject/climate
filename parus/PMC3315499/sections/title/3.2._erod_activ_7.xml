 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Frozen liver samples were homogenized with TissueLyser (Qiagen, Austin, USA) at +4°C to prevent the loss of enzymatic activity prior to measurement. It is important to keep the samples on ice at all stages of preparation. Centrifugation (10 000 g, 15 min) was conducted at +4°C and the used homogenizing buffer was kept ice-cold as well 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Burke1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Burke1">[33]</a>. The complete supernatant was used in EROD activity analyses. The measurement of EROD activity is based on the function of CYP1A enzyme, which converts 7-ethoxyresorufin to a fluorescent product resorufin, which can be detected with a fluorometer 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Whyte1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Whyte1">[12]</a>. The amount of resorufin grows linearly as a function of time and to make the samples comparable, the activity was proportioned to total protein concentration. The unit for EROD activity is hence ηmol/min/mg protein. EROD activity was measured according to Burke and Mayer 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Burke1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Burke1">[33]</a> with adaptations to microplate. The measurements were done in triplicates using 96-well plates with Envision microplate reader (Perkin-Elmer Wallac, Turku, Finland). Protein assay was conducted according to Bradford method 
  <a rid="pone.0033926-Bradford1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Bradford1">[34]</a> using BioRad stock diluted to dH
  <sub>2</sub>O (1∶5) and BSA (1 mg/ml) as a standard and measured with Envision microplate reader at absorbance of 595 nm.
