The species were chosen so that they would represent different migratory statuses and feeding habits. The birds were divided into four groups based on their migratory behaviour and diet on the basis of published information on each species

   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0033926-t001" href="#pone-0033926-t001">Table 1</a>). However, our division is quite rough because some granivores (e.g. reed bunting) sometimes also use insects as their food items, especially during their breeding season. Likewise some species (great tit, blue tit and greenfinch) classified as non-migratory may show partial migratory behaviour.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. Sampling methods</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was conducted between August and October in 2008 near Turku (60°26′ N, 22°11′ E) in southwest of Finland, where we had three sampling sites. Each species were attempted to collect as quickly as possible to avoid the seasonal and temperature variation. The collection periods for the species were: great tit (12.8.-26.8.), blue tit (6.8.-20.8), chaffinch (12.8.-25.9.), greenfinch (20.8.-17.9.), house sparrow (12.8.-1.9.), willow warbler (6.8.-16.9.), sedge warbler (6.8.-25.8.), reed warbler (6.8.-18.9.), reed bunting (15.9.-15.10) and barn swallows (21.8.-19.9.2007). Most of the species were caught within a month, thus minimizing the temporal variation. In reed warblers all but one was collected till the 10
    <span class="sup">th</span> of September. Those species that were caught over a time period more than one month, however, did not show remarkable variation between catching time and EROD activity.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The habitats included a common alder (
    <span class="italic">Alnus glutinosa</span>) dominated grove, a reed bed (
    <span class="italic">Phragmites</span>) and garden habitats. There were no major pollution sources near our study areas, although aerial contamination (e.g. via wind or roads) cannot be fully excluded. However, owing to the tendency of young birds to move and mix a lot in autumn (meaning that their origin varies a lot even within a species) we consider it most unlikely that exposure to pollutants would produce a systematic species-related bias in our data. Barn swallows were collected in 2007 near Turku as well. The birds were caught with mist nets (Ecotone). The nets were checked every 30 minutes. All the birds collected in this study were young females (born during summer 2008), 12–22 individuals per species, except in the case of reed warblers and sedge warblers, for which sex determination in field was impossible. The number of these two species was increased to 30 individuals and they were sexed later in the laboratory. By collecting young birds we were able to exclude the possible influence of migration and the diet consumed in their overwintering grounds, as well as reduce variation in their life-time pollution exposure and age-related pollutant accumulation. We also wanted to concentrate on one sex to avoid sex specific variation in their detoxification capacity. The birds were measured for their wing length and body mass. As a condition index we used wing length (mm) relative to body mass (g). Also moulting phase, an index of visible subcutaneous fat and muscle index were recorded and used to define the condition of the birds at time of capture. Birds were sacrificed by decapitation and subsequently dissected for the liver tissue, which was separated and placed in plastic Eppendorf tubes. Liver was chosen as a sampling site, because it is the major site for detoxification process (Whyte et al. 2000). Liver tissue were stored immediately in liquid nitrogen and later kept at −80°C until laboratory analyses. The carcasses of the birds were stored for sex identification and future analyses. The data were collected under the license of the Environmental Centre of southwest of Finland.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Frozen liver samples were homogenized with TissueLyser (Qiagen, Austin, USA) at +4°C to prevent the loss of enzymatic activity prior to measurement. It is important to keep the samples on ice at all stages of preparation. Centrifugation (10 000 g, 15 min) was conducted at +4°C and the used homogenizing buffer was kept ice-cold as well 
    <a rid="pone.0033926-Burke1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Burke1">[33]</a>. The complete supernatant was used in EROD activity analyses. The measurement of EROD activity is based on the function of CYP1A enzyme, which converts 7-ethoxyresorufin to a fluorescent product resorufin, which can be detected with a fluorometer 
    <a rid="pone.0033926-Whyte1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Whyte1">[12]</a>. The amount of resorufin grows linearly as a function of time and to make the samples comparable, the activity was proportioned to total protein concentration. The unit for EROD activity is hence ηmol/min/mg protein. EROD activity was measured according to Burke and Mayer 
    <a rid="pone.0033926-Burke1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Burke1">[33]</a> with adaptations to microplate. The measurements were done in triplicates using 96-well plates with Envision microplate reader (Perkin-Elmer Wallac, Turku, Finland). Protein assay was conducted according to Bradford method 
    <a rid="pone.0033926-Bradford1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Bradford1">[34]</a> using BioRad stock diluted to dH

Møller) to our data to see how EROD activity is related to relative BMR (W/body mass [g]) and relative liver mass (liver mass [g]×100/body mass [g]) (average values for the species) (
    <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0033926-t001" href="#pone-0033926-t001">Table 1</a>). The average liver masses for the species were derived from samples collected between June and September to minimize the seasonal variation in liver masses. The variation between the months was tested with general linear models and since there was no major monthly variation in liver mass, the mean values based on those four months were included in the final analyses (Felsenstein's correlations). The amount of species varied in the analyses, because liver mass was not available for sedge warbler and BMR for reed warbler respectively. The phylogenetically corrected (OLS) regression (with 95% confidence (CI) and predicted intervals (PI) mapped onto the original data space) and correlations between the variables were analysed with Felsenstein's contrasts in Mesquite phylogenetic software (Version 2.74) 
    <a rid="pone.0033926-Maddison1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Maddison1">[37]</a> by using PDTREE module of PDAP after ensuring the normality of the distributions. Felsenstein's correlations (r
    <sub>F</sub>) are based on phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC), enabling correlations among the sets of characters for a number of species that are not statistically independent, due to the common ancestor in their phylogenetic history.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phylogenetic relationships of the studied species were taken from Treplin et al. 
    <a rid="pone.0033926-Treplin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Treplin1">[38]</a> and branch lengths of the topology were estimated using DNA sequence data from six gene regions. The DNA sequences were downloaded from GenBank (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033926.s001" href="#pone.0033926.s001">Table S1</a>) and analyzed in a maximum likelihood framework using PAUP* 
    <a rid="pone.0033926-Swofford1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0033926-Swofford1">[39]</a>. In some cases a closely related species had to be used as there were no sequences available for species used in this study (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033926.s001" href="#pone.0033926.s001">Table S1</a>). The topology was fixed and a standard general time reversible model with a gamma correction to allow for rate heterogeneity was applied to the concatenated six gene dataset. To allow the estimation of the length of the basal branches, two outgroups were included (
    <span class="italic">Corvus</span> and 
    <span class="italic">Oriolus</span>). This produced a phylogenetic tree with branch lengths in substitutions per site per time unit, which was input into Mesquite for the independent contrasts analysis after the outgroups were pruned from the tree. Phylogeny was not included in the analyses of diet and migration status, because these variables only had two categories, and especially diet was so strongly dependent on phylogeny (insectivores vs. granivores) that there would be no power in the analysis to detect phylogenically independent variation with this number of species.
