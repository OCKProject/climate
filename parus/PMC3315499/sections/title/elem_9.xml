 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study species differed from each other in their liver EROD activity (GLM: F = 30.2
  <sub>9</sub>, p = &lt;0.001) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033926-g001" href="#pone-0033926-g001">Fig. 1</a>). The EROD activity was significantly associated with the diet (GLM: F = 106.6
  <sub>1</sub>, p = &lt;0.001) but not directly with the migration status (GLM: F = 0.22
  <sub>1</sub>, p = 0.64). However, the diet and migration status showed a significant interaction on the EROD activity (GLM: F = 37.6
  <sub>1</sub>, p = &lt;0.001), indicating highest EROD activity in migratory insectivores (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033926-g002" href="#pone-0033926-g002">Fig. 2</a>). Migratory granivores showed much lower EROD activity than migratory insectivores (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033926-g002" href="#pone-0033926-g002">Fig. 2</a>). Non-migratory/partially migrating insectivores showed lower EROD activity levels than migratory insectivores, while non-migratory/partially migrating granivores had higher EROD activity levels than migratory granivores (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033926-g002" href="#pone-0033926-g002">Fig. 2</a>). However, this result is quite strongly affected by low EROD activity in the migratory reed bunting, which differed significantly from all other study species (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033926-g001" href="#pone-0033926-g001">Fig. 1</a>). In contrast, the migratory chaffinch had EROD activity levels that were similar to non-migratory granivores (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was no significant correlation between EROD activity and condition index or fat index (p-values&gt;0.05) in any other species except willow warbler, which showed negative correlation between EROD activity and fat index (r
  <sub>S</sub> = −0.61, p = 0.006, n = 19). This suggests that basal EROD levels are not generally related to the body condition of the birds, though in some species fat reserves may be associated with EROD activity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After taking account the phylogeny there was no correlation between the body mass (size) of the species and EROD activity (r
  <sub>F</sub> = 0.27 p = 0.23, n = 10). Although EROD activity increased with increased relative BMR, the association was not statistically significant (r
  <sub>F</sub> = 0.51, p = 0.083, n = 9), (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033926-g003" href="#pone-0033926-g003">Fig. 3</a>). EROD activity and relative liver mass instead correlated positively with each other (r
  <sub>F</sub> = 0.65, p = 0.028, n = 9) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033926-g003" href="#pone-0033926-g003">Fig. 3</a>), suggesting that larger relative liver mass is associated with efficient detoxification capacity. Relative liver mass correlated positively also with relative BMR, suggesting that larger relative organ size increases relative BMR (r
  <sub>F</sub> = 0.62, p = 0.051, n = 8).
