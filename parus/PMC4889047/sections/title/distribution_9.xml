From 2010 to 2013 we conducted transect-based aerial surveys twice (≤ 3 weeks apart) each fall along the coast between Point Barrow and the U.S.A.-Canada border to characterize distribution. In fall, polar bears are easy to detect when on land because of the contrast between the colors of bears and the snow- and ice-free substrate [

  <a rid="pone.0155932.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref022">22</a>]. Transects were 8-km in length and included segments oriented perpendicular to the coast line connected by alternating inland or coastal segments. We flew Bell 206B and Aerostar 305A helicopters at an altitude of ≈90 m and airspeed of ≈80 knots. In addition, total counts were conducted over every barrier island encountered, with the exception of Barter Island. The village of Kaktovik is located on Barter Island, and is adjacent to a bowhead whale carcass aggregation site which provides opportunities for commercial polar bear viewing. As such, we did not fly over Barter Island over concerns that helicopter activity would disturb commercial bear viewing ventures. We did, however, collect ground-based total counts of all bears present at the Barter Island carcass site and local vicinity on the same day as our aerial survey. We flew over carcass aggregation sites at Point Barrow and Cross Island, though no carcasses were present at Point Barrow in 2013. When we encountered a bear, we estimated age, sex, and group size, and collected a geographic location. We combined counts from transects and barrier islands to generate a total uncorrected minimum count for each of the two annual surveys and used the total counts to examine spatial distribution.
