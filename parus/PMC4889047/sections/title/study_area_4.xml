 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study area ranged from Baillie Island, Canada, (70.5°N, 128° W) in the east, to Point Barrow, USA, (71°N, 156° W) in the west (

The SB is characterized by a narrow, biologically-productive continental shelf with bathymetry contours typically ≤ 300m, and with an abrupt shelf-break that quickly gives way to some of the deepest waters of the Arctic Ocean [

   <p>a-b. Spatial distribution of polar bears observed during fall aerial surveys, 2010–2013, along the coast and over barrier islands prior to the stocking of bowhead whale bone piles with remains from the subsistence harvest. Unused remains from subsistence-harvested bowhead whales are occasionally aggregated at sites on Point Barrow, and consistently at Cross Island (near Prudhoe Bay), and adjacent to Kaktovik on Barter Island following the cessation of the fall whaling season.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SB coastal region is characterized by an industrial footprint associated with oil and gas exploration and extraction activities causing polar bears that frequent this area to be potentially exposed to industrial activities [
  <a rid="pone.0155932.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref028">28</a>]. The Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk oil fields are situated at the approximate midpoint along the coast, and the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) spans a significant stretch of the western portion of the coastal plain, though there is no significant industrial development within the NPR-A. There are 3 communities within the study area that harvest bowhead whales (
  <span class="italic">Balaena mysticetus</span>) in the fall: Barrow, Nuiqsut, and Kaktovik. Remains from the harvest have been sporadically aggregated at Point Barrow and consistently aggregated at Cross Island and Barter Island, all of which are nearly evenly spaced along the coast where they have served as focal attractors for polar bears [
