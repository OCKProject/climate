 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polar bears in the SB prefer sea ice habitat over the continental shelf because it provides greater accessibility to prey than the deeper water of the polar basin [
  <a rid="pone.0155932.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref013">13</a>]. We hypothesized that the phenology of land use was influenced by sea ice characteristics, including the distance between the continental shelf break and the edge of the pack ice and the concentration of ice over the shelf. We used daily sea ice data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC; Boulder, Colorado, USA) to develop concentration and distance metrics. Sea ice concentrations were estimated from a 25 × 25 km resolution raster of passive microwave satellite imagery [
  <a rid="pone.0155932.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref036">36</a>]. For the months of July through October, we estimated a number of metrics including sea ice concentrations over the continental shelf, distances from the shelf break to pack ice, the timing of break-up and freeze-up, and length of the open-water season (see 
  <a rid="pone.0155932.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0155932.t001">Table 1</a> for a list of sea ice metrics). Shelf break and shelf area were delineated by the 300 m isobath for the offshore region within the boundary of the SB polar bear subpopulation [
  <a rid="pone.0155932.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref001">1</a>]. We defined areas covered by sea ice with two criteria based on different ice concentration thresholds, &gt;15% and &gt;50%. We then generated daily estimates of the proportion of the continental shelf area covered by &gt;15 or 50% sea ice concentration, and the mean distance between the shelf break and the ice pack, where ice pack was comprised by ice concentrations &gt;15 or 50%. We chose to use ice metrics based on both thresholds because &gt;50% is most commonly cited as the threshold above which sea ice habitat is most suitable for polar bears [
  <a rid="pone.0155932.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref020">20</a>], while break-up and freeze-up are often defined as the time when ≥15% concentration sea ice melts or refreezes [
  <a rid="pone.0155932.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref014">14</a>]. Additionally, because the SB is characterized by a narrow continental shelf, we hypothesized that bears may remain over the productive shelf even as ice concentrations drop below 50%.
