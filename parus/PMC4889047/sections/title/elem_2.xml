  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used location data from radiocollared adult females from 1986 to 2014 to determine if bears used terrestrial habitat during summer and, if so, to generate estimates of mean date of arrival on shore, duration of time spent on shore, and mean date of departure from shore back to the sea ice. The majority of locations prior to 2010 were derived with the Argos System, and have variable levels of accuracy from &lt; 250 m to &gt; 1500 m (see

We filtered locations in an attempt to remove spurious locations by first removing all designations which had a high probability of being erroneous. We then applied the Douglas Argos-Filter algorithm [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To integrate the GPS and filtered Argos location data, which varied both in accuracy and the temporal scale of collection, we employed the continuous time correlated random walk (CRAWL) model [
   <a rid="pone.0155932.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref032">32</a>] to develop predicted paths at a regularized daily time interval based on observed locations. The CRAWL model allows predicted paths to take into account variable location quality and sampling intervals. Thus, for Argos locations, we defined location accuracy based on accuracy designations for Telonics Argos collars (i.e., L3: 150 m, L2: 350 m, L1: 1000 m, L0: 1500 m;

Because location accuracies are not provided for locations with LA or LB designations, we provided conservative location accuracies; LA: 5,000 m, LB: 10,000 m. We assigned locations obtained from GPS collars an accuracy of 30 m.

   <a rid="pone.0155932.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref031">31</a>] to implement the CRAWL model and predict daily polar bear locations from 1 July to 31 October period. We then associated predicted locations with buffered land coverages (described below) to determine if an animal was likely to be on land at that time.

   <a rid="pone.0155932.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref034">34</a>], we excluded predicted locations that occurred between observed points separated by &gt;14 days. For bears that came ashore, we noted the ordinal date of arrival and departure, and calculated the total amount of time spent on shore. We then generated indices of the earliest and mean ordinal dates of arrival on shore, mean departure back to the sea ice, and length of stay on shore.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We determined if an animal’s location occurred on land by overlaying locations on one of two land coverages. The first layer was a digital elevation model (100 m resolution;

While this layer covered the majority of land used by bears in this study, it did not provide coverage for eastern Canada. Thus, to account for land use in that region, we used the default continent shapefile found in ArcGIS (version 10.1, ESRI, Redlands, CA). Because neither land coverage had sufficient resolution to detect small barrier islands, which are known to receive significant use by polar bears during summer [
   <a rid="pone.0155932.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref035">35</a>], we buffered the land coverages by 5 km. We then determined which animal locations occurred within the 5 km land buffer and categorized those as predicted land locations. While this might have resulted in some bears not on land being classified as using land, this was unlikely to occur given that landfast ice is largely absent during this period. Thus, any animal observed within this buffer would most likely have used land at some point during that day.

   <a rid="pone.0155932.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref013">13</a>]. We hypothesized that the phenology of land use was influenced by sea ice characteristics, including the distance between the continental shelf break and the edge of the pack ice and the concentration of ice over the shelf. We used daily sea ice data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC; Boulder, Colorado, USA) to develop concentration and distance metrics.

We defined areas covered by sea ice with two criteria based on different ice concentration thresholds, &gt;15% and &gt;50%. We then generated daily estimates of the proportion of the continental shelf area covered by &gt;15 or 50% sea ice concentration, and the mean distance between the shelf break and the ice pack, where ice pack was comprised by ice concentrations &gt;15 or 50%. We chose to use ice metrics based on both thresholds because &gt;50% is most commonly cited as the threshold above which sea ice habitat is most suitable for polar bears [

From 2010 to 2013 we conducted transect-based aerial surveys twice (≤ 3 weeks apart) each fall along the coast between Point Barrow and the U.S.A.-Canada border to characterize distribution. In fall, polar bears are easy to detect when on land because of the contrast between the colors of bears and the snow- and ice-free substrate [

Transects were 8-km in length and included segments oriented perpendicular to the coast line connected by alternating inland or coastal segments. We flew Bell 206B and Aerostar 305A helicopters at an altitude of ≈90 m and airspeed of ≈80 knots. In addition, total counts were conducted over every barrier island encountered, with the exception of Barter Island. The village of Kaktovik is located on Barter Island, and is adjacent to a bowhead whale carcass aggregation site which provides opportunities for commercial polar bear viewing. As such, we did not fly over Barter Island over concerns that helicopter activity would disturb commercial bear viewing ventures. We did, however, collect ground-based total counts of all bears present at the Barter Island carcass site and local vicinity on the same day as our aerial survey. We flew over carcass aggregation sites at Point Barrow and Cross Island, though no carcasses were present at Point Barrow in 2013. When we encountered a bear, we estimated age, sex, and group size, and collected a geographic location. We combined counts from transects and barrier islands to generate a total uncorrected minimum count for each of the two annual surveys and used the total counts to examine spatial distribution.

Based on the previously described analysis of CRAWL-derived locations, we coded land use or lack thereof by individuals as a binary response variable (i.e., 1 = individual used land, 0 = individual did not use land). Year was analyzed as a fixed effect, but because some individual bears were radiocollared in multiple years, we used individual as a random factor. We also calculated the mean annual percentage of radiocollared bears with long-term land use, and used a piecewise general linear regression procedure [
   <a rid="pone.0155932.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref039">39</a>] with a normal distribution to determine if and when there was a discontinuity (i.e., breakpoint) in the mean annual percentage detected on shore over the 29 years of study. Parameters estimated for the piecewise regression included the intercept, change in slope prior to the breakpoint, and change in slope after the breakpoint [
   <a rid="pone.0155932.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155932.ref039">39</a>]. We did not include collar type (Argos and GPS) as a variable in subsequent analyses, though it is possible that improvements in satellite collar technology could represent a confounding factor. However, while the ability to accurately estimate the true day of arrival on land and departure back to ice should be better with GPS-era collars, the Argos-era data should not be biased toward estimating either longer or shorter land tenures.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the relationship between the phenology of onshore use by radiocollared bears and sea ice dynamics, we used linear mixed models to examine the influence of sea ice conditions and characteristics on the annual mean timing of arrival on shore, length of stay on shore, and timing of departure from shore back to the sea ice. For this analysis, we included bears that came ashore for ≥7 consecutive days and used ordinal dates of arrival and departure, and total days spent on shore as response variables. We used the ≥7 consecutive days threshold to exclude bears that used land incidentally. Because we sampled some of the same individuals repeatedly, we included individual identity as a random factor in the models with first-order autocorrelation as a covariance structure. We used restricted maximum likelihood (REML) methods for model estimation. When modeling timing of departure, we censored individuals that entered maternity dens on land. Predictor variables included measures of &gt;15% and &gt;50% sea ice concentrations over the continental shelf (e.g., Mn&gt;15%, Mn&gt;50%), distance from the shelf of &gt;15% and &gt;50% sea ice (Mdis&gt;15%, Mdis&gt;50%), and length of the open water season defined as the periods of time when sea ice concentration remained ≤15 or ≤50% (OW15%, OW50%).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the paired sets of annual aerial surveys to investigate whether the availability of bowhead whale remains influenced polar bear distribution. We pooled data among years from surveys conducted before and after whale remains were placed at carcass aggregation sites (Point Barrow, Cross Island, and Barter Island). We used Moran’s I statistic to test the hypothesis that polar bear sightings were spatially autocorrelated (i.e., individuals were not randomly distributed) and an ArcGIS to determine the Euclidean distance of each bear sighting to the closest carcass aggregation site. We then used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine if the distribution of distances from carcass sites differed between survey sessions― i.e., whether the spatial distribution of bears differed prior to and after the stocking of carcass sites. Statistical significance for these tests was set at α = 0.05.</p>
