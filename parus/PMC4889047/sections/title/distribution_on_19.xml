The percentage of polar bears located in close proximity to bowhead whale remains sites was greater following stocking (D = 0.14, P = 0.001). Prior to stocking, 64% of polar bear observations occurred within 16 km (i.e., mean daily distance traveled by SB polar bears; [

During surveys conducted before and after bowhead whales were harvested, we observed the greatest percentage of bears near Barter Island (40%), followed by Cross Island (33%). Relatively few bears were observed in the vicinity of Point Barrow (&lt;2%).
