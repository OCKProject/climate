  <p>a-b. Spatial distribution of polar bears observed during fall aerial surveys, 2010â€“2013, along the coast and over barrier islands prior to the stocking of bowhead whale bone piles with remains from the subsistence harvest. Unused remains from subsistence-harvested bowhead whales are occasionally aggregated at sites on Point Barrow, and consistently at Cross Island (near Prudhoe Bay), and adjacent to Kaktovik on Barter Island following the cessation of the fall whaling season.</p>
