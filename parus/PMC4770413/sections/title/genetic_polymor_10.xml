 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated genetic diversities by the number of polymorphic sites (
  <span class="italic">S</span>), haplotype distribution (Hap), number of haplotypes (Nhap), haplotype diversity (
  <span class="italic">Hd</span>), and nucleotide diversity (
  <span class="italic">Ï€</span>), which were all calculated in DNASP 4.0
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>. We used the uncorrected 
  <span class="italic">p</span> distances to reconstruct an unrooted NJ tree to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among mitochondrial haplotypes of 
  <span class="italic">M. horvathi</span> using PAUP* 4.0b10
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. Statistical support for phylogenetic grouping was assessed by 1000 bootstrap replicates. To further investigate the relationships among unique haplotypes, we constructed unrooted networks using two methods: the neighbor-net algorithm with SplitsTree 4.6
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>, and a median-joining method
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a> constructed with default settings in Network 4.6.1.3 (Fluxus Technology, Suffolk, UK).
