  <a ref-type="table" rid="t2" href="#t2">Table 2</a>) suggested a scenario of recent demographic expansion in the northern and southern populations. For the whole dataset, the negative values of

  <a ref-type="table" rid="t2" href="#t2">Table 2</a>) also suggested an overall past population expansion. Divergence time between clade I and clade II from the results of BEAST was moderately in keeping with the result of IMa2, which was estimated to be 0.051 Ma (95% HPD: 0.073–0.031 Ma) and 0.022 Ma (95% HPD: 0.033–0.016 Ma) separately (i.e. population divergence occurred during the LIG to LGM transition). From

  <span class="italic">τ</span>/2
  <span class="italic">u</span>, we estimated the expansion time ranged from approximately 12.75–25.50 Ka, and the Bayesian skyline demographic reconstructions showed a pattern of population growth through time in which the plots started from 15 Ka (i.e., population expansion occurred in the post-LGM period) (
