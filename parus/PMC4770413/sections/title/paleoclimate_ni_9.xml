 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 47 occurrence records were obtained for niche modeling, including 33 records from the alcohol preserved specimens and 14 records from pinned specimens in Nankai University or the published literature. We chose the seven bioclimatic variables from the WorldClim database (

All the variables were derived from the WorldClim data center at a resolution of 2.5-arc. We used maximum entropy implemented in Maxent (version 3.3.3â€‰k
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>) to estimate niches in environmental dimensions. Analysis was run using default program conditions. Area Under Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot was used for model evaluation. For hindcasting the effect of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, the current native niche models were calibrated using the above environmental variables and then transferred onto the reconstructed climatic conditions during the LGM and LIG periods. The Community Climate System Model 3 (CCSM 3) for LGM conditions was used.
