  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">37</a> program was used to simulate 100 simulated annealing processes for 
  <span class="italic">K</span> = 2 to 10. The potential geographical zones associated with genetic discontinuities across the entire sample region were further investigated using Monmonier’s algorithm implemented in Barrier 2.2
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>. Mitochondrial DNA identified two major clades, which were apparently consistent with a north-south geographic partition (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">3</a>a). We assessed the hierarchical partitioning of genetic structure between the two groups (north and south) resulting from SAMOVA analysis in each marker using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) in Arlequin 3.5
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>. The statistical significance of variance components was assessed using 10000 random permutations. Additionally, for testing an isolation-by-distance model, the Mantel test was performed in IBDWS
