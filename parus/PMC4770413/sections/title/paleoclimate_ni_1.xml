 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A high AUC value was obtained from the current potential distribution (AUC = 0.987), indicating good predictive model performance. The current niche-predicted distribution of this species was generally similar to its actual distribution, with a potentially continuous range in subtropical China and a fragmentary range in southern Japan and Korea (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). When projecting the current niche into historical climate conditions, the suitable climate space continued to stay 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> during the LIG period, but expanded moderately toward southwestern China and most parts of Japan and Korea (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). When the ice age arrived (LGM period), under the CCSM model, the species’ potential range contracted greatly and was mainly located in two segregated refugia (the Sichuan Basin space and a space from northern Vietnam to northern Guangxi) (
