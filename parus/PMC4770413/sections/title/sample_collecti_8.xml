  <span class="italic">M. horvathi</span> across the natural distributional area, which largely covered the whole distributional range of this species in China (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Fig. S1</a>). Distribution maps were generated by the software ArcGIS 10 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). In each population, three to ten (mean of eight) mature males or females were collected. All the materials were deposited in the College of Life Sciences at Nankai University (Tianjin, China). Genomic DNA was extracted from the entire body excluding the genitalia. A total of 250 individuals were sequenced for mitochondrial markers (COI + COII) and nuclear markers (ITS1 + 5.8S + ITS2). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed using specific primers following Ye 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2014). The PCR procedure for COI, COII and nuclear markers (ITS1 + 5.8S + ITS2) included an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 minutes, followed by 31–33 cycles of 30 seconds at 92 °C, 30 seconds at 48–52 °C and 1 minute at 72 °C, ending with a final extension at 72 °C for 8 minutes. The chromatograms of sequences were unimodal, which excluded pseudogene disturbance. Sequences were visually proofread and aligned in Bioedit 7.1 software
