  <span class="italic">M. horvathi</span>. First, we tested the correlations between the ecological divergences and the phylogenetic splits using spatial evolutionary and ecological vicariance analysis (SEEVA
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">46</a>). We extracted seven environmental variables (BIO1, BIO5, BIO6, BIO12, BIO13, BIO14 and Elevation) for each sampling site in ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA), and primary GIS data layers for temperature and precipitation were obtained from the WorldClim data (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.worldclim.org/</span>). Quantitative variables (temperature, elevation and precipitation) were scored as ordered continuous data, while the qualitative variables (vegetation type) were treated as non-ordered categorical data. We divided these variables into four states according to the default setting in SEEVA. We investigated the correlations between ecological shifts and the phylogenetic splits using Fisher’s exact tests and divergence indices (D). Second we used PCA-env function in the R script
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">47</a> to measure niche overlaps in gridded environmental space between the two lineages
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">48</a>. Observed densities for each region were corrected in light of the availability of environmental space using kernel density functions. Niche overlap was measured along gradients of a multivariate analysis (i.e. principal component analysis, PCA), and the statistical tests of niche equivalency and similarity
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">45</a> were computed from the density estimations of taxa in environmental space. Similarity was quantified using Schoener’s
