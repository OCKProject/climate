 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SEEVA analysis compared eight environmental variables between the sister lineages for 
  <span class="italic">M. horvathi</span>. Three of eight comparisons were significant (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S3</a>). The phylogenetic splits between the north and south lineages showed strong divergence in terms of annual mean temperature (BIO1, D = 0.73*), minimum temperature of the coldest month (BIO6, D = 1.0*) and vegetation (D = 0.82*) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig. 6</a>). Although 
  <span class="italic">M. horvathi</span> depended on the water habitat for survival, the split between the north and south lineages only showed a slight divergence in annual precipitation (BIO12, D = 0.40) and precipitation in the driest month (BIO14, D = 0.41). The PCA-env results suggested the two different lineages might not occupy identical habitat, but the differences could simply be due to the differential availability of habitat in the different regions that they occupied (
