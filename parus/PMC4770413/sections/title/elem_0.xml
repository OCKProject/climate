  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A high AUC value was obtained from the current potential distribution (AUC = 0.987), indicating good predictive model performance. The current niche-predicted distribution of this species was generally similar to its actual distribution, with a potentially continuous range in subtropical China and a fragmentary range in southern Japan and Korea (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). When projecting the current niche into historical climate conditions, the suitable climate space continued to stay 
   <span class="italic">in situ</span> during the LIG period, but expanded moderately toward southwestern China and most parts of Japan and Korea (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). When the ice age arrived (LGM period), under the CCSM model, the species’ potential range contracted greatly and was mainly located in two segregated refugia (the Sichuan Basin space and a space from northern Vietnam to northern Guangxi) (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the mitochondrial data, 1405 bp of protein-coding regions of mitochondrial genome were obtained from 250 individuals, including sections of the COI (726 bp) and COII (679 bp) genes. Ninety unique haplotypes were derived among all individuals. The 96 polymorphic sites included 67 singleton variable and 29 parsimony informative sites. The nucleotide diversities and haplotype diversities ranged from 0.00057 to 0.00360 with an average of 0.00262, and 0.378 to 1.000 with an average of 0.845, respectively (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). NJ analyses produced tree topology based on combined mitochondrial sequences (COI + COII) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). The whole haplotypes were shallowly separated into two supported major clades, clade I and clade II. The haplotype frequencies of clade I and clade II were shown in a pie graph revealing that the geographical distributions of the two monophyletic clades were uneven (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). Most haplotypes of clade I were located widely in the northern region of subtropical China, whereas most haplotypes of clade II were commonly found in the narrower southern region (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). Interestingly, the intermediate populations (ZJTS, JXLN and GZYH) living between the northern and southern regions simultaneously possessed the haplotype diversities of both lineages. The network analysis based on all ninety haplotypes showed the same pattern, with two well-defined independent haplogroups (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Figs 3</a>b and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">4</a>a). In the haplotype network (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4a</a>), h1, h12, h15 and h25 were the four most frequent haplotypes, characterizing 37.6%, 6%, 3.2% and 9.6% of individuals respectively. The h1 ancestral haplotype was mostly found in the northern region, whereas h12, h15 and h25 were the ancestral haplotypes found in the southern region (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the nuclear sequencing data, 1039 bp fragments were successfully obtained from 237 individuals, including ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 genes. 19 unique haplotypes were derived among all individuals. The 19 polymorphic sites included 16 singleton variable and 3 parsimony informative sites. The nucleotide diversities and haplotype diversities ranged from 0 to 0.00123 with an average of 0.00055, and 0.000 to 0.833 with an average of 0.478, respectively (

Zones of genetic discontinuities identified by Barrier 2.2 showed the potential geographical barriers associated with the genetic abruption (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Fig. S1</a>). The bold lines mainly divided the entire sampling region into a northern and a southern subregion, reflecting significant genetic/geographical isolation between them. Isolations between the northern and southern subregions (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Fig. S1</a>) were mostly consistent with the results of SAMOVA. The nuclear sequencing data showed much lower genetic diversities than the mitochondrial data, and revealed no distinct phylogeographical structure pattern (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4b</a>). Therefore SAMOVA and Barrier analysis were not implemented in nuclear data.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AMOVA analysis showed a relatively significant genetic variance between the northern and southern groups in mitochondrial DNA data (48.45%,

From

   <span class="italic">u</span>, we estimated the expansion time ranged from approximately 12.75–25.50 Ka, and the Bayesian skyline demographic reconstructions showed a pattern of population growth through time in which the plots started from 15 Ka (i.e., population expansion occurred in the post-LGM period) (

   <span class="italic">M. horvathi</span> depended on the water habitat for survival, the split between the north and south lineages only showed a slight divergence in annual precipitation (BIO12, D = 0.40) and precipitation in the driest month (BIO14, D = 0.41). The PCA-env results suggested the two different lineages might not occupy identical habitat, but the differences could simply be due to the differential availability of habitat in the different regions that they occupied (
