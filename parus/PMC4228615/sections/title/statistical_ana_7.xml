 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed the effect of antiparasite treatment on the growth rate (g/day) and survival of individual chicks and the combined growth rate of all siblings following treatment. These responses reflect different aspects of how parasitism might affect broods: We expect differences in growth rate among nest-mates to reflect how resources are allocated among siblings, and whole-brood growth rate to reflect total parental provisioning. All analyses were conducted in R version 2.13.1 (R Development Core Team 
  <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">2011</a>). All models investigating effects on individual chicks included nest as a random factor to account for the nonindependence of chicks in a brood. Apart from the FEC analysis, all models were linear or generalized linear mixed models, fitted using the packages nlme (Pinheiro et al. 
  <a rid="b68" ref-type="bibr" href="#b68">2012</a>) and lme4 (Bates et al. 
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">2011</a>), respectively, except whole-brood growth rate, which was modeled using simple linear models in the package stats (R Development Core Team 
  <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">2011</a>). All parameter estimates and effect sizes are presented as mean Â± 1 standard error. All model selection used Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to determine the model that best fit the data (Burnham and Anderson
