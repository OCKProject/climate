 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess whether siblings had different worm burdens either pre- or post-treatment, we collected fecal samples every time a chick excreted during handling and counted the number of nematode eggs in it as a proxy for parasite burden (fecal egg counts or FECs; Seivwright et al. 
  <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2004</a>; Atkinson et al. 
  <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">2009</a>). We had sufficient fecal material for quantitative analysis before and after treatment in 2010, where we obtained samples from 60 chicks in 34 nests before treatment (29 controls, 31 drug-treated) and from 102 chicks in 42 nests after treatment (47 controls and 55 drug-treated), of which 54 chicks in 33 nests had both before- and after-treatment samples (28 controls, 26 drug-treated). Samples were classified as pre- or post-treatment, with a spread of ages (15–25 days) in the post-treatment group. We did not have sufficient fecal material to conduct this comparison in all years, but we were able to examine interannual differences in worm burdens in control groups in 2010, 2011, and 2012. For this 3-year comparison, we obtained post-treatment samples from 119 chicks in 65 control nests.

  <a rid="b12" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12">2009</a>). The sample was mixed well with concentrated salt/sugar solution at a ratio of 20 mL solution for 1 g of feces and left for at least 60 sec to allow most of the organic debris to settle. Using a pipette, the sample was then mixed gently without disturbing the layer of debris and an aliquot of 0.15 mL taken while raising the pipette up through the liquid. This sample was placed in a McMaster slide, and all nematode eggs under the grid were counted under a light microscope at 40× magnification. This was repeated for three aliquots from each sample, totaling 0.023 g of feces.
