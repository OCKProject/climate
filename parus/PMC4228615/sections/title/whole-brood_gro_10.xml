 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether chick treatment affected the total amount of parental provisioning to the nest, we modeled whole-brood growth rate. We examined the effects of treatment and productivity as main effects and their interaction and included brood size at the end of the linear growth phase to account for nests in which chicks died after treatment (45 nests of 131 lost at least one chick during this period) and brood sex ratio (number of males divided by brood size), as whole-brood growth rates are likely to depend on the relative proportion of the two sexes because of sex-specific differences in growth rate.</p>
