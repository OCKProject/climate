  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This experiment was carried out on the breeding population of shags on the Isle of May National Nature Reserve, southeast Scotland (56°11 N, 2°33 W), during the breeding seasons (April–July) in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Shags lay a modal clutch of three eggs (range 1-4), each 3 days apart (Snow 
   <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">1960</a>; Granroth-Wilding 
   <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2013</a>). In three egg clutches (78% of clutches in this population), the first egg is the smallest, the second egg is the largest, and the third is generally intermediate in size (Coulson et al. 
   <a rid="b500" ref-type="bibr" href="#b500">1969</a>). Incubation begins when the second egg is laid, such that the first two eggs hatch within 24 h of one another (the A &amp; B chicks), while the third hatches c. 2 days later (the C chick) (Potts et al. 
   <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">1980</a>; Stokland &amp; Amundsen 
   <a rid="b89" ref-type="bibr" href="#b89">1988</a>, pers. obs.). This hatching asynchrony creates a size hierarchy where the C chick remains smaller than its older siblings halfway through chick rearing despite the fact that it typically comes from a larger egg than its A egg counterpart (across the 5 years, at age 25 days of a 50-day nestling period, C chick 9% smaller, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001). Chick mortality is highest in the first 10 days after hatching (Daunt et al. 
   <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">1999</a>) and generally higher for last-hatched chicks (Amundsen and Stokland 
   <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">1988</a>; this study). Males grow faster than females in this sexually dimorphic species (Daunt et al. 
   <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2001a</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sampling of both adults and chicks in this population has demonstrated a very high prevalence of infection of parasitic gastrointestinal ascaridoid nematodes, predominantly 
   <span class="italic">Contracaecum rudolphii</span> (68 of 68 adults endoscoped and 31 of 31 chicks over 10 days old dissected following natural mortality), although, burdens vary substantially between individuals (Reed et al. 
   <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2012</a>; Burthe et al. 
   <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2013</a>; Granroth-Wilding 
   <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2013</a>). Seabirds are the definitive hosts for 
   <span class="italic">C. rudolphii</span> (Anderson

   <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>). Adult worms at this stage release eggs into the marine environment via the bird's feces, which hatch and pass through paratenic crustacean and fish hosts to enter the bird's proventriculus where they feed on food ingested by the host (Anderson 
   <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2000</a>; Abollo et al. 
   <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2001</a>; Fagerholm and Overstreet 
   <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>). Chicks are infected by larval worms in the regurgitated fish they are fed by their parents; direct transmission of adult worms dislodged from the parents' proventriculus may also occur (Hoberg 
   <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">2005</a>; Fagerholm and Overstreet 
   <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>; Granroth-Wilding 
   <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2013</a>). Characteristically of macroparasites, nematode infections in seabirds are rarely lethal (Clayton and Moore 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">1997</a>; Hoberg 
   <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">2005</a>; Fagerholm and Overstreet 
   <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>), but they impose costs through direct competition with hosts for their fish prey and damage such as inflammation, tissue necrosis, and secondary bacterial infections at attachment sites (Abollo et al. 
   <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2001</a>; Hoberg 
   <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">2005</a>; S. Burthe &amp; H. Granroth-Wilding, pers. obs.). Shags also host biting lice 
   <span class="italic">Eidemanniella pellucida</span>, but previous work has found no evidence for an effect of lice on chick growth or survival (Daunt et al. 
   <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">2001b</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study years differed markedly in annual population productivity (Table
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>), measured as the average number of fledged young per incubated nest in a series of unmanipulated, long-term monitoring plots on the Isle of May, henceforth “productivity.” In the last decade (2002–2012), productivity has ranged from 0.25 to 2.04 fledged chicks per nest (Newell et al. 
   <a rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" href="#b61">2012</a>). In shags, as in other seabirds, productivity is best explained by models that integrate multiple environmental factors, including food availability (quality and abundance of sandeel 
   <span class="italic">Ammodytes marinus</span>, the shag's principal prey: Frederiksen et al.

   <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2012</a>), climate (sea surface temperature: Burthe et al. 
   <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2012</a>), and weather (rain and wind: Aebischer 
   <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">1993</a>). These combined measures have been shown to capture the environmental variability that is relevant to a shag's reproductive decisions better than any single measure on its own (Frederiksen et al. 
   <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2006</a>; Burthe et al. 
   <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2012</a>). We therefore used productivity as an annual proxy for environmental conditions (sensu Danchin et al.

    <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2013</a>) and have been previously used on chicks with no negative consequences on survival or growth rate (Reed et al. 
    <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2012</a>). All blood sampling and drug administration was carried out under UK Home Office license with full ethical approval.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental Procedure</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In each experimental breeding season, we compared the effect of treatment on individually marked chicks in antiparasite-treated broods to control broods of three chicks. All study nests were monitored daily from the colony-wide onset of laying to obtain laying dates, which were used to predict hatching date, assuming a mean incubation period of 36 days (Potts et al. 
    <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">1980</a>). Toward the end of incubation, nests were visited every 1–2 days to obtain an accurate hatching date and hatching order for each chick. Hatchlings were blood sampled for molecular sexing (Griffiths et al. 
    <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">1996</a>) and individually marked using colored wool or electrical tape, which was replaced regularly until permanent metal rings could be fitted at age c.15 days.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Treatment was carried out when the oldest chick in a brood was 10–14 days old, when all brood members are at an early stage in the linear growth phase. Treatments were assigned randomly, matching control and drug-treated nests for hatch date and colony area. Only broods with three chicks still alive at the point of treatment were used in the experiment. In broods that were assigned to the treatment group, all chicks were simultaneously treated by subcutaneous injection with 0.05 mL of 1% wt/vol ivermectin (Panomec© by Merial UK), a broad-spectrum antihelminthic. Control broods were left untreated (2006) or sham-treated with 0.05 mL distilled water (2007) or saline (2010–2012). Previous studies have found no difference between sham-treated and unmanipulated controls in any of the dependent variables investigated (Reed et al. 
    <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2012</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At treatment, chicks were assigned ranks A, B, or C in order of decreasing size. Size at this age correctly identifies the last-hatched chick in 90% of cases (120 of a subset of 134 nests with accurate hatching order for all chicks), and mass asymmetry is likely to be a key driver of within-brood dynamics (Reed et al. 
    <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2012</a>). Differences in recommended drug volume as a proportion of body mass between chicks of different weights were so small they did not allow for accurate dose adjustment. Previous parasite treatment studies in our system have shown that within-brood differences in response to fixed volume treatment were not influenced by mass differences at treatment (Reed et al. 
    <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2012</a>). However, to ensure that any dosing differences did not bias our observed effects, we controlled statistically for differences between chicks in dose as a proportion of mass.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All chicks in each nest were weighed every 4–7 days until the oldest chick was aged approximately 28-30 days, the end of the linear growth phase. Weights were measured to the nearest 0.5 g for chicks up to 50 g, 1 g up to 300 g, 2.5 g up to 600 g, 5 g up to 1000 g, and 10 g up to 2000 g. After the linear growth period, nests were monitored regularly for chick survival until fledging at ∼50 days (Snow

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Worm burdens</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess whether siblings had different worm burdens either pre- or post-treatment, we collected fecal samples every time a chick excreted during handling and counted the number of nematode eggs in it as a proxy for parasite burden (fecal egg counts or FECs; Seivwright et al. 
    <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2004</a>; Atkinson et al. 
    <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">2009</a>). We had sufficient fecal material for quantitative analysis before and after treatment in 2010, where we obtained samples from 60 chicks in 34 nests before treatment (29 controls, 31 drug-treated) and from 102 chicks in 42 nests after treatment (47 controls and 55 drug-treated), of which 54 chicks in 33 nests had both before- and after-treatment samples (28 controls, 26 drug-treated). Samples were classified as pre- or post-treatment, with a spread of ages (15–25 days) in the post-treatment group. We did not have sufficient fecal material to conduct this comparison in all years, but we were able to examine interannual differences in worm burdens in control groups in 2010, 2011, and 2012. For this 3-year comparison, we obtained post-treatment samples from 119 chicks in 65 control nests.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Samples were frozen and stored at −20°C or in a solution of dimethyl sulfoxide, EDTA, and sodium chloride (DESS) (Yoder et al. 
    <a rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" href="#b98">2006</a>; Seutin, White &amp; Boag 
    <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">1991</a>) at room temperature. Storage had no detectable effect on egg count (negative binomial model, 
    <span class="italic">χ</span> = 1.57, df = 1, 
    <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.211; see statistical methods below). FECs were obtained using a flotation technique (adjusted from Bowman and Georgi 
    <a rid="b12" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12">2009</a>). The sample was mixed well with concentrated salt/sugar solution at a ratio of 20 mL solution for 1 g of feces and left for at least 60 sec to allow most of the organic debris to settle. Using a pipette, the sample was then mixed gently without disturbing the layer of debris and an aliquot of 0.15 mL taken while raising the pipette up through the liquid. This sample was placed in a McMaster slide, and all nematode eggs under the grid were counted under a light microscope at 40× magnification. This was repeated for three aliquots from each sample, totaling 0.023 g of feces.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analysis</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed the effect of antiparasite treatment on the growth rate (g/day) and survival of individual chicks and the combined growth rate of all siblings following treatment. These responses reflect different aspects of how parasitism might affect broods: We expect differences in growth rate among nest-mates to reflect how resources are allocated among siblings, and whole-brood growth rate to reflect total parental provisioning. All analyses were conducted in R version 2.13.1 (R Development Core Team 
    <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">2011</a>). All models investigating effects on individual chicks included nest as a random factor to account for the nonindependence of chicks in a brood. Apart from the FEC analysis, all models were linear or generalized linear mixed models, fitted using the packages nlme (Pinheiro et al. 
    <a rid="b68" ref-type="bibr" href="#b68">2012</a>) and lme4 (Bates et al. 
    <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">2011</a>), respectively, except whole-brood growth rate, which was modeled using simple linear models in the package stats (R Development Core Team 
    <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">2011</a>). All parameter estimates and effect sizes are presented as mean ± 1 standard error. All model selection used Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to determine the model that best fit the data (Burnham and Anderson

    <a rid="b94" ref-type="bibr" href="#b94">2002</a>) to account for their heavily skewed distribution, with many zeros and few very high counts, common in parasitological data (Shaw et al. 
    <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">1998</a>). Pre- and post-treatment samples from 2010 were analyzed separately to account for partial resampling of chicks. For each, we tested the effect of rank, treatment, and a rank-by-treatment interaction on burdens. To examine interannual variability in worm burdens, we tested the effect of year as a factor (too few years to robustly fit productivity as a covariate) on fecal egg counts in post-treatment control chicks across the 3 years (2010, 2011, and 2012) with rank fitted as a fixed effect.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual chick responses to treatment</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our first indicator of individual chick performance, growth rate during the linear phase of growth, correlates well in shags with prefledging mass (Reed et al. 
    <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2012</a>), which studies in a range of bird species have shown to be positively related to recruitment probability (Magrath 
    <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">1991</a>; Schwagmeyer and Mock 
    <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">2008</a>). We obtained individual growth rates during this linear growth phase by fitting a linear regression for each chick. Each chick had 3–5 measurement points (mean 4.7, 1231 measurements on 259 chicks) apart from in 2007, when only two measurements per chick were possible (at treatment and toward the end of the linear growth phase, mean age 29.3 days). The data have previously been shown to be quantitatively robust to this restricted sampling (Reed et al. 
    <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2012</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested whether the rank-specific effect of treatment on growth rate varied with environmental conditions by fitting a three-way interaction term between rank as a three-level factor, treatment as a two-level factor, and productivity as a covariate. We compared the fit of the three-way interaction with models containing all of its subsidiary two-way interactions in turn and simultaneously. All models also included sex to account for the faster growth rate of males, which may make them more expensive to rear and hence more sensitive to their rank, levels of parasitism, and/or prevailing conditions (Daunt et al. 
    <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2001a</a>; Reed et al. 
    <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">2008a</a>). Therefore, we compared the fit of all models fitted to three terms: sex as a main effect, a sex-by-rank interaction, or a sex-by-rank-by-productivity interaction. We also tested whether sex affected chicks' responses to treatment in the same way as we tested the role of rank. To examine whether rank-specific treatment responses were simply a result of mass differences between siblings at treatment, we fitted mass at treatment instead of rank and undertook the same model fitting and selection procedure.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also investigated whether treatment affected chick survival between treatment and fledging (age ∼50 days, Snow 
    <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">1960</a>). We used the same models as for chick growth rate, with survival modeled as a binary response with binomial errors and a logit-link function.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether chick treatment affected the total amount of parental provisioning to the nest, we modeled whole-brood growth rate. We examined the effects of treatment and productivity as main effects and their interaction and included brood size at the end of the linear growth phase to account for nests in which chicks died after treatment (45 nests of 131 lost at least one chick during this period) and brood sex ratio (number of males divided by brood size), as whole-brood growth rates are likely to depend on the relative proportion of the two sexes because of sex-specific differences in growth rate.</p>
