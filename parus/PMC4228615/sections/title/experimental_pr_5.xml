 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In each experimental breeding season, we compared the effect of treatment on individually marked chicks in antiparasite-treated broods to control broods of three chicks. All study nests were monitored daily from the colony-wide onset of laying to obtain laying dates, which were used to predict hatching date, assuming a mean incubation period of 36 days (Potts et al. 
  <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">1980</a>). Toward the end of incubation, nests were visited every 1–2 days to obtain an accurate hatching date and hatching order for each chick. Hatchlings were blood sampled for molecular sexing (Griffiths et al. 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">1996</a>) and individually marked using colored wool or electrical tape, which was replaced regularly until permanent metal rings could be fitted at age c.15 days.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Treatment was carried out when the oldest chick in a brood was 10–14 days old, when all brood members are at an early stage in the linear growth phase. Treatments were assigned randomly, matching control and drug-treated nests for hatch date and colony area. Only broods with three chicks still alive at the point of treatment were used in the experiment. In broods that were assigned to the treatment group, all chicks were simultaneously treated by subcutaneous injection with 0.05 mL of 1% wt/vol ivermectin (Panomec© by Merial UK), a broad-spectrum antihelminthic. Control broods were left untreated (2006) or sham-treated with 0.05 mL distilled water (2007) or saline (2010–2012). Previous studies have found no difference between sham-treated and unmanipulated controls in any of the dependent variables investigated (Reed et al. 
  <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At treatment, chicks were assigned ranks A, B, or C in order of decreasing size. Size at this age correctly identifies the last-hatched chick in 90% of cases (120 of a subset of 134 nests with accurate hatching order for all chicks), and mass asymmetry is likely to be a key driver of within-brood dynamics (Reed et al. 
  <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2012</a>). Differences in recommended drug volume as a proportion of body mass between chicks of different weights were so small they did not allow for accurate dose adjustment. Previous parasite treatment studies in our system have shown that within-brood differences in response to fixed volume treatment were not influenced by mass differences at treatment (Reed et al. 
  <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2012</a>). However, to ensure that any dosing differences did not bias our observed effects, we controlled statistically for differences between chicks in dose as a proportion of mass.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All chicks in each nest were weighed every 4–7 days until the oldest chick was aged approximately 28-30 days, the end of the linear growth phase. Weights were measured to the nearest 0.5 g for chicks up to 50 g, 1 g up to 300 g, 2.5 g up to 600 g, 5 g up to 1000 g, and 10 g up to 2000 g. After the linear growth period, nests were monitored regularly for chick survival until fledging at ∼50 days (Snow 
  <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">1960</a>).
