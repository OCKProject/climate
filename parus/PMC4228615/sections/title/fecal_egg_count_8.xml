 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We modeled FECs using a negative binomial distribution in the package MASS (Venables &amp; Ripley 
  <a rid="b94" ref-type="bibr" href="#b94">2002</a>) to account for their heavily skewed distribution, with many zeros and few very high counts, common in parasitological data (Shaw et al. 
  <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">1998</a>). Pre- and post-treatment samples from 2010 were analyzed separately to account for partial resampling of chicks. For each, we tested the effect of rank, treatment, and a rank-by-treatment interaction on burdens. To examine interannual variability in worm burdens, we tested the effect of year as a factor (too few years to robustly fit productivity as a covariate) on fecal egg counts in post-treatment control chicks across the 3 years (2010, 2011, and 2012) with rank fitted as a fixed effect.
