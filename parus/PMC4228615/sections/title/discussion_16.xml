 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we have shown that quantitative measures of prevailing environmental conditions can explain variation in responses to parasitism. Moreover, individuals can differ substantially in how parasitism and environmental conditions interact to shape their juvenile development. We found that last-hatched chicks generally responded more strongly than their older siblings to both antinematode treatment and our proxy for environmental conditions. However, the relationship between hatching order, parasitism, and environmental conditions was not simply additive: In the most productive year, parasite treatment had the opposite effect to other years and decreased the growth rate of youngest siblings. These effects were likely due to inherent differences between brood mates in physiology or competitive ability, as siblings did not differ in their parasite load. We found no evidence that parents altered overall investment in drug-treated compared to control broods, as treatment did not change the growth rate of the whole brood. However, as treatment altered the relative growth rates of individuals within the brood, it may have affected how parents adjust allocation of resources among brood members. Overall, our results show that parasitism is important in driving between-individual variation in juvenile developmental trajectories, which could have lifelong fitness consequences (Lindström

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quantitative relationship we found between environmental conditions and parasite effects demonstrates the importance of repeating experimental manipulations across a range of natural conditions. Beyond simply demonstrating the generality of findings, such repeats enable us to account informatively for differences in treatment effects. Although many studies observe that wild hosts' responses to infection can vary between years and seasons, or when environmental variables such as food availability are experimentally manipulated (e.g., Howe 
  <a rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" href="#b42">1992</a>; Stien et al. 
  <a rid="b88" ref-type="bibr" href="#b88">2002</a>; Redpath et al.

  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2008</a>; Knowles et al. 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2010b</a>), we know of no previous study that quantitates the effect of prevailing environmental conditions and incorporates such measures to better explain how individual hosts are impacted by parasites in the wild. Our quantification was informative even with only a limited number of experimental years, a common constraint in wild systems. Importantly, our results show that the interplay between parasitism and environmental conditions was not an intuitively simple case of steadily decreasing parasite impacts as conditions improved. Rather, treatment had the opposite effect in the most productive year to the less productive years, with last-hatched chicks in control broods in the most productive year growing faster than their older siblings, indicating that dealing with an infection may trade off against growth in complex ways. This observation suggests a little explored aspect of the role of younger siblings as highly plastic “resource-tracking” offspring. They may be adaptive for parents not only by minimizing costs of misplaced investment in poor conditions (Mock and Forbes 
  <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">1995</a>; Forbes et al. 
  <a rid="b30" ref-type="bibr" href="#b30">2002</a>; Forbes 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2009</a>) but also by taking advantage of exceptionally favorable conditions through a more plastic growth rate, maximizing parental fitness in high-productivity seasons. This high-risk, high-return strategy is considered in terms of mortality by Forbes (
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2009</a>, 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2011</a>) and applied to an observational dataset, but we are not aware of any theoretical or empirical extension such as ours of the high-return aspect of this theory.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results highlight the role that parasitism may play in brood reduction and family conflict. Based on fecal egg counts, we found no evidence for systematic variation between siblings in their initial worm burdens. This suggests that heterogeneity among siblings in their response to treatment stems from inherent differences between brood members rather than differences in infection levels. Siblings may experience differing costs of a given infection for two reasons, which could operate simultaneously. First, brood members may differ intrinsically in how they cope with both parasite infection and the prevailing external conditions. This may arise from inherent differences such as their relative size and physiology at hatching (Mock and Forbes 
  <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">1995</a>; Mock and Parker 
  <a rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57">1997</a>; Bonabeau et al. 
  <a rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10">1998</a>; Drummond 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2006</a>), within-brood differences in maternal allocation of antibodies to eggs (Pihlaja et al. 
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2006</a>; Hasselquist and Nilsson 
  <a rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" href="#b39">2009</a>; Martyka et al. 
  <a rid="b54" ref-type="bibr" href="#b54">2011</a>), or differences in parental provisioning early in life (Parker et al. 
  <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2002</a>). Second, parasitism may alter competitive dynamics within the brood. If the impact of infection and prevailing environmental conditions affect chicks' competitive abilities in different ways, within-brood interactions may have a different outcome. These influences on individual chicks' competitive environment may lead to siblings effectively inhabiting different worlds despite growing up in the same nest (Forbes 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2011</a>). Indeed, mechanisms that have evolved to give C chicks a developmental boost in their harsher social environment may also give them more potential to do well in benign conditions, as we found.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although within-brood development patterns were influenced by antiparasite treatment, we found no evidence that treatment influenced total parental investment in the brood, which contrasts with similar studies in ectoparasite systems, where increases in provisioning to parasitized broods have been reported (Christe et al. 
  <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">1996</a>; Hurtrez-Boussès et al. 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">1998</a>). However, in ectoparasite systems, changes to provisioning may be a response to a change in parents' own parasite load, altered by the ectoparasites redistributing themselves among the family after manipulation of chick parasite load (Bize et al. 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2004</a>; Fitze et al. 
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2004</a>; Gallizzi et al. 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2008</a>). It is therefore difficult in ectoparasite systems to isolate specific parental responses to chick infection levels. Endoparasite systems, on the other hand, allow us to exclude this possibility by using a trophically transmitted parasite that, to our knowledge, cannot be passed from chicks to parents.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we have demonstrated that parasite infection is an important component of juvenile shags' developmental environment whose impact on different brood members depends on the prevailing environmental conditions. Infection during early life may have substantial consequences for an individual's future success as juveniles are more susceptible than adults to infection and its effects (Hudson and Dobson 
  <a rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43">1997</a>; Møller 
  <a rid="b58" ref-type="bibr" href="#b58">1997</a>; Wakelin &amp; Apanius

  <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2003</a>) and conditions during development can have lifelong fitness consequences (Lindström 
  <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">1999</a>; Metcalfe and Monaghan 
  <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2001</a>; Monaghan 
  <a rid="b59" ref-type="bibr" href="#b59">2008</a>). Our results not only demonstrate the importance of considering both environmental and individual variability when assessing the role of parasites in host ecology, but also show that a quantitative consideration of prevailing conditions can be valuable in understanding individual responses to experimental manipulations in wild systems.
