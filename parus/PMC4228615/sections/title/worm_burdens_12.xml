 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2010, nematode egg counts before treatment did not differ between drug-treated and control shag chick groups (−0.2 ± 0.9, 
  <span class="italic">χ</span> = 0.03, df = 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.865), but 5–15 days after treatment, drug-treated chicks released significantly fewer eggs than control chicks (−3.7 ± 0.9; 
  <span class="italic">χ</span> = 8.5, df = 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001). Chicks of different rank did not differ in their fecal egg counts before or after treatment (before,
