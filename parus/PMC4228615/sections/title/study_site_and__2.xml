 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This experiment was carried out on the breeding population of shags on the Isle of May National Nature Reserve, southeast Scotland (56°11 N, 2°33 W), during the breeding seasons (April–July) in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Shags lay a modal clutch of three eggs (range 1-4), each 3 days apart (Snow 
  <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">1960</a>; Granroth-Wilding 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2013</a>). In three egg clutches (78% of clutches in this population), the first egg is the smallest, the second egg is the largest, and the third is generally intermediate in size (Coulson et al. 
  <a rid="b500" ref-type="bibr" href="#b500">1969</a>). Incubation begins when the second egg is laid, such that the first two eggs hatch within 24 h of one another (the A &amp; B chicks), while the third hatches c. 2 days later (the C chick) (Potts et al. 
  <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">1980</a>; Stokland &amp; Amundsen 
  <a rid="b89" ref-type="bibr" href="#b89">1988</a>, pers. obs.). This hatching asynchrony creates a size hierarchy where the C chick remains smaller than its older siblings halfway through chick rearing despite the fact that it typically comes from a larger egg than its A egg counterpart (across the 5 years, at age 25 days of a 50-day nestling period, C chick 9% smaller, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001). Chick mortality is highest in the first 10 days after hatching (Daunt et al. 
  <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">1999</a>) and generally higher for last-hatched chicks (Amundsen and Stokland 
  <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">1988</a>; this study). Males grow faster than females in this sexually dimorphic species (Daunt et al. 
  <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2001a</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sampling of both adults and chicks in this population has demonstrated a very high prevalence of infection of parasitic gastrointestinal ascaridoid nematodes, predominantly 
  <span class="italic">Contracaecum rudolphii</span> (68 of 68 adults endoscoped and 31 of 31 chicks over 10 days old dissected following natural mortality), although, burdens vary substantially between individuals (Reed et al. 
  <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2012</a>; Burthe et al. 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2013</a>; Granroth-Wilding 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2013</a>). Seabirds are the definitive hosts for 
  <span class="italic">C. rudolphii</span> (Anderson 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2000</a>; Fagerholm and Overstreet 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>). Adult worms at this stage release eggs into the marine environment via the bird's feces, which hatch and pass through paratenic crustacean and fish hosts to enter the bird's proventriculus where they feed on food ingested by the host (Anderson 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2000</a>; Abollo et al. 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2001</a>; Fagerholm and Overstreet 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>). Chicks are infected by larval worms in the regurgitated fish they are fed by their parents; direct transmission of adult worms dislodged from the parents' proventriculus may also occur (Hoberg 
  <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">2005</a>; Fagerholm and Overstreet 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>; Granroth-Wilding 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2013</a>). Characteristically of macroparasites, nematode infections in seabirds are rarely lethal (Clayton and Moore 
  <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">1997</a>; Hoberg 
  <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">2005</a>; Fagerholm and Overstreet 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>), but they impose costs through direct competition with hosts for their fish prey and damage such as inflammation, tissue necrosis, and secondary bacterial infections at attachment sites (Abollo et al. 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2001</a>; Hoberg 
  <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">2005</a>; S. Burthe &amp; H. Granroth-Wilding, pers. obs.). Shags also host biting lice 
  <span class="italic">Eidemanniella pellucida</span>, but previous work has found no evidence for an effect of lice on chick growth or survival (Daunt et al. 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">2001b</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study years differed markedly in annual population productivity (Table
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>), measured as the average number of fledged young per incubated nest in a series of unmanipulated, long-term monitoring plots on the Isle of May, henceforth “productivity.” In the last decade (2002–2012), productivity has ranged from 0.25 to 2.04 fledged chicks per nest (Newell et al. 
  <a rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" href="#b61">2012</a>). In shags, as in other seabirds, productivity is best explained by models that integrate multiple environmental factors, including food availability (quality and abundance of sandeel 
  <span class="italic">Ammodytes marinus</span>, the shag's principal prey: Frederiksen et al. 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2006</a>; Burthe et al. 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2012</a>), climate (sea surface temperature: Burthe et al. 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2012</a>), and weather (rain and wind: Aebischer 
  <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">1993</a>). These combined measures have been shown to capture the environmental variability that is relevant to a shag's reproductive decisions better than any single measure on its own (Frederiksen et al. 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2006</a>; Burthe et al. 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2012</a>). We therefore used productivity as an annual proxy for environmental conditions (sensu Danchin et al. 
  <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">1998</a>; Wilson et al. 
  <a rid="b96" ref-type="bibr" href="#b96">2006</a>; Reed et al. 
  <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2008b</a>; Bogdanova et al. 
  <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2014</a>).
