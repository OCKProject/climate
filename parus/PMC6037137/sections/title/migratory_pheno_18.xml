 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study showed variation in the relationship between the abundance of 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> and the sampling date during the second period, while a constant relationship was found for 
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span> over all three sampled periods. This result contrasts with those of 
  <a rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-54">Supp et al. (2015)</a> where long-migration hummingbird species like 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> were found to have migratory periods with lower interannual variation in comparison to hummingbird species with shorter migratory routes. However, variation in climatic conditions can affect the migration times of some bird species (
  <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Cotton, 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-25">Gordo et al., 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Marra et al., 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-49">Saino et al., 2007</a>). 
  <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Marra et al. (2005)</a> suggested that variation in spring temperatures influences the migration of long-distance migratory birds; in this study, birds were found to migrate earlier in warm years and later in colder years. The environmental conditions (i.e., precipitation) varied in the second period of our study, yet the change in the migration pattern of 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> may also be the result of variation in local environmental conditions at its breeding sites.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meanwhile, altitudinal migrant hummingbirds may perform movements of only a few kilometers but can search for resources along an altitudinal gradient. Generally, altitudinal migration is optional in the short term; sedentary species might migrate, for example, to avoid periods of adverse weather (reviewed by 
  <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">Faaborg et al., 2010</a>). The altitudinal migrant 
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span> examined in our study may migrate depending on local climate conditions and resource quality. Several additional studies establish that seasonal variation of food resources is the main factor that influences the altitudinal migration of birds (
  <a rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-33">Levey &amp; Stiles, 1992</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-42">Newton, 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">Faaborg et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-6">Boyle, 2017</a>). For altitudinal migrant hummingbirds, the availability of food resources as well as competition with other hummingbirds for shared resources is an important factor (
  <a rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-58">Wolf, Stiles &amp; Hainsworth, 1976</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Des Ganges, 1979</a>). 
  <a rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-58">Wolf, Stiles &amp; Hainsworth (1976)</a> stated that dominance interactions and floral availability influence the migration of altitudinal migrant hummingbirds. Meanwhile, 
  <a rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-44">Rappole &amp; Schuchmann (2003)</a> proposed that hummingbird migrations respond to seasonal scarcity of resources as well as seasonal flushes of resources at other sites. However, more studies are needed to determine the importance of competition for resources and climatic conditions for 
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span>â€™s altitudinal migration.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, annual variation in the climatic conditions of winter sites could decouple birds from their usual migratory phenology (
  <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Cotton, 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-49">Saino et al., 2007</a>). If migratory hummingbirds are unable to adjust their migration to specific flowering dates or shortened flowering duration of their preferred plants along their migratory routes, these hummingbirds will be less successful, and their populations will likely be reduced (
  <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">Faaborg et al., 2010</a>). Thus, the decoupling of migrants and food resource availability along migratory routes can have direct consequences for the state of migratory populations (
  <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">Both et al., 2006</a>, 
  <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">2009</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-30">Jones &amp; Cresswell, 2010</a>). For example, 
  <a rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-46">Reed, Jenouvrier &amp; Visser (2013)</a> found such a mismatch can have strong effects on the relative fitness and egg-laying dates of the migratory bird 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (Great Tits) for several years, although a weak effect was found for mean demographic rates. However, population decline as a result of phenological mismatching cannot be considered as a common process affecting all migratory bird species, as this may depend on multiple factors such as migration distance, continent and habitat seasonality (
