 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We registered 15 plant species at the phenological transects. 
  <span class="italic">S. iodantha</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. thyrsoideum</span> were the most abundant species. Over the three sampling periods, 
  <span class="italic">S. iodantha</span> represented 69%, 61% and 77%, respectively, of total flowers counted in the region, followed by 
  <span class="italic">C. thyrsoideum</span>, which represented 24%, 35% and 14%, respectively, of total flowers (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3" href="#supp-3">Table S3</a>). The flowering phenology of 
  <span class="italic">S. iodantha</span> was similar during each sampling period and corresponded with the arrival of 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> to the study site; 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> tended to follow the flowering of 
  <span class="italic">S. iodantha</span>, a pattern that repeats each sampling period (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2</a>). Meanwhile, 
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span> arrival to the study site much earlier than 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2</a>); in the first period 
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span> peak of abundance were when 
  <span class="italic">C. thyrsoideum</span> flowering occurred, in the second period it followed 
  <span class="italic">C. thyrsoideum</span> weakly. 
  <span class="italic">C. thyrsoideum</span> presented a distinct blooming tendency in third sampling period. The flowering of 
  <span class="italic">C. thyrsoideum</span> was almost finished when 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> presented its peak of abundance in each sampling period (
