 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the migratory phenology of the studied hummingbirds, we counted individuals in 20 fixed-radius plots (25 m radius) separated by at least 188 m (minimum distance between two plots; mean distance = 332.42 m; SD = 116.33 m). At the center of each plot, all detected hummingbirds were counted for 10 min. The plots were located in a 300 ha area covered with different types of vegetation (six plots with pine-oak forest, three plots with cloud forest, four plots with forest edges, four plots with clear-cut secondary vegetation and three plots with riparian vegetation;

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1C</a>). All plots were sampled every 10 days from November 12 to February 20 in 2010–2011, 2013–2014 and 2015–2016, resulting in a total of 11 samples of each plot per sampling period.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained permits from the Sub-Secretariat for Environmental Protection Management, General Directorate for Wildlife (Subsecretaría de Gestión para la Protección Ambiental, Dirección General de Vida Silvestre; permit numbers SGPA/DGVS/01833/11 and SGPA/DGGFS/712/1289/16) of Mexico. The collection permit allowed voucher specimens of plants to be collected for identification by specialists.</p>
