  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> abundance was related to sampling time in the first and third periods; this relationship was not significant in the second period. 
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span> abundance was related with the sampling time over all three periods. The abundance of 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> hummingbirds was significantly related to the number of 
  <span class="italic">Salvia iodantha</span> flowers. The abundance of 
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span> hummingbirds was related to the number of 
  <span class="italic">S. iodantha</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Cestrum thyrsoideum</span> flowers and the total number of flowers. We found a non-significant correlation between 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span> abundance and vegetation types.
