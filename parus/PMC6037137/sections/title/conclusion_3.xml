 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to expectations, the long-distance migration of 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> was not consistent over the sampling periods. The migration of 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> through the study region may be altered by changes in climate, as has occurred with other species of migratory birds. In the present study, the migration of 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> was correlated with the blooming of 
  <span class="italic">S. iodantha</span>. In comparison, the altitudinal migrant 
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span> responded to the availability of floral resources but was not associated with a particular plant. The migration of this latter species in the area probably depends on multiple factors, including climatic and demographic factors, but is particularly dependent on the supply of floral resources and competition for these resources.
