 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to expectations, the migration of the long-distance migratory hummingbird 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> was not consistent over the sampled periods. During migratory movements, birds decide where to stop over in response to a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors (
  <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">Cohen, Moore &amp; Fischer, 2012</a>). The migration of 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> through the study region can be altered by changes in climate, as has been demonstrated for other species of migratory birds (
  <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Cotton, 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-25">Gordo et al., 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Marra et al., 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-49">Saino et al., 2007</a>); however, long-term data are necessary to establish that changes in migratory patterns are associated with changes in climate. In our study, the presence of 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> coincided with the blooming of 
  <span class="italic">S. iodantha</span>, although this was not the case for the altitudinal migratory species 
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span>. Furthermore, 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> feeds more on 
  <span class="italic">S. iodantha</span> flowers than on 
  <span class="italic">C. thyrsoideum</span> flowers (
  <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">LÃ³pez-Segoviano, Bribiesca &amp; Arizmendi, 2018</a>). In contrast, 
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span> was not associated with a particular plant, as suggested by 
  <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Des Ganges (1979)</a> at another study site, but responded to the overall availability of floral resources. The migration of this latter altitudinal migratory species in the area likely depends on the supply of floral resources and competition for such resources in addition to multiple other factors, including climatic and demographic factors. More studies are needed to clarify the migratory patterns of 
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span> throughout the mountains of Mexico.
