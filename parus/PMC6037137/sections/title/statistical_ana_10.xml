 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The migratory phenologies and the relationship between hummingbird and flower abundances were analyzed using a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM). We used the numbers of 
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span> species in each plot as the response variable and time, vegetation type (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1C</a>) and the numbers of 
  <span class="italic">S. iodantha</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. thyrsoideum</span> flowers and total flowers (total flowers of 15 plant species) as the predictor variables. Time was measured from 0 to 100 days where day 0 was the initial sampling date on November 12 and day 100 was the final sampling date on February 20. We fitted a GAMM with a Poisson (
  <span class="italic">S. rufus</span>) and Quasipoisson (
  <span class="italic">A. beryllina</span>) distribution, and the plots were incorporated as a random effect (
