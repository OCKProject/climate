 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate flower availability, all flowers inside the fixed-radius plots used for bird counts were counted along transects of 40 m in length and 5 m in width. These transects intersected the center of each plot and were oriented toward the direction where the majority of flowers within the plot were found. The abundance and identity of all flowers were recorded. Floral censuses were carried out at the same frequency as the bird counts: 11 times per period for each plot.</p>
