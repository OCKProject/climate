  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was conducted using 13 bearded dragons hatched from the same clutch. The laying female only had access to one male. The eggs were randomly divided and incubated in multiple plastic boxes with vermiculite under two different heat conditions either 30 ± 3 °C, the ‘hot’ group, or 27 ± 3 °C, the ‘cold’ group. Humidity was kept high and constant for both conditions by regularly adding water to the vermiculite (see Booth 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2004</a>). Once the lizards had hatched, the environmental conditions, such as provision of food, housing, and room temperature, were kept the same. The lizards were originally kept in small vivariums measuring 20 × 30 × 30 cm; they were later moved to larger vivariums (145 × 48 × 60 cm) and were housed in groups. The lizards were maintained in the same room with an average temperature of 29 °C and were maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle with lights turning on at 7 am. All animals were sexually mature at the initial time of testing and had previous experimental experience which measured various aspects of their foraging ability. They had not previously taken part in tests to assess personality. The lizards were handled daily, and they showed no behavioral signs of stress during handling. The ‘hot’ group contained 4 males and 3 females, while the ‘cold’ group contained 3 males and 3 females. The average mass of the ‘hot’ and the ‘cold’ groups did not differ significantly at the time of testing (average ± SE; hot: 220.8 ± 11.7 g; cold: 237.3 ± 17.7 g).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experimental arena was made of plastic-coated wood and measured 76.5 × 73 × 19 cm. Black meshing was placed over the top to ensure that the animals could not escape. The box was marked so that it was visually split into four quadrants (38.25 × 36.5 cm) one of which contained the novel item. Four objects, all novel to the lizards and all of which were a similar size (average ± SD; 13.62 ± 2.43 cm), were used in this experiment. The objects were a plastic toy police van, a china garden fairy, a pottery wellington boot, and a small plastic blue lamp. All four objects varied in color and were chosen so as not to be ecologically relevant (Greggor et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2015</a>). All objects were sprayed with disinfectant to reduce potential olfactory cues, and the arena was cleaned between trials. The objects were always placed in the same quadrant in the arena, 54 cm from the starting position of the lizards (which remained the same throughout the experiment). The room was maintained at 28.5 ± 1 °C throughout testing. A digital camera (Sony HDR-CX22OE) was placed on a tripod above the arena so that the whole area was recorded during the experiment. The experimenter left the room for the duration of the trial.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habituation</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All animals were habituated to the testing arena prior to testing. During habituation, a lizard was placed into the arena for 15 min. After each 15-min period, a mealworm was placed on the opposite side of the enclosure. If the lizard ate the mealworm within 5 min on 3 consecutive days, then it was considered habituated. If the lizard failed to eat the mealworm within 5 min, the habituation procedure was repeated until the lizard met the criterion.</p>

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Testing</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the start of each trial, a lizard was placed on a marker on the diagonally opposite side of the arena to the object, facing toward it. In each Phase, lizards received two novel object trials (order of presentation counterbalanced across objects). Trials were separated by 4 or 5 days. Phase 1 trials were conducted when the animals were 10 months old, and the Phase 2 trials were a repeat of the experiment but using different novel objects 5 months after Phase 1.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experiment 2: novel environment experiment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This was identical to the previous experiment with some key changes. Instead of novel objects, different novel environments were used. Arena A measured 76.5 × 73 cm with pink patterned wrapping paper along the walls and sawdust on the floor. By contrast, arena B was rectangular (105 × 38 cm) and contained leopard print wall paper and a plastic bubble-wrap floor.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lizards were not habituated to the experimental arena prior to the start of testing. Phase 1 trials were conducted when the animals were 12 months old. Phase 2 was conducted 3 months after Phase 1, and trials repeated the experiment using different novel environments: Arena C measured 77 × 38 cm with a laminated, patterned floor and a comic book wallpaper design. Arena D was 63 × 40 cm and contained a patterned wallpaper and the floor was covered with shredded paper.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data collection and statistical analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Solomon coder (© András Péter) was used to analyze the behavior of the lizards. All videos were coded by a coder who was blind to the experimental and incubation conditions. Twelve percent of the videos were second coded and a Spearman’s rank correlation revealed a strong positive correlation between observers (rho
   <sub>23</sub> = 0.987, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first 5 min of each video was analyzed to allow comparison between the first and second exposure to the novel object. For the novel object experiment, the amount of time that each lizard spent in the quadrant surrounding the novel object was recorded. An animal was considered to be in the quadrant when any part of the lizard, with the exception of the tail, was on, or within, the quadrant line. When an animal was in the quadrant, it was considered as being in close proximity to the object. The time the lizard spent in locomotion was also recorded for each animal irrespective of location. It was considered to be in locomotion if it lifted a leg off the ground and the body position moved. A lizard was not considered to be moving if only its head moved. For the novel environment experiment, only locomotion was analyzed.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A general linear model with Gaussian errors and an identity link function (Minitab, ver. 17) was used to see if there was an effect of egg incubation ‘temperature’ (hot versus cold), and ‘Phase’ of the experiment (1 vs. 2), or any interaction between these fixed factors. Given the repeated measurement of the behavioral measures, individual lizards (‘subject’) were controlled in the model as a random factor nested within temperature. The analysis investigated the effects of these factors on the time spent in close proximity to the novel object, time spent moving in an arena with a novel object, or time spent moving around in a novel environment. Repeatability is defined as the proportion of phenotypic variation explained by differences between individuals, and so can provide a useful measure of behavioral consistency. We determined repeatability for each behavior in both the long term (Phase 1 to Phase 2) and short term (between trials in Phase 1 and Phase 2) using the method described by Lessels and Boag (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">1987</a>), which allows the between- and within-individual components of variance to be estimated using analysis of variance. Possible values of repeatability range from zero to one.
