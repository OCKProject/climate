 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the comparison between time spent in proximity to the novel object, neither temperature nor Phase as a fixed factor was significant but there was a highly significant interaction (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). In Phase 1, lizards from the hot group spent more time in proximity to the object but this was reversed in Phase 2 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Long-term repeatability was low, but repeatability in the short term was high in Phase 1 but low in Phase 2 (Table
