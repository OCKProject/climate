 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results represent the first data to show that natural variation in environmental factors during embryonic development, such as incubation temperature, may impact upon the development of behavioral traits during ontogeny. For behavioral traits, such as boldness, to be defined as personality, they need to be repeatable across time and context (Carere and Eens 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2005</a>). We investigated this by examining the impact of incubation temperature on the behavior of lizards toward a novel object and in a novel environment. Each was assessed over two different time periods short term (4 or 5 days) and long term (at least 3 months). We saw no long-term impact of incubation temperature on behavior; however, incubation temperature did impact upon behavior in the short term. In the novel object experiment, the ‘hot’ group initially spent more time in close proximity to the novel object than the ‘cold’ group; however, the opposite was true when tested in the later phase of the experiment. There was no effect of incubation temperature on the amount of locomotion in either the novel object experiment or the novel environment experiment. The results suggest that, rather than impacting upon personality, egg incubation temperature influenced the development of behavioral traits.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, the majority of experiments testing animal personality look at repeatability of behavioral traits over short periods of time (e.g., Frost et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2007</a>; Short and Petren 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2008</a>). The findings of our study highlight the importance of re-testing animals over a longer period. Had this experiment failed to test the long-term repeatability, a different interpretation would have been placed on the results. However, one important consideration in interpretation of these data is the limited sample size used in this experiment. Some of the variations observed in the data could be attributed to this, and replication with additional animals is an important next step. Additionally, only one clutch was used in this experiment, and as such it is possible that the results are not generalizable to the population. We accept that the results are based on a small sample size from one clutch of eggs, but we feel that they are sufficiently interesting to stimulate further research.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Egg incubation temperature has been shown to affect the development of oviparous reptiles in terms of growth, physiology, and behavior (Deeming 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2004</a>). For example, egg incubation temperature affects the growth rates of bearded dragons at different stages in ontogeny (Siviter et al. in prep). As hatchlings, the lizards incubated at hotter temperatures were heavier than animals incubated at colder temperatures. However, as the animals developed, those incubated at colder temperatures grew heavier significantly faster (Siviter et al. in prep). Surprisingly, developmental changes in the behavior of oviparous reptiles as a result of incubation history have rarely been examined. The majority of previous studies only tested the behavior of hatchlings (see Deeming 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2004</a>; Booth 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2006</a>), and as a result, the long-term effects of incubation temperature on behavior are largely unknown. A recent study has revealed that incubating bearded dragons outside their normal range results in a shift from genotypic to environmental sex determination (Holleley et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2015</a>) and that this shift has associated behavioral effects (Li et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2016</a>). However, in this study it is unclear whether the differences in behavior are the result of incubation temperature or genetic differences. By comparing the behavioral responses of bearded dragons in both the short term and the long term, our results provide the first insight into the impact that incubation temperature alone has on personality and the development of and behavioral traits.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Personality traits, such as boldness and activity, have been shown to be linked with food acquisition in a range of different species (for a review see Biro and Stamps 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2008</a>). The results of the present experiment suggest that incubation temperature may impact upon the development of behavioral traits of bearded dragons such that they differ at different stages of their ontogeny. It is therefore likely that they will strongly influence their success. A positive correlation between foraging intake and boldness or exploration has been observed in a range of animals (e.g., in the great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>; Naguib et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2010</a>) and in the common sole (
  <span class="italic">Solea</span>; Mas-Muñoz et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2011</a>). In addition to foraging success, boldness has been positively correlated with basking time in the Namibian rock agama (
  <span class="italic">Agama planiceps</span>; Carter et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2010</a>) and reproductive success in the Southern water skink (
  <span class="italic">Eulamprus heatwolei;</span> Keogh et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2012</a>). However, when resources are plentiful Namibian rock agama that are less bold may have an advantage over active lizards, which may have a higher likelihood of predation (Carter et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2010</a>) and will potentially use more energy. Cooler egg incubation temperatures can produce heavier and larger lizards (see Deeming 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2004</a>) suggesting that lizards incubated at these temperatures will be able to dominate resources (Tokarz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">1985</a>) and retain heat for longer.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mechanisms that cause temperature-dependent differences in the phenotypes of oviparous reptiles are still not fully understood (Valenzuela 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2004</a>; Deeming 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2004</a>). One, as yet unexplored suggestion, is that incubation temperatures differentially impact upon the development and physiology of the hypothalamus, which has a crucial role in regulation of a variety of bodily functions in vertebrates including growth and thermoregulatory behavior (Deeming and Ferguson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">1989</a>). Irrespective of the mechanism, it is possible that the relationship between egg incubation temperature and the phenotype of oviparous species of reptiles is adaptive; hatchlings from a clutch of eggs exposed to a range of temperatures within the nest environment will be suited to a wide variety of different environments (Deeming and Ferguson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">1989</a>). Moreover, the environment in which the lizards are incubated is reflective of the environment that they are emerging into. Therefore, a warmer environment may produce animals that are better adapted to survival in that temperature profile. As such, it has been suggested that the sensitivity of oviparous reptiles to environmental factors may make animals more flexible in dealing with changing environments and could be a valuable defense mechanism for tackling human-induced climate change (Holleley et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2015</a>). Such effects may be mediated through the impact that incubation temperatures have on the phenotypes of hatchlings and older animals. Behavioral responses to ontogenetic variation in lizards need more investigation in a wide range of species to help us understand not only reptilian cognition but also the possible effects of anthropogenic climate changes.
