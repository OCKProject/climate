 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human-induced environmental change, such as global warming, is increasingly affecting the habitats of animals worldwide. Often, the first response that an animal can make in the face of environmental change is behavioral (Tuomainen and Candolin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2011</a>). Changes in behavior allow an organism to adapt to its environment in a rapid and efficient manner. Behavioral plasticity may allow species to combat the effects of human-induced climate change and allow them the time to develop the genetic diversity required in their new environment (Pigliucci 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2001</a>). Within a species, differences in personality could influence how individual animals respond to human-induced climate change with different personalities more successful under different conditions (Koolhaas et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">1999</a>; Minderman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The term ‘personality’ describes differences in behavioral traits between individual animals of the same species that are consistent over time and across contexts (Carere and Eens 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2005</a>). Animal personality has been shown to be heritable (Brown et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2007</a>) and subject to both natural and sexual selection (Smith and Blumstein 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2008</a>; Van Oers et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2005</a>). Despite the underlying genetic component, the development of personality traits can also be heavily influenced by environmental factors, such as behavior of conspecifics (Frost et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2007</a>) and predation pressure (Brown et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2005</a>). Personality traits are measured along a continuum on a number of axes, e.g., boldness/shyness, proactive/reactive, explorative/less explorative (Sih and Del Giudice 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2012</a>; Carazo et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2014</a>). Boldness, the willingness of an individual to take risks in a novel situation, has been investigated across various taxa, including fish (Frost et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2007</a>); amphibians (Caelson and Langkilde 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2013</a>); reptiles (Carter et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2010</a>); birds (Rokka et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2014</a>); and mammals, (Carter et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2012</a>). It has been linked to foraging success, mating success, and higher predation; it is thus considered to have far-reaching implications for an individual animal’s fitness (Biro and Stamps 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2008</a>; Wolf et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the relative abundance of research into animal personality traits, the impact that early life experiences, particularly those which occur during embryonic development, have on animal post-hatching personality has received little attention. However, studies to date suggest that this is a promising avenue for research. Artificial manipulation of androgen levels in yolks of black-headed gull eggs (
  <span class="italic">Chroicocephalus ridibundus</span>) revealed a positive correlation between androgen levels and ‘aggression’ (Müller et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2009</a>). Further, prenatal maternal effects, such as stress levels, have been shown to elevate glucocorticoid levels in both fish (McCormick 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2006</a>) and bird (Bertin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2009</a>) eggs and this is likely to impact upon offspring phenotype. (Rokka et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2014</a>) found that the hormone composition of magpie (
  <span class="italic">Pica pica</span>) eggs, which is controlled by laying order, also impacts personality of the offspring. Taken together, current evidence suggests that prenatal effects do influence the personality of offspring.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural variation in egg incubation temperature impacts upon the phenotype of many oviparous reptiles in terms of sex, morphology, physiology, and behavior (for a comprehensive review see Deeming 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2004</a>; Booth 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2006</a>). The majority of behavioral work has investigated the impact of incubation temperature on either hunting or anti-predatory behavior (e.g., fleeing). Interestingly, the direction of the impact that this has upon behavior varies with species. For instance, cold-incubated hatchlings of the three-lined skink 
  <span class="italic">Bassiana duperreyi</span> exhibited more anti-predatory behaviors than hot-incubated hatchlings (Flatt et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2001</a>). By contrast, bearded dragons (
  <span class="italic">Pogona vitticeps</span>) incubated at hotter temperatures ran faster and were better at foraging than lizards incubated at colder temperatures (Siviter et al. in prep). Similarly, hatchling pine snakes (
  <span class="italic">Pituophis melanoleucus</span>) incubated at cool temperatures exhibited less anti-predatory responses and were less effective at foraging, when compared to hatchling snakes incubated at hotter temperatures (Burger 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">1991</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">1998</a>). Taken together, anti-predatory and exploratory behaviors do appear to be affected by incubation temperature, though the direction of the effect is not consistent across species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that other behaviors are affected by natural variation in developmental environment, personality traits could, potentially, be also modulated by small differences in incubation environment. In reptiles, personality correlates with physiological measures known to be shaped by the incubation environment. For example, pigmentation can be modulated by the incubation environment in lizards and crocodilians (see Deeming 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2004</a>), and in a test that examined willingness to approach humans, darker melanin-based coloration correlates with boldness in Eastern Hermann’s tortoises (
  <span class="italic">Testudo hermanni boettgeri</span>; Mafli et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2011</a>). Many species of reptile have temperature-dependent sex determination and sex-based personality differences have been observed in the Eastern water skink (
  <span class="italic">Eulamprus quoyii</span>), in which males were bolder than females (Carazo et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2014</a>). Indeed, a recent study with bearded dragons (
  <span class="italic">Pogona vitticeps</span>) has revealed that incubating these lizards outside their normal range results in a shift from genotypic to environmental sex determination (Holleley et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2015</a>). This shift has associated behavioral effects which appear to cause more male-like behavioral phenotypes in functionally female animals; this is likely to enhance fitness under certain conditions (Li et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2016</a>). These findings indicate that incubation temperature may play an important role in shaping behavioral phenotypes, but it is difficult to disentangle the relative roles that incubation temperature and genetic differences played in the resultant differences in behavior. However, taken together, this further supports the idea that natural variation in the incubation environment may impact upon the personality of hatchlings.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Personality traits, such as boldness and exploration, are intrinsically linked to animal cognition. As the study of animal cognition investigates how animals perceive, store, and use information from the surrounding environment, cognition ultimately impacts upon most behaviors (Greggor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2015</a>). Recent research has started to directly investigate the link between cognition and personality and suggests that personality and cognitive performance within a species are linked (Sih and Del Giudice 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2012</a>; Carazo et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2014</a>). Thus, the relationship between personality, particularly boldness, and cognitive style could be fundamental in understanding individual differences in cognitive performance (Sih and Del Giudice 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2012</a>; Guenther et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2014</a>). Experimental work has revealed that performance on a spatial task was related to individual boldness levels in the Eastern water skink (
  <span class="italic">Eulamprus quoyii</span>; Carazo et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2014</a>). Complementary to this, studies on the effect of incubation temperature on learning ability have shown that hot-incubated individuals were significantly better at learning tasks than cold-incubated animals in the three-lined skink (Amiel and Shine 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2012</a>; Amiel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2014</a>; Clark et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to understand individual variation in cognitive performance and to understand the influence of changing temperatures on oviparous reptiles, it is essential to investigate whether cognitive differences caused by incubation temperature may be the result of incubation temperature impacting relevant personality traits. In this experiment, we investigate the impact of egg incubation temperature on personality in lizards. This study looked at the effect of egg incubation temperature on the boldness of bearded dragons, an oviparous lizard found in central Australia. When incubated within the normal range, bearded dragons do not have temperature-dependent sex determination (Holleley et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2015</a>) allowing us to discount sex as a factor affecting possible observed differences. We used both a novel object test and a novel environment test to investigate personality differences between animals incubated at different temperatures. The effect was examined in both the short term and the long term. Given the correlation between foraging success and boldness seen in other species, e.g., three-spined sticklebacks (
  <span class="italic">Gasterosteus aculeatus</span>; Ward et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2004</a>) and barnacle geese (
  <span class="italic">Branta leucopsis</span>; Kurvers et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2009</a>), we hypothesize that lizards incubated at a hot temperature would be bolder than lizards incubated at a cooler temperature.
