 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The time that the lizards spent in locomotion in a novel environment was not significantly affected by incubation temperature, Phase, or their interaction (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>; Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). In the short term, repeatability values were high for both Phases but were lower in the long term (Table
