  <div class="title">The proportion of protected habitat in 1971–2000 and in 2051–2080.</div>
  <p>Overall proportion (%) of protected habitat (All protected areas; i.e. the amount of protected habitat vs. the total amount of the habitat) and the proportion (%) protected in the 5% hotspots (1971–2000; CSIRO, B1; 19GCM; MIROC, A2) in three of the studied habitats, forests (A), mires (B) and marshlands (C), and in the three vegetation zones: blue column = the southern boreal zone, red column = the middle boreal zone, green column = the northern boreal zone. The 5% hotpots are separately determined for the three species groups based on the overall habitat suitability index of species and model projections for the observed climate in 1971–2000 and the three scenarios for 2051–2080 (B1, 19GCM ensemble mean A1B, A2).</p>
