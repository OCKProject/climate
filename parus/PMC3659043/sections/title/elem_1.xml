  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We included 100 land bird species of conservation concern in the study, of which 51 were regarded as species of forests, 21 species of mires, 17 species of marshlands and 11 species of Arctic mountain habitats (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063376.s001" href="#pone.0063376.s001">Table S1</a>). We took into account both regularly breeding species (90 bird species) in Finland, and also species of conservation concern (eight forest species and two marshland species) that currently do not occur in Finland but are breeding in adjacent regions to the south or south-east of Finland.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 100 studied species were selected using a number of classifications of conservation concern and the critical categories in them (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063376.s001" href="#pone.0063376.s001">Table S1</a>): the European Union's Birds Directive species (Annex I), species of European conservation concern (SPEC1–SPEC3) 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-BirdLife1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-BirdLife1">[53]</a>, species of Arctic or boreal biome for important bird areas in Europe (IBA)

   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala5">[60]</a>. Species in the study belonged to at least one of these classifications. Species of agricultural habitats or human settlements, and species of lakes (e.g. waterfowl) or the Baltic Sea were not included in the analysis because the study was carried out in the terrestrial protected area network, which consisted of forests, mires and other wetlands (here regarded as marshlands) and mountain habitats.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitats and protected areas were investigated separately in three main vegetation zones in Finland: the southern boreal, the middle boreal and the northern boreal zones. The extent of the hemiboreal zone in the south-western coast of Finland was small, and therefore it was included in the southern boreal zone. In the north, mountain birch forms both the northernmost forests and the tree line in the northern boreal zone.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The proportion of land cover types was calculated as a cover for each 10×10 km cell and also specifically within each of the conservation area included in the study from the digital CORINE Land Cover 2006 database (resolution 25 meters), using ArcView Spatial Analyst (Version 3.2, ESRI, Redland, CA, USA). Different coniferous, deciduous and mixed forest classes were combined as a single forest class except mountain birch woods above the coniferous forest boundary in the northern boreal zone. Open mires (i.e. treeless peatlands) were regarded as mire class. Following Virkkala et al. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala6" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala6">[61]</a>, wetlands along sea and lake shores and along rivers and in estuaries were regarded as marshland habitats (largely dominated by the common reed 
   <span class="italic">Phragmites australis</span>). Open, treeless Arctic mountain habitats in the northern boreal zone were regarded as mountain heaths. Each of the 100 bird species were assigned to one of the four habitat categories based on their main habitat in Finland or areas south of Finland (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063376.s001" href="#pone.0063376.s001">Table S1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amount of protected habitat differs considerably both from south to north (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063376-g001" href="#pone-0063376-g001">Fig. 1</a>) and between-habitat types 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala2">[36]</a>. Some 2.3%, 3.7% and 23.4% of all forests were situated in protected areas in southern boreal, middle boreal and northern boreal zones, respectively. For mires the corresponding figures were 19.0%, 19.4% and 35.2%, and for marshlands 26.7%, 24.2% and 12.1%, respectively. In Arctic mountain heaths, 88.9%, and in mountain birch woods, 82.4%, were included in protected areas.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the European Bird Atlas, the EBCC Atlas for European Breeding Birds 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Hagemeijer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hagemeijer1">[46]</a>, in developing the bioclimatic envelope models for the 100 bird species studied. We focused on present-absent data from all the European Bird Atlas 50-km grid squares where data covered at least 75% of expected breeding species (see 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Hagemeijer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hagemeijer1">[46]</a>). A species was considered to be breeding in a grid cell when the record for it fell under one of these categories: possible, probable and confirmed breeding.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following earlier studies

   <a rid="pone.0063376-Forsman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Forsman1">[62]</a>, we selected five climate variables as potential explanatory variables for BEMs: mean temperature in April–June (TEMP
   <sub>AMJ</sub> ), mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCO), annual daily temperature sum above 5°C (growing degree days, GDD5), mean precipitation in April–June (PREC
   <sub>AMJ</sub>), and mean annual precipitation (PREC).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An observed Eurasian-wide climate dataset of monthly mean temperatures and precipitation at 10′×10′ spatial resolution averaged for the period 1971–2000 was constructed by combining two gridded databases: the CRU_TS_3.1 dataset at 30′×30′ grid resolution with monthly data during the period 1961–2000 (updated from Mitchell and Jones 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Mitchell1">[63]</a>), and monthly climatologies for the period 1961–1990 at 10′×10′ grid resolution from the CRU_CL_2.0 dataset 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-New1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-New1">[64]</a>. Data were extracted for Eurasia for the window 12°W to 70°E longitude and 34°N to 72°N latitude consisting of 73,670 grid cells at 10′ resolution and 9,167 grid cells at 30′ resolution (for more details, see 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala2">[36]</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate data in 10′ resolution were related to the 50×50 km grid system used in the EBCC Atlas for European Breeding Birds by calculating the mean, minimum and maximum for TMP
   <sub>AMJ,</sub> MTCO and GDD5 of all 10′ grid cells whose centre point was located within a given 50×50 km cell. The minimum and maximum values were applied so that our bioclimatic envelope models would include the preferences of bird species favouring lowland or upland climate conditions. Overall, 11 individual climate variables were considered in the model building.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three climate scenarios representing a wide range of possible climatic conditions for 2051–2080 were constructed for our climate variables on a 10×10 km grid covering Finland. Climate data for an ensemble of 19 General Circulation Models employed in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-IPCC1">[65]</a> (GCMs; for the selected models, see Virkkala et al. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala2">[36]</a>) were downloaded from the archive of the Third Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3; 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Meehl1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Meehl1">[66]</a>). In addition to the central ensemble scenario, two individual GCM simulations representing low and high changes were selected. Thus, we included: (i) the 19-model ensemble mean for the SRES A1B emission scenario representing average changes; (ii) a simulation of the Australian CSIRO-MK3.0 GCM for the SRES B1 (from now on B1) scenario, which shows relatively low annual temperature and precipitation changes across Finland throughout the 21st century; and (iii) a simulation of the Japanese MIROC3.2/medres GCM for the SRES A2 (from now on A2) scenario, which is among those simulations giving higher annual temperature and precipitation increases. We calculated simulated changes in temperature and precipitation from these scenarios between the baseline and scenario periods and applied these to an observed monthly climatology on a 10 km×10 km grid for Finland.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The European-wide climate and bird data were employed to calibrate the bioclimatic models. The mean, maximum and minimum values for TMP
   <sub>AMJ</sub>, MTCO and GGD5 were highly intercorrelated. Thus, we first selected either the mean, maximum or minimum value for each study species and each of the three variables. This was done using generalized additive models (GAM) via the GRASP user-interface and the measures of predictor variables importance therein, see 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala2">[36]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Lehmann1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Lehmann1">[67]</a>. Next, a second GRASP run was conducted where we included the remaining five climate variables, and in if high (&gt;0.9) correlations between the five predictor variables appeared, a variable with lower importance was excluded. However, for the precipitation variables we used only the mean values of the 10′×10′ grid cells. Moreover, because the correlation between precipitation variables and the other variables was always below &lt;0.8 (cf. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Denol1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Denol1">[68]</a>) we included these two variables in all our BEMs.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The calibrated bioclimatic envelope models with the European climate (1971–2000) and bird data (50×50 km) were first projected for the climate data for Finland averaged over the period 1971–2000 in the 10×10 km grid scale. This provided the baseline estimate of the climatic suitability (i.e., predicted probability of occurrence) of each 10×10 km grid cell for each bird species. Next, we fitted the derived models to the three climate scenario datasets for the time period 2051–2080, which provided estimates of the future climatic suitability for each species.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bioclimatic envelope models were generated using the BIOMOD framework (the version described in 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Thuiller3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Thuiller3">[69]</a> in the R environment version 2.12., and the three modelling techniques, generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM) and generalized boosting method (GBM). For each of the 100 bird species, polynomial GLMs were computed using an automatic forward stepwise procedure together with the Akaike information criterion (AIC) model selection criteria. To produce GAMs, we used a cubic spline smoother with three degrees of freedom, and the step forward variable selection of GAM in BIOMOD based on AIC was employed 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Thuiller4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Thuiller4">[70]</a>. GBM was implemented into R (R Development Core Team, 2011) 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-R1">[71]</a> using the library GBM (Generalized Boosted Regression Modelling). The maximum number of trees was fixed at 2,000, and a four-fold cross-validation procedure was employed. For more details on the modelling methods used here, see 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Lehmann1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Lehmann1">[67]</a>,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed the predictive power of the derived models using a four-fold cross validation with a random split into 20% validation and 80% calibration datasets. The discrimination ability of the predictive models was determined using three commonly used measures, which were: 1) the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Fielding1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Fielding1">[79]</a>, 2) the kappa statistic 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Congalton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Congalton1">[80]</a>, and 3) the true skill statistic (TSS; Allouche et al. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Allouche1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Allouche1">[81]</a>). The predictive performance of all our BEMs (three modelling techniques times 100 species) was generally good or excellent, as only two species showed AUC values lower than 0.80, see 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala2">[36]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the probability of occurrence of species generated by the three modelling methods, the arithmetic mean probability value was calculated for each species in each 10-km square for the periods 1971–2000 and 2051–2080. In calculating the joint habitat suitability index (joined species-specific and joined overall habitat suitability index), the amount of focal habitat (forest, mire, marshland and Arctic mountain habitats) in each square was first standardised to vary between 0 and 1 by dividing it by the largest amount of habitat per square in the corresponding zone. This was done because the amount of different habitats varies considerably in Finland (see 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala2">[36]</a>): the total land area of forests is 184,854 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> (60.7% of total land area of 304,474 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> in Finland) and that of marshlands 963 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> (0.3%). Then this rescaled habitat amount was multiplied by the species probability of occurrence (values 0–1) to produce the joined species-specific habitat suitability index in each square for each species separately. Thus, in this procedure each species was related to its species-specific habitat, i.e. forest species to forest habitat, mire species to mire habitat etc., so that the species probability of occurrence was multiplied by the species-specific, standardised habitat amount (values 0–1) in each square. In the final step of the process, the joined overall habitat suitability index was calculated for each of our four species groups (i.e. the mean of the forest species joined habitat suitability indices, and so forth for all species groups) in each square. The degree of matching between most optimal areas for species and the reserve network was tested using Spearman rank correlation, where the habitat suitability index of species and species groups was related to the amount of protected habitat (hereafter “proportion protected”) in each square. Because of large sample sizes (452–1539) in these correlation analyses, only very low probability values (p&lt;0.001) can be regarded as “significant”. In comparing the overall habitat suitability index of the four species groups in 1971–2000 and in scenarios in the period 2051–2080, we used 5% hotspots, that is 5% of squares with the highest values of this index, separately for each species group in each boreal zone.
