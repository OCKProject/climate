  <a rid="pone.0063376-Pereira1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Pereira1">[2]</a>, which puts pressures on species to move to new climatically suitable areas

  <a rid="pone.0063376-Huntley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Huntley1">[5]</a> and highlights the need for designing conservation strategies for climate-change adaptation

  <a rid="pone.0063376-Mawdsley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Mawdsley2">[7]</a>. In such strategies, the network of protected areas is one of the most important means of enhancing species survival 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Kharouba1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Kharouba1">[8]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Ervin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Ervin1">[9]</a>. However, novel challenges to the efficiency of the reserve network are evident, because the changing climate may drive species outside the protected areas which they currently occupy 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hannah1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hannah1">[10]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Faleiro1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Faleiro1">[15]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The efficiency of the protected area network in preserving biodiversity is the main point for the conservation biology communities, i.e. identifying sites with the highest conservation value, the establishment and management of protected areas and the implementation of suitable conservation measures 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Carvalho1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Carvalho1">[16]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Bosso1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Bosso1">[18]</a>. Numerous studies have used modelled projections of the range shifts of species under climate change scenarios, accompanied by conservation planning tools that address species’ present and potential future distributions 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hannah1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hannah1">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hole1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hole1">[12]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo2">[14]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hole2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hole2">[19]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Kujala1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Kujala1">[20]</a>. Such studies have provided important insights into potential species losses, turnover and gain in conservation areas, as well as future gaps in the reserve system. In general, the studies employ bioclimatic envelope models (BEMs), whereby the relationships between present-day distributions of species and climatic variables are modelled and then used to forecast the future changes in a suitable climate space for species 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Pearson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Pearson1">[21]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Heikkinen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Heikkinen1">[25]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, many climate change studies assessing reserve network impacts, as well as basic BEM studies, have methodological limitations which may weaken the accuracy of assessments they provide. First, most studies have converted the probability of occurrence data for present-day and future conditions into plain presence/absence data based on a certain cut-off level, such as prevalence 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Liu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Liu1">[26]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Luoto1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Luoto1">[28]</a>, maximized Cohen’s Kappa 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Huntley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Huntley1">[5]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hole1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hole1">[12]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Huntley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Huntley2">[23]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Willis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Willis1">[29]</a> or threshold optimizing the percentage of correctly predicted absences and presences 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Coetzee1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Coetzee1">[11]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-DAmen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-DAmen1">[30]</a>. However, the use of one single cut-off level deeming sites as either climatically suitable or unsuitable may exaggerate the effect of climate shifts on species’ future distributions 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Milanovich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Milanovich1">[31]</a>, and result in the lumping of drastic changes in climatic suitability with marginal changes 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Ohlemller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Ohlemller1">[32]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, some studies have addressed the difficulties in determining how much conservation area there should be in a grid cell of a given size so that a modelled species can be considered as protected 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo2">[14]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Willis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Willis1">[29]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo3">[33]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Alagador1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Alagador1">[34]</a>. However, earlier BEM studies dealing with climate change impacts have predominantly employed only the total size of the conservation areas 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo2">[14]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Willis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Willis1">[29]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-DAmen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-DAmen1">[30]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Marini1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Marini1">[35]</a>; it has been surprisingly rarely investigated how much preferred habitat actually exists for the focal species in the conservation areas modeled as (remaining or becoming) suitable in the face of climate change. This runs the risk of making false assumptions about the availability of protected habitat for a given species in a given locality, and obstructs the ranking of areas for conservation planning under changing climate based on the amount of preferred habitat 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala2">[36]</a>. Alongside with this limitation, there is a long history of assessments and modelling of the species’ biogeographical hotspots, i.e. areas of high concentration of species 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Myers1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Myers1">[37]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hurlbert1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hurlbert1">[39]</a>. Some BEM studies have addressed how severely species ranges will be reduced in the regional hotspots 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Milanovich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Milanovich1">[31]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Carvalho2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Carvalho2">[40]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Kuhlmann1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Kuhlmann1">[42]</a>, or assessed future biases of the reserve network in global biodiversity hotspots (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Pyke1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Pyke1">[43]</a>). However, very little attention has been paid to the amount of suitable protected habitat. In fact, extremely few studies have considered the joint importance of the amount of preferred habitat and the degree of climatic suitability in the conservation areas across a range of species to determine potential species hotspots and the spatial alterations of such hotspots under a changing climate (for a solitary exception see 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Carroll1">[44]</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, studies have mainly focused on the projected future changes in species occupancy patterns and hotspots in the reserves themselves and not in the adjacent non-protected areas (but see 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hannah1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hannah1">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Coetzee1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Coetzee1">[11]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Faleiro1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Faleiro1">[15]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Marini1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Marini1">[35]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Huntley3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Huntley3">[41]</a>). By and large, what appears to be missing is analysis that compares the hotspots of joint habitat availability – climatic suitability for multiple species in reserves with corresponding hotspots in the more poorly protected areas, to assess reserve network efficiency and determine sites for potential new conservation areas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Progress in this arena has been made recently but generally just in one of these three topics. Some studies have retained probability values higher than the threshold to assess the relative differences in climatic suitability of the grid cells for the modelled species instead of using plain converted species present/absent information (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo1">[13]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo2">[14]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-BarbetMassin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-BarbetMassin1">[45]</a>). In the other topics, some work has been targeted to either filter out the human-transformed degraded areas from future projections of species 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Faleiro1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Faleiro1">[15]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Huntley3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Huntley3">[41]</a>, link the climatically suitable areas with suitable land cover types 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-DAmen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-DAmen1">[30]</a>, and to delimit potential future agglomerations of species occurrences in non-protected landscape 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hannah1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hannah1">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Coetzee1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Coetzee1">[11]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hole2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hole2">[19]</a>. In an interesting study, Marini et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Marini1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Marini1">[35]</a> used the BEM-ensemble modelling approach to identify areas with high future cumulative probability of occurrences for bird species and potential major gaps in the reserve system.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, in order to add an important dimension of accuracy into species – climate change based conservation planning, we need to address all three shortcomings simultaneously. Here we make such an attempt by developing BEMs for 100 Northern European bird species of conservation concern and projections of climatic suitability for Finland at present and in the future, and by taking into account the amount of preferred habitat for the modelled species in protected and unprotected areas. Our set of bird species is a useful model system, because their distributions are well covered both in national Atlas and European-wide Atlas compilations (see 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hagemeijer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hagemeijer1">[46]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Valkama1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Valkama1">[47]</a>). Several BEM studies (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Huntley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Huntley1">[5]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Kujala1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Kujala1">[20]</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0063376-Huntley4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Huntley4">[48]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala3">[49]</a>) have been conducted based on them. Moreover, it is anticipated that northern latitudes will face greater projected increases in temperature than most other parts of the globe 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Jylh1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Jylh1">[50]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Loarie1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Loarie1">[52]</a> which may give rise to notable changes in species ranges 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala1">[24]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala3">[49]</a> and challenge the efficiency of the reserve network.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a previous study 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala2">[36]</a> we employed the same bird species and climate data, and investigated whether there are differences in the projected changes in the climatic suitability for the species in grid cells with highest amounts of protected preferred habitat vs. grid cells with similar amounts of unprotected habitat. In the present study, we use the same study setting to introduce an important new dimension into our assessment. Here we will specifically develop a joint index of the amount of preferred habitat and projected probability of occurrence for each species, in order to locate the areas with maximal suitability for the species, both presently and in the future climate, and compare these species-level hotspots of suitability with the locations of reserves with a high amount of suitable habitat. Moreover, we will generate an overall suitability-hotspot index to determine areas where high suitability coincides for many species. These analyses will be performed separately for four main terrestrial species groups, i.e. species from forests, mires, marshlands and Arctic mountain habitats. The trends emerging from these groups will be compared to address whether the conservation status of the hotspots of suitability will show different projected trends, indicating higher future conservation needs in some species groups.
