 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a pan-European study, Araújo et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo2">[14]</a> found that a large proportion (58%) of European plant and terrestrial vertebrate species may lose more suitable climate space in presently occupied protected areas than they gain in new areas by 2080. However, so far only a few regional or national studies dealing with the effects of predicted climate change on the biodiversity of protected areas have been carried out in Europe 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Sieck1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Sieck1">[92]</a>. Our detailed analyses of Northern Europe shows that there is a significant between-habitat variation in the patterns of efficiency of the reserve network to preserve species in a future changing climate. There is also variation in the projected efficiency of the reserve network depending on the climate scenario, which in Northern European conditions is largely related to the velocity of climate warming.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results showed high correlations between the species-specific and overall habitat suitability index and the amount of protected focal habitat, which is particularly visible in the high proportion of protected habitat in the 5% hotspot squares based on the overall habitat suitability index for mire and marshland birds. It seems that the present reserve network is efficient or fairly efficient for the mire bird species in all boreal zones and under all the studied climate scenarios, for the marshland species in the southern and middle boreal zones, and for the Arctic mountain species in the northern boreal zone. This success reflects the fact that the conservation efforts of mires and marshlands have been largely targeted at areas where there are large concentrations of these ecosystems, especially in the southern and middle boreal zones.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, the protected area network for forests appears not to be as efficient as in the other habitats in preserving bird species of conservation concern under a changing climate. Neither the species-specific habitat suitability index of individual species nor the overall suitability index for forest species group positively correlated to any great extent with the occurrence of present protected areas. Therefore, in forests the protected area network is far from adequate for ensuring the survival of forest bird species of conservation concern in a changing climate. In the southern and middle boreal zones in particular the cover of protected areas is clearly too low (2.3–3.7% of forest protected) to provide efficient protection. These findings echo similar concerns put forward in a number of climate change - biodiversity impact assessments. A key point in earlier studies has been that climate change increases the demand for the extent of the reserve network (see, e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Mawdsley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Mawdsley1">[6]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Noss1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Noss1">[93]</a>) because species have to disperse across fragmented, human-modified landscapes due to northward range shifts 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Reino1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Reino1">[94]</a>, and protected areas facilitate species’ range expansions 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Thomas2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Thomas2">[95]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, in the northern boreal zone, a much larger proportion of forests are protected, but protected areas are largely concentrated in the northernmost part of the northern boreal zone. Due to the concentration of protected areas in the northern boreal zone (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063376-g003" href="#pone-0063376-g003">Figure 3B</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063376-g004" href="#pone-0063376-g004">Figure 4</a>), the efficiency of protected areas to preserve forest species is increasing with more pronounced climate warming, under scenario A2. However, this increase does not apply to all the forest bird species studied. In particular, under the A2 scenario the northern species of forests are predicted to decrease the most. Therefore, the distribution patterns of species (e.g. southern or northern) in a given habitat are crucial in analyzing the efficiency of a protected area network to preserve species in the focal habitat.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The importance of acknowledging the differences in species’ geographical ranges has also been demonstrated in the realized population trends in bird species in North Europe. For example, Virkkala and Rajasärkkä 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala7" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala7">[96]</a> observed that the population density of southern species had increased and northern species decreased in Finnish protected areas from 1981–1999 to 2000–2009. Moreover, there was a northward density shift of species in protected areas, as the population density of species distributed over the whole country had increased in northern protected areas and decreased in southern protected areas 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala8" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala8">[97]</a>. In agreement with this, Brommer et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Brommer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Brommer1">[98]</a> used broader-scale data from three nationwide bird atlases of Finland to demonstrate that the latitudinal centres of distributions of southern bird species show a clear and significant range shift northwards, and that there is also a tendency for a similar (but not statistically significant) shift in birds with northern ranges. A recent paper 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hof1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hof1">[99]</a> further illustrated the potential dangers of deriving confounded results from climate change impact studies when too little attention is paid to the effects of the species’ present-day geographical ranges on the results. Hof et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hof1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hof1">[99]</a> reported that the (sub)arctic mammal species in Europe may benefit rather than face increased stress from future climate change, potentially leading to an increased species richness of mammals in northernmost Europe. The problem in this study is that it does not properly separate species with different present-day ranges, and thus mixes the few true Northern European Arctic and subarctic species (e.g. the Arctic fox 
  <span class="italic">Alopex lagopus</span> and the Norway lemming 
  <span class="italic">Lemmus lemmus</span>) with the majority of species which either have large European-wide ranges or which occur predominantly in hemiboreal or temperate regions in Central Europe (e,g, the red fox 
  <span class="italic">Vulpes vulpes</span> and the European rabbit 
  <span class="italic">Oryctolagus cuniculus</span>), and with some introduced alien species (e.g. the American mink 
  <span class="italic">Neovison vison</span>). Given this, the discrepancies between the findings by Hof et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hof1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hof1">[99]</a> and the earlier studies 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala3">[49]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Jetz1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Jetz1">[51]</a> are not surprising and can be explained by the delimitation of the species set used in the climate change impact modelling and the way the species present-day ranges are acknowledged.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, climate change effects on the bird species of boreal and Arctic habitats are largely habitat-specific, with large differences in response times and susceptibility 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala9" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala9">[100]</a>. The different patterns between mires, marshlands and forests are partly due to the fact that the assemblage of bird species of conservation concern is more variable in forests. Almost all bird species of marshlands are southern and all species of mires and Arctic mountains are northern, whereas bird species of forests include both southern and northern species. Thus, the acknowledgement of the variation in distribution patterns both within and between species groups with different habitat preferences is highly important in the assessments of efficiency of protected area networks to preserve biodiversity in the face of climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Aichi biodiversity target for 2020 agreed at the Nagoya summit for the extent of protected areas is at least 17% of land area. Interestingly, our results with bird species of conservation concern are partly parallel with this target, as habitats having an efficient buffer against climate change, mires, marshland and Arctic mountain habitats had an overall higher proportion that was protected, 28%, 25% and over 80%, respectively. This issue, however, is not as straightforward as one might think, because the northern boreal zone, with 23% of forests protected, does not properly preserve forest species according to the different scenarios, due to the unequal location of protected areas and the variation in the forest species distribution pattern.</p>
