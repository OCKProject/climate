 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We included 100 land bird species of conservation concern in the study, of which 51 were regarded as species of forests, 21 species of mires, 17 species of marshlands and 11 species of Arctic mountain habitats (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063376.s001" href="#pone.0063376.s001">Table S1</a>). We took into account both regularly breeding species (90 bird species) in Finland, and also species of conservation concern (eight forest species and two marshland species) that currently do not occur in Finland but are breeding in adjacent regions to the south or south-east of Finland.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 100 studied species were selected using a number of classifications of conservation concern and the critical categories in them (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063376.s001" href="#pone.0063376.s001">Table S1</a>): the European Union's Birds Directive species (Annex I), species of European conservation concern (SPEC1–SPEC3) 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-BirdLife1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-BirdLife1">[53]</a>, species of Arctic or boreal biome for important bird areas in Europe (IBA) 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Heath1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Heath1">[54]</a>, threatened species in the European Union (unfavourable conservation status) 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-BirdLife2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-BirdLife2">[55]</a>, species of special responsibility in Finland 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Rassi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Rassi1">[56]</a>, red-listed species in Finland in 2010 (near-threatened and threatened species) 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Rassi2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Rassi2">[57]</a>, and species preferring old-growth or mature forests in Finland 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala4">[58]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala5">[60]</a>. Species in the study belonged to at least one of these classifications. Species of agricultural habitats or human settlements, and species of lakes (e.g. waterfowl) or the Baltic Sea were not included in the analysis because the study was carried out in the terrestrial protected area network, which consisted of forests, mires and other wetlands (here regarded as marshlands) and mountain habitats.
