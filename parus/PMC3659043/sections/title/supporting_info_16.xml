   <p>Studied species of conservation concern in different classifications. Studied species of conservation concern in different classifications. DIR = EU Birds Directive species (Annex I), SPEC = species of European conservation concern (unfavourable conservation status: SPEC1–SPEC3), IBA = species of Arctic or boreal biome, EU = threatened species in European Union (unfavourable conservation status), RES = species of special responsibility in Finland, RED = red-listed species in Finland in 2010 (near-threatened and threatened specie), PREF = species preferring boreal old-growth or mature (coniferous or deciduous) forests. In parentheses species habitat preference class: F = species of forest, MI = species of mire, MA = species of marshland, AH = species of Arctic mountain heath, AB = species of Arctic mountain birch wood. * Species not breeding in Finland, but occurs in regions to the south or south-east of Finland (see text).</p>

   <p>Correlation (Spearman rank, r
    <sub>S</sub>) between the amount of protected habitat and the species-specific habitat suitability index in the given square. Correlation (Spearman rank, r
    <sub>S</sub>) between the amount of protected habitat and the species-specific habitat suitability index in the given square. The species-specific habitat suitability index is the probability of species occurrence in 2051–2080 multiplied by the amount of habitat preferred by species in each square. The amount of habitat in this calculation was scaled in each square by dividing it by the largest amount of a given habitat in each zone. The probability of species occurrence was based on the ensemble mean of 19GCM. Squares in which the given habitat was absent were excluded from the correlation analyses. The number of squares included in each species group, in southern, middle and northern boreal zone, respectively: in species of forests 1539, 1164, and 1071, in species of mires 1509, 1159, and 1069, and in species of marshlands 1313, 989, and 636. The number of squares included in Arctic mountain heaths was 686 and in Arctic mountain birch woods 452. Correlations were not calculated if the highest value of species probability index was less than 0.01.
