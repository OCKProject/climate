 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitats and protected areas were investigated separately in three main vegetation zones in Finland: the southern boreal, the middle boreal and the northern boreal zones. The extent of the hemiboreal zone in the south-western coast of Finland was small, and therefore it was included in the southern boreal zone. In the north, mountain birch forms both the northernmost forests and the tree line in the northern boreal zone.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The proportion of land cover types was calculated as a cover for each 10Ã—10 km cell and also specifically within each of the conservation area included in the study from the digital CORINE Land Cover 2006 database (resolution 25 meters), using ArcView Spatial Analyst (Version 3.2, ESRI, Redland, CA, USA). Different coniferous, deciduous and mixed forest classes were combined as a single forest class except mountain birch woods above the coniferous forest boundary in the northern boreal zone. Open mires (i.e. treeless peatlands) were regarded as mire class. Following Virkkala et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala6" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala6">[61]</a>, wetlands along sea and lake shores and along rivers and in estuaries were regarded as marshland habitats (largely dominated by the common reed 
  <span class="italic">Phragmites australis</span>). Open, treeless Arctic mountain habitats in the northern boreal zone were regarded as mountain heaths. Each of the 100 bird species were assigned to one of the four habitat categories based on their main habitat in Finland or areas south of Finland (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amount of protected habitat differs considerably both from south to north (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063376-g001" href="#pone-0063376-g001">Fig. 1</a>) and between-habitat types 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala2">[36]</a>. Some 2.3%, 3.7% and 23.4% of all forests were situated in protected areas in southern boreal, middle boreal and northern boreal zones, respectively. For mires the corresponding figures were 19.0%, 19.4% and 35.2%, and for marshlands 26.7%, 24.2% and 12.1%, respectively. In Arctic mountain heaths, 88.9%, and in mountain birch woods, 82.4%, were included in protected areas.
