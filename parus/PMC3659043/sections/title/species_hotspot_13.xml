 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of the earlier diversity hotspots studies have focused either on examining the spatial variation in patterns of species richness

  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hurlbert1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hurlbert1">[39]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Gould1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Gould1">[82]</a>, the coincidence of hotspots in different taxa 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Prendergast1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Prendergast1">[38]</a>, or modelling of the relationships between species richness and environment at broad (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Currie1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Currie1">[83]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hawkins1">[84]</a>) or regional 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Richerson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Richerson1">[85]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Parviainen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Parviainen1">[87]</a> scales. Such studies provide important insights and preservation of diversity concentrations, but it is increasingly argued that longer-term planning needs to take into account the impacts of climate change on the diversity hotspots 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Milanovich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Milanovich1">[31]</a> and species-based conservation activities 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo2">[14]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One commonly used approach for assessing the impacts of climate change on the efficiency of reserve networks is the use of bioclimatic envelope models to predict spatial changes in species distributions, and then relate these projections to the present-day structure of the network. In such studies the probabilities of species occurrences are often converted into plain presence/absence forecasts that can be employed to assess the turnover of species in protected areas 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo1">[13]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Willis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Willis1">[29]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-DAmen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-DAmen1">[30]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo3">[33]</a>, or combined for different areas to determine future richness hotspots which are not covered by the present reserve network 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Coetzee1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Coetzee1">[11]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Huntley3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Huntley3">[41]</a> or fed into reserve selection algorithms to examine whether new protected areas are required to maintain species representation at an adequate level 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hannah1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hannah1">[10]</a>. Some climate change impact studies have specifically focused on projected changes in diversity hotspots, but this is usually done by employing forecasts of species presences/absences to assess species’ future range expansions and contractions 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Carvalho2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Carvalho2">[40]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Kuhlmann1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Kuhlmann1">[42]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Pyke1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Pyke1">[43]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-VelsquezTibat1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-VelsquezTibat1">[88]</a>. Such studies share the same potential shortcoming: the loss of information resulting from the conversion of probability values into plain presence/absence data, resulting in limited possibilities for comparing the forcefulness of the projected suitability changes between different areas.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent studies have made important steps towards sharpening how projections from species climate-impact models are utilized when assessing the efficiency of the reserve network. As regards the problem of assessing species’ conservation status in grid cells with different amounts of protected surface area, an important recent improvement was the development of the joint index that integrates the projected climatic suitability of the cell (i.e. probability of occurrence) with the proportion of the cell that is conserved 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo2">[14]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Alagador1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Alagador1">[34]</a>. In the field of climate change impacts on diversity hotspots, Milanovich et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Milanovich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Milanovich1">[31]</a> discussed the potential shortcomings of using only one threshold for developing species presence/absence projections and employed two different cut-off levels, whereas McClean et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-McClean1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-McClean1">[89]</a> used species projections with an 11-point probability of occurrence scale to identify sets of grid cells in an African plant priority area for the species in the future. One of the most important studies is that of Marini et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Marini1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Marini1">[35]</a>, where the authors used a wide range of models to generate species-specific cumulative (from the ensemble of 48 separate models) future projections to detect potential gaps in the reserve system for Brazilian Cerrado biome birds. The study culminates in the identification of areas where high future probabilities of occurrence coincide with several species, and the comparison of these hotspots with the current reserve system.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, we also made an attempt to sharpen the BEM-based assessments of the efficiency of the reserve network by taking the predicted probabilities of occurrence as a continuous factor into account, but by integrating some hitherto very rarely applied measures in the process. This was done by considering the amount of protected habitat preferred by the study species in each grid cell (not just the total protected area), developing a joint habitat suitability index for each grid cell and species by multiplying the climatic suitability predictions with the cover of suitable habitat in the cell, and ultimately by combining the species-specific suitability values across all species to produce an overall suitability index for the species groups representing four major habitats. Without doubt, our study has limitations of its own, and it could be developed further by including more than one time slice into which the models are projected (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Hannah1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hannah1">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Huntley3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Huntley3">[41]</a>), wider sets of climate predictor variables 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Synes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Synes1">[90]</a>, more modelling methods 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Marini1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Marini1">[35]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Carvalho2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Carvalho2">[40]</a> and model selection criteria and envelope uncertainty assessments 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Platts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Platts1">[86]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0063376-Parviainen2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Parviainen2">[91]</a>, for example, but such dimensions are beyond the scope of this work. By and large, the key methodological point put forward in this study is that instead of using plain presence/absence predictions, we should aim to increase the accurateness of the climate change-based assessments on species range changes vs. reserve networks. The consideration of a preferred habitat for the study species in and outside reserves and the integrated habitat suitability index employed here have the potential to provide an important tool for the enhanced analysis of the efficiency of the reserve system.
